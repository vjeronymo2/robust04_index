			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] Today is just the second day of Bakili Muluzi's  presidency, he was sworn-in on Saturday [22 May]. Putting  together a working majority in Parliament looks like being his  first big political test. According to the official figures  published yesterday, his United Democratic Front [UDF] is just a  handful of seats short of an outright majority, and it looks as  if a coalition government is on the cards. On the line to  Blantyre, Mary Harper asked the UDF secretary general, Harry  Thompson, what they plan to do about it.    [Begin recording] [Thompson] What we are going to do now is,  we are having a meeting today with the Aford [Alliance for  Democracy] people, we will be listening to what they have to say  to us, and take matters up from there. We are prepared to go  into government even with a minority Parliament.    [Harper] And are you going to ask them to form an alliance  with you in Parliament?    [Thompson] Well, we want to hear what it is that they want  to  say to us first.    [Harper] They must have told you already.    [Thompson] No, they didn't. They haven't told us. They are  responding to an announcement made by our president when he had  the victory speech to say that he was prepared to work with  anybody who wants to work with us.    [Harper] And what about the MCP [Malawi Congress Party],  have  they approached you, or have you approached them?    [Thompson] No, they have not approached us, and I do not  believe that we would work with them. I mean, we have been  fighting them, and it would be foolish for us to go back and try  and form an alliance, then we are getting back to the one party  system again.    [Harper] But your relationship with Aford has hardly been  particularly smooth. Over the past few months you have been  fighting each other quite bitterly during the election campaign.    [Thompson] Yes, it was a bit of bruising and full of  mudslinging. That is why we are rather saying, let us hear what  Aford has to say to us. It may very well be that they will say  that no, that was a battle, that was during the time of war, or  [word indistinct], but now that it is over, in the interest of  the nation, what have they got to offer us, what is it that they  would like to talk to us about?    [Harper] Now, there is some concern that the UDF is  basically  a southern party.    [Thompson] I wouldn't go so far as to say it is  southern-based. We have got some 15 or so seats in the central  region, and I think that by the time our president announces the  cabinet, it will be a cabinet of Malawians rather than regional  people.    [Harper] Can you give any indication of who might be in this  cabinet?    [Thompson] No, I cannot. I am afraid, you know, whatever I  say would be guesswork at this stage.    [Harper] Are you planning to invite any opposition members  into the cabinet?    [Thompson] That is the possibility, yes.    [Harper] And when is the president expected to announce his  new cabinet?    [Thompson] The earliest will be tomorrow. [end recording]</p>

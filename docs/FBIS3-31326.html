The mortar shell which also wounded 200 other people on  February 5 may have been fired by either side, Serb or Moslem,  Canadian Colonel Michel Gauthier, who headed the investigation  committee, told the press.    "Both parties are known to have 120 mm mortars, and the  bombs  to go along with them," he said. ``The Team has no reason to  believe that either party does not have access to this type of  ammunition.    "There is insufficient physical evidence to prove that one  party or the other fired the mortar bomb. The mortar bomb in  question could have been fired by either side."    The commission, which conducted its inquiry on the spot  between February 11 and 13, confirmed that a single bomb caused  the explosion, the single bloodiest attack on civilians in the  22-month old Bosnian conflict.    The attack prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation  to  issue its ultimatum Wednesday to order air strikes against the  Bosnian Serb forces around Sarajevo if they do not neutralize  artillery around the capital by midnight Sunday.    Bosnia's Moslem-led government immediately blamed the Serbs  besieging the capital for the attack, while the Serbs charged  that Moslem forces had killed their own people to try to bring  new condemnation on the Serbs, largely seen as the aggressors in  the war.    Gauthier, chief of the engineering section of UNPROFOR, was  appointed head of the team comprising French, Pakistani, Russian  and Spanish experts, by UN special representative for the former  Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi.    The commission of inquiry was agreed on February 10 after  Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said he would refuse to  take part in peace talks in Geneva unless it was appointed.</p>

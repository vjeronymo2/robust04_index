			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Touchdown to a troubled inheritance: George Graham examines the challenges facing the new head of America's space agency Mr Daniel Goldin, named this week by President George Bush to be the new head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), is being launched into one of the least envied tasks in Washington. He takes the helm of the space agency as disputes over the level of funding from the federal government and arguments about the viability of its most important programmes have surrounded it with controversy. His predecessor, Admiral Richard Truly, was sacked last month after a series of policy disagreements with the White House's National Space Council, a supervisory board for US space interests headed by Vice-President Dan Quayle. Mr Goldin's task is to change the very character of Nasa, whose critics charge that it has become so deeply imbued with its own technology-driven culture that it is incapable of carrying out its missions. In Nasa's own strategic plan - a slim document entitled Vision 21, liberally sprinkled with aphorisms from Goethe, Einstein and James Michener - these missions are spelled out in ringing terms by Admiral Truly. 'Nasa exists to make the US the world leader in space exploration and aeronautics research and, through our achievements, to inspire and better the lives of all Americans,' he writes. But despite its grand goals the agency must also conform to the political imperatives of its masters: not only the Bush administration, but also Congress, which holds its purse strings. At a time of tight budgets, Nasa has found it impossible to make the hard choices necessary to please both masters. Instead, it has clung to an array of ambitious programmes that blithely assume that its funding will, somehow, be increased in the future. 'Nasa is overcommitted relative to likely resources - in short, it is chasing too much programme with too few dollars,' says Mr Mark Gebicke, director of Nasa issues at the General Accounting Office. Mr Gebicke estimates that Nasa's current programmes will cost Dollars 92.4bn over the next five years, between Dollars 13bn and Dollars 21bn more than its likely budget. Congressman Dick Zimmer of New Jersey more bluntly describes Nasa's plans as 'a Buck Rogers budget. 'It's long on fantasy and it's short on reality. There simply won't be enough money available in the future to complete all the programmes that are described,' he complains. Nasa's budgets rose steadily in the late 1980s, as it began to reap an early peace dividend from reductions in military spending. But the budget now faces a freeze in the face of the growing US federal deficit. In particular, the 1990 budget compromise between Mr Bush and Congress, has prevented the transfer of money from defence to civil expenditure. In its bid to win a greater share of the dwindling federal funds pie, Nasa has been handicapped by its own failures: not just calamities such as the traumatic explosion of the Challenger Shuttle in 1986, or the fatal flaw in the mirrors of the Hubble space telescope - although these have sapped public confidence in the agency - but a more general failure to adapt its own structures and culture to the realities of the 1990s. Dominated by its highly skilled engineers, Nasa developed an arrogant belief in its own superior technological prowess and an insistence on defining its own projects. Admiral Truly had made more progress than had been generally recognised in modernising Nasa's structures and management, in line with the recommendations of a 1990 report by a commission headed by Mr Norman Augustine, head of Martin Marietta, a defence and space contractor. But as a former astronaut, Mr Truly was protective of the Nasa culture, and staunchly defended his organisation's choices. 'Truly was doing a much better job of telling the president what Nasa wanted than telling Nasa what the president wanted. You basically get the space programme the engineers want to build, rather than the space programme the taxpayers want to pay for,' says Mr Pike. Mr Goldin's credentials suggest he will challenge this Nasa arrogance. He has long experience in military and commercial space engineering, having spent 25 years at TRW Inc, a Cleveland-based engineering group where he headed the space and technology division. ' 'He is not dedicated to the principle that if it was not developed in a Nasa centre it's not worth looking at; and that was one of the White House's goals,' says Mr John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute, a Washington-based research organisation. One of the results of Nasa's engineer-dominated culture is the emphasis on the space Shuttle, which because of its live crew requires a degree of reliability that cheaper, expendable rockets do not aim for. The result is a system with undoubted merits for launching projects such as the Hubble telescope, but at approximately Dollars 500m a launch an extraordinarily costly method of propelling ordinary satellites into orbit. The same culture lies behind the Space Station project. The Space Station has been justified by its supporters mostly on the grounds of the important scientific research it will enable, yet virtually every scientist in the US sharply criticises the project, dubbed Freedom, for its negligible contribution to science, and for sucking such a huge portion of available money away from other research projects. Putting a manned station into orbit will cost an estimated Dollars 40bn, and operating costs thereafter would, according to the GAO, lift the overall bill to Dollars 118bn. But will the Space Station find a cure for everything from Aids to cancer, as some of its backers in Nasa and Congress claim? Or, as their opponents jibe, will it simply find out why astronauts vomit in space? The Space Station is one of the principal issues in the increasingly heated political debate over funding for Nasa. Many politicians no longer believe the extravagant promises Nasa often makes for its projects. They see, instead, an organisation that over the past 30 years has completed its projects an average of 58 per cent behind schedule and 150 per cent over budget. The administration contains its fair share of space junkies - notably Mr Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget - who believe in the dream of pushing back the frontiers of space. But even staunch supporters of the Space Station such as Mr Quayle have their own priorities which do not always coincide with those of Nasa. He has forced Nasa to scale back its reliance on the Shuttle, refusing to order another vehicle after the delivery of the Shuttle Endeavour this month and compelling the agency to work with the Air Force on a new expendable launch system. Congress, too, has its Nasa supporters, but - with the possible exception of former astronauts such as Senator John Glenn - they are motivated more by the presence of space-related jobs in their districts. 'The people behind the space station have managed to put a piece of the action in many congressional districts and have won over supporters with that approach,' says Congressman Richard Durbin of Illinois, one of the Space Station's fiercest opponents. One striking example of this is the likely decision by Congress to write back into the budget the one programme that Nasa did offer to axe this year: the advanced solid rocket motor which was designed to boost the shuttle's payload to allow it to lift bigger sections of the Space Station. The controversial motor happens to be built in Yellow Creek, Mississippi, in the district of Mr Jamie Whitten, the powerful chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. But many voters across the US are now showing less enthusiasm for the challenge of space - particularly in an era when competition with the Soviet Union has lost its meaning. 'I guess we just simply have to recognise that people today are less interested in going to Mars and more concerned about the trip to the grocery store,' concludes Congressman Ralph Hall, chairman of the House Space Committee.</p>

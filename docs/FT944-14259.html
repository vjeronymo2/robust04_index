			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Japanese equities Following the flop of Japan Tobacco's privatisation, the country's finance ministry has finally got the message: its system for floating companies is flawed. The method has a bias which means new issues are typically sold at artificially high prices. So long as investors were willing to pay over the odds, high prices from privatisations suited the ministry. Shareholders might suffer large capital losses - as in last year's JR East privatisation  -but the ministry raked in extra funds. Japan Tobacco was different. Small shareholders rebelled at the high price and more than 40 per cent of the issue was left unsold. Those who did buy are likely to be rewarded by a sharp decline in the share price when trading starts this week. But the ministry has also suffered because the issue brought in much less than hoped. More important, the government must realise there is little chance of drumming up investor interest for issues such as West Japan Railway and the next tranche of NTT so long as the current system remains in place. The method's main flaw is that the issue price is determined by an auction for only a third of the available stock. This auction draws in the biggest and most enthusiastic investors with the result that the price picked is likely to exaggerate what shareholders are prepared to pay for the whole issue. Friday's announcement of a review by the finance minister is therefore welcome. If Tokyo switches to some version of the 'book-building' process common in global markets, it will be doing not only investors but itself a favour.</p>

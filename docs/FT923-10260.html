			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jam tomorrow for oil investors in CIS - Efforts to establish a more friendly climate for western companies HE who does not take risks does not drink champagne, runs an old Russian proverb. Western oil company executives were recently reminded of it at a London meeting with a Russian government official, lamenting the lack of foreign investment in the energy sector. Many companies could give a long list of reasons for their reluctance: fear of political instability; the lack of a proper legal framework and tax regime; a punitive export tariff; poor infrastructure and communications; and nervousness about dealing with with a complex bureaucracy unaccustomed to western ways of doing business. Political stability cannot be guaranteed, and westerners who have negotiated deals report that the end of the Soviet Union has done little to streamline the decision-making process - at least in Russia. Foreign oil companies can still find themselves negotiating simultaneously with production enterprises, local government, regional government, the state committee on property, the state committee on foreign investment and a range of sub-committees. But some of the other difficulties are beginning to be resolved and that could soon make the former Soviet republics no more risky places to do business than many other oil-producing countries. Russia is in the process of developing what will ultimately be three tiers of legislation covering the oil and gas industry. Fundamental laws on foreign investment were passed last summer by the Russian parliament. An umbrella law on subsoil resources has also been effective since May 5, establishing the principle that the state owns natural resources in situ but has the right to license them for development. All future developments must receive a licence, expected to be issued by the state committee on geology. Licences can be awarded either through competition involving submissions of drilling programmes and development plans, or by auction to the highest bidder. Both non-exclusive licences for geological prospecting valid for five years, and exclusive exploration and production licences lasting 25 years or longer, will be available. However, Mr David Moroney, a partner with the London legal firm Denton Hall, which is advising the Russian government on oil and gas law, points to two problems with the current law. One is that there is no provision for licences to be awarded through direct negotiation between companies and the government. Neither does it provide for any disputes to be settled by international arbitration. The final step is to develop a detailed law, specifically covering the oil and gas industry. A group of World Bank-sponsored experts from Houston University, headed by Professor George Hardy, is currently working on drafts, to be submitted to the Russian parliament by September. But a competing draft law, prepared by a Russian academic institute and supported by some petroleum associations, is also being considered. Getting either law passed may be less than plain-sailing. Mr Sergei Roginko, a member of acting Russian prime minister Mr Yegor Gaidar's secretariat, worried western companies by suggesting in London last week that enshrining detailed oil industry regulations in law might be inappropriate. 'We might spend many months debating an explicit law that is ideal for today, but tomorrow it could be out of date.' Specific oil regulations could be established through presidential decrees and parliamentary orders, he suggested. Such an arrangement might not satisfy western investors - presidential decrees can be changed very easily with a change of president. World Bank experts are also working on new tax laws to replace the present regime, which has emerged on a rather ad hoc basis. Made up of an export tariff, royalties, withholding tax, profit tax, as well as a social security tax and tax on expatriate earnings, the total take is close to 80 per cent of revenue, which western companies and many Russian officials alike realise is too high. There is widespread pressure for a move towards a profit- rather than a revenue-based tax, and a reduction in the punitive export tariff of Ecu26 a tonne - more than Dollars 5 a barrel. In the meantime, Mr Roginko pledged that 'serious' western investors could negotiate exemption from the export tariff - which was imposed primarily to discourage illegal exports by 'speculators'. As if in confirmation, the operators of the White Nights joint venture in Siberia announced the following day that they had been granted exemption. Other hurdles remain to be surmounted. A treaty must be designed to cover the 300,000km of oil and gas pipelines that now run through 15 different republics, to establish ownership and regulatory controls, rights of access, and tariffs. There is also the knotty problem of breakaway regions and republics within Russia, which was not solved by the signing of a new Federative Treaty earlier this year. Areas such as Tatarstan, Bashkiria and Chechen Ingushetia are demanding varying degrees of autonomy over their indigenous energy resources. Moreover, while the law on subsoil resources established that 40 per cent of oil revenues should go to the Russian Federation government, 30 per cent to the district or city, and 30 per cent to the region or autonomous republic within Russia, many areas are demanding a bigger share. Such problems, together with a Russian oil industry that is itself in a state of flux, may prompt foreign investors to turn to other republics which now negotiate independently from Moscow, and are competing aggressively for investment. Kazakhstan, which has scooped up two of the biggest deals so far and has the second-largest reserves after Russia, has already passed its own laws on natural resources. These are considered by western lawyers to be incomplete and inconsistent. But, says Mr Robert Gray, country manager for the former Soviet republics at JP Morgan, the merchant bank which has advised on oil deals with Kazakhstan, the central Asian republic scores with a simpler negotiating process. This is usually confined to the local producing association and the republican government. Mr Gray also points to the personal commitment to attracting foreign investment of Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, Kazakh president. Kazakh tax conditions have so far been individually negotiated in each case, and are the subject of some secrecy. They are, however, thought to be rather better than those in Russia. An important consideration for foreign investors across the old Soviet Union is the sheer remoteness and total lack of infrastructure of some of the fields. Mr Vasili Fedorchenko, a member of Russia's supreme economic council and former oil man himself, suggests the idea of special economic regions where western companies would be allowed to develop at special tax rates, on condition they constructed all the infrastructure - roads, schools, as well as hotels and restaurants, and 'houses not like they build here, but like you build in Windsor'. 'But,' he adds, 'I warn you. Russia is not an easy place to build. You might find marshes and rivers, taiga and mountains in your way.' The final article in this three-part series on developments in the oil industry of the former Soviet Union, which will cover deals signed so far with western companies, will be published on August 7. The first article was published on July 24.</p>

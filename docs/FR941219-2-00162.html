The Committee advises the Department on matters concerning the harmonization of private law at the international level. Private law harmonization is normally achieved by preparation of conventions, model national laws, legal guides and other materials. This work is undertaken by organizations such as the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), the Hague Conference on Private International Law, the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), the Specialized Conference on Private International Law of the Organization of American States (OAS), the International Chamber of Commerce and others. The Committee reviews projects under way by the above-referenced organizations or others that may be involved. When appropriate, specialized Study Groups of the Committee are formed to provide technical advice on particular topics. The Under Secretary for Management has determined that continuation of the Committee is necessary and in the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Members of the Committee are appointed by the Legal Adviser, who serves as Chair of the Committee, on the basis of nominations by national legal organizations. Participation in the work of the Committee and its Study Groups is open to any interested and qualified person or organization.

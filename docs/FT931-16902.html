			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Labour Research criticises pensions BRITISH STATE pensions are among the least generous in the European Community according to Labour Research, the independent trade union and labour movement magazine. A study by the organisation says arrangements in the UK are worse than in any EC state except Ireland. Labour Research says there are two main types of scheme in the EC - one linked to earnings and the other flat-rate. The UK operates a mixture of the two. It says countries operating fully earnings-related schemes include Belgium, with a top-rate entitlement of 60 per cent of earnings, France (50 per cent), and Germany (60 per cent). Occupational pensions may face 'disaster' unless reforms are made to the law in the wake of the Maxwell scandal, the TUC warns today. Its submission to the Goode Committee, which is reviewing pension law, includes proposals for replacement of trust law with a single pensions act and the separation of scheme assets from those of the employer.

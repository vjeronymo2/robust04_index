			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 4:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters suggested removing specific areas from the proposal. Such suggestions typically reflected concerns over inclusion of private lands in the proposal or were based on potentially conflicting uses, especially mining areas. Some letters provided additional biological information to support site-specific deletions from critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has reviewed the individual requests and determined whether the critical habitat boundaries should be modified to avoid non-tortoise habitat. Where possible, considering restraints of the map scale with which the Service was working, boundary lines have been modified. Areas suggested for deletion on the basis of perceived land-use conflicts were deleted if they did not meet the criteria for inclusion or did not provide important benefits to the species. Areas suggested for deletion because of poor habitat were re-examined in terms of value to tortoises. In some key areas, habitat currently in poor condition was retained because of its important location and high potential for contribution to recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 5:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters stated that critical habitat should not be designated because existing reserved lands, such as national parks and wildlife refuges, provide sufficient land for the tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service determined that the tortoise should be listed as a threatened species in 1990 (55 FR 12178) partly because insufficient habitat is protected within congressionally protected areas to adequately conserve desert tortoises. In addition, the Draft Recovery Plan recognizes that areas of sufficient size to support self-sustaining tortoise populations do not exist in already protected habitats. Critical habitat is primarily designated for areas identified in the Draft Recovery Plan as necessary for recovery of the desert tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 6:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters stated that the Service had proposed to designate too much habitat for the desert tortoise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service proposed critical habitat designation for those areas that met certain criteria. The proposed and final designations include at least one CHU within each of the six recovery units outlined in the Draft Recovery Plan. The size of these areas is based primarily on the requirements to support self-sustaining populations. Land management agencies, in consultation with the Service, may establish desert wildlife management areas in which the desert tortoise will receive special consideration. Upon establishment of these areas, the Service may reevaluate the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Issue 7:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several respondents stated that the designation should include other important desert tortoise habitats, especially the southern portion of Ft. Irwin, Joshua Tree National Monument, the Desert Tortoise Natural Area (DTNA), and the Desert National Wildlife Range. They stated that Congressional withdrawal of public lands within the DTNA from the general mining and mineral laws must be renewed after 20 years (year 2000). If mineral extraction is allowed after that time, designation of the DTNA as critical habitat may be the only way to protect this habitat from the effects of mining. Some respondents questioned why management plans developed for the DTNA and Joshua Tree National Monument are sufficient to preclude critical habitat designation, yet the BLM's Conservation Plan of 1980 is ignored. One letter said that such inconsistencies degrade the Service's contention that the DTNA is protected so well that it need not be included in the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Rai is the younger brother of Socrates, the leggy bearded midfielder who played for Brazil in 1982 and 1986. Rai scored both goals for Sao Paolo when they won the world club championship in 1992. This season he moved to Europe and has allegedly played lethargically for his new club, Paris St Germain. Nevertheless, PSG romped to their first French title, so Rai cannot have been a passenger the whole time. Sao Paolo provided a reminder of the greatest Brazilian football. Rai - must do for Brazil what he did for his club. Key Game: Brazil v Russia (June 20 - San Francisco) The two most talented teams in the World Cup have warmed up with bitter arguments over money. The Brazilians are used to this, but the Russian players were brought up in the old Soviet sports system and are just learning that the correct way to deal with incompetent, bullying football administrators is to act like spoilt children. Both teams have long records of World Cup frustrations. Russia's traditional World Cup is a mix of great football - a 6-0 win over Hungary in 1986, 4-0 over Cameroon in 1990 - and daft eliminations. They rarely fail to entertain and have played well in warm up matches. They are the perfect opponents to bring out the best in Brazil. And as go Brazil so goes the World Cup. A good early win could encourage the masters to dazzle. Strike breaker: Sergei Yuran, the Benfica attacker, will play for Russia</p>

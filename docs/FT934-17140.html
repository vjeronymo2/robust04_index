			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Pension proposals no threat to equities Sir, In your report of the Goode Committee's recommendations for pensions reform, the suggestion is made that the stability of equity markets may be threatened by the proposals for minimum solvency standards ('Goode report strikes a fine balance', October 1). I feel that alarm bells are being rung unnecessarily and it would be unfortunate if alarmist talk jeopardised the introduction of such a standard. The problems of underfunded pension schemes do not arise from the Goode Committee's proposals. If a scheme has insufficient assets to meet members' accrued benefits the trustees should, in conjunction with the employer and advisers, address the problem and, among other things, adopt an appropriate investment strategy. If some schemes have not tackled this problem to date, the recommendations in the Goode report should encourage them to do so and hence properly protect members' benefits. The development of derivative instruments means that, for schemes which need to take action, an appropriate investment strategy can usually be devised which avoids a substantial shift away from equities and thus the dangers of 'plummeting equity markets'.

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Steering in rough seas: Portuguese prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva talks to David Marsh and Peter Wise Portugal and its prime minister, Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, can thank the European Union for a great deal. Financial transfers from Brussels to the second-poorest member state (after Greece) in the last two years amounted to about Dollars 3bn a year, close to 4 per cent of gross domestic product, and are due to double by 1999. The funds, designed to cushion the impact of rapid structural change in the Portuguese economy, are rolling in at a difficult time. Mr Cavaco Silva calls it the 'worst period' since his centre-right government took office in 1985. Under the impact of the Europe-wide recession, Portugal last year suffered its first economic contraction for 10 years, with GDP falling by an estimated 0.5 to 1 percentage point. Officially-registered unemployment has risen to 6.2 per cent of the labour force, against 4.5 per cent a year ago. At the same time, Portugal's ambition to be a fully fledged member of economic and monetary union by the end of the century have been hit by currency unrest and devaluation in the last 12 months. In an interview last week in his palm tree-surrounded residence in the centre of Lisbon, Mr Cavaco Silva, a prickly economist who is the EU's fifth longest-serving prime minister, put a brave face on his problems. 'We have to prepare the Portuguese economy for a new phase. It's not easy . . . This is a real challenge. But I'm doing what I am convinced is in the interest of the country.' To increase competitiveness and pave the way for an anticipated 1.5 to 2 per cent rise in GDP this year, Mr Cavaco Silva wants many Portuguese workers to accept wage increases well below the 6 per cent inflation rate. The squeeze is being felt above all in the public sector, where employees are due to stage a one-day strike on January 25 to protest against a proposed wage freeze. The austerity is part of Mr Cavaco Silva's efforts to cut the budget deficit, which rose to 8.5 per cent of GDP last year, well beyond the original forecast of 4.6 per cent. Pointing to tough pay rounds in Germany, France or Spain, Mr Cavaco Silva says: 'Look at wage costs abroad. We cannot pay more (in percentage increases) than they do.' Since Portugal joined the Community in 1986, it has made rapid strides to catch up with other member states. Despite flagging output growth in 1991 and 1992, Portugal between 1985 and 1992 achieved annual average GDP expansion of 3.7 per cent, 1 percentage point above the EU average. Privatisation, particularly in the banking sector, has reversed some of the state takeovers implemented by the post-revolutionary communist government in 1974-75 - contributing to a general strengthening of government finances. Mr Cavaco Silva pledges to continue privatisation sales, but admits the political sensitivity of the planned sell-off in the telecommunications sector. To guard against foreign shareholders building up a dominant stake, the government wants to restrict the initial disposal to between 20 and 30 per cent of the single state company which will emerge later this year from a restructuring of the three publicly owned telecommunications concerns. With a general election due in October 1995, the prime minister faces a testing time in the next two years. His job has been made more difficult by a quickening in the pace of global economic competition. There are three main reasons for this: As a condition for part of the increase in transfers from Brussels, Portugal has accelerated the dismantling of protection for agriculture. This has been necessary as part of a shift towards relying more on industry. Only 12 per cent of the labour force now works on the land, compared with 22 per cent in 1985. Competition has increased from countries in eastern and central Europe offering low wage costs and investment opportunities for foreign companies. Lisbon plays down the idea that Portugal is losing foreign investment to the Czech Republic or Hungary. However, the economic threat from the east is one reason the government rules out a firm timetable for the former communist states to join the EU. The relatively firm exchange rate since Portugal joined the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 has added to pressure on companies to cut costs. Portugal devalued the escudo twice - in November 1992 and May 1993 - when the Spanish peseta came under speculative attack, and was forced, like most other ERM members, to move to 15 per cent fluctuation bands in August. However, strong foreign buying has brought the escudo back to July's level against the D-Mark. Declaring that industrialists can no longer rely on devaluation to boost foreign sales, Mr Cavaco Silva says: 'The government is not going to help inefficient enterprises to survive. They must look to new factors of competition - not just to low wages, but to quality and marketing.' Last month's Uruguay Round conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will, Mr Cavaco Silva says, intensify pressure on Portuguese business to modernise. Towards the end of the negotiations, Portugal voiced concern about the impact of trade liberalisation on textiles, which make up 30 per cent of its exports. However, Mr Cavaco Silva now says the trade deal  -like the escudo policy - will have a positive impact by 'changing the mentality of (Portuguese) entrepreneurs'. With 21 months before the general election, Mr Cav-aco Silva's Social Democrat party is riding relatively high in the opinion polls, even though it won only 34 per cent of the vote in December's municipal elections. Mr Cavaco Silva brushes aside signs of tension with Mr Mario Soares, Portugal's veteran Socialist president, who has started a well-publicised offensive against the government's economic and social policies. Mr Cavaco Silva - well aware that Mr Soares' is a largely honorific office - suggests the criticism has been stage-managed by the president's Socialist 'entourage'. He professes no great desire to take over from Mr Soares at the next presidential election in January 1996. He does, however, say he will stay on as prime minister only if his party wins another absolute parliamentary majority in October next year. He would have few qualms, he claims, about returning to university: 'I liked my job as a professor.' If he remains at the helm, steering Portugal through the next phase of European integration to the end of the century will be an arduous task. The country has to reform its economic structures with redoubled energy. Otherwise, as Europe's centre of gravity moves eastwards and northwards, Portugal will again suffer from its location on Europe's south-west periphery.</p>

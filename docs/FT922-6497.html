			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THERE was exceptionally heavy trading in the Footsie future, with many observers surprised at a series of buying bursts during what had been expected to be a relatively subdued pre-weekend session, writes Steve Thompson. Some early aggressive selling pressure by locals (independent traders) drove the June contract down from an opening 2,717 to 2,708 minutes after the opening. However, with the future looking cheap against the cash market and with some determined buying by arbitraguers entering the market, the June contract quickly stabilised and moved up strongly to the mid-2,720s. It held around this level until the late afternoon when a squeeze developed prompting a sudden burst of buying, and leaving the contract at 2,739 at the close. This was up 11 points on the day and an estimated fair value premium to cash of around 16 points. Turnover at the official close was 8,706 contracts, with dealers pointing out that over 6,000 contracts had been traded by lunchtime. In traded options, turnover was poor, reaching only 26,575 lots. BP was the heaviest traded stock option.</p>

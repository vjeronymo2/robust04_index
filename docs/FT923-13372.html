			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (9): Tomorrow's car takes shape - A look ahead into the future of motoring THE proportion of a car's value represented by bought-in components is steadily increasing although the basic pattern of car manufacture has changed but little in recent years. The vehicle manufacturer invariably produces the body shell, almost always the engine (with its own proportion of bought-in parts) and more often than not the transmission. All other components are purchased for direct installation, and this is the area in which car value has been increasing fastest. The process will inevitably continue at a rate which will comfortably outstrip the growth of car production measured in raw units. Consumer demand for ever higher levels of comfort, performance and equipment have gone hand-in-hand with legislation for more safety and cleaner exhausts to ensure this. A particular area of technology that has become the component suppliers' preserve is electronically-controlled systems. While nobody should underestimate the electronic expertise of the vehicle manufacturers themselves, they are simply not in the business of producing electronic components in large numbers - unless they do so via dedicated subsidiaries, as do General Motors and Toyota, for example. While the popular image of an electronic system is that of a 'black box' computer which exercises control over the operation of some aspect of the car, the reality is that the black box and its contents are the (relatively) easy part. To exert control, the computer must first assess circumstances by means of various types of sensor. It must then act to control the situation by means of output devices or transducers. It is in the area of sensors and transducers that some of the most intense development of vehicle components is taking place, placing component-sector companies with related expertise, such as Germany's Bosch and Japan's NGK, in a very strong position. The first serious application of electronic control systems to the car was in the management of engine operation. It is now commonplace to have a single computer controlling ignition and fuel injection, the latter particularly with the aim of reducing exhaust emissions. New regulations concerning emission control systems have placed extra demands on systems and sensors: for example, US and Japanese legislation will shortly demand the in-car monitoring of catalytic converter efficiency, calling for oxygen content 'lambda' sensors to be installed upstream and downstream of the converter. The adaptability and availability of electronic engine control systems may yet bring about a revolution in basic engine design: none of the development teams now working hard on two-stroke engine projects would pretend they could make their units work properly without the speed and precision of electronic control. Electronics has since migrated to the control of automatic transmission. No designer of such transmissions would today contemplate any other approach. Without electronics, the control mechanism of the latest five-speed transmissions would be too heavy and complex to be seriously contemplated. Nor would there be any question of systems which adapted their shift patterns to the driver's own technique, as some of the new units do. With automatic transmissions in Japan now making the breakthrough to American levels of sales penetration, and with confident predictions that Europe will follow suit, this will be an important growth area. Another transmission-related area in which rapid growth is expected is that of traction control systems, which operate to detect incipient wheelspin and to prevent it either by cutting back power or by partial brake operation. It is also expected that limited-slip differential units, with or without electronic control, will become much more widely fitted. The chassis is the part of the car most recently to have felt the impact of electronic engineering. We have become more and more familiar with electronic anti-lock braking but today's developments go further. More and more up-market cars are now offered with electronic control of suspension operation, adapting its stiffness to the road surface and to the car's behaviour: soft when cruising on a smooth road, firm when driven briskly on a rough or winding one. Development in this area is rapid and the potential for expansion is huge. Among other things, engineers have long since moved on from considerations of mere ride comfort to study the subtle effects on car stability and handling of varying suspension stiffness between the front and rear of the vehicle. Further into the future, chassis specialists are examining the possible advantages of electronic 'steer by wire' replacing mechanical linkages. The components industry has already greatly benefited from the much greater amount of comfort and convenience equipment now fitted especially to up-market cars. There has been a trend towards the power operation of almost anything that moves. Electric windows and centralised locking have been joined by power-operated seats, mirrors and sunroof. Car manufacturers are beginning to count the number of electric motors installed in luxury-level models in dozens. In spite of warnings from some quarters that such developments are driving up the weight, the complexity and the cost of cars to undesirable levels, the trend seems inexorable. Serious consideration has already been given to multiplexing and 'databus' systems to reduce the now huge amount of wiring in modern luxury cars. Beyond the area of mere comfort and convenience, there looms the huge potential market for equipment to link cars with each other and with the environment - the kind of equipment beginning to emerge from the pan-European Prometheus research programme, for example. It is now possible to conceive of equipment which would enable a car to be precisely aware of its position (and duly to inform its driver) and thus to be able to calculate the shortest and quickest route to its pre- programmed destination, taking account of any temporary delays and ensuring safety via automatic vehicle separation and optimised road-space sharing. Any such system would inevitably be a high-value item, and would certainly be supplied by the component manufacturing sector. Virtually all the necessary technology has already been demonstrated: the remaining problems, not to be underestimated, involve its integration into complete systems and more particularly, the standardisation of communications protocols and other operational aspects.</p>

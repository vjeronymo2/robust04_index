			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Hong Kong MING PAO in Chinese on 23  April publishes on page A6, below the fold, a half-page  1,000-character "statement" signed by 118 China affairs  reporters from 23 news organizations in Hong Kong, on the case  of MING PAO reporter Xi Yang, who has been convicted and jailed  in Beijing for allegedly stealing state secrets. Entitled  "Statement on the Xi Yang Case by Hong Kong Reporters Covering  China Affairs," this item is also published, in Chinese, in the  23 April edition of the English-language SOUTH CHINA MORNING  POST. The POST version takes up the lower left quarter of page  22, in the paper's sports section. Both the MING PAO and POST  versions are enclosed within a heavy black border, with the  headline in large, bold characters. The statement does not  appear in the 23 April editions of any of the other Hong Kong  papers on regular coverage at Hong Kong bureau: HONGKONG  STANDARD, EASTERN EXPRESS, HSIN PAO, and LIEN HO PAO, nor in the  PRC-affiliated TA KUNG PAO and WEN WEI PO. Neither was the  statement mentioned in the 0500 GMT "News at One" cast for 23  April on Radio-Television Hong Kong (RTHK).    The full text of the statement reads as follows:    "We are a group of Hong Kong reporters who constantly visit  mainland China to cover China affairs. Here we express our  indignation and resentment against the case of MING PAO reporter  Xi Yang, who has been charged with 'stealing state banking  secrets,' and found guilty without an open, fair trial, and has  been sentenced to 12 years in prison and deprived of his  political rights for two years.    "Despite the fact that Chinese officials and official media  have time and again stressed that Xi Yang's case was an  individual one, and that it has nothing to do with press  freedom, nevertheless, we Hong Kong reporters, who constantly  visit Mainland China, found the case to be shocking and  worrying. In fact, the behavior of Xi Yang, which which the  Chinese authorities brought charges, was very familiar to us as  our work style in our routine coverage of Chinese affairs.  Should Xi Yang be found guilty, then we will face the same  crisis, and Xi Yang will be neither the first nor the last  reporter to be apprehended.    "Since the PRC implemented reform and opening up, Hong Kong  news workers -- including Xi Yang -- have played an important  and promotional role in China's economic growth. We hope the  Chinese Government will adopt an open and practical attitude and  that it will respect Hong Kong reporters' coverage methods and  their right to report news according to the usual practices of  world news coverage.    "We believe that Xi Yang's case has revealed two important  issues: First, the Chinese authorities' definition of `state  secret' is vague; second, according to the document, `On Matters  of Attention for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for  News Coverage,' our news coverage activities in mainland China  can almost invariably be charged as `illegal.'    "The Chinese definition of `state secret' is very arbitrary  and vague, and even some basic materials are listed as  classified documents, which results in very great difficulties  for reporters' news coverage. Furthermore, they can be charged  on the grounds of `prying into' and `stealing' state secrets.  This being the case, we strongly require the Chinese  authorities to explicitly publish the definition of the category  of `state secrets,' while reviewing and revising it according to  customary international practice.    "In addition, Hong Kong reporters going to mainland China  for  news coverage are liable to violate the `Matters of Attention  for Hong Kong Reporters Going to the Hinterland for News  Coverage' because these rules and regulations stipulate that an  application must be filed before going to mainland China for the  purpose of news coverage, and furthermore, that no news coverage  activities beyond those specified in the application are  allowed. Practice over the past four and half years has  demonstrated that these regulations are impractical. We require  the Chinese authorities to remove promptly these restrictions on  news coverage.    "To express our strong resentment against the handling of Xi  Yang's case, and to urge the Chinese authorities to face our  anxieties and requirements squarely, as of today and until 31  May 1994, we have decided to boycott all news coverage  activities in the north which are funded by the Chinese  authorities by invitation as being of propaganda and tourist  values. At the same time, we appeal for support from our  employers.    "On the other hand, we urge the Hong Kong and British  Governments to actively follow up Xi Yang's case through  diplomatic channels, while requiring the Chinese Government to  clarify the definition of `state secrets' and to lift the  restrictions placed on news coverage by the requirement to  submit applications beforehand.    "We require our media employers to make a commitment that  they must bear legal, moral, and economic responsibilities  should their employees be held in custody or detention while  conducting news coverage in mainland China. We hope that the  Hong Kong Press Guild, the Hong Kong Association for News  Administrative Workers, and the Hong Kong Reporters' Association  will support us in setting out these requirements to the Chinese  authorities."

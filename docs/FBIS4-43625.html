			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["jj" commentary: "Criminal Carelessness"] </F>   [Text] France has proposed it, UN chief Butrus-Ghali is  enthusiastic, and now even the WEU [Western European Union], the  purely European nine-power alliance, is discussing an  intervention in Rwanda. Nevertheless, it should be considered  carefully. Be it Bosnia, Somalia, or now Rwanda -- it is always  the same problems that emerge if one takes a closer look.    First: Everything is always more difficult than it looks.  The Somali "gangs of thieves" have proved to be clever  tacticians, who even drove the Americans away in the end.  Second: The old colonial times when a few battalions were able  to "clear up" among the natives are over. Anyone who goes in  must be ready to stay. Shooting a hostile headquarters to rubble  only takes minutes. But creating a durable political order  takes years. Third: Democracies do not like zinc coffins, if  there is no solid national interest behind the casualties. And  fourth: Since the rebels are on the point of conquering Kigali,  this intervention would indeed come a bit late.    Is there a path between the "criminal passiveness," which  Paris has pilloried, and a criminal carelessness, which pushes  away the problems that come after the paratroopers have jumped?  Many African states have long offered soldiers to the United  Nations. They primarily lack armored personnel carriers that  would save them from the snipers. Instead of discussing an  unlikely intervention, the rich European Union countries had  better send the equipment. In this way, they could save lives  immediately.</p>

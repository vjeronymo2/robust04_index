			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / World Trade News: Concentrate effort, UK groups told British companies as well as government aid should concentrate on a few centres of economic growth in China in order to maximise their impact and build strong relationships, Mr Richard Needham, the British trade minister, said yesterday. Speaking at a London seminar on the city of Suzhou, he said: 'I do not believe that a scattergun approach to China works. You may hit the target but you are far more likely to miss it.' He urged UK businessmen to consider Suzhou as one area in which they could establish a presence. Mr Needham last year signed a memorandum of understanding with the mayor under which British companies are to be offered preferential terms for investment in Suzhou, which is 60 miles west of Shanghai, in return for co-operation on the city's development plans. He expected UK companies to be involved in a full range of activities, particularly infrastructural projects such as power stations, telecommunications, and a clean-up of the canal city's water, as well in manufacturing investment and services. The British presence would, in part, be a partnership with Singapore, which is building an industrial township to the east of the old city. Mr Alan Barlow, a director of accountants Coopers and Lybrand, which has produced a report on the Suzhou plans, said: 'We're piggy-backing on what the Singaporeans are doing.' Mr Needham said this triangular approach would also be appropriate in other parts of China, such as in Wuhan in central China, where Hong Kong companies are heavily involved, and in the eastern city of Fuzhou, where Taiwanese companies might be involved. He said there were similar opportunities in Bangalore, India, where Singapore is building another industrial park. Mr Needham said Britain must make clear its long-term commitment to involvement in China's development, in order to counter suspicions about London's intentions after sovereignty over Hong Kong passed to China in 1997. Failure to build on British investment in Hong Kong - which he estimated at Pounds 50bn - would be a devastating loss and put Britain's role a world power in question, he said.</p>

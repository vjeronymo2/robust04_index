			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: SCHOOLS GETTING BUM RAP, NEWPORT PRINCIPAL SAYS  </P> <P> One of the qualities especially impressive about Dennis Evans is that he not  only resents what he considers the bum rap being laid on public education these  days, but he takes on the critics as well. Head to head. One on one. Something  a lot of public educators -- who generally prefer to play it closer to the  chest -- are reluctant to do.  </P> <P> Evans, who is the principal at Newport Harbor High School (and a very different  breed from some of the administrators I remember when my kids were going to  public school in Orange County 25 years ago) asked me rhetorically the other  day: "Why do we accept the fact that we get what we pay for in every other area  except public education?"  </P> <P> We had been looking at a batch of recent headlines in Orange County newspapers  that I carried into Evans' office with me. They were universally bad news. "SAT  Scores Plummet to All-Time Low." "Many Freshmen Lack Basic Study Skills for  College." "U.S. Education Doesn't Make the Grade." "America's Toughest  Assignment: Solving the Education Crisis."  </P> <P> Evans shook his head. "I know my perspective is limited," he said, "but some of  this rhetoric is pretty excessive. Crisis. Plummet. Come on. This kind of talk  is political. The educational reform bandwagon is rolling, and politicians are  all climbing aboard.  </P> <P> "That's why we're hearing so much these days about such reforms as schools  competing for students and the use of parents as classroom teachers. Public  education ranks right up there with popular music, dressing styles and TV  stardom in terms of its susceptibility to faddism. These quick fixes are just  ways for politicians to avoid infusing the system with enough money to make it  work properly."  </P> <P> Whether you agree or not, this kind of straight talk is highly refreshing --  and it is why I turned to Evans in looking for an Orange County professional  educator to respond, as the new school year starts, to the growing shrillness  of the critics of public education.  </P> <P> I got a strong taste of this directness last year when Evans sent me a copy of  an open letter he had written in the aftermath of the attacks by Christian  fundamentalist groups, led by the Rev. Louis Sheldon, on the curriculum of  Corona del Mar High School psychology teacher Mike Marino. Those attacks  resulted in the forced removal of certain instructional units and materials  from courses in psychology and family life. That incident was cited in a recent  study by a liberal Washington organization called People for the American Way  that named three right-wing groups -- two of them based in Orange County -- as  leading a growing effort to censor course content in public schools. I asked  Evans if the heat from these groups had intensified since they scored some  points in the Newport-Mesa Unified School District last year.  </P> <P> Said Evans: "Maybe some good came of it because it has been relatively quiet  here ever since. I suppose there's some perverse value to us that Lou Sheldon  has been busy acquiring a national reputation so there has been no focus on our  district since last year.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, efforts at the local level are to get something out of the  curriculum. They've been concentrating lately at the state and national levels  where the effort is to get things like prayer and creationism in.  </P> <P> "But one of the results these people achieved would seem to me the opposite of  what they said they wanted. We have lots of very conservative teachers who in  the past would talk about reproduction in appropriate classes in a general way  and move on. Now, because of the new law lobbied through by these  fundamentalist groups, our teachers either have to avoid this subject  altogether or deal with it in the 10 steps required by law -- which forces  teachers to go into a lot more detail than they otherwise would have."  </P> <P> All of this is offered up matter-of-factly and without rancor. Evans is a tall,  lanky, graying, composed, feet-on-the-table type who neither dodges questions  nor makes speeches. But when he is annoyed, you know it. And he is plenty  annoyed about what he considered a lot of widespread misconceptions about  public education. Here's what he had to say about some of the more pervasive  ones:  </P> <P> The virtues of free marketplace competition that would offer a choice of  schools would improve education.  </P> <P>  This approach has been extolled by the President of the United States and  various corporate gurus, but Evans said it is a case of apples and oranges. "In  the business world," he said, "the relationship between competition and quality  is a function of profit. Competition may sometimes allow the consumer to save  money, but the product or service may still remain shoddy. When you truly want  a high quality product, you must pay for it -- and we're not in the fast-food  business in education."  </P> <P> We need to apply better business precepts to our schools.  </P> <P>  Said Evans: "It's a supreme irony that some of the most strident criticism of  public education comes from corporate America, which offers up such current  role models as Lincoln Savings and Eastern Airlines. But we would be happy for  a Chrysler-type bailout that would dump that kind of money on our schools. Try  us."  </P> <P> Given the chance, parents would make wise choices between schools.  </P> <P>  "What evidence," Evans asked, "exists to support this politically attractive  myth? Certainly most parents will be highly motivated to make a wise choice of  schools. But isn't it more reasonable to assume that marketing, packaging and  advertising will dictate school choice? Unfortunately, good intentions are no  guarantee of good decisions."  </P> <P> Lay groups protect us from our professional educators.  </P> <P>  Evans thinks this shibboleth has been stood on its head. "Why," he asked, "has  no one examined the part played by lay decision-makers in helping create the  problems public education deals with today? It may be heretical to suggest that  lay legislators and school board members are not the best sources for  educational decision-making or that neighborhood council members would do well  to concentrate on their own children, but perhaps we have reached a point in  time when heresy is what is needed."  </P> <P> The quality of teachers is falling off drastically.  </P> <P>  "Because this is an attractive area in which to live," Evans said, "we've got  outstanding people coming into the teaching profession here. Dynamite people.  Enthusiastic, eloquent, articulate people. I don't know that that scenario  plays out in urban schools, but it is happening here. But because of the  teachers' lack of income and status -- somewhere below firemen -- there still  has to be some feeling of altruism to go into this field."  </P> <P> Parents are abrogating their educational responsibilities to their children.  </P> <P>  "I don't see any great changes in the level of parental desire to help their  children to the best education possible," Evans said. "It's the circumstances  of their lifestyles that have changed. It's especially tough in single-parent  families. It's easy for critics to say that parents should give more time to  their kids, but a lot of them are at the survival level. It's also hogwash --  at least in my experience -- that some minority groups don't care about their  kids' education. They do care."  </P> <P> Evans tends to take the long view in assessing the problems of public  education.  </P> <P> "Action and reaction tend to ebb and flow," he said. "In the '60s and '70s,  when we were infected by the desire to be relevant, our teachers did bring some  things into the curriculum that were challengeable. When those influences  started to wane, the pendulum swung the other way and legitimate things were  attacked. I tell my teachers that if they can achieve the same educational  objective with less volatile methods, I prefer that. But if this is the only  way to get it across, then do it -- but be prepared for the heat.  </P> <P> "When public education professionals say things aren't all that bad, we're  accused of being self-serving. But educational problems must be looked at  school-by-school and site-by-site. There is very little bridge between the  problems of inner-city schools and what we deal with here -- and it's important  that we not paint everybody with the same brush."  </P> <P> It's also important that educators assert their professionalism and get off the  defensive to press their own views on what needs to be done to jack up public  education. Evans isn't denying the need for reform. He'd just like to see the  professionals have a clear shot at designing the reforms -- and enough money to  carry them through. It's a legitimate point of view that needs to be heard.  </P></p>

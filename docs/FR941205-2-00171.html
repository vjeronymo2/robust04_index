			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 101(a)(15) requires that States conduct continuing statewide studies of the needs of individuals with disabilities and how these needs may be most effectively met, including outreach to minorities and those who have been unserved or underserved. Vocational rehabilitation services are provided under section 130 of the Act to American Indians residing on reservations. Under the Act, the term American Indians includes Eskimos and Aleuts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Indians have one of the highest disability rates of all population groups. Yet, according to recent RSA statistical data on the vocational rehabilitation program, when American Indians with disabilities receive vocational rehabilitation services, they have a low rehabilitation success rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the major problems in providing services to American Indians include_(1) Lack of outreach efforts to rural and isolated areas where many American Indians live; (2) Cultural differences that make use of standard rehabilitation practices or methods less effective and may lead to lack of mutual understanding and trust between the provider and recipient of services; (3) Language and communication barriers; and (4) Limited employment opportunities in rural areas and on reservations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These problems are being addressed, in part, through the American Indian vocational rehabilitation services (section 130) discretionary grants. Increased cooperative efforts and sharing of information have occurred as a result of linkages between the discretionary projects and State rehabilitation agencies. There is a great need, however, for training methods and materials to improve the provision of services to American Indians with disabilities. Rehabilitation counselors and other staff who work in State rehabilitation agencies that serve significant populations of American Indians need training on how to work effectively with this population. In addition, institutions of higher education, which prepare individuals to provide vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities, have a need for culturally appropriate materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The project must_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop, with the active participation of American Indians, culturally sensitive rehabilitation training materials that address the use of appropriate rehabilitation methods, cultural differences, and development of mutual understanding and trust between service provider and recipient;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Use a ``train-the-trainer'' approach to train State rehabilitation unit in-service training educators and rehabilitation educators on all materials developed in order to improve the skills and knowledge of personnel providing vocational rehabilitation services to American Indians with disabilities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

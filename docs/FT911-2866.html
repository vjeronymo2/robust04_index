			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / UK Company News: Granada expected to take over BSkyB satellite TV rental side GRANADA GROUP is expected to take over the satellite television rental business built up by Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television in the early months of the satellite venture. As a result Granada will take over more than 200,000 rental agreements for satellite dishes and receivers, giving a boost to the company's rental division which already has some 2.5m customers. The agreement, expected to be signed soon, will mean additional revenues of more than Pounds 25m a year for Granada. Mr Murdoch set up his own rental organisation in the early days of Sky when there was an overwhelming need to increase the number of viewers as quickly as possible. Since the merger of Sky Television and its rival British Satellite Broadcasting in November to form BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, publishers of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, the television company has been less interested in being directly involved in rental. The deal is effective compensation for Granada's losses on surplus BSB squarials. Granada was stuck with about Pounds 20m in redundant stock because of the merger, and was one of those with a legal case for compensation against BSkyB even though it was an investor in the satellite venture. Last week Comet, Kingfisher's consumer electronics chain, won a judgment against BSkyB because of the effects of the merger on its business. Comet is claiming more than Pounds 10m compensation although BSkyB said it would appeal. Apart from revenues of about Pounds 10 a month from each satellite rental customer, Granada will also collect film channel subscriptions from them for BSkyB.</p>

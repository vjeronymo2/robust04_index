			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY PROFILE / FALLBROOK: FALLING FOR FALLBROOK;  </P> <P> TANTALIZING SPELL STILL SNAGS MANY  </P> <P> Although the Sleeping Indian Mountain formation looms over Fallbrook's  southwest skyline, the Indians encountered by the Spanish missionaries at San  Luis Rey and Pala during the late 1700s would not venture into what is now the  site of Fallbrook.  </P> <P> According to the legend of the Luisenos tribe, which populated the foothills  and coastal plains at the time of the Spanish occupation, one of their members  had entered the area and had been bewitched and turned to stone.  </P> <P> Centuries later, Fallbrook continues to cast its tantalizing spell over those  who enter its environs. Part of the enchantment is that travelers do not drive  through Fallbrook on their way to anywhere else -- to visit the town you must  decide that this is your destination.  </P> <P> And sometimes, when folks arrive, they decide this country village -- billed as  the world avocado capital -- is where they want to stay.  </P> <P> "I come from an old country town in Massachusetts, and Fallbrook reminded me of  it," said Bettina Shaw, who moved to the area from Los Angeles in 1969. "We  loved the avocado trees and all the fresh air. The town was so pretty, we  decided to retire here."  </P> <P> A former documentary filmmaker, lecturer and self-described "fugitive from a  film colony in Hollywood," Shaw was charmed by the downtown, where some  original Western-style buildings, as well as some "false front" designs, give  the appearance of a frontier town.  </P> <P> "There weren't even any traffic lights when I first came here," said Shaw, who  now owns an antique and doll shop.  </P> <P> Fallbrook has long been the favorite of Hollywood types (the Frank Capra home  was on 18 acres of Red Mountain Ranch and two sons graduated from Fallbrook  High School) as well as the corporate elite, and an enduring group of active  and retired commercial pilots who use Fallbrook as their home base. The pilots  can take off and land in their private planes at Fallbrook Air Park.  </P> <P> Many of the area's residents live on 5-to-15-acre parcels of avocado and citrus  groves.  </P> <P> Rufus and Betty Thompson gradually came to make their home in Fallbrook, and  today live with 8 acres of peach, persimmon and avocado trees.  </P> <P> Rufus Thompson discovered Fallbrook when he was stationed at Camp Pendleton  during the '60s. After retiring from the Marine Corps, he and his family moved  north to El Segundo but acquired a pied-a-terre in Fallbrook for peaceful,  getaway weekends. Ten years ago, they returned to live full time.  </P> <P> "The trees keep me plenty busy," said the retired Marine. "I wanted to find  something to keep me active that I could also get away from when I wanted. It's  really a very enjoyable way of life."  </P> <P> Fallbrook is a roller-coaster of a town, with sinuous roads running up hill and  down dale. Most of the homes are not visible from the road -- long, gated  driveways and dirt roads disappear into thick, green foliage.  </P> <P> Ancient oaks and huge sycamores shade the area, and rambling streams and narrow  winding valleys carry the rainfall runoff to the Santa Margarita and San Luis  Rey rivers.  </P> <P> Much of Fallbrook's rural charm can be attributed to its insulated location.  It's bounded on the north by the Santa Margarita River and the Riverside County  line, and on the west by the Fallbrook Naval Weapons Station and Camp  Pendleton. Interstate 15 serves as the eastern border, and the town extends  south to the San Luis Rey River and California 76.  </P> <P> Fallbrook, with an estimated population of 34,000 if you include neighboring  Bonsall and Rainbow, has not escaped the growth affecting all of North County.  </P> <P> Like so many other communities, Fallbrook is struggling to balance the  interests of preservation and development. A number of residents have become  activists in trying to preserve the rural ambience. Recently, a group came  together to form the Fallbrook Land Conservancy, which succeeded in  establishing a 43-acre nature preserve on the edge of town. When a stand of  live oaks was cut down recently to make way for a housing development, it  prompted cries of outrage.  </P> <P> "Fallbrook has changed a lot in the last 15 years. Everybody found it," said  Dorothy Norton, who came in 1948 from Santa Ana when her father took a job with  the Soil Conservation Corps.  </P> <P> "It seems like the population about doubled in the last 10 years, and a lot of  groves are being cut down for subdivisions and houses. But we have a very  active planning group, and we're trying to keep it rural."  </P> <P> Even before it was settled in 1869, the area now known as Fallbrook was unique.  When the Francisco padres and Spanish conquistadors settled in Southern  California, they took over the land in San Luis Rey and Pala, but not in the  Live Oak Park area.  </P> <P> Vital Reche, his wife, and three children settled in the area in 1869. Having  traveled west from their home in Fall Brook, Pa., they first lived in the Santa  Clara Valley, and for a short time, Pala, before homesteading by Live Oak  Creek. They designated the area Fall Brook, after their Pennsylvania home (the  name later become one word), and began farming and raising bees on the 160-acre  Reche Ranch, which eventually housed a resort hotel, post office, stagecoach  stop and grocery store.  </P> <P> Although the land was fertile enough to support strawberry and alfalfa crops  grown by the Reches and other farmers, the creek was an erratic water source,  overflowing from cloudbursts and repeatedly washing out dams and crops.  </P> <P> Randy Harris, who owns two antique shops in town, said he had no intention of  moving to Fallbrook when he first went there. "It was almost like a fluke. I  was furnishing a house and came out here to look for antiques. I found a house  I loved that was about to be torn down, so I bought it.  </P></p>

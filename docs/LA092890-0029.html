Cooperman, president of  the unit's North American division, and G. Richard Thoman, president of  American Express International, the company said.  </P> <P> The two men also will serve as co-chief executives of the unit.  </P> <P> Papone, who has held his post since April, 1989, will become a senior adviser  to American Express Co., reporting to Chairman James D. Robinson III. Papone  also will continue as a director of the parent company.  </P> <P> "This completes a management evolution that began almost 18 months ago when  Aldo advised me that he would need to be less active in TRS (Travel Related  Services) management activities for medical reasons," Robinson said in a  statement.  </P> <P> Cooperman, an 18-year American Express veteran, is credited with increasing the  growth of the American Express card.

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Power row may delay coal sell-off A ROW between the gov-ernment, the electricity regulator, and the 12 regional electricity companies of England and Wales has emerged as a potential obstacle to the privatisation of British Coal. National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, will not sign long-term supply contracts with British Coal unless they can first sell the coal-fired power to the 12 regional electricity companies. But the companies are refusing to sign contracts to buy coal-fired electricity from the generators without approval from Offer, the regulator. They are worried that if they sign at too high a price Offer will penalise them for passing on the cost to consumers. Offer says it will not intervene. The government has also refused to step in. The privatisation of British Coal cannot go ahead until the stand-off is resolved. 'It's a vicious circle,' said the chairman of one of the regional companies. The government is anxious to make sure British Coal sells enough coal at a price which will ensure its future, while avoiding the appearance of subsidising the corporation. The prices being offered to the companies by the generators for coal-fired power is presently about 3p a unit, well above the price in the pool, or wholesale, electricity market. At this price, the companies say, the government would have to persuade them to sign a five-year contract and make sure Offer approved this. Offer said yesterday that the companies should simply make sure they buy coal-fired power at competitive prices. The regional companies are angry about the situation. 'It's all very well for Offer to say it should be a commercial deal between us, the generators and British Coal,' said the chairman of one, 'but we're being forced to do something we would not normally do - sign a long-term contract at an unknown price and volume that could put our business in jeopardy.' Another chairman said the coal contracts could cost his company around Pounds 1.2bn over five years. 'That would be the biggest commercial deal we do,' he said. 'If Stephen Littlechild (the electricity regulator) comes along in a year and says we signed at too high a price, it could have disastrous financial consequences.'</p>

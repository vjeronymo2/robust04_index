			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] THE PIONEER expresses displeasure about the recent  mock operation involving American and Ghanaian military  personnel code- named MEDFLAG '94. In the operation, four  hijackers took over a Ghana Airways plane carrying about 80  passengers and a crew of four at the Accra Airport. The  hijackers made certain demands, including the stepping down of  the government. THE PIONEER says the operation was  ill-conceived and ill-motivated because apart from causing fear  and panic, it amounted to putting bad ideas in the minds of  certain sections of the society.</p>

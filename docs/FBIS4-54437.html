			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 28 (CTK) -- The pressure exerted  by the opposition on parliament to dismiss Deputy Premier Roman  Kovac is increasing. The dismissal was proposed on Wednesday  [27 April] by Dusan Masiar, a deputy for the Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), who is supported by 35 deputies.  The opposition accuses Kovac of being incompetent both as  deputy premier and from the moral point of view, and of  corruption attempts.    Peter Sokol, adviser to the opposition Slovak National Party  (SNS) said at a SNS press conference today that Kovac was  morally incompetent mainly due to his previous "commitment". As  deputy premier in the previous government of ex-Premier Vladimir  Meciar, Roman Kovac was one of the protagonists of the then  coalition agreement between the HZDS and the SNS, Sokol said.    According to Sokol, Kovac pushed for the joint of his post  of  vice-premier with the seat of health minister, and promoted  himself to this post.    Parliamentary deputies refused to include the proposal to  dismiss Roman Kovac into the agenda of the parliamentary  session. However, Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic (HZDS)  announced he would convoke an extraordinary session to discuss  this point immediately after the end of the current regular  session.    SNS leaders also criticised former SNS leader and present  chairman of the National Democratic Party-New Alternative  Ludovit Cernak.</p>

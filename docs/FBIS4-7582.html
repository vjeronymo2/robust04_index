			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Tibor J. Keri report: "If the MSZP Forms the Government, </F> the MDF Will Not Have a Place in It, Gyula Horn, Leader of the  Socialists Says"]    [Text] I do not wish to react to the statements of Viktor  Orban [chairman of the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz] or  other leaders of the Fidesz, Gyula Horn, chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], told our correspondent. As is  known, Orban recently said that the parliamentary parties had  made a mistake by letting the MSZP out of quarantine after two  years, and society will suffer for this. Horn also said that if  the MSZP came to power, it would be a deception of the electors  to take the current Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] back into  government.    In connection with Orban's statement, Horn noted that he  cannot do anything about such statements, but he finds it  unfortunate that the Fidesz is adopting the style applied by  some of the government parties. This does not suit them, Horn  said, and at the same time, he believes that the Young Democrats  will still have time to cool down.  <H5>  Rather Than Wrestling, It Is Confidence Gaining </H5>   Horn does not believe Prime Minister Boross, either, who  said  that the elections will be decided between the MSZP and the MDF,  and the liberal parties will wither away. At the same time, he  thinks it possible that, in the long run, the liberal parties  will fulfill a political role similar to that in Western Europe.  This means that they will be parties with a marked character  but smaller social support than they now have. However, Horn  certainly does not assume that the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] would not have an important role in the May elections,  and its results will be at least as good as those of the MDF.  Therefore, Horn sees Boross's statement on this as a simple  prediction, one that is solely meant to reassure the MDF, but  which is unlikely to increase the number of their votes.    About the election prospects, Horn also said that the MSZP  is  not wrestling with the MDF, but the MSZP would like to gain the  confidence of the voters. They would find it desirable if they  reached a result that expresses that Hungary does have a  European democratic left wing. A left wing -- whether it is in  government or opposition -- which cannot be left out of  important decisions. This is our fundamental goal, rather than  dealing with other parties' predictions of chances, Horn noted.  He added that it is their feeling that most of the citizens  have already decided for whom to vote, but this will only come  to light at election time.    Horn finds the increasing coarseness of the election  campaign  worrying. In reply to our note that a recent UJ MAGYARORSZAG  interview called him the "most popular henchman," Horn said that  if he took certain articles in the UJ MAGYARORSZAG seriously  then he should indeed leave the country. What is published in  this newspaper has nothing to do with honest information, he  said. He finds it regrettable that newspapers that are  presumably supported from state finances can allow themselves to  take this tone. According to Horn, in the long run, a solution  could be reached in the Hungarian press if all newspapers were  privatized after the elections and the readers could then decide  through their purchases if newspapers with this style are  needed. At the moment, this newspaper can easily survive  because its losses, which exist in spite of its declining  print-runs, are presumably covered from state resources, he  added. As for the so-called opposition press, he noted that,  contrary to government propaganda, the MSZP's popularity is not  to be attributed to the press. As an example, he also mentioned  NEPSZABADSAG, because, as he said, this newspaper was not very  good at reporting the MSZP's important proposals and  parliamentary statements to the readers.  <H5>  There Is a Witness to Every Lie </H5>   According to information received by NEPSZABADSAG,  government  circles have asked the activists of the National Federation of  Political Prisoners [POFOSZ] and the Historical Justice  Committee [TIB] to seek out evidence and witnesses in connection  with Horn's activities in 1956 and 1957. In connection with  this, Horn said that it is possible that this kind of action has  been started. In his view, it is an old truism that it is  always possible to find and pay a "witness" for every lie. In  the past four years, they have tried to accuse him of all kinds  of acts but all these slanders have proved to be lies. It is  possible that new ones will be brought up, and I will reply to  them; however, if I receive any very rude insults then I will  use my legal rights, he said.    According to Horn, it is necessary for the current  government  to prepare detailed accounts before it gives power to the new  cabinet. This is important because, whatever kind of government  comes to power, the new parliament must be clear about the  country's real financial situation. From an opposition  position, we were not able to find out many facts. For example,  we do not know what kind of domestic and foreign financial  commitments and guarantees the Boross government has taken on.  Nor do we know exactly what kind of lasting effects the various  government decisions will have and how Hungary's debt-servicing  obligations may change. It is important to find all this out  because these factors will significantly influence the next  government's freedom of movement. This is one of the reasons it  is important for the current cabinet to give a true report on  the economy's real situation instead of the country being full  of the propaganda of success, Horn stated. Should the Boross  cabinet decide to distort the reality and deceive the new  government and society, this will be discovered very quickly,  within a few weeks, Horn said. He is convinced that expert  committees will have to uncover the country's real situation  while the coalition talks are being held.   <H5>    Social Cooperation Is Needed </H5>   In Horn's view, after the elections, regardless of the  result, social unity will be needed to remove the country from  the economic crisis. He said that the other side also has  honest people and the loudest people in the parties need not be  identified with the given parties. There are many clever and  sober people who are free from extremism in this country.  Therefore, Horn is convinced that the new parliament and  government will have the opportunity to integrate these forces.  I am optimistic, and believe that, sooner or later, it will  certainly be possible to create social unity in this country,  Horn said. Talking about a possible grand coalition, Horn said  that it would be equivalent to deceiving the electors if the  MSZP, in case it comes to government, retained the MDF in  government. However, even if the current government parties are  put into opposition, we would like to achieve a normal dialogue  and cooperation between the parliamentary parties, Horn said at  the end of the interview.</p>

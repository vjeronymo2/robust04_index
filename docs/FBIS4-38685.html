			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 2 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Russia  will soon establish a trade committee to discuss ways to promote  and strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of trade,  investment and technology.    The committee's creation was agreed in Moscow on Thursday  when the two nations' trade ministers signed a memorandum to  that effect. Attending the meeting were Korean Trade, Industry  and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su and Russian Foreign Economic  Relations Minister Oleg Davydov. Kim Chol-su is accompanying  President Kim Yong-sam on his state visit to Russia.    The ministers agreed to hold the committee's first meeting  in  Seoul this year to be headed by the two sides' assistant  ministers.    During the meeting, Russia promised to continue offering  preferential tariffs for Korean goods that are half the most-  favored-nation rate. In addition, Moscow said it will dispatch  an evaluation team to Korea to designate six more  safety-certifying agents for easier customs clearance of Korean  goods bound to be shipped to Russia.    They also agreed to set up a working-level committee to  support construction of a Korea-Russia Trade Center at a site  owned by Moscow University Campus.    Minister Kim pointed out that there is still 755 million  U.S.  dollars receivable from Russia for Korean exports, saying this  uncollected money resulted from a foreign currency freeze in  December 1990 imposed by the former Soviet Union's External  Economic Bank.    With regard to Minister Kim's call for early settlement of  Russia's outstanding receivables, Davydov proposed a meeting in  Moscow to discuss terms of payment and creditor-confirmation  procedures.</p>

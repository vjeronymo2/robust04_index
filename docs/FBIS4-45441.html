We will  take this opportunity to speak to Cuban Justice Minister Doctor  Carlos Amat. Dr. Amat, virtually at the close of this event, we  would like you to tell us what fundamental topics were discussed  and what was the fate of the proposal submitted by the Cuban  delegation?    Amat: The meeting of Ibero-American justice  ministers is a conference that has been held for several years.  As you stated, this is the 10th conference. On this occasion  we touched on topics that appear to be permament topics on our  agendas. One is the topic of the fight against drug  trafficking. This topic does not have the same implication in  Cuba as in other countries, because our society does not engage  in using, trafficking, or producing drugs. For other countries,  however, it does have a serious connotation. Some of those  countries are drug producers and are hard hit by the drug  trafficking problem. Although we do not have this problem in  our country, it is a very useful topic, because the experience  of countries that are victims of this situation can always be  learned from. They are teachings that benefit us, because Cuba  is fighting hard to prevent drug trafficking from invading us.  This does not mean, however, that we are immune to it or are  exempt from it. It could happen to us. Our duty, therefore, is  to prepare technically and to learn about the problem, to be  able to wage an anti-drug program if necessary. There are  isolated cases, however, involving tourists. However, it is not  a problem that affects us to the extent it affects other  countries. [passage omitted]</p>

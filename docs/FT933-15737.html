			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Heavy demand for Rhone-Poulenc offer RHONE-POULENC'S FFr4.4bn (Dollars 770m) sale of its 35 per cent stake in Roussel-Uclaf, France's third-largest pharmaceuticals group, has been highly oversubscribed, according to initial indications. The international placement is said to have been oversubscribed more than twice and the domestic public offer has also been oversubscribed. The offers close at 5pm tomorrow. Advisers will have to decide whether to claw back shares from the international issue. Rhone-Poulenc's 7.8m shares were allocated equally to the two issues. Under Paris stock exchange rules, up to 15 per cent of shares in the international issue could be clawed back, leaving the French public offer with 4,483,000 shares. No clawback is possible from the domestic offer. A decision about the clawback will be made on Friday. The criteria will include both demand and political considerations. It is understood the French authorities would prefer to allocate as many shares in France as is possible. The offer is being co-ordinated by Barclays de Zoete Weed. The two offers are jointly managed with Banque Nationale de Paris and JP Morgan. A price of FFr563 was set earlier this week after a two-week bookbuilding period. The quality and the depth of the book is understood to have been good. Hoechst, the German chemicals group, owns 54.5 per cent of Roussel-Uclaf.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Kalashnikova: "Ukraine-Iran Talks. All </F> Oil Roads Lead to Moscow"]    [Text] The results of a mission to Tehran by Ukraine  Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko that ended yesterday have  disappointed both sides. The contracts on deliveries of Iranian  oil to Kiev are recognized as dead and buried. Ukraine could  not after all get "black gold" either by the oil pipeline  running across Azerbaijan or by tankers across the Black Sea  because the Turkish side would not let them pass through the  Bosporus.    Oil contacts with Tehran that saw the light of day as a  result of Kiev's seeking economic independence from Moscow  called for the supply of 5 million tonnes of "black gold" as  early as 1992, and another 4 million in 1993. There were plans  under which the "Iranian oil for Ukrainian metal" barter scheme  was supposed to have reached the $7 billion level. There was  also talk of a really pipe-dream project, of a direct oil and  gas pipeline from Iran to Ukraine. But it was perhaps not  fated. Mr. Zlenko has characterized the situation with failed  deliveries as a stalemate.    Now there is a new deal in the offing. Iran intends to buy  from Kiev military hardware manufactured in Ukraine, in  particular Antonov-type military transport planes and spares for  them. Since there are no diplomatic constraints for such  bilateral relations, this understanding appears rather realistic.    A bilateral commission to coordinate economic cooperation  was  formed. As for political ties, Tehran has so far offered to  Kiev mediation in freeing Ukrainian POW's in Afghanistan (there  are nearly 80 of them).</p>

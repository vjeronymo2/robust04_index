			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rise across maturity spectrum US Treasury prices rose across the maturity spectrum yesterday. The yield curve depicting the relation between two-year and 30-year bonds pushed close to flat as the long end of the market gained more than the short end. Late in the session the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 96 31/32 , yielding 7.756 per cent. The two-year note rose  1/16 to 99 21/32 , yielding 7.673 per cent. The yield spread between the two-year and the long bond shrunk down to 7.7 basis points before rebounding later in the day. Prices dipped early in the morning after the conference board released a stronger-than-expected report on consumer confidence. Prices recovered later amid short-selling by traders reacting to relatively weak home sales. European markets were very quiet, with most participants on holiday and the UK market closed. German bonds got a small lift from firmer US Treasuries, and the March bund futures contract on DTB ended at 98.84, up 0.08, albeit on extremely thin volume. The German government will launch its year-end bond today. The first tranche of the 10-year paper - expected to carry a 7.5 per cent coupon  - will be placed via the traditional bond consortium and a second tranche is due to be auctioned tomorrow. In Spain, continued jitters surrounding political scandals undermined the market, causing the March bond future to tumble by 0.68 to 84.20. In Italy, the March bond future rose by 0.29 to 99.82, despite continued political uncertainty following Mr Silvio Berlusconi's resignation last week as prime minister.</p>

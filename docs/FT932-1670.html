			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: EC fears grow on high cost of creating jobs THE summit revealed that there is a consensus emerging among the Twelve that the cost of creating jobs in the Community is too high, and that Europe's competitiveness is suffering so badly that it is in danger of exporting jobs rather than goods. But there is little to indicate that governments are preparing to tear down Europe's traditional welfare systems. In spite of British crowing that the debate is moving 'inexorably in the direction we have been advocating for some time,' as Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, concluded, Britain's partners are not about to rip up the EC's social charter. 'No monster or dragon has been slain by the British delegation,' insisted a senior European Commission official. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the social democrat prime minister of Denmark who chaired the summit, went out of his way to stress that the 12 had begun a debate on jobs and competitiveness 'without questioning the basic principles of our social welfare system.' But what has started is a radical rethink on labour costs and flexibility, and on ways the EC can regain competitive advantage and restore growth. This debate will certainly reshape thinking on EC social policy, a debate likely to be complicated by sharp differences over whether the EC should develop an industrial strategy. Behind the fuzzy outline of Mr Delors' presentation on jobs and competitiveness is the conviction that Europe cannot compete with Japan and the US, let alone, with eastern Europe and China, simply by driving down wage and non-wage costs. Part of Mr Delors' solution is that the EC must 'trade up' into ever higher added value activity. This means much more spending on infrastructure, research and development and training. Liberal member states, with the UK in the vanguard, see a disguised industrial policy behind such prescriptions, which Mr Delors failed to insert in the Maastricht treaty, and in the seven-year EC finance package agreed at the Edinburgh summit. The UK has already objected to Brussels plans to reform the Ecu6bn (Pounds 4.71bn) EC social fund, by siphoning off funds targeted on young and long-term unemployed to allow companies undergoing restructuring to retrain their workers. Other parts of the Delors prescription, like more spending on active labour market policies, more job-sharing, and switching taxes on labour to eco-taxes on energy and natural resources, reflect a shift in emphasis towards those without jobs and away from setting terms for those in work. A green paper on the future of social policy, due from the Commission in the autumn, will confirm the shift. But neither Brussels nor the UK's partners are likely to abandon outstanding draft laws derived from the Social Charter. Mr Major singled out the recently passed working time directive, and Brussels proposals to protect part-time and young workers and acquired employment rights, as particularly 'muddle-headed meddling', and argued that all proposals should be screened for their impact on costs and competitiveness. This is likely to happen more and more. Despite the opt-out, the UK has had to fight hard to dilute measures it abhors, like the working time directive. It is having to negotiate assiduously on measures its partners may introduce under the social chapter. Nevertheless the UK is right in believing costs have moved up the social agenda of all its partners. When the working time directive was finalised this month, a so-called no-regression clause - a pledge by the 11 not to use concessions designed for the British to backslide on their own working time conditions - was struck out without demur.</p>

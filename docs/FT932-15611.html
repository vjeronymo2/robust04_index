			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fiction: A saga, backwards MR MANI by A B Yehoshua Peter Halban Pounds 15.99, 368 pages ADJECTIVES come racing to mind to describe Mr Mani, for instance 'rich, complex, exotic, creative, informative', but 'easy' is one that does not fit. On finishing it, this reader had the reaction that he had to turn back to the beginning in order to grasp more firmly the sources of his admiration. A B Yehoshua has hit upon an original way of telling what in former days might have been a three-decker family tale of the Thomas Mann or Galsworthy type. Depicting ten generations of the Mani family, Yehoshua chooses to unfold the story backwards, from a young Israeli woman in the present bringing up the latest Mani, a boy whose father has been killed on active service in Lebanon. Behind her and this boy stands a grandfather who is a judge, and behind him stands an elder Mani who was in Crete with his family at the time of the German invasion in 1941, and who did not survive the Nazis. Behind him stands his father, who had been in Palestine when the British captured it in 1917, and had been treated as a spy and deported to Crete. And behind him stands a previous generation which travelled between Poland and Jerusalem. In this way the roots of the Manis are traced to a forebear in the Jewish quarter of Salonika in the 18th century. By the fictional standards of today it might have seemed unacceptably old hat to give a straightforward narrative even of so unusual a lot as the Manis. It is also a brilliantly oblique method of telling the entire recent history of the Jews, of course, with the one diaspora in Europe and the other in the lands of the former Ottoman empire meeting now in the modern state of Israel, and not always smoothly as a new identity arises. Yehoshua sweeps in an enormous cast of characters, beginning with wise rabbis and Jewish doctors and villagers in eastern Europe, going on to Dr Herzl himself at a Zionist Congress in Basel, taking in the British consul and British army officers and people who ran a clinic in Jerusalem, Ottoman Beirut, Turks and Arabs and Jews of all sorts. Such a display of learning and command of historical detail might have been intimidating, but the touch is far too light and natural for that. As for the Manis, they survive without giving any sense that they realise how special they are. As a family they have more than their fair share of suicide and illegitimacy. History brings them tragedy and murder. Their personal dramas count for more than anything symbolic which Yehoshua may have intended for them as representatives of Jewish fate. It is extraordinarily skilful to have captured the Jewish mixture of suffering and revival, despair and messianic hope, without in any way spelling out such heavy themes. Which brings us to technique, a subject of concern to writers rather than readers, but inescapable in this case. Yehoshua has chosen to arrange the novel in the form of five lengthy conversations, so that the saga is not necessarily carried forward (or backward) by those directly living it, but instead through the mouth of someone convenient for the purpose: the mother of the last Mani boy, the German soldier who killed the Mani in Crete and so on. The supposed interlocutor is missing. The conversations are therefore so many interior monologues. On the one hand this allows Yehoshua to range far and wide, but on the other it proves extremely cryptic because it is one-sided. The reader is often left to puzzle out what the missing person is supposed to have said, and Yehoshua delights in setting traps. I cannot imagine what else Yehoshua could have done, but imposing this structure on himself makes for harder work than need have been the case, and raises an awkward question of verisimilitude: if one side of these conversations has been recorded, how come the other has not? In the future, as this book takes its rightful place, seminars and doctorates will thrash out that point. Let me now add 'creative, wild, exemplary, life-enhancing and even optimistic' to the list of adjectives.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Siberian air crash kills 120: Pilots' chief blames Aeroflot break-up for poor safety The head of Russia's pilots' union called for 'an end to the mess' in the domestic airline industry after 120 people died yesterday in the country's worst air crash for a decade. A Tupolev-154 crashed in Siberian farmland just after taking off from Irkutsk, near Lake Baikal, for a five-hour flight to Moscow. All 120 crew and passengers, including 16 foreigners, were killed after the engines failed and the aircraft caught fire in mid-air. Nine of the 16 foreigners who died were German, and four Chinese. Mr Alfred Malinovski, head of the pilots' union, said in an interview with the Financial Times that the crash was part of a 'harvest of accidents which, to a significant degree, is being reaped because of the shocks suffered by the aviation industry'. He claimed that, with the break-up of Aeroflot into 160 local carriers such as Baikal Air, whose aircraft crashed yesterday, safety checks had been weakened and pilots had little control over the over-loading of aircraft with cargo, fuel and passengers. 'The industry is in a fearful state. Not enough money is spent on repairs, and enforcing safety regulations. Pilots have to travel with bags of cash to pay for fuel and tend to load as much fuel wherever they are because prices are so unpredictable. 'Crudely speaking, things are a mess.' At its year-end press conference, the Russian Transport Ministry reported that fatal accidents on Russian airlines had dropped to 10 last year from 24 in 1992. Mr Malinovski added that ground staff and crew were vulnerable to bribes and threats to take on extra cargo. The threats come particularly from small traders who criss-cross the country reselling goods and transporting them on passenger tickets. While some of the units that have emerged from the break-up of Aeroflot and some of the many new airlines have improved services, domestic travel within the former Soviet Union remains dismal.</p>

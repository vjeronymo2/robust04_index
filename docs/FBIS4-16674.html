			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Otto Latsis report: "Russia's Economy on the Bottom. Is </F> It Not Time To Climb Back?"]    [Text] Up-to-date information has been received from the  State Committee for Statistics on Russia's socioeconomic  situation in the first quarter. It testifies not only to the  continuation of known processes in the economy, but to new  phenomena too.    Today's slump is qualitatively different. In industry, the  slump in production is far more acute and far more profound than  last year. Industrial production fell by 24.9 percent in  comparison with the first quarter of last year, and by 27.4  percent in March in comparison with March last year. This,  indeed, is something which has not been seen since the beginning  of 1992. The slump hit 19.3 percent in the first quarter of  1993 as measured against the level of the first quarter of 1992.  <H5>  First Sales Crisis in 70 Years </H5>   However, it is not so much the quantitative as the  qualitative changes which are significant. You will recall that  the first wave of the slump was attributed largely to the  disruption of links with CEMA countries. Then the  disintegration of relations between USSR republics and the  regions of Russia began. Price deregulation revived interest in  the ruble, but 1992 hit industry with wholesale conversion in  the "defense sector." Today, all these things have moved either  into the past or onto the second stage.    According to data for January and February, only 6 percent  of  stoppages in industrial production can be attributed to  conversion, and around one-third to inadequate provision of  material resources. Lack of demand for products caused 58  percent of the losses in working time from stoppages in  production. Consumers are dissatisfied with either the price,  the range, or the quality of products, or with all of these  things taken together. In actual fact, the influence of the  sales factor is probably even greater because many enterprises,  instead of reorganizing production in line with market  requirements, are loading the very same commodity onto knowingly  insolvent consumers and then requesting state help in resolving  the problems of nonpayments. In fact, many "nonpayments" are  the result of the very same absence of a market.    This is a situation which our industry has not known for  around 70 years, since the days of the 1921-1924 sales crisis.  And now, as then, there is no sense in enterprises relying on  state help to solve this problem. The state can help some  enterprises at the expense of others, but it is powerless faced  with a crisis hitting virtually all of them. There is no other  option but for them to reduce their own expenditure and, in the  wake of this, prices, and to alter the range in line with  consumer aspirations.    For decades, our consumer has been compelled not to purchase  a commodity but to "take" whatever is "given." Under market  prices, this does not work. But if the thing the consumer needs  is put on offer -- then the money is found to purchase it. For  instance, production of trucks has fallen by slightly more than  two-thirds (in January-February in comparison with the same  period last year), while, according to the results of the first  quarter, production of cars dropped by 31 percent whereas bus  production hardly fell at all: The latter are needed by cities  which have lost the opportunity to acquire "Ikarus" buses for  hard currency. Virtually nobody would claim that our buses are  better in terms of technical standards than our trucks or cars  -- or that they are very cheap. But they are needed -- so  production is maintained. Likewise, UAZ vehicles are needed --  so the Ulyanovsk Automobile Plant is running, while the ZIL  [Likhachev Automobile Plant] and GAZ [Gorkiy Automobile Plant]  plants are at a standstill.  <H5>  Market Saturation Grows </H5>   Events taking place in connection with the consumer goods  market are even more vivid. Sales volumes for consumer goods in  the first quarter were 4 percent down on last year, while the  figure for March was 8 percent down. As for paid services, the  volume of these comprised just 49 percent in comparison with the  level for the first quarter of last year, and 22 percent in  comparison to the first quarter of 1991. The effective demand  of the population places a rigid limit on sales. How is the  market reacting to this?    First, the coefficient for commodity saturation of the  retail  network is rising (this coefficient expresses the correlation  between the number of cities where the commodity was on sale,  and the total number of cities being monitored, of which there  are 132). In the space of one year (February through February),  this coefficient rose from 57 to 82 in respect of foodstuffs,  and from 76 to 90 in respect of noncomestibles. In respect of  vegetable oil and sugar, this figure hit 100 in March.    Second, price rises are slowing down. Here is how the  indicators for the growth of the price index looked in the  period from October through March (expressed in percentages by  comparison with the previous month): 19, 17, 13, 21, 10, 9.  With the exception of the January upsurge, typical of the first  month of the year for a number of reasons, inflation is falling  steadily.    And so it is that despite talk about the various inscrutable  peculiarities of our market, general economic laws do operate in  Russia too. A drop in demand, an increase in reserves, a cut in  production, and a slowing down of inflation go hand in hand.  And the only way to overcome the crisis is persistent economic  compulsion for producers to overhaul the structure of production  in line with market requirements and to cut prices. Resisting  the pressure of sector lobby groups now, and refusing to return  to the path of spoon-feeding inefficient enterprises through the  state budget or preferential credits, means opening the way to  recovery for a sickly economy.    The objection inevitably arises: It is easy to say stand  firm, but how can this be done when there are so many poor  people all around, when a multitude of enterprises which are  undoubtedly vital to the country are on the brink of ruin?! In  part, the answer to this is provided by life itself. Yes, the  fight against inflation is inseparable from a "tight money"  policy. Even the moderately stringent financial restraints of  the past year led to a situation where pay increased more slowly  than prices, as a result of which the average real wage in the  first quarter was 4 percent down on last year, while in March  this figure was 3 percent down. But at the same time, the  population's disposable income (money left over after essential  payments), taking due account of the price index for the year,  rose by 10 percent. How can the average income rise while the  average wage drops? Purely at the expense of a second job, and  via additional earnings. The statistics confirm: The  proportion of the wages fund making up the total volume of  income fell from 65 percent to 59 percent, while that of  additional earnings has risen.    An evaluation of the social consequences of such a  development cannot be simple. People are earning more, but to  do this they have to work more. But this is better than abject  poverty. Meanwhile, there is a gradual healing of the most  painful social ulcer of the transition period: large-scale  deprivation. Last January, 35.5 percent of Russia's total  population were on incomes lower than the minimum wage, while in  December this figure was 26.7 percent, and in March this year --  17 percent. This is still an awful lot -- more than 25 million  people. But it is half as many as at the beginning of last  year. Last year, 13 percent of the population had incomes which  were not only lower than the minimum wage, but even lower than  the cost of the minimum food basket. In the last quarter, this  figure was 6 percent.  <H5>  Peasants Are Hindered by Russian Monopolism, Not Imports </H5>   Statistics for foreign economic relations reflect some very  interesting processes. Exports continue to rise slowly, but  imports are falling rapidly (although not as rapidly as last  year). As a result, the foreign trade surplus, which was highly  significant last year, is increasing. In the first quarter, the  excess of exports over imports hit $5.1 billion. Unfortunately,  the traditional raw materials imbalance in the structure of  exports increased even more. Exports of cars and equipment,  already negligible, declined even further.    However, a relatively new process is attracting attention:  Food imports are falling sharply. Grain imports in the last  quarter were 81 percent lower than a year earlier -- that is,  they fell by a factor of more than five. It is known that from  now on the state does not intend to import more grain -- all  that will remain will be imports at the discretion of  enterprises. Imports of raw sugar fell even more sharply -- by  92 percent, while those of refined sugar dropped by 49 percent,  freshly frozen meat by 53 percent, and butter by 8 percent.    Let us note: All this occurred before the government's  decision to introduce import tariffs on foreign food. So how  can one justify talk on the part of our agro-industrial lobby  about the influx of cheap food from abroad which is suffocating  national production? Yes, the country does have ample meat  supplies (incidentally, we have not heard such words for some 30  years). But is this the fault of the importers? Last year, meat  production fell by 7 percent, or 860,000 tonnes (in live  weight), and in the first quarter of this year it fell by 13  percent. Meanwhile, meat imports from abroad for the whole of  last year came to just 77,700 tonnes, while in the first quarter  of this year this figure was 10,700 tonnes. The entire volume  of imports is substantially lower than the scale of the slump in  national production. It is not imports which can be blamed for  low demand, but the expense, limited variety, and poor quality  of Russian food. Introducing import tariffs and finally  shutting out foreign competition will provide our  agro-industrial complex with an opportunity to increase prices  even further instead of lowering them -- and then demand will  fall even more markedly and the predicament of Russian peasants  will become even more difficult.    Clearly we have to help our producers not by freeing them  from competition from importers. They need to be provided with  good roads in order to convey products to the city, and a good  processing industry. They have to be set free of food industry  and trade monopolies, which, more than anything else, are  inflating prices. Incidentally, the peasants themselves are  doing just this. Even now, in conditions of a wretched  processing and trade infrastructure, they are reducing the sale  of goods to state procurement agencies and increasing sales at  markets, through their own trade network, through public  catering outlets, and via other channels.    There is no easy way out of the crisis. But if there is no  deviation from fulfilling the demands of the market, and if the  mindless structure of production derived from the "planned  economy" is painstakingly reworked into something more rational,  then it is possible to find a way out. But if there is a new  plunge into an inflationary spiral, there will be no increase in  production, as the experience of past inflationary upsurges has  shown, but rather the solution of all economic and social  problems will be put off even longer.    To try to withstand, to survive this most difficult and,  therefore, decisive period, and not to turn back -- this is a  worthy aim. Is it enough? It seems that the crisis in the  economy is approaching the state that the Americans call "the  bottom": there is no further to fall. But this by no means  signifies that a revival will begin tomorrow of its own accord.  It is possible to lie on the "bottom" in a state of stagnation  for a fairly long time. It is important not to miss that moment  when a kick-start is required, when an incentive to start  climbing is called for. A sensible reduction of taxes could  provide this incentive for the healthy, viable portion of our  industry. But only if it is not accompanied by an increase in  the budget deficit and, with it, accelerated inflation,  otherwise this will be an incentive not to heal but to intensify  the disease. This means that it is possible and expedient only  if state expenditure is cut to the same extent and at the same  time. All this is food for thought when completing the work now  under way on the budget for this year.</p>

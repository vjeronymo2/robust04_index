			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Markets: Saddam's ghost gives investors the shivers - Wall Street even though he is believed to be very much alive. Saddam's refusal to allow United Nations monitors to do their arms-finding job in Baghdad brought the possibility of a renewed US-led military attack on Iraq closer than it has been in the 18 months since the Gulf war ended. The thought that US forces in the Middle East might once again face combat sent a chill through the stock markets, contributing to the 30-point decline in the Dow Jones average on Wednesday and yesterday's early losses. A renewed conflict with Iraq - with all the resulting political and economic uncertainty for the world's financial markets - is the last thing US investors need. The domestic economic recovery continues to disappoint; second-quarter corporate earnings have been decidedly mixed; international equities are in a flux over higher German interest rates and concern about the global economic outlook; and President Bush still looks as if he could lose November's election. The markets cannot even draw comfort from the thought that another shooting match with Saddam might revive Bush's popularity at home. If anything, it probably would emphasise how the Gulf war, although successful in military terms, was an unfinished job. Just like the week before, US investors had a hard time this week coping with all the news swirling around them. In the past few years, Wall Street has developed a resilience in the face of big declines in foreign markets. The drawn-out crash in Japanese equities, for example, created barely a ripple in US markets. But that resilience is under severe stress and has shown its first sign of cracking. This week, Tokyo stocks fell to their lowest levels in six years and continental European bourses took consecutive tumbles, as did London. By the time trading in New York opened each day, US investors were in no mood to buy stocks. While each market was responding partly to domestic influences, the domino-like losses from Tokyo to New York were incurred against a background of deepening concern about the global economy. Investors everywhere are worried that the rise in German interest rates could stifle already-weak economic growth in Europe and the US. The fact that 11 of the world's central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, had to intervene in foreign exchange markets this week to prop up an ailing dollar only added to the mood of crisis. That is a word with which the bosses of US airlines must now be very familiar. After a vicious price war in late spring and early summer, all the major operators now are reaping the unhappy consequences of trying to boost sales with bargain basement offers. It was no surprise, therefore, when Delta, supposedly one of the most secure of the country's troubled carriers, unveiled a Dollars 265.4m second-quarter operating loss on Thursday. To compensate for low passenger-mile revenues, Delta is taking the knife to its cost base. The airline plans to cut its workforce by 4,000 (5 per cent of the total) and convert an unspecified number of full-time positions to part-time status. Another big carrier, USAir, also announced a sizeable second-quarter loss (Dollars 84.9m) and also blamed the red ink on the domestic fare wars. At least the struggling USAir, which is labouring with debts of more than Dollars 2bn, was thrown a lifeline on Tuesday in the form of a Dollars 750m investment by British Airways, which will take a 44 per cent stake. There was brighter news on the corporate front elsewhere. Bank profits continued to improve with Citicorp, Chase Manhattan, First Chicago and JP Morgan all posting sharply higher income. Salomon, meanwhile, proved that it has finally moved out from under the shadow of last year's bond trading scandal. It reported the highest three-monthly operating earnings ever recorded by a publicly-quoted US securities house. Salomon's stunning feat comes just three quarters after the company was laid low (and almost laid out) by the discovery that it had rigged Treasury auctions in 1990 and 1991 to bypass government rules. It was achieved partly by piggy-backing the steep yield curve to a big increase in interest income, and by recording a strong performance from its bonds and derivatives trading businesses. The outcome was a promising debut for the company's new chairman and former chief legal adviser, Robert Denham.  --------------------------------- Monday     3303.0  - 28.64 Tuesday    3308.41 +  5.41 Wednesday  3277.61 -  30.8 Thursday   3290.04 + 12.43 Friday     3285.71 -  4.33  ---------------------------------</p>

Ivan Rybkin got 233 votes during a so-called "rating vote"  on  Thursday which is far above the majority of the Duma. Yuriy  Vlasov, another conservative lawmaker, was second with 200 votes.    Rybkin's success should be attributed also to a  representative of the communist party, Valentin Kovalev, who  withdrew his candidacy in favour of Rybkin just before the vote.    The winner will be determined on Friday morning when the  deputies would elect one of the two lawmakers.</p>

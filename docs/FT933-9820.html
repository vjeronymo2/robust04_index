			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Fated to share the same cage: Ian Davidson examines the future of Franco-German relations after the humiliating shockwaves of recent days A week is a long time in politics; in the crisis which has hit the European Community's plans for monetary integration, it is an eternity. On Monday, it seemed the weekend monetary crisis had delivered a fatal reverse to the future of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and a damaging blow to Europe's pivotal relationship - between Germany and France. Today, the future looks less certain; even the present is unclear. Five days ago, most commentators agreed that the European Monetary System was in tatters, the programme for economic and monetary union had suffered a comprehensive defeat, and the Maastricht treaty was now void of economic credibility. Just as important was the political corollary: that the Bundesbank had inflicted a crushing humiliation on France. France's conservative newspaper, Le Figaro, described it as a 'shock-wave shaking Europe'. Germany's mass-circulation Bild newspaper crowed: 'Euro-money is stone dead - hurrah, the D-Mark is still there]' Mr Norman Lamont, Britain's former chancellor, said: 'This is the end of the ERM in all but name.' Today, it looks as though these judgments may need some qualification. It is clear that the foreign exchange crisis has debunked old ERM certainties. With bands of 15 per cent above or below the central parity, the ERM is a different beast from one with bands of 2 1/4 per cent. What we do not yet know is how European governments will manage their currency convergence in the months ahead. The market forces that broke the system assumed that, in a deepening recession, the French government could not long tolerate high interest rates. The past few days have suggested, however, that France may be prepared to resist the temptation of an early cut in rates. The result is the franc has not moved far from its old level against the D-Mark. Moreover, it appears that the Belgians want to revert to a narrow-band arrangement with the Germans. One surprising possibility, therefore, is that the pattern of European exchange rates, at least for a small group of inner-core countries, may strongly resemble the pre-crisis period. One reason why the French have not immediately cut their interest rates is that they need to rebuild their foreign reserves, badly depleted supporting the franc last week. The more important factor is that the government remains steadfast on its franc fort policy. In the build-up to the crisis, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur repeatedly pledged he would resign rather than devalue. This week, he insisted the value of the franc and its central rate in the EMS had been maintained - the implication being that it was policy to keep the franc near its old level. Before going on holiday on Thursday, Mr Balladur repeated that French economic policy objectives remained unchanged: namely, 'monetary stability, reduction of deficits, control of inflation and reduction of the tax burden'. French resistance to devaluation could put a new gloss on the medium-term outlook for the exchange rate mechanism. Last weekend the 12 EC members states declared that phase two of Emu would start on schedule on January 1. Phase two is the preparatory stage for monetary union during which the currencies of all countries wanting to join are confined to narrow bands in which the possibility of realign-ment is precluded for two years before they can join Emu. Most commentators wrote this off as whistling in the wind. They believe the new wide bands are a prelude to more currency uncertainty. But the German and French governments are adamant they are wrong. 'I am absolutely sure,' a senior German official said this week, 'that phase two of Emu will start on time. The franc will not go down and, if our economies pick up, it will be easier to reach the criteria for economic convergence. The new situation is, shall we say, more interesting; but the old time-table is still valid.' Mr Balladur, evidently, does not assume things will be quite so simple. 'A European monetary system must be rebuilt on new bases,' he said after last weekend's crisis meeting. 'This system must not be subject, like its predecessor, to repeated crises which are incompatible with the recovery of our economy.' The problem is that the fundamental tension in the system, between Germany and its EC partners, is unresolved. The Bundesbank is determined to squeeze domestic inflation induced by the costs of unification; but the resulting high interest rates force Bonn's partners to make an invidious choice between deflation and devaluation. Mr Balladur did not disguise his view this week that German monetary policy was to blame for the crisis. 'What is the reason for this speculation? It is certainly not in our economy. The cause of the speculation is the persistance of high interest rates in Germany.' Since it is the German economy which is out of step with the rest of Europe, the French had proposed that the D-Mark should temporarily leave the ERM. Indeed, Mr Balladur maintained this week that the Germans had been ready to go along with this solution. Some German officials have denied this, though Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, has appeared tacitly to admit it. He told a press conference in Bonn this week: 'Several countries said that having Germany as an anchor was vital, and that they intended to stick to this policy, for which they saw no alternative.' For the moment, Mr Balladur is sticking to his hard franc policy. But in the months ahead he will be squeezed between the January 1 deadline for phase two of Emu, and domestic demands for lower interest rates and faster economic growth. This pressure will be most intense among his supporters in the conservative Gaullist RPR party. On one hand, they fear for their prospects of winning the 1995 presidential election if the government does not deliver economic recovery and a fall in unemployment. On the other, many are hostile to the Maastricht treaty, and see the currency crisis as an opportunity to ditch the programme for monetary union. Even Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullists and the party's candidate for the 1995 poll, seems to be keeping his options open. On Monday he warmly endorsed government policy, but seemed to call for a more expansionary economic posture. It seems that the new wide-band regime in the ERM has given France, and the EC a breathing space, but hard choices still lie ahead. After the summer holidays, the French will have to test the options for lower interest rates; and the EC will have to decide whether it really can go into the next phase of Emu and, if so, on what terms. The fundamental question now is whether this currency crisis has cast a serious political shadow over prospects for European integration and, in particular, over relations between France and Germany. The programme for Emu, and the broader negotiations on the Maastricht treaty, like all recent initiatives in the EC, have been driven by the close co-operation between Paris and Bonn. But Emu could come to grief over the tension between German and French economic interests. Judged by the angry denunciations in French newspapers, Paris and Bonn would seem to be experiencing a serious political fallout. Even Mr Raymond Barre, the former conservative prime minister, went so far as to denounce the 'dogmatic attitude' of the Bundesbank. But most analysts discount talk of a political showdown. 'This probably won't cause any lasting damage,' according to Mr Pierre Jacquet of the French foreign policy institute, IFRI. 'In practice the crisis will produce a reaction of closer co-operation.' Mr Jacques Lecacheux of OFCE, the economic policy institute, argues France and Germany are, in fact, in close agreement on how to solve the crisis. Moreover, the partnership between France and Germany has been so close for so long that neither can easily imagine an alternative. This is partly a consequence of their shared history through three wars; it is also a reflection of their economic integration, in which each is the other's leading trading partner. There is, however, no doubt that Franco-German relations are not as close at the moment as they have sometimes been. Policy disagreements, such as that over the break-up of Yugoslavia, have left a nasty taste. And, if there is a real danger of lasting conflict, it is most likely to come over the the Uruguay Round of talks on trade liberalisation under the rubric of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs. According to a senior German official, the ERM crisis had 'absolutely not' caused any political damage. But he stressed that, in the trade field and over Gatt, there were real differences of philosophy. Yet most commentators believe the partnership will remain solid because there is no alternative. 'We must build a more confident Franco-German relationship than we have had in recent weeks,' declares Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand. 'We must never forget that the Franco-German understanding is the basis of Europe. To imagine other alliances is an illusion.'</p>

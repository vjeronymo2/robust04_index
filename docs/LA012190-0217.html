			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BRAVE NEW WORLD OF BEBE MILLER;  </P> <P> WITH AN EMPHASIS ON CONTEXT, THE BESSIE AWARD-WINNING CHOREOGRAPHER TAKES AN  UNUSUAL DEPARTURE FROM FORM IN HER LATEST WORK  </P> <P> No one has ever accused Bebe Miller of making dances that are too clear.  </P> <P> A two-time Bessie Award-winner, Miller is drawn to the colorful ambiguities of  psychology, and her dances have typically sketched the clarity (or confusion)  of her inner life rather than addressing themselves to any distinct narratives.  </P> <P> But now Miller, who danced with the neo-Tharpian Nina Weiner for six years  before diving into the radically minimalist work of choreographer Dana Reitz  for a year, seems to be cautiously edging her way towards greater social  consciousness in her work. Context -- social and political -- is becoming  increasingly important to her.  </P> <P> Miller's company appears at Royce Hall, UCLA, Friday and Saturday -- her second  local engagement in two years. The company also returns to San Diego on Feb. 2  and 3, performing in the Educational Cultural Complex, sponsored by Sushi  Gallery. Among the pieces scheduled: "Rain," a solo that recently surprised  audiences in New York with what seemed obvious symbolism -- colors that added  up to nothing less than the African liberation flag (red, black, green).  </P> <P> A lithe, black women with layers of dreadlocks, Miller wore a gown of crimson  velvet and danced on a large patch of farm-fresh green sod. To anyone who had  followed the choreographer's recent work, it seemed an unusual departure.  </P> <P> Oddly, the 39-year-old Miller, a native New Yorker who went to college in  Indiana and then to Ohio State for her graduate dance degree, claims she was  unaware of the symbolism until she first performed the piece. "The red and  green were quite conscious color decisions," she says, "but the red, green and  black?  </P> <P> "It wasn't till I had done it a few times that I realized it. I was dealing  with textures more than colors: The opulence of velvet -- so rich, so  imperialistic -- versus the depth and necessity of earth, soil, grass.  </P> <P> "I can't dissociate myself from a Third World point of view, because it's me.  But the piece is much more than just a Marcus Garvey piece -- although,  interestingly enough, I am making a Marcus Garvey wall-hanging as we speak.  While there is some of that in there, it's limiting because  </P> <P> the piece is really about this particular black woman's return to earth.  </P> <P> "And not just this particular woman. I mean, I was thinking about the globe as  a whole more than about me finding my roots. It's more of a prayer or a shout  for more people than me to say, 'C'mon folks, roll in the grass!' "  </P> <P> Instead of showing couples engaged in physical metaphors of hand-to-hand combat  as in "The Hell Dances," Miller has recently started making dances that show  the inner workings of different social interactions, as in her new group work  "Allies," in which Nikki Castro, one of the six dancers in the piece, appears  to have been given unique power over the rest -- who then scatter away like  greased marbles.  </P> <P> "After 'The Hell Dances,' I thought we would kill each other," Miller says with  an exhausted sigh. "Emotionally, there was a  </P> <P> sense that we were co-existing in a way that I couldn't see anything brighter  happening. And maybe nothing brighter does happen. It may have been a  dead-end."  </P> <P> I felt, 'OK: We have man and we have woman, and they don't get along. But we do  get along; I think we figured it out. And that's part of what 'Allies' is  about. The world does continue. For some reason it seems there are more subtle  reasons why we get along than why we really fight.  </P> <P> "But it's really elusive. It's survival but it's different than the sense of  surviving over your opponent. Why are they opponents at all? After all, we do  take walks in the park together."  </P> <P> With "Allies" (which she calls her glasnost piece), Miller feels she has  finally found a way to expand the mechanics of her psychology out to the world.  "Allies" is a real "turf piece," she says. "It's like looking at an active  social mechanism from a number of different sides. . . . Everyone realizes that  the continuity of a group depends on its inner balance, maybe even a reliance  on each other, even though it's not necessarily a comfortable place. If 'The  Hell Dances' were about a sense of antagonism and drama, there's a sense in  'Allies' of the greater good and the continuing of the social whole."  </P> <P> However, for all the changes in Miller's choreography, she still hesitates to  leap into a world of direct symbolism. "Rain" came about, she says, "because I  realized that all the intellectual exertion of 'Allies' wasn't the answer I  thought it would be. It was a surface, front-brained approach.  </P> <P> "There's a sequence of events from 'The Hell Dances,' where we see the other,  to 'Allies,' where we can see a plurality of others, to 'Rain,' which sort of  goes back underground and says forget all that stuff: The answer is that there  is an unknown that we can tap into.  </P> <P> " 'Rain' isn't only a black piece. So many choreographers prefer for their work  to be referred to as black dance done by black choreographers about black  subjects. And, although that wasn't the case for me for a long time, it's sort  of changing now because people keep asking me about it, so a point is already  being made. But in recognition of that point, my work can be used to expand on  the genre and expand the reactions to it.  </P> <P> "What's implied is going back to self. You're not left with the fact of  blackness but the fact of me. And I think that has to do with where I'm going,  and I might be going there because of my blackness and my femaleness. But it's  a place everybody can go to."  </P></p>

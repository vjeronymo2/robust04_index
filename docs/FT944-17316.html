			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: The day, not the date I understand that shares in Rosehaugh plc were suspended about 18 months ago but my inspector seems unable to agree a date on which they become negligible value. For indexation of capital gains loss, it is important that they be so declared before November 1993. Have you any information? Your letter is based upon a misapprehension: it is irrelevant, for indexation loss purposes, whether 'they be so declared before November (30) 1993'. It is the day on which your negligible-value claim is made that is important. If it is made after November 29 1993 but before April 6 1995, indexation-loss relief will be due (up to the Pounds 10,000 limit for 1993-94 and 1994-95 together) either statutorily, if you make a statutory claim under section 24(2) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, or extra-statutorily, if you make a claim under extra-statutory concession D28 (Asset of negligible value) as revised on May 31 this year. Ask your tax office for a copy of D28, which should help to clarify the position. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> REBOUND ON WALL STREET;  </P> <P> DISCOUNT BROKER;  </P> <P> SCHWAB &amp; CO., STUNG IN 1987, HAD CRISIS PLAN READY FOR FALL OF 1989  </P> <P> Randall N. Kirk, manager of the downtown Los Angeles branch of Charles Schwab  &amp; Co., rolled into the office at 4:30 a.m. Monday to prepare for the  onslaught.  </P> <P> He was still sleepy. But memories persisted of an October Monday two years ago,  when a flood of panicked investors overloaded phone lines at Schwab and other  brokerages in the Wall Street selloff that would become Black Monday.  </P> <P> Some investors later charged Schwab with botching, delaying or failing to  complete stock transactions; others, mostly individuals, said they simply  couldn't get through.  </P> <P> Stung by the snafus, Schwab made major changes, such as extending hours and  adding phone lines, for the next time that trading volumes exploded. That time  came Monday, the first market day since an unsettling 190-point drop Friday in  the Dow Jones industrial average.  </P> <P> Kirk and other Schwab employees nationwide arrived an hour earlier than usual.  By 5 a.m., Kirk's office was staffed. By 6 a.m., switchboards were turned on,  and the flood of calls began.  </P> <P> By the close of trading Monday, the 110 offices of the country's largest  discount brokerage firm had fielded more than 45,000 transactions,  overshadowing Friday's heavy volume of 20,000 transactions and more than four  times the normal volume, said Schwab spokesman Mark Thompson in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Unlike 1987, the brokerage took things in stride, investors and Schwab  officials said.  </P> <P> Telephone calls to several Southern California Schwab offices were answered by  machine but were picked up in less than a minute by a Schwab employee.  </P> <P> "I haven't had any transactions with them, (but) I did call them a few times  (Monday) morning, and I got quick service as far as getting a few quotes," said  investor David Schettini of La Crescenta, who was watching the ticker tape at  Schwab's downtown office.  </P> <P> Schwab was one of several brokerages that anticipated heavy volume and took  steps to avoid 1987-style customer complaints. On Monday, Fidelity Investments  ran full-page newspaper ads saying "Fidelity is ready for your call."  </P> <P> After 1987, Schwab doubled its computer links with major exchanges to avoid  trading bottlenecks, Thompson said.  </P> <P> More important, Schwab now requires about 90% of its 2,000 branch employees to  have broker's licenses, compared to 60% to 70% in 1987, Thompson said. Now,  almost any employee -- even those in support functions -- can take orders in an  emergency.  </P> <P> Schwab also opened a call overflow center, to which calls could be bumped from  swamped local offices, and added phone lines for investors using touch-tone  phones to obtain quotes or make trades directly.  </P> <P> And the brokerage extended its hours. After Friday's unexpected drop, Schwab  opened all of its branches on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. In addition,  employees came to work Sunday to prepare for Monday's expected deluge.  Nationally, Schwab took about 18,000 calls over the weekend, more than three  times the normal weekend load on its 24-hour telephone hot lines.  </P> <P> Today, Schwab was scheduled to open an hour earlier, as well. It will decide  whether to extend hours through the week depending on market conditions.  </P> <P> Monday, the mood at Schwab's offices was quite different from that in 1987.  "Two years ago at this time, the momentum just kept getting stronger and  stronger as the day went on . . . and there was a lot of panic," a Century City  Schwab broker recalled. But this time, "We're not seeing the panic at this time  that we saw two years ago," the broker said.  </P> <P> In the downtown office, the activity was constant but subdued. No one took much  time to lunch on the delivered pizza that grew cold, but Kirk was relaxed  enough to chat for a few minutes with a couple of visitors just before the  market's close.  </P> <P> One investor even regretted the relative ease with which he transacted business  Friday. It took only about five minutes for a Bellflower resident to reach a  broker and sell his shares -- at a $3,000 loss.  </P> <P> "They were good, and I wish I hadn't gotten through now," he said.  </P></p>

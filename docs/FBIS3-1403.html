			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pierre Claasen] </F>   [Text] Cape Town March 27 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] will escalate its rolling mass action until it  has attained its demand for free political activity in  Natal/kwaZulu, ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa said on  Sunday.    Furthermore, he told a media briefing in Cape Town, the  Natal  issue would be taken up by the management committee of the  Transitional Executive Council (TEC) on Monday.    He welcomed political initiatives which he said had been  started with a meeting between President F W de Klerk and ANC  President Nelson Mandela this week and which had continued with  Mr de Klerk meeting kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi  at the weekend.    Political initiatives, however, were not enough. Security  forces had to be deployed to protect people from roving bands of  armed killers, he urged. "As the ANC we will insist that  security forces protect the lives of our people and guarantee  that elections take place. The ANC has also embarked on rolling  mass action to ensure that we get our demands for free political  activity. This will escalate unless Chief Buthelezi and the  government agree that our people will be given the political  space, and agrees with the TEC to ensure free and fair elections  are held."    He said all homeland governments would cease to exist on  April 27 and that whoever was a chief minister or minister would  lose his position on April 27 when the new constitution came  into operation. "Chief Buthelezi will cease to be chief minister  but what happens between now and then is a moot question.  Clearly we expect the kwaZulu government to co-operate in  holding free and fair elections."    The TEC would discuss the IEC's [Independent Electoral  Council] report on the kwaZulu situation and would need to  reflect on the position put forward.</p>

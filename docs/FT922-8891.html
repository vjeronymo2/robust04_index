			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / EBRD brings banks into east European lending THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has for the first time brought in commercial banks as participants on one of its loans to an eastern European borrower. The Dollars 60m (Pounds 33m) loan, to Polska Telefonia Komorkowa, a Polish joint venture set up last year to build and operate a cellular telephone network in Poland, marks the EBRD's first success in promoting an eastern European borrower on the international public loans market, an important development in its aim of attracting private capital for the region. The bank - which is looking at several more potential loans - says its priority is to concentrate on financing joint ventures with western European partners at first, although it hopes to encourage indigenous corporate borrowers to tap the international loans market eventually. This year, the bank expects to lend Ecu1bn (Pounds 700m) to eastern European ventures, although it stresses its aim is 'to mobilise additional capital' from commercial banks rather than merely put up its own funds. 'Our strategy is to lend to commercial projects in countries where commercial banks are reluctant to lend,' said Ms Noreen Doyle, the recently-appointed head of syndications at the EBRD. She said the EBRD wants to do project-linked loans and longer-term financings, although she warned that lending for certain projects could be hampered by the fact that many of the eastern European countries lack the necessary legal framework to satisfy commercial bankers. 'Project financing requires an infrastructure which doesn't exist' in many of these countries, she said. The EBRD signed its Dollars 60m seven-year loan agreement with the Polish telephone venture PTK last November, and it has now syndicated Dollars 20m of the deal to four European banks - Credit Lyonnais, BNP and Societe Generale of France and Internationale Nederlanden Bank (formerly NMB Postbank). The EBRD is conferring its 'preferred creditor status' on the deal in order to encourage the commercial banks to participate. This means that if there is insufficient cash to pay all creditors, the preferred creditors come first. Ms Doyle stressed that without the participation of the EBRD in the deal, the four commercial banks would probably not have lent. Normally French banks must make provisions against loans to the eastern European and Commonwealth of Independent States, but with the EBRD as a lender, the banks will be exempt from this condition. PTK is a joint venture between the Polish telecommunications network operator, France Telecom Mobiles International (a subsidiary of the French national telephone company), and Ameritech International of the US.</p>

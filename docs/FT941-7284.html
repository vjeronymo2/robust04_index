			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Private finance Public spending outstrips the willingness of taxpayers to fund it in most countries of the OECD. Yet there remains considerable demand for greater investment in infrastructure such as roads, railways and river crossings. Public services are also denied funds for desirable capital projects. Demographic trends mean that such pressures are likely to increase. A shrinking band of people of working age will have to finance public services, while demand for those services rises from the growing band of those who have retired. The idea of meeting needs for public services and infrastructure through private sector investment is proving attractive in many countries. This week's decision by the UK Labour party to explore the private financing of public projects is therefore welcome. A party that promises better public services needs to explain how it will fund them in an era when the taxpayer demands more for less. Harnessing private sector capital and management expertise may be one way of achieving that. If Labour's initiative is to be convincing, however, the party will need to reconsider its policy of clamping down on the private sector in the National Health Service. Despite this inconsistency, Labour's conversion has succeeded in discomfiting the Conservative government whose private finance initiative, launched in November 1992, has yet to show any real progress. A list of projects issued by the Treasury as evidence of its success is heavily larded with proposals that have yet to get off the drawing board. The accompanying brochure is consequently filled with artists' impressions rather than pictures of holes in the ground. The absence of progress has created a mood of cynicism among those who might build or finance infrastructure projects. An attempt to sell the government's initiative to the City at the Mansion House on Tuesday encountered deep scepticism. As Sir Alastair Morton, the businessman brought in last November to push the initiative forward, observed, a lot of businesses have spent a lot of money on proposals and so far have very little to show for it. One reason for this is that there is still not a clear understanding in Whitehall of the level of risk that the private sector will assume in joint projects. Another is that there are too few incentives for civil servants to approve them. The search for a perfect formula means that the best has become the enemy of the good. One way to shift the logjam would be to set targets for involving the private sector in areas of public expenditure where the greatest contribution could be made. Broadcasters, for example, are already required to use independent producers for 25 per cent of their output. The Social Market Foundation, an independent thinktank, recently proposed similar targets for organisations financing public services. The proposal has merit.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ELECTRONIC SENSOR SYSTEM PLANNED;  </P> <P> DUTCH CONSIDER HI TECH TO EASE TRAFFIC  </P> <P> It's 8:30 a.m., and traffic is bumper to bumper on this eight-lane  Amsterdam-area highway. A few yards away, commuter trains pass every 10  minutes.  </P> <P> The government wants to unclog the roads to improve the economy. But  environmentalists worry about the ecosystem, and motorists worry about their  freedom.  </P> <P> Included in the 20-year plan to upgrade mass transit and build more highways is  a plan to plant electronic sensors that would track motorists at rush hour and  periodically bill them for their use of the highways.  </P> <P> Traffic jams cost the Dutch economy an estimated $350 million a year in the  68-mile urban crescent that stretches from Rotterdam to Amsterdam to Utrecht in  the central Netherlands.  </P> <P> The $15.5 billion transport plan, which must be approved by Parliament,  reflects government concern that a faltering transportation system could  irreversibly damage the Netherlands' position as Europe's major port of entry  via Rotterdam.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Time, Production Delays  </P> <P> Transport Minister Neelie Smit-Kroes says a 30% growth in highway traffic in  the last five years has cost about $1.75 billion in lost working time and  production delays.  </P> <P> The government forecasts that its car-curbing measures would lead to a slower  growth of traffic -- 55% more in 2010 instead of 70%.  </P> <P> Environmentalists welcome mass transit improvements. But they contend that they  will be neutralized by a highway expansion that could harm the already fragile  ecosystem of this tiny nation of 14.6 million living in an area the size of  Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island combined.  </P> <P> "It's been shown time and again that improved roads attract more traffic, which  in turn necessitates more roads -- it's a vicious circle," says Willem-Jan van  Grondelle of the Dutch Nature and Environment Foundation.  </P> <P> "To counter the colossal environmental problems ahead," he says, "the use of  private cars must be drastically cut."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Influential Environmental Group  </P> <P> Van Grondelle's privately-financed organization is the nation's most  influential environmental research group.  </P> <P> On the other hand, a spokesman for the Dutch motorists' lobby, Henk Langeweg,  says his group, with 2 million members, opposes the plan because it "limits our  constituency in what it prizes most -- its liberty."  </P> <P> This is a car-oriented culture, with its 5 million private automobiles that  provide freedom of movement in this crowded nation.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Transport Minister Smit-Kroes says that in the  Rotterdam-Amsterdam area -- an urban conglomerate of 3.5 million people -- five  new highway tunnels would be dug under major waterways.  </P> <P> In addition, about 620 miles of existing highways would be widened to increase  their capacity about 40% and the electronic sensors would be installed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Road Pricing' System  </P> <P> The system known as "road pricing" is still in development. But it has already  stirred considerable controversy because of it would be a means of registering  the movements of a citizenry traditionally sensitive to any potential  infringement of its liberties.  </P> <P> Despite the huge scope of the government's gridlock remedy, both the automobile  lobbyists and the environmentalists see little chance of ending the Dutch  driver's love for the open road.  </P> <P> "Huge traffic jams will be part of life here for quite a while," says Langeweg.  "Especially since most of the Dutch will only leave their car home on pain of  death."  </P></p>

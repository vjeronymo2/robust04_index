			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Caribbean troops arrive in Haiti Caribbean troops and a group of returning Haitian refugees arrived in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince yesterday, which suggests that the US military believes it is in full control just 10 days before the scheduled return of exiled President Jean Bertrand Aristide. The 262 Caricom troops from Jamaica, Trinidad, Belize and Barbados will be in charge of security at the port in the capital. This has become a vital task as humanitarian aid begins to pour in now that US troops have set up distribution networks. Some 492 refugees arrived from the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. A total of 14,000 refugees remain outside Haiti, but US officials expect 500 a day to arrive should the country remain calm. Political tensions have been partly defused by a virtual breakdown in the Haitian police force now that its leader, Lt Col Michel Francois, has fled to the Dominican Republic. Police officers were completely absent from Haitian streets yesterday, remaining at their headquarters even while sporadic looting took place across the street from the US embassy. US soldiers have worked with Haitians in recent days to locate the homes of suspected army auxiliaries, who terrorised the population with their harsh crackdown against supporters of Mr Aristide. But with thousands of weapons still reported to be in the hands of pro-regime auxiliaries and other extremists and some Haitians thirsting for revenge, the potential for violence remains high. Parliament yesterday continued to debate the granting of a general amnesty, a condition for de facto leader Lt Gen Raoul Cedras to step down, but appeared unable to arrive at a consensus.</p>

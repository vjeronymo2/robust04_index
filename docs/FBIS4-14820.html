			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Tallinn, Apr 04, BNS -- The next round of  intergovernmental talks between Estonia and Russia is to be held  near Moscow on Tuesday [5 April] and Wednesday.    Ago Tiiman, secretary of the Estonian delegation for the  talks, in his comments to BNS today said the new round was to  deal with the four traditional series of topics -- humanitarian,  economic, military and border issues -- and that no substantial  changes were expected when compared to the previous rounds.    Also to be discussed is the issue of taking out nuclear fuel  from two reactors located at a Russian naval base in the  Estonian small town of Paldiski. It is possible that a  technical protocol on the issue will be signed, after which work  on taking out the fuel from the two reactors can begin, Tiiman  added.    The main obstacle on the way to progress in the talks is the  issue of retired Russian army officers, who Russia wants must be  granted guarantees that they will get permanent residence  permits in Estonia.    Estonia's chief negotiator for the talks, Vaino Reinart,  told  BNS the main controversy between the two sides in the talks was  that Russia wants to fix the categories of persons who will  start applying for residence permits in Estonia, whereas Estonia  insists that the circle of these persons is not to be  established in the agreement. Estonia says the document should  just establish the rules under which the retired officers will  receive their pensions and pay for medical services in Estonia.  [passage omitted]</p>

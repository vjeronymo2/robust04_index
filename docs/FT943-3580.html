			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / International Company News: Telstra turns in record ADollars 1.7bn Telstra, the state-owned Australian telecommunications group which is known as Telecom in its own country, made a profit of ADollars 1.7bn (USDollars 1.3bn) in the year to end-June, a sharp increase on the ADollars 904.8m of the previous 12 months, and a record for any Australian corporation. Revenues were 5.6 per cent higher at ADollars 13.4bn. Part of the improvement was due to a reduction in abnormal items - down to ADollars 277.4m from almost ADollars 500m, and a fall in interest charges to ADollars 748m from ADollars 921m a year ago. However, Telstra also said that earnings before interest and tax had increased by 13.2 per cent, in spite of increasing competition as the Australian telecommunications market is opened up and Telstra's monopoly dismantled. The return on equity, before abnormals, was 18.3 per cent, 'in line with other successful world telecommunications companies'. In spite of the figures, Mr Frank Blount, Telstra's American chief executive, made clear that he expected competition to intensify and indicated that the group - much criticised in the past for its poor service levels - had further to go in reaching the highest international standards. 'We are not there yet, and we cannot afford to relax for a moment,' he said. He declined to be drawn on the debate about the possible privatisation of Telstra. 'It's a matter for the shareholder,' he said, noting that the federal government has said that such a move 'is not on the agenda in the term of this government'. However, Mr Blount said he welcomed last week's final break-up of the 'PMT' consortium - the alliance of Telecom, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Mr Kerry Packer  -which was formed to pursue pay-TV opportunities in Australia. This freed Telstra to pursue other alliances, he indicated. 'We're talking to other programming and content people and services providers. We have discussions going with at two or three parties in Australia and some that are not in Australia,' he said.</p>

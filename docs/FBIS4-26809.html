			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 26 (XINHUA) -- A loudspeaker truck  driven by a member of an illegal ultra-rightist group hit the  front door of the office building of the ASAHI SHIMBUN newspaper  in Osaka on Saturday [25 June], causing no casualty, local media  reported today.    The truck smashed the windows of the front door of the  building after hitting it twice. The driver, a member of a  local illegal ultra-rightist group, was arrested by police for  "object destruction offenses."    A lot of Japanese ultra-rightist groups, including the one  involved this time, are connected with organized criminal groups  and other violence groups.    This is the fourth time for ASAHI SHIMBUN to be attacked by  ultra-rightist groups since April 1, when two of its staff  members were taken hostage by members of a Tokyo ultra-rightist  group in the newspaper's headquarters in Tokyo.    On April 21, the newspaper's Osaka office building was  attacked by an ultra-rightist loudspeaker truck smashing its way  into the building.    On April 25, the building was attacked with firebombs by  ultra-rights.</p>

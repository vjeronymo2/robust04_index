			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Food: New York greets a dab hand with fish - Nicholas Lander meets expat Englishman Richard Lord, a true fan of all things piscine WHEN New Yorkers finally appreciate the pleasures of eating fresh fish, and when most of the world's 28,000 different species of fish are classified for their taste as well as their bone structure, a big vote of thanks will be due to Englishman Richard Lord and his encounter with an article in the Financial Times. Lord, now 33, recalls the occasion. Driving on holiday to Cornwall - parents in the front, children, bored, in the back - Lord handed his son an article on aquaculture telling him flippantly that it might provide him with a future. Lord junior was hooked. At school he did a field project on aquaculture and spent his summer holidays working on a trout farm. When his mother, Shirley Lord, moved to America to work, Lord turned his attention to the waters off Alaska and then enrolled on the fisheries programme at Humboldt State University in northern California. He confesses to not having been the university's best student but Lord's enthusiasm and love of fish, as well as a phenomenal memory for fish minutiae, may prove even more valuable. During the two hours I spent listening to him, the facts never stopped. Did I know that there are 385 species of grouper? That the butterfish, particularly prized among the West Indian community, passes through three colour phases in its life (from red to yellow to brown), or that the male parrot fish is an hermaphrodite? Lord knows the answers because, after leaving California, he moved to New York and became information officer for the Fulton Fish Market, New York's biggest and oldest. He worked with importers and wholesalers, with the Chinese, Koreans and Japanese who buy for their shops and restaurants, and with those of Indian, Spanish and South American origin who buy fish in a big way to eat at home. Wholesalers would acknowledge his expertise and come to him with unusual fish. Only the salary, Dollars 13,000 (Pounds 6,800) per annum, brought this enjoyable episode to a close. Lord is now hoping to produce an encyclopedia of seafood. He has catalogued and eaten more than 1,000 species of fish. Any unusual specimen quickly finds its way into his apartment where he photographs it, fillets it, examines its bones, analyses its skin and texture and finally cooks and eats it. Lord hands the skeleton on to the manager of the fish collection at the American Museum of Natural History. No part of any fish is wasted. Being in New York has been a great advantage, says Lord. The city's cosmopolitan nature, high standard of living and its citizens' willingness to pay high prices for top quality fish have made his work interesting. So, too, has New York's geographical position. Whereas the top fish markets of Europe - Paris, Madrid and London - draw stock from Mediterranean and Atlantic waters and increasingly from those around Africa, New York draws its fish from Canada, the Pacific and from South America. Tuna from Ecuador, black grouper from Venezuela, long fin pomfret from the coast of Florida and mahe mahe from Hawaii are now as common as cod, halibut or Dover sole to Lord. Lord hopes to broaden his knowledge so that he can bring buyers and sellers of fish together from Europe and America and pursue a writing career for trade magazines. With his eye for detail he should succeed. As we shared a taxi downtown he spotted a van, delivering fish to a New York restaurant. Within seconds his pen and notebook were out taking their details.</p>

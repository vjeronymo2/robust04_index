			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEMBERSHIP ANGRY AT NRA FOR LOSING VOTE ON GUN BAN  </P> <P> The National Rifle Assn., stung by an unexpected Senate vote to limit the sale  of assault weapons, received hundreds of calls Thursday from outraged members  demanding to know how a lobbying group legendary for its political prowess lost  on such an important issue.  </P> <P> "Our main reaction has been to try and calm our membership," NRA spokesman Dave  Conover said. "It's one thing to rant and rave to us, and another thing to  write their senators and to express their displeasure over voting the wrong way  on this issue. That's what we're telling them to do."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, gun-control advocates celebrated the Senate vote as proof of the gun  lobby's receding influence. They said that senators formerly faithful to the  NRA have issued their declaration of independence from what critics  characterize as the NRA's strong-arm tactics.  </P> <P> The Senate action could improve the prospects for passing other gun-control  bills, they noted.  </P> <P> "This was the worst legislative loss they've ever suffered," said Susan  Whitmore, a spokesman for Handgun Control Inc., a gun-control advocacy group.  "I think this vote shows that (members of Congress are) less afraid of the gun  lobby than they used to be."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, both gun-control advocates and opponents cited the presence of a  relatively new lobbying group -- a coalition of the nation's police chiefs and  sheriffs -- as the driving force behind the Senate's 50-49 vote banning 14  military-style firearms.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials, concerned about the proliferation of the lethal  weapons among drug dealers and other criminals, pressed the senators to vote  for the ban. Equally important, the police officials promised to defend  lawmakers who voted for the ban against any attempt by the NRA to inflict  political revenge.  </P> <P> "We're tired of passing out flags to the widows of officers killed by drug  dealers with Uzis," said Col. Leonard Supenski, a Baltimore County Police  bureau chief.  </P> <P> Supenski, a spokesman for the Major City Chiefs of Police and the Police  Executives Research Forum, national organizations composed of law enforcement  executives, said one of the groups' primary purposes is to assure supportive  lawmakers of protection from the NRA. "We sent a clear message to the  congressional people that we will support them," he said.  </P> <P> "The police were all over the Hill," Tom Korologos of Timmons &amp; Co., a  public relations firm that represents the NRA, conceded. "When you get the  local sheriff and the local chief of police from your district calling on your  guy, you've got a problem. They know these people and don't think of them as  gun-control nuts, plus they can come out and campaign for them in their  districts."  </P> <P> Conover said that the NRA miscounted the Senate vote because some "six or seven  senators voted against their very firm commitments on the issue." Those  senators -- mostly rural and Southern -- were swayed by the appeals from police  officials, he said.  </P> <P> "In a contest between the perceived needs of the law enforcement community on  the one hand and the perceived needs of the target shooters and hunters on the  other hand, we can't win that fight," Conover said.  </P> <P> Jim Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, was equally blunt: "We never expected to  lose. We knew it would be close, but we didn't expect it to be that close."  </P> <P> But Baker attempted to downplay the significance of the vote. "I wouldn't say  it was our biggest defeat," he said. "The 20,000 state and local gun laws on  the books are bigger defeats."  </P> <P> He noted also that the Senate ban on assault guns is only a part of a larger  omnibus crime bill sponsored by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.). The Senate  has deferred a final vote on the crime package until after it returns from its  Memorial Day recess.  </P> <P> "The Biden bill hasn't passed yet," Baker said, vowing to fight the issue all  the way to the White House if necessary. "There's a long way to go yet."  </P> <P> The military-style firearms subject to the proposed ban approved Wednesday by  the Senate are: Norinco, Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs  (all models); Action Arms Israeli Military Industries UZI and Galil; Beretta  AR-70 (SC-70); Colt AR-15 and CAR-15; Fabrique Nationale FN/FAL, FN/LAR and  FNC; MAC 10 and MAC 11; Steyr AUG; INTRATEC TEC-9, and Street Sweeper and  Striker 12.  </P> <P> Although it surprised many people on both sides of the issue, the Senate vote  extended a recent string of setbacks for the NRA.  </P> <P> In the last three years, Congress has voted to ban both armor-piercing  "cop-killer" bullets and plastic handguns, which would be difficult to detect  with X-rays.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, California, New Jersey and Maryland have enacted laws limiting the  sale and possession of some firearms. In each of those cases, the NRA has been  an outspoken advocate and financial backer for the losing side.  </P> <P> NRA executives said Thursday that the organization's membership of about 2.8  million has remained static over the last five years as the public debate has  shifted away from the NRA's strict interpretation of Americans' constitutional  right to bear arms.  </P> <P> "The NRA doesn't carry as much weight anymore because they've gone over the  edge," said Nancy Coffey, a spokesman for Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio),  who was targeted by the gun lobby as its "No. 1 foe" during his 1988 reelection  campaign.  </P> <P> "They have subscribed to the camel's-nose-under-the-tent theory on guns for so  long, it has become a hysterical view," Coffey said. "Many Americans are  deciding it's just a ridiculous position."  </P> <P> But Coffey said that does not mean the NRA has been fatally wounded. "They're  still a formidable foe," she said.  </P> <P> On that point, NRA officers and their opponents share common ground. Between  fielding calls from members, NRA leaders were busy Thursday planning strategy  for future elections.  </P> <P> "Gun groups are springing up today all over the West," Korologos said. "It  might not be all bad to have had this happen. The fence-sitters are going to  wake up."  </P> <P> Added Conover: "Do gun owners feel betrayed? The answer is most definitely yes,  and we've been hearing it all day long. Gun owners are going to make their  opinions known."  </P></p>

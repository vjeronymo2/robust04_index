			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Arbed tumbles to LFr6bn ARBED, the Luxembourg -based steel group, yesterday announced a sharp drop in net profits to LFr6bn (Dollars 175m) last year, the halving of its dividend to LFr100, and the prospect of worse to come. Confirming the cyclical nature of the steel business, Arbed said the drop in its net profit, after three good years including a 1990 profit of LFr9.8bn, was due to falling prices, under the pressure of imports, particularly from eastern Europe. The group said that finished steel prices had fallen, even in current francs, below the level of 1984. At the turn of this year, the European Community removed its quotas on steel imports, which under newly negotiated association agreements with central Europe can enter freely from Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. At the same time, Gatt talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement and a subsidies code were stalled. At current levels, prices were too low to make a profit on the majority of its steel products, Arbed said. As a result, turnover fell 5 per cent to LFr198bn. Its total steel production last year stayed steady, decreasing by only 0.7 per cent from 1990 levels. With higher sales of wire products in Brazil, Arbed was able to compensate slightly for static or falling output in Europe. The group invested a record LFr18.3bn, an increase of 67 per cent over 1990 levels.</p>

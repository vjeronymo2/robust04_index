			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / OECD Economic Outlook: Debate on 'zero inflation' reopens The battle against inflation is proceeding well - but governments now need to gear up for the next stage of the campaign. With inflation forecast to remain at low levels across the industrialised world, it is time to clarify the longer term inflation goals, says the OECD, writes Gillian Tett. Part of the problem stems from the monetary authorities' own success, it says. In the past, most governments have assumed that their goal was to achieve 'low inflation', often implicitly defined at around 2 per cent. But inflation is now running near this level in many countries, and is forecast to remain stable over the rest of this year before rising slightly in 1995. As a result, the question of whether governments should be aiming lower for 'zero inflation', has re-entered the policy arena, the report says. Supporters of this zero target, the OECD points out, claim that this would 'provide a clear, easily communicated goal'. However, the OECD suggests that a 'zero' goal is dogged by problems. Governments which announce a zero goal run the risk of looking overly ambitious and losing market credibility. Indeed, once inflation falls to these very low levels, there may be problems assessing the target number itself - consumer price indices in the US and Canada in particular become more ambiguous once inflation falls below 3 per cent. As a result, the OECD concludes that most governments will continue to aim for above zero targets - although it warns that 'a good deal of judgment is required as to what they might imply in numerical terms'.</p>

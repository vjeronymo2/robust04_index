			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The Eighth Standing Committee Session of the  Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress concluded in Hefei  this afternoon.    The session adopted a resolution on convening the Second  Session of the Eighth Anhui Provincial People's Congress,  "Regulations of Anhui Province for Handling Land Ownership  Disputes," "Regulations of Anhui Province on Protection of  Minors" and approved personnel appointments and removals.    Meng Fulin, chairman of the Provincial People's Congress  Standing Committee, spoke at the concluding session. He said:  The year 1994 is a year for deepening reform, promoting  development, and advancing the socialist market economy,  socialist democracy, and socialist spiritual civilization in an  all-around way. The new situation and new tasks set forth new  demands on the people's congress. For this reason, the standing  committees of people's congresses at all levels must devote more  efforts to studies. They should conscientiously study Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, the decision adopted by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, new reform measures  announced by the Central Government, knowledge about market  economics, the Constitution, laws, and regulations so that they  will have a better understanding of the basic policy of the  Central Committee and the overall task of the whole party and  whole nation for this year, a better understanding of the  relations between reform and opening to the outside world, and  economic development and social stability -- the three promote  one another and form a single entity. Efforts should be made to  promote socialist democracy, speed up the drafting of economic  laws, conduct publicity and education on the laws and  regulations with redoubled efforts, step up supervision over law  enforcement, and use laws to guide, advance, and guarantee the  smooth progress of reform and construction. We must support  and take an active part in reform and construction. The  people's congress must make economic construction the focus of  its work and subordinate itself and serve the overall task of  the whole party and the whole nation so as to advance the great  cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.    The session was presided over by Shao Ming, vice chairman of  the provincial people's congress Standing Committee. Present at  the meeting were Vice Chairmen Liu Guangcai, Lu Shengdao, Wu  Changqi, Lu Zixiu, Jiang Zehui, Chen Jiyu and Secretary General  Lu Desheng. Present as observers were Deputy Governor Yang  Duoliang; Han Yunping, president of the provincial Higher  People's Court; Liu Sheng, chief procurator of the Provincial  People's Procuratorate; chairmen of some city and county  people's congresses standing committees, and officials of the  People's congress's liaison committees in the prefectures.</p>

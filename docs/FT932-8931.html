			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / International Company News: Icahn offers Dollars 1.18bn for E-II MR CARL ICAHN, the financier and former greenmailer, yesterday stepped up the battle over the E-II Holdings, telling directors of the bankrupt holding company - which takes in Samsonite luggage, Culligan water softener and McGregor clothing - that he was prepared to pay Dollars 1.18bn in cash for its assets. The response from the company, however, was cautious. 'Earlier this afternoon the board of directors of E-II Holdings received a new proposal from Carl Icahn, concerning E-II's emergence from Chapter 11,' it commented. 'The proposal has been forwarded to the E-II creditors' committee and our attorneys. We will be happy to comment after they have had the opportunity to fully examine the proposal.' Mr Icahn's letter to the board suggested that he was prepared to acquire all E-II's assets and liabilities other than the senior subordinated notes and junior debentures for the cash payment. It added that the offer was not subject to finance being obtained, and claimed that ACF Industries, his major operating company, had 'more than enough' capital to consummate the deal. The tussle over E-II has been continuing since last summer. The company  - once run by Meshulam Riklis, husband of Pia Zadora - filed for Chapter 11 protection in July, after a 'bondholder revolt' led by Mr Icahn scuttled restructuring plans. Mr Icahn owns almost 32 per cent of the group's junior bonds. The company, however, has presented its own reorganisation plan, which has been backed by both management and the creditors' committee. Voting on the plan closed earlier this week, although the result is not yet known. A court hearing is set for May 24. The plan is also supported by rival deal-maker, Mr Leon Black, whose company  -Apollo Advisers - speaks for 24 per cent of the senior bonds and 27 per cent of the junior bonds.</p>

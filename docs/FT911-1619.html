			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar resumes its advance THE DOLLAR gained support from the German Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's council meeting, but trading was nervous ahead of today's US employment data for April. The market expects a rise in the unemployment rate to 7.0 from 6.8 per cent, although most analysts are looking for a smaller fall in non-farm payrolls than the March drop of 206,000. If these figures prove correct, with payrolls falling about 170,000, it will leave the market waiting for further evidence of economic recovery and for indications that lower interest rates are having a beneficial impact. In subdued trading the dollar rose to DM1.7240 from DM1.7060; to Y138.05 from Y137.55; to SFr1.4590 from SFr1.4445; and to FFr5.8325 from FFr5.7725. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index climbed to 66.2 from 65.5. Sterling lost ground to the dollar, but improved against its partners in the European exchange rate mechanism. The pound was weak on Wednesday, when most European centres were closed for the May Day holiday, but it picked up yesterday to finish fourth strongest in the ERM, according to figures from the European Commission. Trading was cautious ahead of the local government election results in England and Wales. Dealers expected the Conservative party to perform relatively badly in the elections, but it was not clear whether this would have a detrimental effect on sterling. The results are likely to have an influence on the timing of the next general election, and if the ruling Conservatives lose ground at the local level it will not encourage Mr John Major, the prime minister, to hold an early general election. This will reduce some of the political risk surrounding sterling in the short term, even though a bad result for the government reduces its options in the timing of the next election, which must be held by the middle of next year. Sterling fell 80 points to Dollars 1.7165 and eased to Y237.00 from Y237.25, but rose to DM2.9600 from DM2.9425; to FFr10.0125 from FFr9.9550; and to SFr2.5050 from SFr2.4900. Its index lost 0.2 to 91.4. In New York the pound regained 27 points to end at Dollars 1.7192. The D-Mark showed mixed changes after the Bundesbank council refrained from tightening its monetary stance. The economic and political situation in Germany and the Soviet Union continued to weigh on the currency, but there was little real expectation of higher German rates yesterday. In terms of the yen the D-Mark slipped to Y80.05 from Y80.60, but it rose to L741.00 from L738.10 against the Italian currency at the Milan fixing. The Bank of Italy sold Dollars 27m as the dollar was fixed higher. In Paris the D-Mark firmed to FFr3.3852 from FFr3.3775 at the fixing. The French franc remained the weakest member of the ERM and the Spanish peseta stayed the strongest currency in the system.</p>

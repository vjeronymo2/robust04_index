			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Shake-up of professions urged BRITAIN'S professions should be scrutinised for restrictive practices by the Office of Fair Trading, according to Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum, the cross-party think-tank. Mr Mather yesterday told the Royal Institute of British Architects that professions such as doctors and lawyers had escaped the reforming zeal of Thatcherism. They lagged behind other businesses, the utilities and public-sector organisations in the quality of service they gave to their customers, he said. 'Many professions have failed to stamp out wildly misleading underestimates of likely charges, dilatory approaches to work, and a detachment from their customers' priorities, timetables and commercial constraints,' he added. Their restrictive practices should be reviewed and dealt with, he said.</p>

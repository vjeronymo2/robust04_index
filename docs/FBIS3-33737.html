Their mood contrasted with the earlier heady prediction of  PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat that a deal would be signed "very soon"  on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank town of Jericho and  the Gaza Strip.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa had also said all major  problems had been settled and an accord could be concluded  within 10 days as a followup to the broad autonomy agreement  signed in September.    But PLO officials said later that the Israelis had gone back  on issues they thought were resolved. "Nothing is settled.  There is no agreement," said one senior official, who asked not  to be named.    They said that 'Arafat would have a third meeting Sunday  night with Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who is due to  leave for the United States in the early morning hours of Monday.    The discussions began Saturday with three major points  outstanding: manning of international border crossings, the  size of the Jericho autonomous area and the security of Jewish  settlers.    Musa said the two sides agreed on the deployment of Israeli  border guards, who would keep a discreet presence at frontier  posts.    But Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said there  was no agreement on the size of the Jericho autonomous area and  there was no word on the question of security for the settlers.</p>

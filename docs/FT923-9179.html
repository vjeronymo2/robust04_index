			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Maddox makes Pounds 10m computer services buy MADDOX, the network and cable group run by Mr Hugo Biermann, has acquired Wakebourne Group Holdings, a specialist computer services company, for Pounds 10m. The acquisition is being financed by a Pounds 16.5m placing of new shares at 8p each. Mr Biermann, the South African-born entrepreneur, who sold the mini-conglomerate Thomson T-Line to Ladbrokes for Pounds 186m in 1989, said the acquisition took Maddox into the top end of the market in cabling and network sys-tems. Maddox, which first acquired its listing in March, has two main businesses, Cables and Flexibles, a UK distributor which Mr Biermann bought back from Ladbrokes last year, and Seacoast Electrical Corporation in the US. The Wakebourne acquisition is part of the group's strategy to expand its UK businesses. Further bolt-on acquisitions in the range of Pounds 200,000 to Pounds 4m are expected over the next six months. Wakebourne, which specialises in connecting different computer systems together, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m for the year ended May 31 1991. Mr Biermann said the number of corporate users of computer systems had been growing. Wakebourne's Pounds 3.5m debt will be paid off by the placing of new shares which has more than doubled Maddox's total number of shareholders. 'Raising money in a recession means that you have to talk to many more institutions that in the good years', Mr Biermann said. Maddox talked to 80 institutions, 20 of which decided to take up the new shares. Shareholders who wish to take part in the placing will be offered 81 new shares for every 88 existing shares. Maddox's shares were yesterday relisted, closing at 8p, after being suspended on June 29 at 8 3/4 p soon after Mr Biermann disclosed that he was close to making the acquisition.</p>

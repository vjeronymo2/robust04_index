			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IDEA IS IN THE BAG  </P> <P> Regarding the issue of paper vs. plastic shopping bags, I would suggest neither  ("Big Bear Packages a Worthy Concept," Oct. 29). European shoppers generally  bring along their own shopping bags, which are usually made of a lightweight  see-through nylon netting. The bags fold up into a small wad in pocket or  purse. This practice has got to save the stores a bundle. Perhaps some  enterprising company could give away such bags free to shoppers with their  logo, and stores might give some coupons to shoppers who bring their own bags  as an added incentive.  </P> <P> GENE BURKARD  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Christmas comes late at L Ashley MR JIM Maxmin, the effusive American chief executive of the Laura Ashley frocks and fabrics group, was in generous mood yesterday as he toured the company's stores handing over big cheques to his staff. Some employees in London received as much as Pounds 1,800 as a bonus for their work over a three-month period from October to December. This unaccustomed fit of generosity by a hard-pressed retailer in the middle of a recession was part of the company's Profit Improvement Plan launched last year with the purpose of 'incentivising' the staff at 10 underperforming stores. Mr Maxmin had promised the staff at these stores they could share any profits uplift they managed to generate. Each store devised its own promotional strategy and these efforts resulted in some impressive improvements. The highlights were in Liverpool where profits were more than doubled and at London's Marble Arch branch where they climbed by 62 per cent. Mr Maxmin has engendered a fair degree of scepticism in the City because of his somewhat eccentric approach. But he defended himself yesterday: 'A lot of people thought that we were mad. But we did it and made it work.' . . . Now for Laura Ashley's other 500 outlets.</p>

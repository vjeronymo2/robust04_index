			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 10 (XINHUA) -- More than 140 million  yuan will be spent this year to upgrade the telecommunications  facilities in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.    Local officials said that the autonomous region is to  construct another 200 telecom projects this year to help promote  local economic growth.    Among the 200 projects are two national projects -- the  Inner  Mongolian section of the Beijing-Shenyang-Harbin optical fiber  line and of the Beijing-Hohhot-Yinchuan-Lanzhou optical fiber  line -- and a few long distance telephone lines.    According to the development plan, 17,470 long distance  automatic terminals, three times that of 1993, and another 2,000  long distance telephone lines will be added to the existing long  distance network. That will help all counties and banners of the  autonomous region to reach the target of long distance direct  dialing.    In addition, some 300,000 lines of intra-city telephone  exchanges will be installed this year and 80 rural telephone  automatic exchange systems will be added.    Last year, automatic long distance telephone services were  installed in 100 counties and banners on the grasslands.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / MP charged over tax refund fraud Public prosecutors yesterday indicted Mr Tadao Otani, a Diet member, and charged him with helping supporters obtain tax refunds by falsifying receipts. Mr Otani recently resigned from the Japan Renewal party, second biggest grouping in the government coalition. Until now, investigators have focused on local politicians and the business community. Mr Otani is the first Diet member to be indicted during the present anti-corruption effort. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, senior economist at Morgan Stanley in Japan, said: 'This shows the continuing willingness of the government to tackle corruption. It's unusual for a Diet member to be indicted, but Mr Otani is a little fish, not a big one.' Mr Otani, now an independent member of the House of Representatives, is alleged to have conspired with his former political secretary, Mr Susumu Ochiai. In January, Mr Ochiai admitted offering supporters receipts for political donations in excess of amounts given. Under present electoral rules individuals can receive tax breaks on donations of more than Y10,000 to political groups; the 72 supporters were said to have been able to claim the inflated amounts, worth Y55m (Pounds 341,614). The offences are alleged to have occurred between 1990 and 1992.</p>

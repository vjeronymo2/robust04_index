			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / UK Company News: Union Intl back into black with Pounds 32.5m THE elimination of Union International's loss-making businesses through disposal and reorganisation helped turn a pre-tax loss of Pounds 102.3m into pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.5m after exceptionals for the year ended December 31. During the last year the group sold many of its non-core activities, including the Australian pastoral land and cattle herd and its meatworks business, for about Pounds 80m. However, as reported in February, preference shareholders will have to wait for any dividend until after the refinancing schedule is met at the end of December 1994. A tight control of operational costs and a substantial reduction in central group overheads was mainly responsible for an increase in operating profits from Pounds 3.1m to Pounds 44.9m on reduced sales of Pounds 1bn (Pounds 1.3bn). The UK division made profits before exceptionals and interest of Pounds 8.3m compared to a loss of Pounds 25.9m. The Dewhurst butcher suppliers were reduced from 1,200 to 200, and for the first time in a number of years the meat chain made a profit. Property in the UK traded at a reduced loss and made sales of Pounds 30m, which included the disposal of the Dewhurst retail units. Union's Australia and New Zealand businesses increased profits from Pounds 7.7m to Pounds 29.6m. The division sold its pastoral and meatworks operations and made a number of property disposals. Profits from the Far East rose from Pounds 636,000 to Pounds 4m on the back of Union's own branded products of meat and canned product. Turnover in this area has shown an increase of 24 per cent and profits a 71 per cent rise over the past two years. Mr Terry Robinson, chief executive, said: 'Considerable emphasis is now being placed on the importance of and value of the group's brands.' Europe, excluding the UK, turned a Pounds 947,000 loss into a profit of Pounds 1.3m. The only weak spot was South America and the West Indies which saw profits almost half from Pounds 32.5m to Pounds 16.5m. A net cash inflow of Pounds 96.1m compared with a cash outflow of Pounds 5.9m.</p>

Market makers in securities argued that if they were forced to buy a large block of shares from an institution and the information became available to the market immediately, their competitors would be able to mark the price down, possibly forcing them to sell the shares at a loss. The solution agreed yesterday was broadly what had been expected by several large financial service houses in the UK.

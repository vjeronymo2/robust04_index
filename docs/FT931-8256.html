			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bank may buy Spanish state ferry BANCO Central Hispano-americano (BCH), one of Spain's biggest commercial banks, is understood to be negotiating to buy the bulk of the Spanish state's 95 per cent stake in the Transmediterranea ferry company. The government had wanted to include Transmediterranea in a slew of part privatisations this year. The company has returned to profit in the past two years. Talks are said to centre on BCH taking about 60 per cent of the company. This would cost the bank about Pta85bn (Dollars 726m), based on the price of the 5 per cent of the company that trades in the Spanish markets. Spain's financial futures exchange, the Barcelona-based MEFF, said it would start trading its first individual share options on February 25, Reuter reports from Madrid. It will start with Telefonica Espanola and Endesa options, which have been running in simulated trading since February 2, and hopes to add Repsol and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya shortly.</p>

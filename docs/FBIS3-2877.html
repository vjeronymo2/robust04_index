On the same day, three of the 1989 pro-democracy movement  leaders, including Wang Dan [3769 0030] and Zhou Duo [0719  5305], suddenly left Beijing and their current whereabouts  remain unknown.    Before the departure of U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  from the United States, U.S. officials had hinted that he would  possibly meet Chinese dissidents during his visit, despite the  fact that during his journey he had openly stated that he would  not meet dissidents. The fact that the Chinese public security  authorities took action against dissidents yesterday shows that  the authorities are not "taking any risks." According to some  foreign reports, it is not known whether or not the departure of  Wang Dan and others from Beijing is by design of the  authorities. However, their choice to leave Beijing before  Christopher officially began his visit might avoid becoming  entangled with the public securities authorities which would  most likely happen. Surprisingly, a foreign dispatch quoted  Wang Dan and others calling on the U.S. Government to continue  to prolong MFN status for China, before they left Beijing.    Wang Fuchen is the fifteenth dissident that has been  detained  over the past week whereas Yang Zhou has been detained twice  over the past weeks. According to Wang Fuchen's family, when he  returned home yesterday morning, he was immediately taken away  by some public security men: "They said they were taking Wang  to stay in a guest house for several days."    The 39-year-old Wang Fuchen, an individual household, was  given a sentence of 3-year imprisonment for participating in the  1978 Democracy Wall Campaign. He is currently secretary-general  of the Shanghai Human Rights Association.    Yang Zhou, one of the signatories of the "Peace Charter,"  had  talked about Wang Fuchen being detained with this reporter over  the phone before he himself was apprehended, saying: "They hold  Wan Fuchen in custody as a warning sign. If Wang was lucky, he  would be detained for 24 hours; otherwise, they might detain him  till after the conclusion of the NPC."    Shortly after, he was taken away from his home by a public  security man. Yang Zhou's wife said that the public security  man did not provide an explanation on why he took Yang away, nor  did he disclose when Yang would be released.    As to the three pro-democracy movement figures who left  Beijing, they are: Wang Dan, the student leader of the 1989  student movement who sent the NPC and CPPCC an open letter only  two days before; Zhou Duo, one of the last batch to withdraw  from Tiananmen during the 4 June incident; and Min Qi [7044  3823], a scholar.    This reporter phoned Wang Dan's family yesterday evening to  inquire after him. His mother said that she knew nothing about  Wang Dan's departure from Beijing; Wang Dan had "left home" when  his family members were all at work and he had not said goodbye  to his family, nor had he made any telephone calls. They  learned about his departure through one of his friends who was  with Wang Dan. According to his mother, Wang Dan had left home  without saying goodbye and she was worried about it. However,  she reckoned that Wang Dan would make contact with the family in  a few days time.    According to his cousin, Wang Dan suddenly decided to leave  Beijing by taking a train heading south yesterday morning.  Accompanying him were two of his friends, Zhou Duo and Min Qi.  His cousin said that Wang Dan left Beijing at around 0900 and  that Wang did not explain anything to him because Wang was in a  hurry; However, Wang did say that he would return to Beijing  after a week or so. His cousin was worried as to whether or not  he would be able to return to Beijing a week later.    A foreign dispatch quoted Zhou Duo: "In view of the present  situation, we are leaving Beijing for a few days on our own. We  strongly appeal to the U.S. Government to continue to grant  China MFN status."    It is still hard to tell whether or not the departure of the  three was genuinely voluntary. Earlier, the public security  authorities demanded that Wang Dan leave Beijing but he refused.  However, within 10 days, Wang Dan has already been detained  twice fro a short time for interrogation and the public security  men had warned him to end all his political activities or else  he would face heavy penalties.</p>

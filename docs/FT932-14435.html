			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Letter: EBRD - a meaningless comparison of estimates and the need for broader remit Sir, The major failing of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in the ex-Soviet Union and eastern Europe was not discussed in your article ('Spending at the European Bank', April 13). It relates to the rules, approved by its founder governments, that 60 per cent of the loans go to private-sector projects and 40 per cent to the public sector. Private sector loans/equity investments are in effect only being made by the EBRD to bankable projects with a substantial export component and with a western joint venture partner. However, western investors do not want to invest because the risks are too high and few east European enterprises have so far been privatised. In essence there are too few good projects to fund. To be successful, the bank needs to be able to fund smaller projects run by state-owned enterprises meeting local as well as export needs. It needs to be pro-active to be able to fund feasibility studies and then bring in one or several western joint venture partners to manage and restructure the operation.

Gershuni and his  associates in relation to subsensory reactions provided the  first proof that the problem of unconscious perception in human  psychology, specifically the problem of unconsciously perceived  audio signals, may be resolved successfully by the natural  science route by means of experimental physiological research.  Gershuni's research in the area of humans' bioelectric and  autonomic reactions to unconsciously perceived audio stimulation  began in 1942 and ceased in 1950. During that relatively brief  period, Gershuni developed the concept of the subsensory zone of  human consciousness, i.e., that region of the unconscious state  within whose confines stimuli not consciously perceived by a  person can affect that person's mental and physiological  functions. One of Gershuni's associates, A.M. Maruseva, made the  interesting discovery that the intensity of audio stimulation  sufficient for conscious perception by a person decreases by 10  dB upon repeated exposure to a given stimulant while that same  person's cutaneogalvanic reaction and eye movements in response  to the said stimulant will remain unchanged. Gershuni's research  on various autonomic and bioelectric reactions to audio stimuli  led him to the conclusion that the suppression of alpha-rhythm  to sounds of different strength and simultaneously recorded  cutaneogalvanic reactions are both components of an orientation  reflex. Gershuni's thinking regarding the existence of a  cortical electrical component of the orientation reflex and the  concept of a multicomponent orientation reflex as a centrally  integrated reaction has since been confirmed by others and has  proved to be a very productive concept in the study of  subsensory reactions. Gershuni identified two types of  subsensory reactions. The first, either autonomic or  bioelectric, is induced by trauma or hysteria (i.e., by brain  pathology) and is manifested as a steady decrease in the  excitability of the structures of a given sensory system. The  second is observed under conditions of the normal activity of  the human central nervous system. Research conducted by Gershuni  and his associates during World War II established that patients  suffering from closed craniocerebral trauma manifested a  cutaneogalvanic response to audio stimuli that were 30-40 dB  below the audibility threshold. The size of the subsensory zone  of one and the same patient has since been shown to fluctuate  from 0 to 50 dB from day to day depending on that patient's  clinical condition: The subsensory zone becomes bigger as a  patient's emotional state deteriorates. Gershuni's work on  subsensory reactions has been used by others, including I.S.  Beritashvili, to explain the nervous mechanisms of blind  people's spatial orientation. Beritashvili's work provided  additional confirmation of Gershuni's notion that during  pathological states of the central nervous system, the number of  external stimuli that are not consciously perceived by a person  but that induce various autonomic, bioelectric, and motor  reactions increase significantly. Another important contribution  of Gershuni and his associates was the idea (which he confirmed  through laboratory studies) that the simultaneous effect of a  set of stimulants on the sense organs creates conditions  favorable to the formation of subsensory conditioned reactions.  Gershuni's work in the area of the physiological mechanisms of  unconscious psychic phenomena in man was abruptly halted in the  early 1950s by what has since been termed the ``Pavlov'' joint  session of the two academies. His work was only rebegun and  continued 20 years later, but by different teams of researchers.  One continuation of Gershuni's work has been in the form of  studies of the effect of photostimulation on the audio stimulus  detection threshold of healthy persons, patients suffering from  the consequences of craniocerebral trauma, and individuals with  emotionally labile personalities. Other areas that Gershuni's  work has been taken up are that of the link between focused  attention and the fixing of information in the long-term memory  and the effect of unconsciously perceived words associated with  negative emotional experiences. Perhaps Gershuni's most  important hypothesis was that the levels of organization of  nervous activity required for conditioned reflex responses and  perceptions are not identical (albeit close to one another) and  that perception requires a higher degree of organization of  nervous processes than simple conditioned reflexes do.

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: Today's Television Eldorado (BBC 1, 7.00) already seems to have been running forever, getting through plot lines with the profligacy of a Sun King. If, like me, you have wondered why so many Brits are clustered together on the Costa del Sol, there is hard evidence in Coast of Dreams (Channel 4, 9.00) which follows some real ex-pats who have forsaken the UK for a living in Spain. Among them is Mike, once a joiner in Southend, who now works 16-hour shifts preparing 200 roast beef dinners for British tourists. This is the real face of Eldorado. It is 23 years since the Rolling Stones' totally spaced-out guitarist Brian Jones was drowned, and Mick Jagger mourned him by wearing a dress and reciting Shelley's Adonais in front of the thousands in Hyde Park. Film of the event features in Mojo Working (Channel 4, 11.15). Earlier on BBC2 and Radio 3 at 7.30, the oldest orchestra in Russia, the St Petersburg Philharmonic, plays romantic music at the Proms - Berlioz, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky. In Business (Radio 4 at 8.45) examines the impact of the recession on three companies and asks 'experts' how long the agony will continue.</p>

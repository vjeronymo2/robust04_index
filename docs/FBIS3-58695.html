In an interview with ZDF today, Woerner  said "what we want is a greater Europe, if you will, a lasting  Euro-Atlantic community with the Russians so that they do not  have the feeling of being excluded or even encircled."    Woerner defended the concept of Partnership for Peace with  the countries of Central and East Europe that was approved at  the NATO summit in Brussels, and pointed out that consultations  were envisaged in the event of a crisis. Even though there were  no security guarantees for these countries as yet, this did not  mean "that we will stand idly by if they are attacked."    As for NATO's attitude to the Bosnia conflict, Woerner said,  with regard to possible air strikes in Bosnia, the alliance  depended on the approval of the United Nations. The opinion of  UN troops on the ground also had to be heard. However, he had  the impression that there was "much greater determination" in  the alliance: "Things cannot stay the way they are."</p>

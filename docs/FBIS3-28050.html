The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: Comrade Kim  Chong-il is glorifying our party's chuche idea as a great  guidance idea of the independent age [chaju sidaeui widaehan  chido sasang] by carrying out ideological and theoretical  activities with extraordinary ability and energy.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the great successor  and  leader [yongdoja] of the chuche revolutionary cause, has  completely systemized the respected and beloved leader Comrade  Kim Il-song's revolutionary idea based on the chuche ideological  and theoretical method and generally elucidated anew its  historical position, nature, and content, thus deepening and  developing it into a unique revolutionary guidance idea of our  times, the independent age.    The importance of the ideological and theoretical  achievements by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who has  deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he  generally systemized the chuche idea and completed aspects  worthy of the revolutionary guidance idea of the independent age  and fulfilled its lofty duty. The dear comrade leader first  explained the philosophical view of the world scientifically in  a human-oriented way, so that he made the chuche idea a complete  revolutionary doctrine that elucidates the way to pioneer man's  destiny.    An essential characteristic of the chuche idea lies in the  fact that it is based on the new, human-oriented philosophical  view of the world. From the chuche viewpoint that the primary  aim of the view of the world is to elucidate the way to pioneer  man's destiny, the dear comrade leader stipulated that the  explanation of man's position in the world and man's role in the  world changes and development is the primary question the  philosophical view of the world should solve.    He also scientifically explained that independence,  creativity, and consciousness belong to man's basic character.  Based on this, he elucidated the new, human-oriented  philosophical principle that man reacts to the environment  independently, creatively, and consciously on purpose; occupies  the master's position in the material world; and plays a  decisive role in developing the material world.    As the dear comrade leader completely explained the  human-oriented philosophical principle, the chuche [words  indistinct], it has been clearly revealed that man's position  and role has become higher and greater in the world because of  man's independent and creative activities and that the world  becomes more man-centered and comes to serve man all the more.  The dear comrade leader also embodied the chuche philosophical  principle in the area of social history, so that he elucidated  anew the popular mass-centered principle of social history and  prepared theoretical grounds that have great significance in  developing overall social sciences.    While appreciating positive aspects and significance of the  past materialistic opinion on history, the dear comrade leader  explained its limit in history and gave a scientific explanation  on the general principle of social development.    The dear comrade leader declared it as a basic principle of  social development that man's position and role in nature and  society has become higher and greater according to the  development of man's independent ideas, consciousness, and  creative ability. As the dear comrade leader discovered the  basic principle of social development, it has become clear that  advanced capitalist countries cannot reform the old social  system in a revolutionary way -- although they have high  production capability -- because they are behind in remolding  man, who is in charge of reforming society.    It has also become clear that socialism has been frustrated  in some countries mainly because they did not promote remolding  man in a revolutionary way in conformity with the new socialist  system so that people could not fulfill their responsibility and  role as masters of socialist society.    Our party's strategic policy on occupying both material and  ideological fortresses of socialism, communism, and on giving  priority to occupying the ideological fortress has invincible  vitality, and so does the general line of socialist construction  on vigorously carrying out the three revolutions -- ideological,  technological, and cultural -- while enhancing the function and  role of the people's power. This is because they are embodying  the chuche principle of social development.    For the first time in history, the dear comrade leader has  elucidated that mankind, a social being, has a sociopolitical  life -- different from the quality of physical life -- and that  individuals will only obtain the valuable sociopolitical life if  they are members of the collective, the main body of  sociopolitical life. This occupies an important position in his  achievements that have deepened and developed the chuche idea.    In this way, the dear comrade leader -- who has expounded an  original ideology and theory on the sociopolitical life and  opened a new epoch for establishing the chuche-oriented view of  life -- has elucidated the truth that for the social collective  to become a sociopolitical organism, it must be organically  merged with a center, a central organization. He has also newly  and scientifically explained the basic doctrine that will merge  this organism into the position and role that the leader  [suryong], the party, and the masses would occupy within the  sociopolitical organism.    As a result, he has put the chuche-oriented revolutionary  view of the leader [suryong], the view of organization, the view  of the mass, and the view of morality on a profound ideological  and theoretical foundation. He has made an historic  contribution to creating the chuche-oriented view of life, which  pursues a rewarding and happy life in glorifying the  sociopolitical life by participating in the revolutionary  struggles befitting the master under the leadership of the party  and the leader [suryong].    What is important in the immortal ideological and  theoretical  achievements gained by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who  has deepened and developed the great chuche idea, is that he has  newly developed and enriched the chuche revolutionary theory and  the leadership method based on the philosophical doctrine of the  chuche idea in conformity with the demands of the current times.    Based on his scientific explanation of the basic  characteristics of modern imperialism, the dear comrade leader  has newly established theories, strategies, and tactics capable  of victoriously leading the socialist and communist cause.  Also, he has elucidated that imperialists, who fought each  other in the past, have entered a new stage of further  strengthening exploitation and suppression of the world's  people, thus conspiring with each other today.    In this way, the dear comrade leader has fully analyzed the  reactionary or antipeople characteristics of modern imperialism  -- which is different from that of the past. Based on this, he  has expounded a new strategy to win victory in the independent  cause, the socialist, and the communist cause.    By internationally conspiring with each other, the  imperialist powers have strengthened exploitation and  suppression of the people. As a result, the world has been  further divided into two poles in which the rich get ever richer  and the poor get ever poorer. Also, the social and class  foundation capable of burying capitalism has been further  expanded and strengthened.    We can successfully effect an upturn of converting  capitalism into socialism only if we strengthen revolutionary  and independent chuche under such circumstances, thus alerting  the masses of their independent and ideological consciousness  and politically uniting them with each other.    In explaining the current changed class structures in a  capitalist society, the dear comrade leader has developed a  ideological and theoretical guideline for making the working  popular masses conscious of and organized into the socialist  ideology -- the revolutionary ideology of the working class --  by overcoming all descriptions of right and left deviations. As  a result, he has elucidated a way to develop the revolutionary  struggle for socialism onto a new higher stage.    The dear comrade leader originally expounded a new  party-building theory that the working class party should be  strengthened and its leadership role should be raised in order  to revolutionize and win over the broad working popular masses  in conformity with the class composition of a society that  changes as it develops. He has fully expounded principles and  plans to strengthen the party, while defining the enhancement of  the party's leadership role as a lifeline for guaranteeing the  victory of the revolution and construction.    Based on the chuche idea centered upon mankind, the dear  comrade leader has put forward, for the first time in history of  the building of the working class party, a new principle that  the work with man is a basis of the party's work and has  presented a combination of the party's monolithic leadership and  line as the basic principles of party activity. As a result, he  has elucidated a way to follow correctly the party's leadership  for the popular masses.    As shown by historical experiences, we can win victory in  the  revolution and construction only when we firmly fortify the  driving force of the revolution and raise its role. To firmly  strengthen the driving force of the revolution and raise its  role, we must, above all, strengthen the party and its  leadership role. This is the solid truth.    Truly, the dear comrade leader has deepened and developed  the  chuche idea and gained a great achievement, which will shine  forever in history, in enriching its treasure house by  energetically conducting ideological and theoretical activity  without sleep or rest.    The chuche idea, which the great leader [suryong] has sown  its seed in the soil of our nation and fostered for a long time,  has been greatly advanced and enriched by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Thanks to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's ideological  and theoretical activity, the chuche idea has been developed  into the authorized guide of the independent era of our time and  has vigorously led the hundreds of millions of the people  throughout the world to the single road of independence by  griping their hearts.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE FREEWAY LEAGUE;  </P> <P> DIVISION VI;  </P> <P> LUCZAJ, READY TO BUILD, WANTS PAST TO BE HISTORY AT BUENA PARK  </P> <P> Martin Luczaj knows what to do with the artifacts of a losing football program  -- relegate them to the dumpster of history.  </P> <P> "We don't talk about the past," Luczaj said from his office at Buena Park High  School. "We don't deal with the past. We've tried to change anything that we  possibly, humanly, know how and that's what we do."  </P> <P> At Buena Park, where Luczaj is attempting to right his second Freeway League  football program in 10 years, there's a lot of negative history to bury. The  Coyotes last qualified for the playoffs in 1981. Until last season, they hadn't  won a league game since 1983.  </P> <P> As he did in 1981 during his first year at Fullerton High, Luczaj has attempted  to wipe away reminders of the past.  </P> <P> Needless to say, there's no talk of the 28 consecutive league losses, a  six-season streak that ended last year. The white helmets of years past have  been replaced by green ones and new jerseys have been acquired. Luczaj enlisted  the players to clear out and wash the weight room "from the roof to the floor"  so it could be re-painted.  </P> <P> It's all a part of Luczaj's psychological sales job -- trying to convince  players at a school with little football tradition that they can be successful.  </P> <P> The last time Luczaj took over a struggling Freeway League football program, he  led Fullerton to the league championship in 1981, but it might not go so  smoothly the second time around.  </P> <P> For one thing, Luczaj isn't the unknown sophomore team coach he was when he  took over at Fullerton. Luczaj may have been out of Freeway League football  since he resigned at Fullerton after the 1986 season, but his reputation as a  resuscitator of football programs is still strong.  </P> <P> For another, with the players the Coyotes have returning, Buena Park doesn't  figure to challenge the consensus favorites -- Sunny Hills and Troy.  </P> <P> Last season, Sunny Hills didn't lose a game until it met the eventual Division  VI champion, Corona del Mar, in the semifinals of the playoffs. And the Lancers  likely will be strong again despite losing all-division running back Brian  Pizula, who gained 1,226 yards and scored 19 touchdowns during the regular  season, and the bulk of their offensive line.  </P> <P> Ken Overby, who gained more than six yards per carry last season, and Mike  Sullivan, who gained more than eight per carry as a wingback, should pick up  the slack for the Sunny Hills running game.  </P> <P> This may be the season Troy, which has qualified for the playoffs in John  Turek's first six years as coach but has never won a league championship,  breaks through. Warrior quarterback Greg Windle was a first-team all-league  selection as a junior and his receivers, Steve Friedrich and Chad Hartford, are  two of the best in the league.  </P> <P> After Sunny Hills and Troy, the league is difficult to handicap. La Habra  missed the playoffs only three times in the '80s, but one of those times was  last season, and the Highlanders will have to replace their quarterback and two  top rushers.  </P> <P> Like Buena Park, Fullerton and Sonora have new coaches this season. Former  Chaffey College defensive coordinator Pat Ward takes over at Fullerton, which  finished third last season, and former San Gabriel Coach Terry Cox assumes  responsibility for Sonora, which finished last.  </P> <P> With D.C. Olsen, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound linebacker, Fullerton has one of the  league's best hitters -- he set a county record with 13 home runs and batted  .595 for the Fullerton baseball team last season -- and his move from the  offensive line to fullback likely scares many a defensive coach.  </P> <P> Cox has tried to bolster Sonora, which has only seven returning lettermen, by  disbanding the sophomore team and promoting the players to the varsity. Cox  said only 23 of the 41 players truly belong on the varsity. Quarterback Ryan  Lewis, who missed the league season last year with an injured shoulder, returns  and he'll be protected by two of the bigger linemen in the league, Scott DeBie  (6-2, 245) and Robert White (6-5, 270).  </P> <P> Mark Medellin, a part-time starter at quarterback last season, is one of only  three experienced offensive players for Buena Park and the Coyotes' defense is  just as green.  </P> <P> "It dawns on me every time I look out at practice that we're not very big and  not very fast," Luczaj said.  </P> <P> But Luczaj said he is glad to be back coaching football in the Freeway League.  He returns after two seasons as baseball coach at Fullerton High and two as an  assistant coach for the Fullerton College football team.  </P> <P> Luczaj resigned the Fullerton High football job partly because he couldn't get  any assistant coaches hired as full-time teachers, and he doesn't have any  assistants who aren't walk-ons this time around. But his assistants, two of  whom are Coyotes' assistants from last year, are experienced, Luczaj said.  </P> <P> Buena Park's program is in similar shape as Fullerton's in 1981, Luczaj said,  and the players are taking to the system well. But the tradition of losing runs  deep at Buena Park, which last won a Freeway League football championship in  1965.  </P> <P> Luczaj, however, believes the school has had enough of that legacy.  </P> <P> "I think that everybody's to the point that they're tired of losing," he said.  "Hopefully, we can change things. But I don't know, I'm not a miracle worker."  </P> <P> Tomorrow: Garden Grove League.  </P> <P> Buena Park  </P> <P> Coach: Martin Luczaj (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-7, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Mark Medellin, QB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Mike Kennedy, OT, 6-0, 220,  Sr.; Bryan Baylor, TE-DL, 6-2, 215, Jr.; Shane Langenberg, DB, 5-11, 175, Sr.;  Albert Trujillo, DB, 5-8, 160, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Angel Barrios, RB-LB, 6-2, 215, Jr.; Robert Starks, RB-LB, 5-10,  200, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Coyotes ended a 28-game league losing streak last season, but they  still have only won one league game since 1983 and last made the playoffs in  1981. Without defensive back/running back Malcolm King (Cal State Fullerton)  and linemen Jim Perricone (Cal State Fullerton) and Jason James (Fresno State),  who earned Division I football scholarships, the Coyotes lose quite a bit of  talent, but returning quarterback Medellin and a two young running  back/linebackers, Barrios and Starks, give Luczaj reason for optimism.  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> Coach: Pat Ward (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 7-4, 3-2  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 20  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, five on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: D.C. Olsen, LB-FB, 6-1, 220, Sr.; Jimmy Peterson, WR-DB, 5-10,  175, Sr.; Brian Wilber, C-DL, 6-4, 250, Jr.; Ben Iuli, DL-OL, 6-4, 260, Jr.;  Daniel Chacon, QB-DB, 5-9, 160, Jr.; David Chacon, RB-DB, 5-9, 165, Jr., Shawn  Pearson, OL-LB, 5-9, 190, Jr.; Joey Hernandez, LB-RB, 5-10, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Kelle Whitehurst, TE-DE, 6-3, 215, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: In his first head coaching position, Ward, the defensive coordinator  at Chaffey College the past three years, will be faced with the task of  replacing quarterback Rene Arias, a three-year starter and three-sport  all-league player. But Ward says junior Daniel Chacon, who played cornerback  last year, will be a capable replacement. And of course, the Indians have D.C.  Olsen, possibly the league's best athlete, at linebacker.  </P> <P> La Habra  </P> <P> Coach: Jack Nicholls (third year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-6, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 17  </P> <P> Returning starters: Four on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Matt Smith, C, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Herman Hernandez, OL, 6-3, 245,  Sr.; Mike Mooney, FB-LB, 6-2, 200, Jr.; Frank Saiz, RB-DB, 5-8, 155, Sr.; John  Ledieff, OL-DL, 6-1, 205, Jr.; Don Anderson, DL-FB, 6-0, 180, Sr.; Pat Gleason,  LB, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Greg Mitchell, QB, 6-2, 190, Sr.;  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Steve Busch, WR, 5-8, 140, So.; Matt Moreno, RB-DB, 5-10, 150,  Jr.; Jason Johnson, RB-DB, 5-9, 160, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Highlanders missed the playoffs last season for the first time  since they forfeited two league games in 1987. Greg Mitchell, starting free  safety and backup quarterback last season, takes over at quarterback for Mark  Moreno. Whether they can return to playoffs probably depends more on the young  runners who replace Mark Brown and Jeff Besinaiz, who gained more than 1,300  yards between them last season.  </P> <P> Sonora  </P> <P> Coach: Terry Cox (first year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 2-8, 0-5  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: Seven  </P> <P> Returning starters: Three on offense, two on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Ryan Lewis, QB-DB, 6-0, 195, Sr.; Scott DeBie, C-DL, 6-2, 245,  Jr.; Robert White, OL-DL, 6-5, 270, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Deron Drake, RB, 5-10, 170, Jr.; Danny White, LB, 5-10, 175,  Jr.; Scott Spears, LB, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Tim Gorman, LB, 5-7, 165, Jr.; Todd  Fletcher, DL, 6-2, 185, Jr.; Kurtis Lucero, DB-WR, 5-10, 165, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Cox is faced with a task that humbled five coaches during the 1980s --  turning around Sonora's football program. Cox, the former San Gabriel coach,  replaces Larry Allen, who resigned after winning one league game in two years.  Cox says attitudes have improved. Among those who should contribute are  quarterback Lewis, who injured his shoulder and missed the league games last  year, and Drake, who gained more than 2,000 yards in two years for lower-level  teams.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills  </P> <P> Coach: Tim Devaney (11th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 12-1, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 21  </P> <P> Returning starters: Six on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Ken Overby, RB-LB, 5-11, 195, Sr.; Mike Sullivan, RB-DB, 5-11,  185, Sr.; Steve Choe, DB-WR, 5-9, 175, Sr.; Brian Gluhak, LB, 5-10, 175, Sr.;  David Wilde, DB-WR, 5-8, 170, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomer: Marlon Womack, RB, 6-2, 195, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Leading rusher Brian Pizula has graduated. But with Overby and  Sullivan, who each averaged more than six yards a carry last season, returning  to the backfield, the defending league champs' ground game shouldn't suffer  despite the loss of linemen Robert Sung (6-1, 235), Darren Correll (6-2, 255)  and Pat Marshall (6-1, 230). On defense, where the Lancers shut out six  opponents last season, the situation on the line is unclear. But Devaney is  confident in the linebacker corps, headed by Overby, and the secondary, which  includes Sullivan and Choe, a three-year starter.  </P> <P> Troy  </P> <P> Coach: John Turek (seventh year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 7-4, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 20  </P> <P> Returning starters: Nine on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Greg Windle, QB, 6-1, 185, Sr.; Steve Friedrich, WR-DB, 5-11,  170, Sr.; Chad Hartford, TE-DB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Chad Brasington, RB, 6-1, 195,  Sr.; Jeff Dorsz, OL, 6-5, 255, Sr.; Robert Blankmeyer, OL, 5-10, 200, Sr.;  Bodie Berg, C, 6-1, 195, Jr.; Ryan Russell, WR, 5-8, 145, Sr.; Marty Gomez, DE,  5-10, 175, Jr.; Robert Long, DT, 6-1, 190, Sr.; Bryan Ferguson, LB, 6-1, 180,  Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Jim Falletta, TE-LB, 6-4, 205, Jr.; Roger Cruz, DL, 6-2, 220,  Sr.; Brent Coon, DB-RB, 6-1, 185, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: With Windle (the league's top quarterback), Friedrich (one of the top  receivers), tight end Hartford and flanker Russell (both second-team all-league  receivers), running back Brasington and all but two of the offensive line  returning, Troy might have the firepower to challenge Sunny Hills, the  defending champions.  </P></p>

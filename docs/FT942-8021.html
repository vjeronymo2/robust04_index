			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Echikatsu - a quiet oasis in downtown Tokyo / Eating Out A compensation of doing business in Tokyo is the thrill of discovering the many green oases hidden between the sprawl of office blocks. One of the nicest of these is Echikatsu, a cottage restaurant endowed with a water garden, in Kanda, downtown Tokyo, only 15 minutes taxi ride (Y960) from the Otemachi business district. As you pass Echikatsu's wooden gate and cross its cobbled courtyard, the sound of traffic recedes and peace descends. A kimono-clad waitress ushers you to your private tatami-mat room, thoughtfully adapted for westerners by the addition of a leg pit under the table. Sliding paper doors open on to a gurgling brook stocked with carp, and lined with candle-lit stone lanterns and bamboo. Tokyo seems miles away. Echikatsu's specialty is shabu-shabu (rough translation: slosh slosh) or beef teriyaki. They both feature thin-sliced beef and vegetables cooked at the table. Even unadventurous foreigners have been known to like these and Echikatsu will equally please a Japanese guest. The food is excellent, copious, and healthy. But steer clear of the wine list. As in many Tokyo restaurants, it is limited and expensive. I paid Y3,500 for a bottle of Piat d'Or, one of the only two white wines on offer. Stick to sake (rice wine) or beer. In any case, Japanese food was never meant to mix with French wine. Shabu-shabu for two, plus wine, came to just over Y25,000 (Dollars 240), reasonable for a restaurant of this class. Echikatsu is suitable for serious business discussion in small groups. It is upmarket, private, quiet and there is lots of room to spread papers around on the tatami floor. The service is unobtrusively attentive. Equally, its charm makes Echikatsu good for romance. Ask your hotel or secretary to book a room facing the garden and to get Echikatsu to fax you a map. It is well known, but Tokyo taxi drivers are terrible navigators. Echikatsu is open from 5pm to 9.30pm. Bookings only. No English spoken. It accepts leading credit cards. Phone 3811-5293.</p>

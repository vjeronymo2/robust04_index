			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Xu Yang: "Women's Rights Most Secure in Capital"] </F>   [Text] Beijing has taken the lead in protecting women's  rights by strictly forbidding discrimination in the workplace  and setting quotas on the number of female leadership positions  in city and county government.    The Standing Committee of the Municipal People's Congress  [MPC] on Saturday approved the city's Regulations Governing  Implementation of the Law For The Protection of Women's Rights  and Interests.    The Municipal Committee for Protection of Women's Rights and  its subsidiary neighbourhood groups are the watchdogs of women's  rights.    The new regulations, passed by the 10th Plenary Session of  the Beijing MPC Standing Committee, are a first in China.    Similar regulations are expected to be drafted and adopted  by  other municipalities, provinces and regions within the next two  years.    The law requires the municipal and county women's rights  committees to be composed of leading officials from local  government, courts, procuratorates, and local organizations of  the Women's Federation, Trade Union and Youth League.    The national Law for the Protection of Women's Rights and  Interests (LPWRI), which was introduced in early 1992, requires  the State to set up institutions to safeguard women's  constitutional rights.    Accordingly, the Beijing Committee for Protection of Women's  Rights was set up in October 1992.    Another key part of the new law stipulates that women should  be given a minimum number of seats in the Municipal and County  People's Congress, local administrations and enterprises. But  it does not give an exact percentage which is considered proper.    Women account for almost half of the 10.5 million people  living in the capital.    Currently, there are about 368,000 women officials including  the vice mayor in Beijing, or 44.5 percent of the total. Women  account for about 33 percent of the MPC deputies.    However, women only occupy 11.9 percent of the city's senior  posts.    The new regulations specify in detail that any  discrimination  against women in school enrollment and employment constitutes a  violation of the law.</p>

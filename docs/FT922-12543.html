			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Leading Article: A window for rate cuts AFTER months of pre-election tension, the City has finally relaxed. The markets have reacted with great enthusiasm to the prospect of five years of stable Conservative government committed to low inflation and no devaluation. But this surge of confidence will only persist if the economic recovery starts soon; and the main obstacle to growth remains high interest rates. Some City folk are encouraging the government to postpone interest rate cuts and instead move quickly to narrow bands within the European exchange rate mechanism. It is a temptation that Mr Lamont should resist. Economic recovery, long predicted by the Treasury and like-minded City analysts, may at last be in the pipeline; but their recent record does not inspire confidence. The economy may experience a post-election boomlet over the next few months, as companies and consumers make purchases they were postponing. But timing-related blips in retail sales figures can send misleading signals, as the chancellor learned last summer. The risk remains that the recession will give-way to a prolonged period of slow growth. The combination of high real interest rates and heavy consumer and business debts do not together make a stable platform on which to build a recovery driven only by rising real incomes for those in work. Rising unemployment is also likely to keep southern consumers nervous for some months yet. Obstacle removed The election result has removed one political obstacle to interest rate cuts, namely the risk that they would have to be reversed if sterling slipped to its ERM floor. Indeed, the post-election market rally appears to have made this risk even more remote. Sterling has already climbed to well within 2 1/2 per cent of its central rate. But it makes no sense for the Treasury to wait for sterling to rise above its central rate before cutting rates. High German interest rates are the main obstacle to looser UK monetary policy. UK short-term rates are a mere  3/4 of a percentage point above German rates. No ERM member country has yet managed to maintain lower rates than those of Germany for any length of time. A new government, however large its majority and conservative its rhetoric, is not in a strong position to test the market's patience. Yet the government's hands are not completely tied. It can and should narrow this interest rate differential further, perhaps by just a quarter of a point at a time. The markets, and the public, must become used to the idea that the ERM means frequent small changes in interest rates, and not always downwards. Attractive symbolism The government should also resist a move to narrow bands within the ERM, however attractive the symbolism of doing so during the UK's forthcoming presidency of the European Community. The UK may have little room for independent monetary policy manoeuvre in the ERM; but the Treasury and the Bank of England should cling on to what flexibility they do possess, both over when to move to narrow bands and around what rate. Indeed, wide bands may give the UK a better chance than other ERM members of pushing interest rates below those in Germany. A country can only do so if its currency is expected to appreciate against the D-Mark. But the UK's wide bands make the room for appreciation much greater. Success would be more likely if the Bank of England were first made operationally independent of Treasury control. That would be the clearest possible signal that the UK is committed to low and stable inflation. Even then, a substantial easing of UK monetary policy will not be forthcoming until the Bundesbank cuts interest rates, a prospect which Germany's fiscal crisis continues to postpone. Strains in the ERM would quickly ease if economic growth in the UK and France picks up soon. But the longer these countries have to endure slow growth and rising unemployment, the greater the risk that monetary co-operation in Europe will disintegrate. The rest of Europe badly needs Germany to put its house in order, but will not be able to wait for ever. Until German rates do fall, the UK government should take what opportunities it can to cut interest rates.</p>

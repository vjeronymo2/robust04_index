			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Business and the Law: BA's acquisition of TAT upheld - European Court Air France's appeal against the European Commission's 1992 decision approving the acquisition by British Airways of a 49.9 per cent stake in TAT European Airways, has been dismissed by the Court of First Instance. The acquisition, about which the Commission was notified under the EC Merger Regulation, also gave BA the option to buy before April 1 1997 the remaining 50.1 per cent retained by its parent, TAT SA. The Commission decided the transaction was a concentration with a Union dimension but raised no serious doubts as to its compatibility with the common market. BA had no share of the French domestic market. TAT EA had only 3.8 per cent of it, while Air France together with Air Inter had 84.9 per cent. BA and TAT EA overlapped on the Paris/London and Lyons/London routes. Because they were not substitutable, the Commission treated each airport pairing as a relevant market for the purpose of assessing market dominance. The combined market shares of BA and TAT EA on these routes exceeded 50 per cent and on the route between Gatwick and Lyons there was no effective competition. However, the parties undertook to make slots available to competitors at Heathrow and Gatwick airports where new entry was otherwise impossible. In the light of the shareholders agreement and agreed business plan which covered strategic commercial decisions, the Commission concluded that BA and TAT SA exercised joint control over TAT EA. Key decisions required the approval of at least one of the board members appointed by each shareholder. The agreement was to last for 6 1/2 years until April 1 1999 if the option was not exercised. The Commission considered that sufficient indication of the durability and permanence of the change to the structure of the parties. On the other hand there was no risk of co-ordination of behaviour between competitors which remain independent because TAT SA left the market in which TAT EA operated. BA itself was not in competition because it exercised substantial influence (industrial leadership) over the common subsidiary, TAT EA. The main criticisms of the Commission's decision made by Air France were that the Commission had not recognised that BA had sole control over TAT EA on the basis of the purchase option and that the relevant market was defined too narrowly. The Court first said Air France had sufficient standing to appeal the Commission's decision although there was no formal complaint procedure under the Merger Regulation. Applying by analogy the European Court of Justice's approach to standing in state aids cases, the CFI found that Air France had participated sufficiently in the Commission's procedure and was the main competitor affected by the acquisition. The CFI ruled that the Commission was right to conclude TAT EA was jointly controlled by reference to the need for both parents to take strategic decisions and the fact that TAT SA had a 50.1 per cent holding. These were the circumstances of fact and law which the merger regulation required the Commission to take into account. The ultimate purpose of BA to integrate TAT EA into its international operational network, was not among them. Nor was the future and hypothetical possibility that BA would gain sole control by exercising the purchase option. The coincidence in the date by which the option had to be exercised and the date for liberalisation of air transport cabotage was not such as to justify the conclusion that it was inevitable BA would exercise its option. The CFI also upheld the Commission's definition of the relevant market as the services between the airport pairs primarily affected by the acquisition, namely London/Paris and Lyons/London. The Commission was required to examine whether the merger in question created or strengthened a dominant position which resulted in a significant impediment to effective competition. Air France had no grounds to complain because it never even suggested that the acquisition would have such an effect on a more widely defined market.

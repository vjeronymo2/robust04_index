			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FALLBROOK;  </P> <P> BOY, 5, RECOVERING IN PIT BULL ATTACK  </P> <P> A 5-year-old boy mauled by a pit bull was recovering Saturday after surgery to  repair painful bite wounds, hospital officials said. Garry Chisholm's condition  was upgraded from serious to fair after the Friday night surgery, said Mark  Morelli of Children's Hospital of San Diego.  </P> <P> "This morning, the youngster is awake and well-oriented, but in considerable  discomfort," Morelli said Saturday. He said Garry will remain hospitalized  several more days. Authorities said the boy was mauled Friday after he jumped a  fence into a neighbor's back yard where the dog was kept. He suffered multiple  scrapes on his arms, back, chest and face and bite wounds to the back of his  head and around his right ear. The pit bull's owner, Gabino De La Torre, found  the shaken, bleeding youngster when he and a friend returned home from the  beach. The dog was placed in quarantine by the San Diego County Department of  Animal Control. Agency officials said they will decide by Monday or Tuesday  whether it will be destroyed.  </P></p>

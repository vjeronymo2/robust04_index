			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 16 (CNA) -- The Beijing-based  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS) is  stepping up contacts with Taiwan investors in Mainland China in  an attempt to have them cut their relations with Taiwan, a  high-ranking mainland affairs official said Thursday [16 June].    Huang Kun-hui, chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council  (MAC), said during a cabinet meeting that ARATS Chairman Wang  Daohan and Standing Vice Chairman Tang Shubei have visited many  southeastern mainland cities where a number of Taiwan-owned  companies are located, including Ningbo, Hangzhou, Nanjing,  Yangzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou, since mid-May.    Wang and Tang have met intensively with senior executives of  Taiwan-invested firms during their tours of those cities, Huang  said. They have also held face-to-face talks with Taiwan youths  studying there.    [Words indistinct] might be aiming to win back the hearts of  Taiwan businessmen whose confidence in mainland authorities has  been adversely affected by the Qiandao Lake travel disaster in  which 24 tourists were killed, Huang noted.    "The two might also be implementing resolutions reached  during a Beijing meeting in April on a new strategy toward  Taiwan to intensify courting Taiwan investors," Huang said.    Huang also said that ARATS has adopted a sugar-coated  conciliatory approach to win the trust of Taiwan businessmen.  "Wang seems to be talking Taiwan investors into believing that  ARATS can speak for them and protect their interests and rights  on the mainland," he explained.    On the other hand, he said ARATS has deliberately ignored  the  call from the Taipei-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) for  cooperation in assisting mainland China-based Taiwan companies  to resolve their problems.    "By doing so, ARATS aims to alienate Taiwan companies from  the SEF," Huang said, adding that ARATS hopes those firms will  in the long run exclusively turn to it for assistance and  gradually cut their ties with their homeland.    The SEF and ARATS are semi-official bodies set up by their  respective governments to handle cross-strait exchanges in the  absence of official contacts.</p>

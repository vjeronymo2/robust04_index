			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DINKINS TO RAISE N.Y. CITY TAXES  </P> <P> Mayor David N. Dinkins, after only a month in office and faced with a giant  budget deficit, said today he would raise taxes by $550 million and cut city  services.  </P> <P> "This is a time for tough choices. . . . We have not entered a recession -- not  yet anyway -- but these are very hard times indeed," Dinkins said as he  unveiled a $27.8-billion budget, highest in the city's history.  </P> <P> Dinkins, the city's first black chief executive, is facing a projected  $1.2-billion deficit for the fiscal year starting next July 31 and a  $400-million gap for the current fiscal year.  </P> <P> Dinkins proposed raising property and city income tax surcharges by $550  million. He said he will also cut city services by $226 million to help close  the gap. Additional measures such as savings through increased productivity  will also be aimed at closing the budget gap.  </P></p>

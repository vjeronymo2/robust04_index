			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> URBAN WILDERNESS;  </P> <P> WITH A TEEMING METROPOLIS MERE MILES AWAY, MORE THAN JUST CAMPERS ARE MAKING  MALIBU CREEK PARK THEIR DIGS  </P> <P> It's totally dark. You're in the woods camping, just you and your wife alone in  your tent. Thankfully, the three party animals in the next campsite manage to  turn off the stereo before passing out. You settle back and just before you  fall asleep, you hear -- what? -- a scream? A scream! But before you can make  sure, the sound is muffled by a jumbo jet screeching through the black night.  </P> <P> Dawn finally comes through a canopy of oak trees in the Santa Monica Mountains.  You unzip the tent and look out across a gently sloping valley, see first light  glance off the ridge of a distant range. The air smells fresh and clean. With  daybreak, incidents of the night seem less disturbing, trade-offs attendant  with the convenience of a park that is within just a few miles of millions of  people.  </P> <P> You're staying in the newly opened campground at Malibu Creek State Park, which  is only four miles south of the Ventura Freeway on well-traveled Las Virgenes  Road and a scant few minutes from the heart of the Valley. You wanted pure  wilderness but knew that the perfect outdoor experience is almost impossible  outside of Alaska, especially at a California state park in the middle of  summer. You almost expected the highway hum and the obnoxious neighbors. Even  the almost incessant air traffic wasn't out of the ordinary.  </P> <P> But Malibu Creek is unusual, even by state park standards. The freeway provides  quick access to L. A., turning the campground into a sort of budget motel for  people seeking jobs or working here for a short time or sightseeing in  Hollywood. State rules let them camp for 14 consecutive days and 30 days in a  year.  </P> <P> "There's a slightly different urban mix here," says Marc McCulloch, the camp  host who lives in a trailer on the campground, where campers get hot showers,  clean toilet facilities and some of the best views on the planet for only $10 a  night, "probably the cheapest rent you can find," McCulloch says.  </P> <P> For people who just want to camp and hike, going to Malibu Creek is like  running out to a mini-mall. Convenience camping. Just toss the gear in the car.  If you forget anything, zip over to the nearby market. Do lunch in Malibu.  Invite a friend to drop in for cappuccino in the morning, when Malibu Creek  becomes a kinder, gentler park.  </P> <P> You get out of the tent and see cars driving along the crest of Mulholland  Highway, maybe two miles away. Thinking about people in three-piece suits going  to the office, you sip a cup of hot coffee. A state park ranger comes by and  you talk to him. He is on his way across the campground to investigate the  screams you heard a few hours earlier.  </P> <P> "Someone complained that a guy was beating his wife," says Ranger Frank Padilla  Jr., a peace officer who carries a revolver and has the power of arrest.  </P> <P> You ask Padilla what kind of problems he's seen at the campground. "Valley  kids," he says, "underage kids drinking beer. Transients, too. They bring their  problems with them, get drunk, and we make arrests. We've also had to boot out  live-ins."  </P> <P> Padilla drives over to the campsite where the alleged wife-beating took place.  He talks to the couple and evicts them from the park.  </P> <P> You walk through the campground. Meteor-shaped boulders guard the entrance to  every site. The sun rises overhead and the summer heat comes on. Of the 60  sites, about 20 are under the cooling protection of California live oaks. The  rest -- most in a barren field -- offer no shade, although the state Department  of Parks and Recreation is considering installing ramadas over the wooden  picnic tables.  </P> <P> You notice that the campground is mostly empty. There are perhaps six sites  being used, all of them in the upper end of the horseshoe-shaped campground.  Since opening May 1 -- after a year of delays to improve the park entrance on  Las Virgenes -- Malibu Creek has never been full, even on the weekends, in  contrast to almost 100% occupancy at other state parks. Depending mainly on  word of mouth to increase public awareness, the state plans to put the  campground in the computer listings next year, meaning that reservations will  be taken and the overflow from other parks diverted to Malibu Creek.  </P> <P> The campground sits in the southeast corner of the 6,000-acre park. The trail  head for the best hiking trails are to the west about 1 1/2 miles away. You  brush off the ubiquitous sweat flies and decide to hike to Century Lake a mile  farther into the mountains. Despite its heavy use, the park is kept cleaner  than most back yards, its sandstone walls having somehow escaped the attention  of graffiti artists.  </P> <P> You pass through what looks like a prairie of desolation, vegetation so dry  that it couldn't possibly be alive, but then you see thriving gum plants and  milkweed and lavender thistles hanging from brittle branches. Life is  everywhere. You look up. A plane is circling, white vapor trailing behind it.  Sky graffiti. The message, probably intended for beach-goers a few miles south,  says "Think Bic."  </P> <P> Crossing Malibu Creek, or what's left of it after months of drought conditions,  you take a fire road into the mountains. The park is almost child proof.  Warnings signs keep visitors on the right trails and off the wrong ones. But  because of a lack of cooling ocean breezes in the summer, hiking can be  deceptively difficult without water. There is a welcome drinking fountain at  Century Lake.  </P> <P> But the lake is a disappointment. A portable generator clatters away on the  shore. The state is employing divers to fix a valve in the damn. They report  zero visibility in the water. You start the return trip and see a mother  shepherding four young children to the lake. They are tired, hot and thirsty.  You tell them about the noise and absence of ambience but they trudge on. The  kids want to fish.  </P> <P> On the way down the mountain, three cowboys on horseback come trotting by. They  are riding to Malibu Lake, "a nice, easy ride," one of them says. "You can  drink beer and not worry about your horse jumping off a cliff."  </P> <P> You take a shortcut down a steep, narrow trail and stop at a picnic area for  lunch under an umbrella of pine. You watch scrub jays fight over your crumbs.  They finally leave and you hear a woodpecker in the distance, then silence. No  generator or plane with earshot, nothing but the outdoors, as primal as ever.  </P> <P> You go home and wish the park was always that perfect. You ask McCulloch about  it.  </P> <P> "We don't have any big problems here," he says, "and the rangers are cracking  down on rowdy activity. We only want good people. We want them to get away from  the city and have a pleasant experience. That's the magic of being this close  to an urban area."  </P></p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada's first commercially-producing offshore oilfield comes on stream Flaring illuminates the night sky over Canada's first commercially-producing offshore oilfield, 250km south-east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Lasmo Nova Scotia, a subsidiary of the UK oil exploration company Lasmo, this week commenced production at the Cohasset development, representing an important milestone in the 30-year quest to establish commercial production from Canada's substantial offshore fields. The CDollars 260m (Pounds 119m) Cohasset development comprises two offshore fields, Cohasset and Panuke, with estimated recoverable reserves of about 50m barrels of light crude. Only the Panuke field is currently producing, but development drilling on Cohasset will commence next year, bringing production to around 40,000 barrels a day for the next six years. A third field, Balmoral, 3 km (2 miles) north of the existing facilities, will later be tied into Cohasset by a subsea pipeline.</p>

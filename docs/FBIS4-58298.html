			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 May (MENA)--The Arab Industrialization  Authority [AIA] factories have modified the Egyptian al-Hadaf  [Arabic for "target"] aircraft used for training air defense  units in shooting. The modification involves increasing their  fuselage area and fitting them with lights [masha'il] so that  they can be engaged by heat-sensitive rockets in addition to  ground artillery.    Engineer 'Abd-al-Hamid Wasfi, chairman of the AIA Qadir  Factory, which manufactures this aircraft, said the modification  also involved increasing its load capacity and range for use in  aerial photography.    In a statement to AL-AKHBAR today, he added that the name  Qadir has been given to this new type of airplane, which flies  at 180 km/hour, is equipped with a piston engine and remote  control, and can be made airborne without a launching pad.    Engineer Wasfi said production of the light armored car  Qadir  will begin in July after the successful production of the first  example of the vehicle. He noted that the car is fitted with  armored steel and glass and can be equipped with a half-inch  turret against personnel and concentrations [not further  specified].    He said over 60 percent of the car is manufactured at the  factory, that it is equipped with a 214-horsepower engine, and  its maximum speed on a flat surface is 220 km/hour and 100 km on  rough terrain. He added that Qadir car is designed for border  guard duties, internal reconnaissance and security, and  protection of VIP's, and that it can be used as a command room  for radio communication units. He said the factory is capable  of modifying normal passenger cars to bullet-proof vehicles for  protection against weapons of up to 7.62 calibers [as received].</p>

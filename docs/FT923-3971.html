			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / International Company News: Australian insurer cuts losses to ADollars 49m FAI Insurances, the Australian financial services group, remained in the red in the 12 months to June, but reduced its net losses by 76 per cent to ADollars 48.7m (USDollars 37.4m), from ADollars 204.2m a year earlier. Mr Rodney Adler, chief executive, expects a further improvement in the group's performance this year, although it is still budgeting for underwriting losses. He said the main reason for the lower losses was a reduction in the group's underwriting deficit to ADollars 79m, from ADollars 191m. 'This improvement has not come without cost, and our premium income, net of reinsurance, has dropped from ADollars 651m to ADollars 518m,' he said. 'The insurance market remains very difficult, and despite the withdrawal and merger activities of various underwriting companies both here and abroad, premium rates remain generally insufficient.' FAI in passed its dividend. The latest losses came on a fall in revenue to ADollars 1.03m from ADollars 1.07m. Tax took ADollars 3m against a credit of ADollars 84.1m, while depreciation was ADollars 31.6m, against ADollars 24.6m.</p>

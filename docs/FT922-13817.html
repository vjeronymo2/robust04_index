			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Harrods active at Vung Tau auction: Saleroom HARRODS, the London department store, was a prominent buyer yesterday at Christie's two-day sale of the Vung Tau cargo in Amsterdam. It will be offering the porcelain for sale from Monday. The shipload of Chinese blue and white export porcelain, lost off the coast of Vietnam in the early 1690s and rediscovered in 1989, is selling far above target. Christie's was estimating about Pounds 1.5m for the 28,000 items - originally destined for display in the homes of Dutch burghers - but after three of the four sessions it had already raised Fl 9.75m (Pounds 3m). The top price at yesterday morning's sale was Fl 126,500 (Pounds 39,655), far in excess of the Fl 10,000 estimate, for a blue and white five-piece garniture decorated with what the Chinese imagined a Dutch canal house looked like. A similar garniture realised Fl 112,700 (Pounds 35,329). There was strong international bidding from dealers and private collectors. Sotheby's auction of British paintings in London yesterday brought in Pounds 1.18m, but with more than 35 per cent unsold. That resulted mainly from the failure of two important lots - a Constable sketch of Dedham Vale and a portrait by John Webber of the young Captain Bligh of the Bounty, to find buyers. The top price was Pounds 61,600, almost double the estimate, paid for a rare portrait of King James V of Scotland by Corneille de Lyon. A portrait by Lely of Barbara Villiers, mistress of King Charles II, was on target at Pounds 57,200. Historical portraits did well, as did shipping scenes, but sporting pictures are still proving difficult to sell. A portrait by Reynolds of Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Shannon made Pounds 41,800.</p>

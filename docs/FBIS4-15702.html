			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Suntsov] </F>   [Text] Before his departure for Madrid, Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin gave a press interview at the [Vnukovo-2] airport. He  described his visit to Spain as important and emphasized the  serious preparation of the documents, including the treaty on  friendship and cooperation.    [Begin Yeltsin recording] These documents which are to be  signed give the green light to a rapid development of  cooperation between our countries. So far it has been, one must  say frankly, slow, though our two countries have great potential  both for developing bilateral relations and for influencing the  policy in Europe and in the world. [end recording]    Asked about Russia's stand regarding the NATO air strike  against the Bosnian Serbs and about his conversation early this  morning with U.S. President Clinton, Boris Yeltsin said:    [Begin Yeltsin recording] Everything must be in accordance  with the decisions of the United Nations. He did not answer my  question this morning about whether the UN secretary general had  given the go-ahead for this. We advocate discussion of this  issue in the Security Council -- without doubt. Speaking to  Clinton, I insisted again and again that it is impossible to  make decisions on such issues without prior consultations  between the United States and Russia. It is impossible, and  that will be our stand. [end recording]    [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 0604 GMT on 11 April adds,  in  a report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova on the  Yeltsin-Clinton phone conversation: "The Russian president  pointed out that he had a telephone conversation with U.S.  President Bill Clinton `at six in the morning today.' According  to Boris Yeltsin, `Bill Clinton was unable to reply whether the  U.N. Secretary-General gave a go-ahead to the strikes.' Boris  Yeltsin is convinced that `all problems should be resolved  strictly in accordance with U.N. decisions." Yeltsin said  "Russia favours discussing this issue in the U.N. Security  Council.']    [Moscow INTERFAX in English at 1120 GMT on 11 April adds:  "Before flying to Spain on an official visit Yeltsin told  journalists that Clinton had not said whether the UN secretary  general had given his go ahead to the NATO air strike against  Bosnian Serb positions in the vicinity of Gorazde. `This is  important to know because the air strike took place at night.  Such actions should not be taken unless authorized by the UN,'  Yeltsin said. `It is also important to know what targets were  destroyed. If only two tanks, it's one thing; if the civilian  population suffered, it's another. In any case this incident  has to be debated by the UN Security Council. I insisted that  such decisions should not be made without Russia. This is our  firm position.']</p>

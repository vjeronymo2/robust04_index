			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Resistance to job relocation 'growing' EMPLOYEE resistance to job relocation is growing, mainly because of the difficulties of selling homes and the reluctance of partners to give up their jobs and move, according to a survey published yesterday. Nearly 40 per cent of the 251 companies surveyed said a working spouse 'presented a key inhibitor to relocation'. A third mentioned concern about children's education and just more than a quarter quoted family ties and roots as reasons for reluctance to move with the company. Ms Sue Shortland, head of the Confederation of British Industry's relocation group, said: 'The issue of the working partner will increase with more women working and more dual-income families.' She added that it was not only the temporary loss of income that caused problems but also the damage to the partner's career, promotion and income potential. The current property price slump is the most serious barrier to relocation. As many as 44 per cent of the sample said inability to sell their home inhibited them from being moved to another part of the country by their employer. The survey, published by the CBI and Black Horse Relocation Services, suggests that employers are not doing all they can to deal with the relocation problems of their workers. While four out of five companies sampled said they were trying to resolve the difficulties of moving home with financial assistance, fewer than a third were doing anything to help working partners find a new job. When asked how employees' needs for relocation support would change in the next three years, as many as 24 per cent said the requirements of working spouses would become more important while 10 per cent mentioned the slump in the property market and a further 7 per cent 'negative equity problems'. More than half of the companies surveyed were in the manufacturing sector.</p>

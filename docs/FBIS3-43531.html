National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] forces have shelled the northeast  part of the city of Cuito, capital of Bie Province, causing 10  deaths and seriously wounding others. Our correspondent Abel  Abreu reports from the area:    The government forces -- firm and decided as always -- have  repelled yet another attack by UNITA forces. The dead were  buried in several cemeteries across the city, and silence, pain,  hatred, and indignation were reflected in the faces of the  mourning family and friends who accompanied the bodies in  funeral processions.</p>

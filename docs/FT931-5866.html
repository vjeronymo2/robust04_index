			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Lotus wins Taiwan order GROUP LOTUS, the Norfolk-based sports car and engineering concern, has won a contract to help develop car engine production in Taiwan. The contract, which the company yesterday said is backed by the Taiwanese government and would be worth 'quite a few millions' over several years, may make more difficult a decision by General Motors on whether to sell Lotus. GM has owned Lotus since 1987. Several interested parties have approached GM about the purchase of all or parts of Group Lotus, including a management team led by Mr Adrian Palmer, the managing director. GM has not disclosed details of the other approaches, which followed a decision last year to abandon production of the Elan small sports car after less than two years. Lotus had hoped to sell 3,000 a year but the car was widely regarded as too expensive and never came close to sales targets. As a result Lotus Cars, the carmaking division which now produces only the very low volume Esprit 'supercar', has been making heavy losses for the past two years. It now employs only 200 people - one third of 1991 levels. Lotus Engineering, the consultancy division which has won the Taiwan contract, earned more than Pounds 30m in 1991 and is understood to have made substantial profits last year, although figures have yet to be released. The division is now substantially larger than the carmaking side of the business, with 500 employees. The Taiwanese deal involves technology transfer by Lotus to the Taiwan government-backed Industrial Technology Research Institute.</p>

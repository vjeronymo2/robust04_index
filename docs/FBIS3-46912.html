He thus reiterated the need for ruling and  opposition parties to reach a compromise for the passage of the  political reform bills.    Concerning the view expressed by some politicians that the  lower house of the Diet should be dissolved if the political  reform bills fail to become law during the current Diet session,  Hata said: "We should be ready and willing to do just that."  However, he also said: "Dissolving the Diet is not such a  simple matter."</p>

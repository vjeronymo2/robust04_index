			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / People: Bill McLennan to go back home Bill McLennan, the lively Australian director of the Central Statistical Office and Head of the Government Statistical Service, is leaving to become Australian Statistician. McLennan, 52, who joined the CSO in 1992 after serving as deputy director of the Australian Bureau of Statistics, brought a breath of fresh air into the operations of the statistical service. During his time in office he has sought to tighten up government leaks of information, develop a stronger business focus and make the CSO more self-financing. The changes have significantly boosted the credibility of the CSO in the City, although his forthright and colourful style has occasionally seemed at odds with British Civil Service traditions. 'I found the culture change bigger than I expected - it took me 12 months to realise all the subtle cultural differences,' McLennan says. McLennan, one of the highest-paid civil servants, will leave the CSO in March after serving out his three-year contract. He said yesterday that he had decided to return to the post of director of the ABS, which he first joined in 1960, because he wished to 'go home' and be closer to his two children. 'It's a great job - not the sort I am ever likely to be offered again,' he said. His post, which commanded a salary of Pounds 114,000 this year, will be advertised shortly.</p>

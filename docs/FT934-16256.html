			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Arts: A bizarre inauguration for St John's new organ - Concert Even in its days as a working church St John's, Smith Square was not graced with an organ appropriate to its scale and position, an impressive landmark on the 18th-century skyline of London just behind Parliament Square. One writer remarked that its modest instrument was 'very foul and much in need of repair'. Two centuries later, the omission has been made good. Following its restoration after war damage, St John's functioned well enough as a concert hall without an organ until the past few years, when it has been building on its reputation as a venue for choral music. An organ no longer looked a desirable extra; it had become a necessity. An appeal was launched and reached its target thanks to a large donation from the Sainsbury Family. The Sainsbury organ, as it is to be known, was inaugurated with a gala concert on Tuesday. In several ways it was a bizarre affair, if an enjoyable one. There was no standard organ solo on the programme, but we did get Ruggero Raimondi, who turned up to sing an Italian song with piano lasting all of two minutes. Meanwhile, the audience was seated with its back to the new instrument, supposedly the star of the evening. Those who turned round will have been impressed with what they saw. The familiar 18th-century organ case has been retained, extended where necessary in the same style, and restored, its pipes gleaming silver, the overall picture a splendid enhancement to an elegantly Baroque hall. The German builder Johannes Klais of Bonn was put in charge of producing the new instrument and has come up with a firm, varied, authoritative organ sound. Varied is the key word these days. A new organ has to do duty for the whole repertoire, whether it be Bach or Messiaen, the grand French romantics or Baroque preludes and fugues. Simon Preston, the organist for the gala evening, chose to show off its prowess in unusual music - a triumphal march by Francaix to start, a riotous set of variations on 'God Save the Queen' by Charles Ives, some Tournemire and a dazzling showpiece by Joseph Bonnet. Even after all those, the organ seemed to have new sounds to spare. It can unleash plenty of volume as well - too much for Poulenc's Organ Concerto, when it dwarfed the orchestra, at least from where I was sitting. Another problem there, too: it is notoriously difficult to keep an organist and a choir or orchestra together when they are at opposite ends of the hall. The only answer will be to have the audience facing the other way. These initial impressions will no doubt be enlarged, modified, possibly contradicted, as the solo recitals get underway, led by Preston, Gillian Weir and Daniel Chorzempa. A big additional attraction will be the novelty of the video screen, which allows the audience to watch the organist at work in close-up, though the players themselves may not like it. No cheating will be possible in those tricky pedal solos at St John's. Organ recitals this month will be on October 14 and 28 (evenings), 15 and 29 (lunchtimes)</p>

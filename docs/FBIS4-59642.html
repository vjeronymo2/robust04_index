			<p>BFN     [Text] Jibril al-Rujub and Muhammad Dahlan, who will be  in charge of internal security in the West Bank and the Gaza  Strip on behalf of the PLO, will arrive in the autonomous area  on Tuesday [17 May]. Jibril al-Rujub told our correspondent  Karmela Menashe he will arrive to the Allenby Bridge with  several of his aides Tuesday morning, from where he will  continue to Hebron. Al-Rujub expressed satisfaction with the  rate of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] withdrawal from the autonomy  areas. He said it feels very good to return after six years and  five months in the diaspora, and 17 years in prison. Al-Rujub  says the two nations have no alternative to coexistence. He  defined this a national and religious duty.</p>

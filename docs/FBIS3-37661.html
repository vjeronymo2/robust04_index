			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs, by unidentified Ostankino Television correspondent in  Moscow on 19 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Churkin] The Serbs were greatly impressed by three  elements in the Russian proposal. First of all, it was Russia's  request to the Serbs to withdraw heavy weaponry from Sarajevo.  Second, it was the circumstance that the letter was signed by  President Yeltsin. Third, it was the fact that it was not just  words, but that the proposal and the president's signature were  backed by Russia's pledge to send Russian servicemen to Sarajevo  in the UN peacekeeping contingent.    [Correspondent] Vasiliy Ivanovich, what about the ultimatum?  Does it still remain in force, or it can be said that NATO will  revise its decision?    [Churkin] I do not know what this ultimatum is in general.  We are not members of NATO. It is UN troops that are in  Sarajevo, not NATO ones, and it is the resolutions of the  Security Council that are operating there. I refuse to take  into account any time periods or any other elements of any sort  of ultimatums. The countdown in Sarajevo now starts from the  moment when on Thursday at 1600 the Serbs said that they agree  to the Russian proposal and are grateful to Russia that it put  forward so bravely and energetically its proposal for the  de-blocking of the Sarajevo crisis.    [Correspondent] NATO's decision has permitted some reviewers  to come to the conclusion that for the first time in recent  years a crisis has developed between the young democratic Russia  and its partners in the Western alliance, if not a split.    [Churkin] I think that there has been no crisis or split as  yet. There was a certain episode, a serious one, but one should  not dramatize it too much because we are only just learning to  carry out equal partnership relations with each other. This  episode might turn into a crisis if, in spite of the Russian  initiative, NATO takes some kind of reckless, precipitate action  that would lead to an exacerbation of the situation in Sarajevo.  Well, if somebody made a sudden decision -- and there are  people who feel this way in NATO I can say quite frankly -- to  carry out air strikes in the area of Sarajevo, then, indeed, we  would be faced with a crisis, but for the time being I proceed  from the fact that the crisis around Sarajevo will be overcome  on the basis of the Russian initiative and we and the NATO  states will thus acquire, as a result of this episode --  although it is serious -- important experience in how to build  relations with one another.</p>

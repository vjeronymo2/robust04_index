			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Conference on fishing agreed EARTH Summit delegates are to hold a big international conference on the contentious issue of over-fishing and dwindling world fish stocks. A Canadian-led move to increase international co-operation on the issue had been resisted by the European Community and Korea, but delegates at the Rio de Janeiro summit were finally persuaded by the argument that over-fishing contravenes the principle of sustainable development. A conference will be held next year under UN auspices. Countries such as Canada, Iceland and many Latin American nations had voiced concern that foreign over-fishing on the high seas was depleting national fish stocks. The main worry was over straddling stocks - fish that cross between the exclusive economic zones of different countries or between those zones and the high seas - as these are not included in the Law of the Sea regulation. The Canadian delegation said it had voluntarily reduced its total allowable catch of northern cod by more than half to 120,000 tonnes in February and was likely to announce a new cut soon. A resolution on a fishing conference will form part of Agenda 21, the global action plan on environment which is one of the main Earth Summit documents. The conference will not affect the Law of the Sea.</p>

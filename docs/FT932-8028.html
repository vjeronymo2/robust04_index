			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / International Company News: Troubled Honda seeks a mass market formula - Moves to escape a niche WHEN officials of Honda assemble today at the company's headquarters in Tokyo's fashionable Aoyama district to unveil a new passenger car, they will be investing more hope than usual in their latest offering to help reverse the company's sagging fortunes. Honda has just announced a 32 per cent decline in pre-tax profits and a 61 per cent fall in net income for the year to March, and warned that trading in the current year was likely to be at least as bad. The Japanese motor manufacturer, which began production at a new factory in the UK last autumn, expects demand to remain weak in its main markets and the yen's sharp appreciation to result in a 40 per cent decline in consolidated net income this year. Honda officials do not see light at the end of the tunnel yet, and are battening down for a tumultuous year ahead. Capital investment is being kept at about half the level of its 1990 peak, profit-related bonuses for board members are being cut by 10 per cent, and recruitment of graduates will be nearly halved next April. These steps come in addition to a restructuring programme introduced three years ago which has already streamlined operations and cut costs significantly. But these defensive measures, while effective in getting the company into better shape to meet the challenges of a severely depressed and increasingly competitive motor industry, have failed to solve Honda's overriding problem -its inability to make sufficient profits on cars. Operating income from car production last year declined by 62 per cent to Y49.2bn (Dollars 443m) and the outlook for improvement does not look promising. Income from cars is now only slightly more than that from motorcycles. Honda, once a symbol of Japanese innovation and a company that built America's most popular car for the three years until the last, increasingly seems to have everything going against it. In the US, where it has had spectacular success with its mass-market Accord, the prospects remain uncertain for all car manufacturers and for Honda in particular. It has been losing market share in the US where it estimates its slice has fallen from 9.8 per cent in 1991 to 9.3 per cent last year and 7.5 per cent in the first four months of 1993. Competition from a revitalised and much stronger 'big three', as well as from its Japanese competitors, has intensified. Last year, Honda's Accord lost the title of best-selling car to Ford's Taurus. The Accord, its main profit-earner, is due for a model change later this year and, like any car coming to the end of its model cycle, has been selling less well than in the past. At the same time, the company, which is 67 per cent dependent on exports for revenues, is being battered by the sharp appreciation of the yen. The yen's rise in the year to March shaved Y70bn off its revenues. While unit sales of cars in North America declined nearly 17 per cent, in value terms they were 47 per cent down at Y1,542bn, after falling 52 per cent in 1991-92. In the domestic market, where car sales fell nearly 8 per cent, Honda faces the same problem with its Accord, which saw sales fall by about 29 per cent last year. Honda's problems lie largely from its dependence on the US market and a narrow product range that stems from its origins as a niche market manufacturer. These qualities served it well when demand in the US market was firm and the huge popularity of the Accord made up for its relative lack of other offerings with mass appeal. But they have been a big stumbling block as changes in the US market, the high yen and increased competition have eroded what advantages it had as a focused company with a head-start over other Japanese manufacturers. Honda is hoping that the launch of new models, such as the mid-range Integra which is being unveiled today, and a new Accord later this year, will help stimulate demand. It believes it has a formula for success in cost-cutting measures which have helped it to add value to products without adding to the price. Honda is also confident the restructuring will begin to show results ahead of others in the industry. The motorcycle division, for example, has doubled operating income to Y45.3bn since it was made a separate business division. But that cannot make up for the fall in car revenues as the unit price of motorcycles is so much smaller, says Mr Koji Endo, an analyst at SG Warburg. 'Honda is not a full-line maker, but neither is it a niche manufacturer any longer,' Mr Endo says. Its current size means that 'it probably can't go back to being a niche player'. If so, Honda's chances of making a comeback depend largely on whether it can hold its own against its big rivals. That, Mr Endo believes, depends to a large degree on whether the new Accord, its most popular mass market car and main profit earner, can attract enough demand after it is launched this autumn to offset what is expected to be a very slow period until then.</p>

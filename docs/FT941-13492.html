			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Settlement 'very disappointing', says Australian supplier Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian resources group and the country's biggest coal producer, yesterday described the magnitude of the price cuts for coking coal arrived at with the Japanese steel mills after the annual round of negotiations as 'very disappointing'. BHP said that hard coking coal prices would fall with effect from April 1. It added that the tonnage of hard coking to be supplied to the Japanese steel mills from its Australian coal division would fall to 7m tonnes in 1994-95, compared with 7.9m tonnes in the current year, although it added that it expected to maintain its total share of overall tonnage purchased by the mills. The price of Australian coal has already been cut in annual negotiations in recent years, under heavy pressure from the buyers. Yesterday, Mr Geoff Lill, BHP Australia Coal's marketing manager, blamed international competition and the downturn in Japanese economic activity for the poor result of the latest haggling session. 'Facing high losses. the JSM (Japanese steel mills) had requested co-operation from their raw material suppliers in the cost-cutting area,' he said. '(Our) main competitor, Canada, had attempted to use the opportunity to build its market share at the expense of Australian producers.' The weakness of the Canadian dollar, he argued, had allowed Canadian suppliers to cut prices more substantially without loss of revenue. 'BHPAC estimates that failure to be competitive could have resulted in the loss of a further 2m tonnes of hard coking coal sales from BHPAC alone, and that in the final result BHPAC would have been compelled to match prices offered by Canadian producers,' he added.</p>

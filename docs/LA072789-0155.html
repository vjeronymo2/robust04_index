			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S EAT OUT: KOREAN RESTAURANT THAT RISES ABOVE THE ORDINARY  </P> <P> Reviewing Restaurant Yeejoh has been a challenge. Why? Because I've developed a  fixation on one dish, and that makes it difficult to move on through the  absorbing menu of this Korean restaurant.  </P> <P> The dish in question is dae ji bul ko ki -- barbecued pork. It is different in  flavor from Korean barbecued beef -- more spicy, redder in color and less  strong on soy sauce. If you've got the nerve, you can eat it the way Koreans  do, rolled in cabbage leaves with cloves of raw garlic.  </P> <P> For a perfect meal, I'd have this with bin dae duk, pancakes that are soft  inside, golden brown on the outside and as tempting as an American flapjack.  The difference is, they're made from ground beans and contain bean sprouts and  green onions.  </P> <P> Such a meal would take in a lot of food because it comes with rice, tea, soup,  dessert and an assortment of relishes. These vary from day to day but usually  include at least two forms of kimchi. There also might be fried tiny fish,  marinated spinach, marinated bean sprouts, sliced fish cake, hotly seasoned  carrots, chewy, syrup-coated beans or other tidbits.  </P> <P> Because it is summer, the restaurant has switched to cold soup and iced corn  tea rather than hot. The soup the other day was mi yuk kook, a combination of  clear broth and mi yuk, which is a leafy seaweed. Employed as a restorative for  women who have given birth, this soup may follow the infants through life  because it is also served on birthdays, a Korean told me.  </P> <P> Yeejoh is owned by Bo Ae Kim, a leading Korean film actress, and her husband,  Jong Ho Kim. Although rather obscurely located in a shopping center at the far  eastern fringe of Koreatown, it does not lack for customers. The room itself is  rather plain, but gleaming wooden furniture from Korea, silken pillows in  splashy colors and waitresses garbed in the hanbok, the traditional Korean  dress, lift it from the ordinary. It is definitely not a smoke-filled room  because the barbecuing is done in the kitchen, not at the table.  </P> <P> Once I asked a Korean friend to order lunch and gave up the barbecued pork to  try a parade of sumptuous dishes. Oxtail stew -- kori kim -- was an enticing  blend of meat with Asian red dates, pine nuts, white radish and carrots, all of  this crowned with green onion tops and omelet shreds. Then came a platter of  oysters, shrimp, fish and vegetables, each piece coated with egg and fried. The  charm of this dish lies in its  </P> <P> simplicity and delicacy, but cooking it properly is not as easy as one might  think, my friend observed.  </P> <P> Then we went to the other extreme with a gutsy kimchi casserole, using its  fiery orange broth to season our rice. We also had cho gae tang, which, for my  taste, is one of the world's great soups. The menu describes it as oyster  broth, but what we had was wonderful peppery broth crammed with clams in the  shell, soy bean sprouts and a leafy green named sukat. Then we munched on  crisp, oiled, salted sheets of nori, wrapping these around rice or eating them  plain.  </P> <P> Lunch ended with fruit and bowls of sweet rice punch. Pine nuts and a few rice  grains floated in the sweet, ginger-flavored punch, which was cool and light  after our strongly seasoned meal.  </P> <P> Returning another day, I automatically chose barbecued pork but added something  new, kongae bokom. The menu's translation is crab with sauce and seasoning.  This is accurate but hardly describes what came -- a bowl piled high with crab  legs drenched with thick and spicy sauce. The procedure is to extract the crab  meat with chopsticks. If this is too difficult, one can pick up the legs and  chew them. A third option is to place the body shells on a plate, spoon on  rice, mix it with the sauce and enjoy the flavor without a struggle.  </P> <P> Yeejoh's prices are reasonable. Barbecued pork and barbecued beef are $11.50  each, which includes the accompaniments. The oyster broth-clam soup is $11.50;  kongae bokom, the crab dish, is $15.50, and kori jim, the oxtail stew, is  $13.95.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Restaurant Yeejoh, 2500 W. 8th St., No. 108, Los Angeles; call (213) 380-3346  for reservations.

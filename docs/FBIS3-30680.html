Goncz announced on Friday [4 February] that the  first round of elections will be held on May 8.    In the interview, the president said that the past four  years  were a period of looking into the past in many respects -- good  and bad alike -- but the next elections will already focus on  perspective aims. He noted that no extremist forces had ever  come to power in Hungary through elections.    According to Goncz, the most important change in the last  four years was that society has become aware of its strength and  realized that its fate is in its own hands.    MPs should mainly pass major economic laws in the remainder  of the parliamentary cycle, and abstain from adopting  legislation that another parliament of different composition  would refuse to accept, he said.    Speaking about international issues, the president mentioned  his Davos meeting with Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)  leader Yassir 'Arafat, where he expressed Hungary's readiness to  participate in reconstruction work in the Gaza Strip and  Transjordan. Arafat welcomed the proposal and said experts'  talks would follow.    Regarding his Prague consultation with the U.S. President  and  NATO's peace-partnership plan, Goncz said that security and  stability have more aspects than just the military, as they also  include human-rights, minority, social-welfare and environmental  questions.    He said Hungary had definitely come closer to NATO, adding  that the country's security can be guaranteed through  integration into all-European organizations, among them NATO and  the Western European Union.</p>

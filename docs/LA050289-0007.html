			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAURENCE PRICE TESTIFIES OF SNUB BY MULTIMILLIONAIRE FATHER  </P> <P> Laurence Price, son of multimillionaire businessman Sol Price, told a Superior  Court jury Monday that he felt ignored by his father and that he was  particularly hurt when his father refused to attend a party after his son's bar  mitzvah.  </P> <P> "I couldn't believe it," Laurence Price said. "I cried for hours and hours,  and, when the rabbi came over, I cried on his shoulder, in the bedroom. It was  the most emotionally high day and emotionally low day. I don't want to ever  have to go through that again."  </P> <P> Price, 43, is suing his father for $100 million for emotional distress he  claims his father caused by interfering with the raising of Laurence's sons,  Jonas, 17, and Benjamin, 15. He is represented by Los Angeles attorney Marvin  Mitchelson.  </P> <P> He said he still suffers from the bar mitzvah incident, which occurred in  January, 1985. He said his father attended the ceremony at a temple in the Del  Cerro neighborhood, but refused to attend the party at Laurence's home  afterward.  </P> <P> "It still affects me today," he said. "I don't know how you take it back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Serious Rift  </P> <P> Laurence said his father also interfered by helping to buy Jonas a car without  consulting him and by taking Jonas on a trip to view the campus of Stanford  University without his knowledge.  </P> <P> Although Laurence and Sol Price were at odds periodically for decades, the most  serious rift occurred about three weeks before the bar mitzvah episode,  according to Laurence's testimony. About 11:30 one night in December, 1984,  Laurence's sons, who were living with their mother, telephoned him and begged  him to come and get them, he said. He went over to pick them up and took them  to his house.  </P> <P> He described them as "distraught," but added that he was never able to  determine why they were so upset. Laurence and his wife, Emma, were divorced  and she had been awarded physical custody of the boys, although they had joint  legal custody, which meant that he had a say in major decisions about their  lives.  </P> <P> About a week later, Laurence said, he got a telephone call from his father, who  said, "Larry, take those boys back to their mother or I'm going to take away  your business and disinherit you."  </P> <P> Laurence told the jury he was "enraged" and called his father back later to  tell him "never to threaten me again."  </P> <P> To give in, he said, "would be like abandoning my children. I felt I was  abandoned by my father. If I had to lose everything, I would lose everything."  The younger boy still lives with Laurence, but the older one is living with his  mother.  </P> <P> Sol and Laurence have spoken only once since then, he said, although on  cross-examination by Sol Price's lawyer, Gerald McMahon, Laurence conceded  that, about six months later his father forgave him a $20,000 loan and  continued to give gifts to the children.  </P> <P> About eight months later, Laurence Price lost his lease to operate a tire  installation business at his father's Price Club discount warehouses. Sol Price  had set Laurence up in the business in 1978 after Laurence had been out of work  for two years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Particularly Galling  </P> <P> Laurence quit a job at the Price Club in 1976 in part because he thought the  $23,000 salary he was making was too low contrasted with that of a cousin, who  was making $35,000.  </P> <P> Particularly galling, however, was the attitude of his older brother, Robert,  who was paid $40,000 a year as president of the Price Club, Laurence said.  "Robert had very little patience with me," Laurence said, adding that his  brother sometimes ordered him out of his (Robert's) office after meetings by  saying, "That's it. Get out."  </P> <P> "I don't believe anyone has the right to do that to anyone else," Laurence  said.  </P> <P> The final straw, he said, was when Robert ordered him to get a hanger for his  coat and a trash can for his office, Laurence said. "Nobody needs this kind of  trouble," Laurence said. "It was just two frustrating."  </P> <P> For the next two years, he said, he looked for business opportunities and was  supported by his father until his father came up with the tire installation  idea, he said.  </P></p>

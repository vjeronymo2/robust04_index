			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 7 (AFP) -- French voters will choose a  successor to President Francois Mitterrand in a two-round ballot  next year on April 23 and May 7, Interior Minister Charles  Pasqua said on Tuesday [7 June].    Setting the date for the presidential ballot, Pasqua told  the  French Senate, or upper house, that the Socialist head of  state's second seven-year term ends at midnight on May 20, 1995.    Mitterrand, aged 77, has shrugged aside any idea of standing  for a third term.    First elected head of state in 1981, he has been sharing  power with a conservative coalition government since the ouster  of the former Socialist administration in elections in March  last year.    He also shared power with a conservative government from  1986  to 1988.</p>

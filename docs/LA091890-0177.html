			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KUWAITI TEAM STANDS TALL AT ASIAN GAMES;  </P> <P> CEREMONY: ATHLETES FROM THE INVADED DESERT NATION RAISE THEIR FLAG IN BEIJING,  VOWING TO CARRY ON IN THE FACE OF CRISIS.  </P> <P> Kuwaiti athletes stood defiantly to attention and white-robed officials dried  tears with their headdresses as the conquered nation's flag was raised today at  the Asian Games athletes' village.  </P> <P> All but 71 of the 320 Kuwaiti athletes, coaches and officials originally  selected to go to Beijing were trapped by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of their  desert homeland.  </P> <P> Those who made it to China had something to prove. "We've come to put our flag  high," said star soccer goalkeeper Samir Said, 27.  </P> <P> Asked if he was ready to face Iraqis on the soccer field -- a proposal to  exclude Iraq from the Games goes to a vote here Thursday -- Samir said:  </P> <P> "We've been two times champions of Asia and won the Gulf Cup seven times. Maybe  we're against the government of Iraq, not the people. I will play. It's a good  chance for me to beat them."  </P> <P> The red, green and white Kuwaiti flag was raised in the heart of the athletes'  village in the presence of Sheik Ahmed Fahd al Ahmed al Sabah, new president of  the Kuwait Olympic Committee.  </P> <P> Sheik Ahmed last month took over the post from his father, Sheik Fahd, who was  killed defending the Emir's palace from the Iraqi invaders.  </P> <P> Two of the four Asian Games torches carried across China in a monthlong relay  reached Beijing. The torches were lit in the Chinese capital a month ago and  flown to the four corners of the country, from which they were relayed back to  Beijing by 100 million runners.  </P> <P> Japan announced that it is sending Education Minister Kosuke Hori to attend the  opening ceremony on Saturday. It will be the first Cabinet-level visit between  the two countries since Beijing cracked down on last year's massive  pro-democracy movement.  </P></p>

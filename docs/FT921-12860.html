			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: JCL to be liquidated with Y129bn outstanding debts JCL, a property and sales affiliate of Janome Sewing x Machine, one of the world's leading sewing machine makers, began liquidation proceedings yesterday with outstanding debts of Y129bn (Dollars 1.04bn), which arose from Janome's dealings with a stock speculator group. The collapse of JCL symbolises the sometimes disastrous results of conservative Japanese manufacturing companies' diversification into property development and their uncharacteristic links with stock speculators during the financial frenzy of the late 1980s. Janome was entangled in the failure early last year of Nanatomi, a property and stock speculator which had outstanding debts of Y300bn and was then Japan's third largest bankruptcy on record. Through JCL and another ailing affiliate, New Home Credit, Janome had guaranteed loans of about Y187bn for Nanatomi, and was left exposed after the company's collapse. JCL had come to guarantee the money after a Nanatomi executive, Mr Masayuki Yasuda, was appointed to the Janome board in 1989, and later became its vice-president. While he claimed to have ended his days as a stock speculator, Mr Yasuda later admitted to close links to Mr Mitsuhiro Kotani, the head of the Koshin speculator group charged with attempting to extort Y30bn from Janome. Nanatomi and Koshin began buying Janome shares in late 1985, when the sewing machine maker became one of many targets of the speculative buying that was characteristic of the Tokyo market at that time. At the start of 1986, Janome shares were at Y380, by March they reached Y1,900 and in November they were trading at Y2,600. The speculators' purchase of Janome shares was partly inspired by the belief that the company's 180 fully-owned sales outlets in Japan were a potential property goldmine, bearing in mind the then fast-rising price of land. Meanwhile, Janome had hoped the loans to Nanatomi would ensure that the speculators' holding, which reached almost 40 per cent, would not be on-passed to another predator. JCL was established in 1988 as part of Janome's plans to expand into non-manufacturing business such as jewellery, restaurants and sports clubs. The company, apparently in expectation of yesterday's filing with the Tokyo District Court, had last year reduced its staff from 60 to five. While JCL is to be liquidated, Janome has the backing of its main bank, Kyowa Saitama Bank, which has already replaced several executives at the sewing machine company and whose affiliates took control of 81 per cent of JCL shares. The former president of Saitama Bank resigned last year to take responsibility for its exposure to Janome before his bank merged with Kyowa Bank. Janome has announced that a large part of a Tokyo plant will sold to pay off debts, while Kyowa Saitama has assured other creditors that it is supporting the company. The sewing machine maker is reported to have sold some of its cross-held shares in financial institutions to raise funds, including part of its stake in Kyowa Saitama. Other listed companies caught in the Nanatomi collapse, including Tobishima Corporation, the construction company, are also being restructured with the assistance of their main bank - in Tobishima's case, Fuji Bank.</p>

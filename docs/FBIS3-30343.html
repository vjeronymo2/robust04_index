He said the convoy left the northwestern town of  Banja Luka Tuesday morning and was to travel north through  Serb-held territory in order to avoid crossing the Croat enclave  of Zepce where several previous convoys have been stopped.    The last aid convoy to reach Maglaj, besieged by Serb and  Croat troops, arrived there on October 26, five months after the  previous one. Janowski said the situation in the enclave was  desperate. [passage omitted]    In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev said  Tuesday that Russia was against the international community  launching air strikes on Bosnia that could lead to an escalation  to the conflict.    Kozyrev, who spoke following a meeting with peace  negotiators  David Owen, of the European Community, and Thorvald Stoltenberg  of the UN, added that if air strikes are inevitable then they  must be "carried out within the framework of UN Security Council  resolutions and the approval of the UN Secretary General and  members of the Security Council."    He added that such strikes should not be aimed exclusively  against the Serbs but against all the belligerants.    In central Bosnia, British troops reported seeing  helicopters  flying over the regions of Novi Travnik and Vitez, where Croat  and Moslem troops are fighting, Bill Aikman, spokesman for the  UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) said.    He said the helicopter flights, carried out by both the  Moslem and Croat troops, were noticed Monday and one helicopter  from a Croat base in Vitez flew over the camp of the British UN  peacekeepers stationed nearby. The flights are in violation of  a no-fly zone declared over most of Bosnia by the United Nations.    Aikman said that the situation was relatively calm  throughout  the country Monday except in the capital and central Bosnia.    In Geneva, the UNHCR protested to Belgrade Tuesday against  the mobilisation of Bosnian Serb refugees in rump Yugoslavia  (Serbia and Montenegro), and denounced a new wave of ethnic  cleansing in western Bosnia. Spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the  mobilisation of hundreds of Serbian refugees to fight on the  warfronts in Bosnia was "illegal."    She said that often trucks went to the refugee camps at  night  to take away people by force. She said the UNHCR had also  protested to Zagreb about similar actions going on in Croatia  with Croat refugees from Bosnia.    Foa said the UNHCR was also concerned at a new wave of  killing and terror in the Banja Luka region, where Serbs are  trying to evict the last Moslems and Croats living in the region  and confiscating their property. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, Janowski said in Sarajevo that 19 containers  carrying a field hospital donated to the Moslem sector of Mostar  by a Moslem South African organisation were expected to reach  the enclave from Croatia Tuesday after a six-month delay.</p>

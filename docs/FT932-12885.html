			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Italy's quiet civil servant steps into political arena: Widely respected bank governor chosen to form government IT IS impossible to hear anyone speak ill of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the 72-year-old governor of the Bank of Italy. The high personal esteem in which he is held by politicians of all parties explains why Mr Ciampi was chosen yesterday in extremis to form Italy's 52nd post-war government. At a time of public concern over corruption, his integrity is beyond question. And he has always been scrupulously neutral in his public attitude towards the parties. As the epitome of a discreet civil servant his name has cropped up on occasions either as a figure to head a 'super' economy ministry or to head a government of technicians. He has been reluctant to press his own candidacy. Partly, this is because he is already close to retirement as governor after nearly 14 years at the helm. In February he confirmed his desire to retire when asked about rumours of his departure: 'If a person has been asked to stay on, it means that the same person has requested to go.' More importantly he lacks direct political experience. Since 1946, his entire working life has been within the confines of the Bank of Italy, and the world of central bankers. He has dealt with politicians at arms length invoking the Bank of Italy's prestige as a bi-partisan institution and has been instrumental in ensuring it has become fully independent. Over the years, the politicians have all nodded reverentially in his direction and then proceeded to ignore his advice on reigning in public spending and tackling Italy's mountain of debt. The tone of his public statements has as a result become increasingly exasperated. Last May in his annual bank statement on the state of the nation said bluntly: 'It is unacceptable that a society with a clear awareness of the nature of the problems it faces, which has identified the instruments and means of resolving them, defined its objectives, and has the resources to achieve them, is incapable of translating this into action.' He enjoys a strong personal relationship with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, which is likely to be a central factor in efforts to achieve a consensus among the political parties on electoral reform. Both are of the same generation, saw service during the war, experienced the founding of the Republic and are devout Catholics. They also have summer houses north of Rome near each other. Mr Ciampi had hoped, like many from his native Livorno, to pursue a naval career. Though invalided out because of problems with his eyes, his conversation is full of nautical metaphors and he likes to run the bank with the firmness of a ship's captain. He is going to need all this firmness.</p>

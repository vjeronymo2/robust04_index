			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> PLAYOFFS COME AND GO QUICKLY FOR MOST VENTURA COUNTY FOOTBALL TEAMS  </P> <P> Mistakes are costly at any time during a football game, but they can bankrupt a  team come playoff time.  </P> <P> Seven of nine Ventura County teams were testament to that Friday in the  Southern Section playoffs. Only Camarillo (Division II) and Oak Park (Division  XI) avoided those often-deadly miscues and advanced to the second round.  </P> <P> Ironically, Thousand Oaks, which has the county's richest tradition of playing  mistake-free football, fumbled six times and lost four during a 31-27 loss to  Lynwood.  </P> <P> Coach Bob Richards was still shaking his head Saturday.  </P> <P> "I've never had a team do that," he said. "It's an absolute mystery to me."  </P> <P> Marmonte League foes Westlake and Royal also were eliminated because, in no  small part, of mistakes. Five Warrior interceptions and a fumble were turned  into four Muir scores during a 52-13 loss.  </P> <P> "It's difficult enough to stop a team like Muir without giving them six more  opportunities," Coach Jim Benkert said.  </P> <P> Royal twice drove inside Downey's 10-yard line without scoring a touchdown and  lost, 17-10. On one drive, an illegal-procedure penalty forced the Highlanders  to settle for a field goal. On another, a holding call erased a touchdown and  the drive ended on downs.  </P> <P> Ventura, the Channel League champion, was not immune to blunders in a 59-30  loss to Capistrano Valley. Ventura's first three drives resulted in two  turnovers and a blocked punt, and, consequently, a 17-0 deficit.  </P> <P> And Rio Mesa quarterback Angel Lopez, who had thrown only three interceptions  entering the game, tossed four in a 27-7 loss to Paramount.  </P> <P> "The playoffs are a very strange time," Ventura Coach Harvey Kochel said.  </P> <P> Parting shots: Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle, who is retiring at the end  of this his 28th season at the school and 34th overall, criticized Reseda's  program in The Daily Breeze, citing Reseda's longtime reluctance to move from  the City Section 3-A Division to the 4-A level.  </P> <P> Reseda enjoyed 11 years of success at the 3-A level until this season, when the  Regents were elevated to 4-A. Reseda, which finished 5-4, even had an  opportunity to win the North Valley League title until it lost to Kennedy on  Friday.  </P> <P> "For years, Reseda cried and cried that they can't compete in the 4-A, they  can't do this, and they can't do that," Vollnogle was quoted as saying in the  newspaper's Thursday edition. "Well, they could end up winning their league  Friday.  </P> <P> "It aggravates me that people don't try to upgrade their program to a higher  level."  </P> <P> Reseda Coach Joel Schaeffer responded Saturday with accusations that Vollnogle  has built a successful program at Carson because of illegal recruiting.  Schaeffer cited the transfer of quarterback John Walsh from West Torrance to  Carson before this season.  </P> <P> An investigation this fall by the City Section office exonerated Carson but did  not convince Schaeffer.  </P> <P> "Walsh's transfer was highway robbery," Schaeffer said. "At least I don't have  any skeletons in the closet like (Vollnogle) does. I respect him for being in  the game as long as he has, but he has no right to throw daggers at anybody.  Recruiting is a big part of his program, but it isn't any part of mine."  </P> <P> A ticking bomb: Cleveland Coach Steve Landress watched too many Cavaliers  hobble toward the sidelines Friday. His frustration peaked when he was ejected  with 30 seconds remaining in a a 27-0 loss to San Fernando.  </P> <P> Landress said he was upset because officials were slow in whistling a play  dead. Landress said Cleveland running back Derrick Dumas was stopped by three  San Fernando players and a fourth player was allowed to take a final blow  before a whistle was blown.  </P> <P> A few plays earlier, sophomore tailback Ibn Bilal (knee) had become Cleveland's  fifth player to be forced from the game because of an injury. Quarterback David  Erhardt (cracked rib), Palen Sorensen (ankle), Michael Wamsganz (knee) and  Keyan Murphy (ankle) were injured.  </P> <P> "I just felt the official should have blown his whistle in that situation,"  Landress said. "Why have the kid held up like a sponge when the game's clearly  out of reach? They should be protecting the kids, and they weren't doing that."  </P> <P> Landress was penalized twice for unsportsmanlike conduct, which resulted in his  first ejection in 15 years of coaching.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, it was Landress' counterpart Friday, San Fernando Coach Tom  Hernandez, who two weeks ago filed a complaint with the City Section office.  </P> <P> "The officiating is extremely poor," Landress said. "It's the worst I've seen  in my 15 years of coaching."  </P> <P> Signings: Channel Islands center fielder Jacob Cruz, who hit .494 and was an  All-Marmonte League selection, has signed an early letter of intent to attend  Arizona State. Simi Valley's Tyler Nelson (Cal State Northridge) and  Camarillo's Mike Muncy (Arizona State) also have signed letters of intent.  </P> <P> Future signing: Rio Mesa's Dmitri Young, the state freshman, sophomore and  junior baseball player of the year, is visiting the University of Miami this  weekend. Young, a projected first-round pick in the amateur draft, is also  planning visits to Auburn, Oklahoma State, Arizona State and Texas.  </P></p>

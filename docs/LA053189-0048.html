			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> O'CONNOR TO HIKE REQUEST FOR STATE EMERGENCY FUNDS  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who elicited a skeptical response last week from the  governor's office when she asked for $34 million in emergency funds to combat  street crime, said Tuesday that she will submit a new request for a higher  amount.  </P> <P> O'Connor made the announcement after meeting with members of a newly created  Emergency Council, which is supposedly mapping out strategy to deal with a  "state of emergency" that O'Connor said has been created by a recent spate of  street gang violence. The mayor said San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen will  put together a budget proposal with the higher figure that she will submit to  Gov. George Deukmejian, possibly later this week.  </P> <P> The city is going ahead with the funding proposal despite a virtual guarantee  from Deukmejian's staff that the governor will veto the request, regardless of  the amount. O'Connor submitted the request for $34 million in emergency funding  amid much fanfare last week. Kevin Brett, Deukmejian's press secretary, said a  state of emergency is traditionally declared only after a natural disaster and  offered little hope that the governor would accede to O'Connor's request.  </P> <P> "We're still going over the concept we will present to the governor," said  O'Connor. "Thirty-four million dollars does not seem to meet our overall need."  </P> <P> Both O'Connor and Burgreen, who attended the Tuesday meeting, refused to say  specifically how much money will be needed to meet the supposed crime  emergency. However, Burgreen offered a "ballpark" figure of between $50 million  to $100 million to apply a "systemwide approach" to the crime problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Budget Surplus  </P> <P> The mayor declared the state of emergency and submitted the $34-million request  after state officials announced a $2.5-billion budget surplus.  </P> <P> O'Connor said that city officials would also ask the federal government for  emergency funding but that she was not sure which federal agency would be  approached. She said her office would contact U.S. drug czar William J. Bennett  for assistance.  </P> <P> Burgreen envisions using the state and federal funding at every level of the  criminal justice system, including hiring more police, building new detention  facilities and courtrooms and hiring more judges. The chief said the top  priority in the city's fight against crime is building new detention  facilities, which are financed by the county and administered by Sheriff John  Duffy. The county's jails are severly overcrowded, and most misdemeanor  offenders are either given citations or routinely booked and released.  </P></p>

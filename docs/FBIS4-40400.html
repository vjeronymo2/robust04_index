			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Chugayev: "The President Confirmed His </F> Choice in Favor of Reforms and Democracy"]    [Text] On the eve of his third anniversary in the post of  president of Russia B. Yeltsin made a number of statements at a  news conference which give grounds for regarding this generally  ordinary measure as the most important internal political event  not just of last week. For the first time since the 12 December  elections and referendum the country's public was able to gain a  clear idea of the president's economic and internal political  principles and plans.    Yeltsin's new political strategy was essentially made public  at the news conference. Its essence seems to be that the  president of Russia is largely restoring the status which he had  at the end of 1991, once again becoming an informal prime  minister, placing leadership of the executive under his direct  control, reforming the economy, and governing the country with  the help of edicts. At the same time the president's staff is  becoming, as it were, a second branch of the executive,  entrusted with formulating economic strategy. The tackling of  current problems has been left to the government.    Yeltsin's statements also make it possible to conclude that  there have been serious political changes in his position. The  period of vacillation -- echoes of which, in particular, were  reaching the public in the form of diverse rumors of cardinal  reshuffles in the system of the executive -- seems to have ended  for the president. Russia's economic situation has made him  finally choose one of two options: Either movement toward  building an open country with a civilized market economy, or  reversion to a closed militarized state. The president, as far  as can be judged from his statements, has definitely chosen the  first option and thereby restored his image as a reforming  democrat.    Thus, today it is possible to draw three definite  conclusions: Yeltsin has chosen the optimum political and  economic course, he has clearly demonstrated that he remains a  reforming president, and, for the first time since the new  Constitution was adopted, he has broken through the interests of  the nomenklatura and shown himself to be a leader capable of  making strategic decisions. Right now there are grounds for hope  that Russia will succeed in extricating itself from the crisis  with the minimal upheaval.    Undoubtedly, the economic situation will not yet improve  quickly. Possible attempts to destabilize the economic and  internal political situation cannot be ruled out. After his  news conference the president has gotten two powerful -- both  politically and economically -- new opponents: a section of the  commercial banks and a section of the Army. He has confronted  the former with the prospect of being squeezed in the vise of  increased state control and increased competition from foreign  colleagues, and the latter with the threat of radical reduction.  Thus, a temporary tactical alliance between these forces and  the opposition appears perfectly real. Nevertheless, there are  grounds for believing that it is perfectly realistic to preserve  political stability in Russia.    This is primarily borne out by the president's statement  that  he has no intention of changing the government or the premier.  By taking on the formulation of economic strategy, Yeltsin has  encroached upon V. Chernomyrdin's competence, since the  worsening state of the economy was weakening the president's  political positions. But at the same time he extended a hand to  him at a difficult time by stating officially that there can be  no question of any "surrender" of Chernomyrdin. Of course,  something similar was also heard in the past in respect of Ye.  Gaydar and Yu. Petrov. But in this case there are weighty  reasons to believe that words will not be at variance with  actions, at least in the immediate future. This assumption is  also confirmed by the blow which the president dealt during the  news conference to A. Chubays and V. Kvasov -- Chernomyrdin's  opponents in the government.    A rather unique situation has been created. While having  weakened Chernomyrdin as premier and as an administrator, at the  same time Yeltsin has strengthened him as a political figure.  And not just by refuting the rumors of a change of government.    After his news conference it will probably no longer be  possible for Yeltsin to reach agreement with the opposition.  But Chernomyrdin will be perfectly able to work with it. It  could essentially be a question of creating a political alliance  between the president and the premier in which the former holds  the political right flank and the center, while the latter holds  the center and the slightly left flank. It seems far from  coincidental that it was precisely the center and the opposition  in the Duma that supported the draft budget submitted by the  government, as well as the fact that, to judge from statements  by opposition leaders, they are not nurturing plans to remove  the premier but advocate only a presidential election. Although  the chief credit for the fact that the Duma adopted this, the  most optimum version of the budget, should undoubtedly go to M.  Zadornov, chairman of the Budget Committee, whose speech at the  session placed him, without exaggeration, you might say, at the  peak of the Russian political and economic elite, on a par with  Gaydar and G. Yavlinskiy.    Yeltsin, to judge from his statements, has found his second  most important point of support in the leaders of the Russian  regions. The most graphic evidence of this is provided by his  unequivocal support for Yu. Luzhkov in his conflict with  Chubays. There is no doubt that the other regional leaders will  also demand for themselves rights analogous with those accorded  the mayor of Moscow. At any rate, a similar statement has  already been heard from the leaders of "Siberian Agreement." If  you consider the fact that an accord has already been reached  between Yeltsin and the Russian governors on the transfer of the  regional apparatus to their control, then it is possible to  believe that these aspirations too will not go unsatisfied.  Yeltsin has also managed to substantially improve relations  with the republic leaders, as evidenced most vividly by his  recent visit to Tatarstan.    Finally, the third support necessary for full stability  seems  to have been found in the leadership of the central bureaucratic  apparatus. The president's phrase about the corruptness of  precisely the middle echelon of managers may be regarded as a  guarantee that top officials will not suffer such persecution.  This, in turn, destroys the monolith of the bureaucratic  apparatus, weakens its influence, and creates preconditions for  establishing control over it.    According to information available in the editorial office,  during the president's meeting with Gaydar at the beginning of  last week Yeltsin complained, in particular, that the  apparatuses of the government and of the president's staff have  grown incredibly and become unmanageable. Previously the mass  media repeatedly voiced opinions that the head of state was  increasingly becoming a hostage of the bureaucratic apparatus.  But now, as we see, the president is trying to break through  this ring.    The distribution of forces on the Russian political scene  following Yeltsin's news conference appears as follows: In  addition to the national-communist opposition, a section of the  Army and the military-industrial complex is becoming  concentrated in the camp of the president's opponents, with a  section of the commercial banks and also a section of the  central bureaucratic apparatus as temporary, tactical partners.  Mainly the middle link. Among the forces which support the  president there are, above all, the government, the majority of  the regional leaders, the oil and gas complex, and the West.  The president can also count on the support of Russian  democratic forces. Evidently, it was for precisely this reason  that he did not even send greetings to the founding congress of  the "Russia's Democratic Choice" party. Not wishing to tie  himself to a single party, Yeltsin proposes, to all appearances,  to rely on the whole spectrum of democratic forces, whose  congress, as is known, is planned for the fall. Incidentally,  such a strategy seems the optimum and probably also the only  possible one for Yeltsin if he has already made the decision to  run in the next presidential election. If this is so, it means  that we are talking of a strategy virtually chosen by the  president for the next two years.    Such a political balance and also the energy and the  capacity  for work which the president has been displaying for quite some  time provide grounds for forecasting that, despite the economic  crisis, the political situation in Russia will remain stable for  the time being. No serious upheavals are expected, apart from  some cadre reshuffles in the government.</p>

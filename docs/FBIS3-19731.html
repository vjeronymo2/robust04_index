Throughout the night and this morning, police officers and men  carried out a very thorough search of the area around  Yeoryiadhis' home on Thoukidhidhou Street in Aglanjia to locate  evidence. Police dogs were also used during the search.    The police announced that they are looking for a man of  30-35  who was seen leaving the scene at high speed aboard a small  motorcycle of the Vespa type. According to the police  announcement, this man is well built with short black hair and  was wearing a dark sports jacket and dark trousers. [passage  omitted]    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the police  have  information that yesterday afternoon, a foreign national was  asking around the area near the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  offices for information on the whereabouts of Thoukidhidhou  Street, where the murdered man lived. The government spokesman  also said that police will publish a sketch of the person within  the day.    President Glavkos Kliridhis will raise the issue of  Yeoryiadhis' murder with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's  special representative on Cyprus, with whom he is having a  working luncheon at the Presidential Palace now within the  framework of the proximity talks for the confidence-building  measures. President Kliridhis this morning asked police for a  report on Yeoryiadhis' murder as well on the recent arrest of  four foreign students in the yard of the Omeriye Mosque in  Nicosia.    Responding to correspondents' questions before his meeting  with [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas this morning in the  occupied areas, on whether he agrees with the view that  Yeoryiadhis' murder was aimed against the talks process, Clark  said he did not know the details of the tragedy and that he did  not wish to comment. Asked whether he considers the murder as a  blow to the confidence-building measures, Clark expressed the  conviction that progress on the measures can continue. He also  expressed regret over Yeoryiadhis' murder but repeated that the  process will continue.    The government spokesman said Yeoryiadhis' murder is part of  the Turkish Secret Services actions that aim to hurt the  movement for Kurdistan. He also said it cannot be ruled out  that another aim of the murder is to hurt the talks on the  Cyprus issue. Responding to a question, Kasoulidhis said  Yeoryiadhis' murder affects the climate of the talks. The  spokesman also said the government will show the necessary  response to the needs of the victim's family in such cases.    The political parties issued statements blaming Ankara for  the murder. The political parties condemn with disgust the  cowardly murder and call on the government to make every effort  to solve it. They also repeat the solidarity of the Cypriot  people with the struggle of the Kurds. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A second round of talks between Presidents Vaclav  Havel and Ion Iliescu, with the participation of the two  official delegations, took place at Cotroceni Palace this  afternoon.    In a statement to the press at the end of the talks,  President Ion Iliescu stressed the particular political  significance of the first visit that the head of the new Czech  state has paid to Romania, which demonstrates the joint will to  develop the rich tradition of relations between the two  countries on new foundations and the mutual interest in  developing bilateral relations in all areas.    As regards international issues that were approached during  the talks, Mr. Ion Iliescu stressed the joint interest for  integration in international processes and bodies and the very  good relations between Romania and the Czech Republic within  these bodies.    For his part, President Vaclav Havel, referring to the  friendship treaty between Romania and the Czech Republic, stated  that the act of signing this treaty, which will take place  tomorrow, 22 June, is a starting point for a new kind of  relations between the two countries. Mr. Havel added that  during his talks with President Iliescu and Premier Nicolae  Vacaroiu, particular attention was paid to economic relations  and ways to develop them.    The official dinner given by Romania's President Ion Iliescu  in honor of President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel is  scheduled to take place at this hour at Cotroceni Palace, our  correspondent Sorin Croitorescu informs us.    Also today, Romania's Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu met  with Vaclav Havel at the latter's rooms. The talks were  attended by Teodor Melescanu, the Romanian foreign minister, and  Jiri Skaliczky, the Czech minister of privatization. Recalling  the positive development of the framework for Romanian-Czech  relations, especially after the visit to our country by Czech  Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, Mr. Vacaroiu stressed that the new  judicial framework of bilateral relations initiated on that  occasion needs to be completed as soon as possible, with the  conclusion of a free trade agreement between the two countries,  implementing the memorandum that has been established in this  respect between the two governments. Assessing bilateral  relations between the two countries positively, the Romanian  prime minister stressed the need to develop economic and  commercial relations between the two states. In this context, an  important role is played by the exchange of experience in the  field of privatization, which is an area of great interest to  both countries.    President Havel stressed the significant drop in the volume  of bilateral commercial exchanges as a result of the collapse of  the old system of economic relations in Eastern Europe and  emphasized the need to rebuild these relations of cooperation on  the basis of the principles of the market economy. In this  respect, the process of economic and commercial rapprochement  between the two countries depends mainly on commercial  companies. However, governments are duty-bound to create a  favorable climate, something that the two countries have already  started to achieve by concluding the Romanian-Czech accord for  mutual protection of investment, the accord on avoidance of  double taxation, and the memorandum regarding the establishment  of a free trade zone.    The Czech President expressed his hope that this process  will  be crowned as soon as possible with the conclusion of the free  trade accord, which is in the process of negotiation, reads a  press statement that we have received from the spokesman of the  Romanian Government.</p>

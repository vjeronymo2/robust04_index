			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / India bans foreign share discounts The Indian government has banned foreign companies from buying shares in their stock-exchange listed Indian subsidiaries at a fraction of market prices. The decision follows protests from some Indian companies that multinationals were gaining unfair advantage by arranging for their affiliates to issue shares to them on a preferential basis at discounts of up to 90 per cent of the market price. The Finance Ministry has now ruled that shares issued to a foreign parent must be priced at a minimum of the average price of the previous six months. The ruling indicates that the government is taking serious note of complaints from some leading industrialists that the economic liberalisation which has swept India since 1991 has favoured foreign groups at the expense of Indian companies. These industrialists urged the government to create 'a level playing field' for Indian industry, including equal treatment in the capital markets. The ministry's decision does not signal any desire to hold back further liberalisation. Rather it is seen in Delhi as a response to a one-off anomaly. Foreign companies started making big-discount share issues early last year after the government relaxed curbs on stock market investment, abolishing long-standing powers to fix issue prices and permitting free pricing. Under the liberalised regime, companies were free to allot shares on preferential terms to any shareholder - as long as they secured approval from at least 75 per cent of shareholders. Shareholders were happy to grant approval to multinationals because they judged a multinational which increased its stake would also probably bring other changes such as new managers or new technology - and benefit all share-holders. Indian state-owned financial institutions, which hold the bulk of Indian shares, set rules for minimum pricing, including a minimum price/earnings ratio of 15. However, because profits in 1991 and 1992 were depressed by recession, the formula allowed companies to issue shares to their foreign parents very cheaply. Colgate Palmolive, the US toiletries group, bought stock in its affiliate at a 90 per cent discount; Burmah Castrol, the UK oil group, secured an 89 per cent discount on shares in Castrol India. Several Indian business families jumped on the bandwagon - persuading their companies to issue shares to founding families at cheap prices. Last December the institutions set an additional rule, fixing the minimum price at the average price for the previous six months. Foreign companies did not like this change, but did not object since the institutions were exercising their rights as shareholders - as they might in the US or the UK. However, the institutions' decision did not apply to every listed company because they do not always have majority shareholding - some important foreign-related companies have small institutional holdings and large numbers of individual shareholders. The government has stepped into the breach and ordered the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to impose pricing rules on share issues to foreign shareholders. The government also plans in future to amend the Companies Act to ban all preferential share issues - whether to foreign or domestic shareholders. Among foreign companies affected by the new ruling is Hindustan Lever, the affiliate of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch group, which plans three separate issues of stock to Unilever. Hindustan Lever declined to comment last night.</p>

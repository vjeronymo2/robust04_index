			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S LESSON IN JAILHOUSE VIDEO  </P> <P> Police are not merely using video cameras to record demonstrations and other  potentially explosive events where their actions may be challenged. The cameras  also have become part of the everyday fight against crime.  </P> <P> When Los Angeles sheriff's detectives are called to a murder scene, no longer  does a still photographer join them to snap shots of the body, footprints, etc.  "All our homicide teams now have video cameras," said Cmdr. Ray Morris. "I  won't say we've totally eliminated the photographer (but) we use them very  infrequently."  </P> <P> Similarly, the traditional tape recorder is being pushed aside by the new  technology when it's time to record a suspect's confession or the death-bed  testimony of a witness. It's much more effective for a jury to see the witness'  face, as well as hear his words.  </P> <P> Lighter, portable video equipment also has made it easier for police to play  "Candid Camera" in their periodic stings, such as one in Anaheim this year in  which 105 suspects were recorded selling nearly $1.4 million in stolen goods to  undercover officers posing as fences.  </P> <P> At the Beverly Hills police station, two mounted cameras have videotaped all  bookings since 1985.  </P> <P> After Zsa Zsa Gabor portrayed herself at her recent cop-slapping trial as a  woman offended by vulgar language, prosecutors were able to show the jury a  tape of her saying angrily into a jailhouse telephone: "The (expletive)  policeman picked me up and pulled me out of the car!"  </P> <P> The videotapes, kept for two years, are designed to protect the public from  mistreatment and "us from false claims," Beverly Hills Police Lt. Robert Curtis  said.  </P> <P> Although the decreasing size and cost (now an average of $940) of camcorders  has made it easier for police to use them in the field, one legal expert does  not foresee them ever being a routine part of the equipment carried in every  patrol car.  </P> <P> "They would need extra people" to man the cameras, said UCLA law professor  Norman Abrams. "I don't think we're going to reach the point where we'd spend  the resources to make that possible.  </P> <P> "The problem, of course, is there are only certain contexts where police can  use it. . . . Police catching a bank robber or a car thief are not likely to  videotape it."  </P> <P> They'd be too busy, he noted.  </P></p>

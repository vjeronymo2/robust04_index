			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Regulator may be shifting on prices Offer, the electricity industry regulator, is showing signs of compromise in talks with regional power companies over its plans for a tough regulatory framework from next April. However, the companies say the latest letter from Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer director-general, suggests there is still a wide gap between his views on distribution prices and theirs. 'The general tone is that he is prepared to consider some of the problems the industry has put to him,' said one chief executive. 'But he is still being extremely stringent and our initial evaluation is that if he made his final proposals now we would find them unacceptable.' Some analysts expecting a compromise were also encouraged by remarks by Norweb which reported annual results yesterday. Mr Ken Harvey, chairman, said he could say nothing about the contents of Prof Littlechild's letter but he confirmed that his company still expected to be able to offer real dividend growth of 6 to 8 per cent annually until the end of the decade. Some City houses believe Norweb would struggle to do so if the regulator stuck to the tough line taken in his letter earlier in the summer which was interpreted as suggesting distribution price cuts of up to 20 per cent initially and rises of inflation minus 4 per cent in subsequent years. Most analysts believe the final cuts will be less tough, although UBS believes Prof Littlechild is unlikely to move significantly. Prof Littlechild's letter of was faxed to companies on Friday evening amid tight security precautions. Norweb and Seeboard results, Page 22</p>

The estimated margins of sales at less than fair value are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on March 21, 1994 (59 FR 14148, March 25, 1994), the following events have occurred:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 11, 1994, the United States International Trade Commission (``ITC'') issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Investigation No. 731&hyph;TA&hyph;688, 59 FR 18825 (April 20, 1994)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 19 CFR 353.42(b), the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') issued its antidumping duty questionnaire to Interfit, S.A. (``interfit'') and its related U.S. company, Vallourec, Inc. (``Vallourec''), on April 29, 1994. Interfit is the only company named in the petition as a producer and exporter to the United States of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 14, 1994, petitioner alleged that Interfit was selling the subject merchandise in France at less than its cost of production (``COP''). We found reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that sales in the home market were being made at less than COP and thus initiated a COP investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 30, 1994, petitioner requested a 50-day postponement of the preliminary determination. The request was granted by the Department on July 19, 1994 (59 FR 37961, July 26, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 4, 1994, petitioner alleged critical circumstances with regard to imports of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from France.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 6, 1994, Interfit submitted constructed value (``CV'') data for models reflecting a large percentage of sales made in the United States during the period of investigation (``POI''). On September 23, 1994, Interfit provided CV information for the remaining models sold in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings having an inside diameter of less than fourteen inches (355 millimeters), imported in either finished or unfinished condition. Pipe fittings are formed or forged steel products used to join pipe sections in piping systems where conditions require permanent welded connections, as distinguished from fittings based on other methods of fastening ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> threaded, grooved, or bolted fittings). Butt-weld fittings come in a variety of shapes which include ``elbows,'' ``tees,'' ``caps,'' and ``reducers.'' The edges of finished pipe fittings are beveled, so that when a fitting is placed against the end of a pipe (the ends of which have also been beveled), a shallow channel is created to accommodate the ``bead'' of the weld which joins the fitting to the pipe. These pipe fittings are currently classifiable under subheading 7307.93.3000 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The POI is September 1, 1993, through February 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether Interfit's sales for export to the Untied States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (``USP'') to the foreign market value (``FMV''), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because Interfit's U.S. sales of certain carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings were made to an unrelated distributor in the United States prior to importation, and the exporter's sales price methodology was not indicated by other circumstances, we based USP on the purchase price (``PP'') sales methodology in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

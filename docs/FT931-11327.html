			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Auditors called to account: The DTI is studying the results of one year of professional self-regulation Within the next few days, senior Department of Trade and Industry officials are to issue their verdict on the future of audit regulation in the UK. For the accountancy profession, their conclusions are unlikely to be comforting. The first year of the new self-regulatory regime for auditors ended last October. The government is now considering the outcome in advance of a fuller review of the system at the end of this year. What emerges is a picture of failure by many parts of the profession to meet the standards it has set for itself. Equally important, far wider concerns over the scope and provision of audits and the mechanisms for their regulation have been put under the spotlight. Auditing - the annual independent scrutiny of a company's accounts - was first enshrined in UK law in the middle of the last century in response to a series of financial scandals. It became mandatory at the turn of the century for all incorporated companies - those which limit liability to assets of the business. But the question of who audits the auditors was not addressed until far more recently. It was only in 1989 that a new UK companies act - generated by requirements in the EC's eighth company law directive - introduced the requirement for regulation of the profession. A regulatory regime was set up by October 1991, to be overseen by the DTI but run by the accountancy profession's own bodies. All firms and individual practitioners who wished to audit companies had to register with one of five bodies: the three chartered accountancy institutes covering the UK, the chartered association of certified accountants, or the association of authorised public accountants - a small group outside these bodies. The reports submitted to the DTI by the five bodies have raised concerns over the quality of auditing. They examine a significant number of complaints mainly by companies or investors over issues such as the level of fees, lack of response to correspondence and inadequate audit work. Inspectors from the five professional groups identified problems in a high proportion of both random visits and those triggered by complaints. From 158 random visits to auditors by the three chartered bodies, just 11 firms passed all of a series of questions on audit independence, control, training and methods. As one senior regulator says: 'I'm not happy. It's no use sweeping it under the carpet. Serious action has to be taken.' Those views are echoed by Mr Harry Youngs, head of practice regulation at the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. 'The results don't come as any great surprise,' he says. 'One of the biggest problems for a significant minority of small practitioners is competence. The standards in the large firms have not always been reflected at the smaller end.' Two recent surveys of audit practitioners have shown that many have been forced to make fundamental changes to their systems and procedures to meet the requirements of the regulatory regime. Publicly, the regulators are playing down the findings of the reports. They say that random monitoring only got fully under way in the second half-year of the new regime, from last spring. Once firms understood that mechanisms had been introduced to monitor standards, many quickly improved their performance. Mr Colin Brown, head of the chartered accountants' audit regulation policy co-ordinating committee, says: 'It is too early to make any final judgments. There are elements that need to be remedied and they are being remedied.' Other regulators stress that many auditors judged unsatisfactory had not delivered poor-quality audits. Rather, they did not have adequate documentary records to back up their conclusions. However, the reports of the five bodies provide little evidence to support this view. What they do show is the highly segmented structure of the auditing profession. There are nearly 14,300 separate registered audit firms and practitioners in the UK (a firm counts as one, no matter how many audit practitioners it employs). But just 161 firms audit all companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, and eight firms alone audit three-quarters of them. If another tier of 1,300 large, unquoted companies is added, there are still only about 300 firms carrying out the audits. All the other auditors share the remaining 1.1m limited liability companies. Auditing standards have been focused on the few large firms which carry out the vast majority of audits on leading UK companies. But they have been applied equally to the large number of small firms and their many, less significant clients. The imbalance revealed by the figures in the reports is fuelling calls made over the past year by chartered accountants and small business groups that statutory audits should be abolished for small companies - a position currently being examined by the DTI. The submissions have also raised questions about how effective monitoring is proving. 'The problem is trying to find one set of standards to suit everyone, which are going to get under the surface of the big firms and not overload the small ones,' says Ms Stella Fearnley, an lecturer at Southampton University. One difficulty is assessing quality when many of the most important auditing issues are based on subjective judgment and rarely committed to paper. Ensuring consistency of standards across a large firm with many offices is equally troublesome. A possible solution may be peer review by partners in a comparably sized firm. Another concern highlighted by the reports is the highly complex structure of regulation. The three chartered bodies have a single joint monitoring unit which inspects firms and then refers any problems to their three separate registration and disciplinary committees. The certifieds have their own monitoring unit, which also carries out supervision for the authorised accountants. The existence of separate bodies is a legacy of fiercely independent professions with their own qualifications and practices. But it creates difficulties in ensuring that audit regulation is consistently applied. The target number of visits and the time spent on them varies. The certifieds have pledged to inspect each auditor every five years. The chartereds have only made this commitment for the auditors of listed companies. Their current plans - ratified by the DTI - allow them to inspect just 150 of the remaining firms each year, which means that they will take 60 years to cover all practitioners. There is a final, wider issue: whether the profession can police itself effectively. While many auditors have been criticised in the three reports, the number against whom action has been taken is smaller (see chart), and none of the disciplinary proceedings is open to public scrutiny. All the bodies are caught between two roles which may be incompatible - as regulators upholding the public interest and as trade associations representing their members' interests. On one hand, they face rising regulatory costs - totalling more than Pounds 4m last year - which are passed on to their members in annual registration fees and compliance costs. On the other, any threat of withdrawing audit authorisation could jeopardise their members' livelihoods. Both may increasingly threaten to compromise their ability to act independently. Add to that, growing public scepticism towards auditing in the light of recent corporate frauds and collapses, and the demand for accountants to be independently regulated so they can be seen to be independent may yet prove irresistible.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  UK AUDIT REGULATION: OCT 91-SEPT 92  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Chartered    Certified    Authorised                                    accountants  accountants  accountants  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Individual members                  113,000       39,000       1,100 No. of firms/practitioners registered for audits                 9,850        3,890         550 No. of inspections                      212          297          49 Share of registration applications rejected or withdrawn by firms                    11%           -          11% No. of complaints                       175          245          18 Unsatisfactory inspections               55%          55%         65% No. of firms struck off                  10            6           3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Professional bodies' audit regulatory reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

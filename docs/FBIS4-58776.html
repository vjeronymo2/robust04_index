			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 7 (AFP) -- The Arab League decided here  Saturday [7 May] not to intervene in Yemen's civil war after the  northern-led government turned down an Egyptian proposal to send  Arab peacekeepers to halt its conflict with the south.    But permanent delegates at the Cairo-based organisation  called on its secretary general, 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, to pursue  efforts to end the conflict which erupted on Thursday.    A diplomatic source said the League decided to abstain on  the  Egyptian proposal after it had been turned down by the north.    Senior southern leader 'Abd-al-Aziz al-Dali had said earlier  the south could favour Egyptian proposals to send a peacekeeping  force.    He said the southern Yemen Socialist Party (YSP) led by  Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid "supported all measures by the  Arab League," after meeting with 'Abd-al-Majid.    And he added that if the "situation is necessary and if it  is  imperative in order to stop the fighting" then the YSP was in  favour of sending a peacekeeping force "even if northern leaders  reject it."    Foreign Minister Muhammad Salih Basindwa earlier opposed the  emergency meeting in Cairo, insisting the three days of intense  fighting in Yemen was an "internal affair."    'Abd-al-Majid told journalists after the meeting behind  closed doors that the Arab countries had charged him with  "continuing efforts to stop the fighting immediately."    They also repeated their support for Yemen, where fighting  erupted Thursday between rival forces from the former North and  South Yemen which were unified in May 1990.    The proposal put forward by Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Musa needed the backing of both the Arab League and Yemen.</p>

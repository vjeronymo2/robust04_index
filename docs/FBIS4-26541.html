			<p>BFN     [Text] On the afternoon of 19 June, the municipal party  committee and the municipal government held a meeting of leading  cadres of districts, counties, and bureaus to mobilize leading  cadres at all levels and cadres of party and government organs  to concentrate a period of time on going deep to enterprises and  the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study, to  size up the situation, to ponder practical ways and do practical  things, to conscientiously find out where we are lagging behind,  to formulate measures, to sum up the work of the first half of  the year in a down-to-earth manner, and to make arrangements for  the work of the second half of the year. The meeting stressed:  It is necessary to fully understand the major significance of  this activity of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct  investigation and study and to do practical things, extensively  create a trend of conducting investigation and study and making  earnest efforts to do practical things in the whole  municipality, push all fields of work to a new height,  comprehensively fulfill or overfulfill this year's various  tasks, and lay a solid foundation for Tianjin's reform and  development during next year and for some time to come and for  creating further brilliant success in Tianjin.    Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal party committee, gave  an important speech. Zhang Lichang, deputy secretary of the  municipal party committee and municipal mayor, presided over  the meeting. Li Jianguo, deputy secretary of the municipal  party committee, Nie Bichu, chairman of the municipal people's  congress standing committee, and Liu Jinfeng, chairman of the  municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, attended the meeting.    In his speech, Gao Dezhan pointed out: The main implications  of this activity of concentrating a certain period of time on  going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct investigation and  study and to do practical things are: Conducting investigation  is aimed at sizing up the situation and conducting study is  aimed at pondering practical methods. With practical methods in  hand, we should also implement them and do practical things. We  must see the actual results to judge whether we have really  implemented them or not. This move is aimed at developing the  current excellent situation and better promoting the work of the  second half of this year. Generally speaking, in going to the  grass-roots units, we have three major objectives: First, we  must further promote the change of work style of leading cadres  and the change of functions of leading organs. During this  activity of going deep to the grass-roots units, leading cadres  at all levels must conduct investigation and study and ponder  practical methods. All leading organs should change functions  and do practical things. Second, we should further develop our  municipality's excellent situation and maintain a good trend in  all fields of work. In line with the overall plan of the  enlarged plenary session of the sixth municipal party committee,  we should promote this work during the middle stage, size up the  situation through conducting meticulous investigation and study,  know how the matter stands, list out the difficult points, find  out the problems, and put forward countermeasures and measures  in the light of the problems and weak aspects. Third, we should  further maintain close ties with the masses and mobilize the  enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Through this  activity, we should further improve the mass feelings, pool the  strength of the masses, further arouse the enthusiasm of the  broad masses of people in participating in reform, promoting  development, and safeguarding stability, and form a vivid  situation in the whole municipality in which the higher and the  lower levels work with one heart and one mind and make concerted  efforts to carry out reform and construction.    Gao Dezhan stressed: the general tasks and demands of this  activity of conducting investigation and study and doing  practical things are to size up the situation, ponder practical  methods, and do practical things on the basis of summing up the  work of the first half of this year and making work arrangements  for the second half of the year, grasp the work of the second  half of this year more firmly, rapidly, and successfully,  comprehensively fulfill the aforementioned three objectives, and  successfully accomplish the following four tasks. 1) We should  conscientiously sum up the work of the first half of this year.  In addition to summing up the achievements and experiences in a  down-to-earth manner, we should also honestly find out problems  and where we are lagging behind. It is also necessary to place  the emphasis in sizing up the real situation and fining out  where we are lagging behind. In this aspect, we should attend to  the major issues. First, we should maintain close connection  with the overall work situation of the entire party and country,  with an emphasis in finding out where we are lagging behind in  deepening reform, expanding opening up, promoting development,  and maintaining stability, and in ending deficits, increasing  profits, and raising efficiency. Second, on the basis of finding  out where we are lagging behind in the system of assuming  responsibility for fulfilling a certain work objectives, we  should conscientiously investigate and examine the situation of  implementing this system among leading cadres. Third, we should  find out where we are lagging behind in the major work of our  own departments, localities, and units. In this aspect, we  should not only find out where we are lagging behind in work but  also in ideology. 2) We should make proper work arrangements for  the second half of the year. On the basis of summing up the  work, we should specify countermeasures and measures for  successfully carrying out the work of the second half of this  year and formulate practical methods that comply with the  reality and are workable, and can solve problems. It is  necessary to avoid giving vague and general directions while  formulating measures and making work arrangements. As far as the  work of whole municipality is concerned, the various tasks  defined in this year's work targets responsibility system must  be fulfilled or overfulfilled, the unfulfilled ones left over by  the first half of the year must be accomplished, the weak  aspects must be strengthened, and all fields of work set for  this year must be done better compared with last year; during  the second half of this year, strenuous efforts must be exerted  to deepen reform, particularly enterprise reform, tackle reform  problems, and accomplish this year's reform tasks and  objectives; energy should be concentrated on ending enterprise  deficits, increasing profits, and raising efficiency during the  second half of the year, and more financial revenues should be  collected, more profits should be created by enterprises, and  the urban and rural masses should earn more. Difficult  enterprises, in particular, should strive to rapidly take a turn  for the better and enable staff and workers to have a higher  income. Furthermore, we should realistically attend to spiritual  civilization, comprehensive improvement of public security, and  party building. 3) We should concentrate efforts on summing up  and popularizing a number of typical examples. To grasp the  typical examples, it is necessary to sum up a number of good  examples during this activity of going to the grass-roots units  and achieve big breakthroughs in using typical experiences to  promote work in the entire area and to solve difficulties in  work. 4) We should help the grass-roots units solve problems  and do practical things for enterprises in a down-to-earth  manner. During this activity, we should go not only to units  which have done a good job in their work but also to units with  great difficulties and many problems in an effort to attain the  goal of doing practical things and helping grass-roots units  solve problems in the course of conducting investigation and  study. It is necessary to realistically change functions, exert  real efforts to do practical things for enterprises and  grass-roots units, honestly do some practical things for  enterprises, and create good external conditions for them. The  number of problems solved should be regarded as a standard for  testing the results of this activity.    Gao Dezhan demanded: To organize this large-scale activity,  we have to concentrate a period of time, assume heavy tasks, and  set high standards because it involves the work of many sectors.  Party committees and governments at all levels must attach  prime importance to it, realistically strengthen leadership,  organize work carefully, clearly define tasks, attend to  priorities, and guarantee that this activity will be smoothly  carried out and actual results will be achieved. 1) We should  carry out all sorts of organizational work in places where it is  needed. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly the first  two top leaders, should take the lead in going to the  grass-roots units, earnestly practice what they advocate, and  take the lead in setting examples. We must set the time.  Cadres going to the grass-roots units must guarantee that they  will devote more than 15 days to conducting investigation and  study at the grass-roots level and do practical things for them.  The entire activity must be carried out in a well-organized and  planned manner, and by no means should it be let alone. 2) We  should highlight priorities. It is necessary to proceed from our  own reality, attend to the major contradictions, grasp the  priorities and key units, strive to effectively solve a number  of difficult problems that affect or restrict the development in  various fields, enable a number of key units to achieve fairly  big progress in their work, and make some backward units or  units with many problems have a turn for the better and change  the outlook. 3) We should realistically change the work style.  We must not just travel from one office to another. We should  go to plants, rural areas, shops, schools, and the grass-roots  units. We must be good at using our brains, realistically size  up the actual situation, ponder practical methods, and attain  the aim of seeking actual results. We must be clean and  self-disciplined and be thrifty and simple in work style, use  simple means of transportation and have fewer people in our  company, and become one with the masses, and must not give  trouble or add burdens to the grass-roots units. Still less  should we be allowed to seek special privilege or practice  unhealthy trends. 4) We should pay attention to actual results.  In addition to realistically sizing up the real situation,  pondering practical methods, doing practical things, solving a  number of problems, and expediting the work, all levels should  do a good job in summing up their work done during the first  half of this year and make work arrangements for the second half  of the year. Each and every leading cadre should genuinely go  to the grass roots to get firsthand information and personally  write his investigation report.    Gao Dezhan emphatically pointed out: Recently, Comrade Jiang    Zemin gave a speech at the commencement of the fourth  theoretical discussion class for principal leading cadres of the  provincial and ministerial levels in which he gave important  views on the issue of unceasingly deepening the study of Comrade  Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in the whole party. This speech is of great  guiding significance in successfully carrying out this  municipality-wide activity of conducting investigation and study  and doing practical things. The process of going deep to the  grass-roots units to conduct investigation and study is not only  a process of applying scientific theories to solving practical  issues but also a process of bringing practical issues to the  class in the course of deeply studying this theory. This  activity of going deep to the grass-roots units to conduct  investigation and study and to do practical things for them is a  major move of summing up and popularizing the work in line with  the general tasks of the whole party and country; a major move  of promoting the change of work style of cadres and the change  of functions of organs and maintaining close ties with the  masses; and a major move of deeply studying Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics in line with reality. During this process, we  should consciously combine the activity of conducting  investigation and study and doing practical things with the  study of theory, use this theory to guide practice, solve  practical problems, and enable the ideological and theoretical  levels and the ability of solving practical problems of cadres  at all levels to enter a new height.    Zhang Lichang called for efforts to rapidly relay the  guidelines of this meeting to leading bodies at all levels and  cadres of all party and government organs, unify thinking,  enhance understanding, proceed from the reality of one's own  department, locality, and unit, organize the work carefully, and  make overall planning and proper arrangements; strengthen  leadership, set strict demands, clearly define the tasks for  cadres going down to the grass-roots units, and avoid formalism.  It is necessary to solve problems and to expedite the work in  the course of conducting investigation and study, and strive to  achieve actual results.    Also attending this meeting were members of the standing  committee of the municipal party committee, vice chairmen of the  municipal people's congress standing committee, vice mayors,  vice chairmen of the municipal committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference, and principal responsible  comrades of various departments, committees, offices, districts,  counties, bureaus, and mass organizations, a total of 700 people.</p>

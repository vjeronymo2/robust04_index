			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Karlov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 1 TASS -- The orators at a meeting in the  centre of Moscow sponsored by the Moscow Federation of Labour  Unions demanded that the government pay up on its salary  obligations, index salaries to the inflation rate, give state  subsidies to the agricultural sector, get rid of unemployment,  establish strict control over retail trade, and do much more.    As always happens with such demonstrators, there was no lack  of anti-president and anti-government slogans. All the speakers  finished their appearances with hurrahs for international  workers' solidarity day. However, in contrast to previous  years, there were no representatives of the international  proletariat at the meeting.    The Moscow Federation of Labour Unions collected about ten  thousand demonstrators for its march from Triumfalnaya (Triumph)  Square to the Manezh just across from the Kremlin, which started  at nine a.m. this morning. By the time the procession reached  the meeting place, it had lost half its participants. Dominant  were representatives from almost all the trade unions, the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and guests from many  Russian regions.    The meeting was over at 10:30, by which time the square had  practically emptied.</p>

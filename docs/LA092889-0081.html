			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: COMPTON;  </P> <P> DYMALLY SEPARATES HIMSELF FROM TUCKER RECALL  </P> <P> Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) was quick this week to separate himself from  a recall movement being organized against one of his political foes, Compton  Mayor Walter R. Tucker.  </P> <P> In a letter that Dymally released to the public, he told the mayor, "There is  no justification for disgruntled citizens to seek to remove you from office. .  . . You were overwhelmingly reelected. . . . The people have spoken."  </P> <P> The recall effort is being promoted by Concerned Citizens of Compton, a group  that was formed this summer by Benjamin Holifield and Basil Kimbrew. They claim  to have 120 members. Holifield, a local businessman, was an unsuccessful City  Council candidate this year. Kimbrew, a political consultant, managed the  campaign of Tucker's opponent.  </P> <P> Kimbrew also managed the campaign of Councilwoman Patricia Moore, who was  elected with some help from her former boss, Dymally. Tucker has accused Moore  of being behind the recall effort. She denies it.  </P> <P> Kimbrew said this week that his citizens group is still planning to serve the  mayor with a recall notice at Tuesday's council meeting. City police and  firefighters are threatening to join the recall effort because Tucker is  advocating that the city abolish its public safety departments and contract  with the county for those services at a lower cost.  </P></p>

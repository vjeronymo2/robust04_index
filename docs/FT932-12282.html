			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Workplace pensions are less popular THE PROPORTION of employees who belong to an occupational pension scheme has been falling, according to the 1991 General Household Survey published today. The survey shows that the proportion of full-time employees who were members of their employer's pension scheme fell from 61 per cent in 1988 to 59 per cent in 1991. The fall was entirely accounted for by a decline in pension-scheme membership among full-time male employees from 64 per cent to 61 per cent during the period. Membership among full-time women employees remained stable at 55 per cent, and rose for women part-timers. The survey found higher earners were more likely to belong to an occupational pension scheme than the low-paid. Membership of employers' pension schemes tended to rise with age and service. Three quarters of full-time professionals belonged to an occupational pension scheme, compared with 44 per cent of unskilled manual workers. The survey includes details about membership of personal pension schemes for the first time. Among employees, 25 per cent of men and 15 per cent of women were members of such personal pension schemes in 1991. Among the self-employed, membership of personal pension schemes was much higher, at 63 per cent for men and 30 per cent for women. Few employers appeared willing to contribute to personal pension schemes - 85 per cent of male full-time employees received no contribution from their employer. The survey presents annual data on population characteristics, households and families, marriage, economic activity, education, health and housing. General Household Survey 1991. HMSO.

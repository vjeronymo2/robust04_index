			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Thorntons hit by French provisions THORNTONS, the chocolate maker and retailer, was plunged deeply into the red in the year to June 26 by the cost of restructuring lossmaking French businesses and new accounting rules. The company warned of the impending problems in May. The loss was Pounds 4.8m against a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.2m a year earlier. Operating profits of Pounds 9.35m (Pounds 10.4m) were wiped out by one-off provisions of Pounds 7.63m made against restructuring in France as well as a Pounds 5.41m charge for goodwill previously written off to reserves taken to the profit and loss account. But the board, confident about the future, recommended a maintained final dividend of 2.4p to give a same-again total of 3.65p. Losses per share were 11.94p (profits of 9.9p). 'The current year will see the benefit of the changes we made in the past year to our management and organisational structure,' said Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive. Sales rose to Pounds 92.5m (Pounds 84.3m). 'On a like-for-like basis UK sales were up 4.8 per cent. We are seeing the benefit of a lot of work on our ranges and pricing points and believe this performance is good against the broader retail background.' In the UK and Belgium total sales rose 8.3 per cent to Pounds 81.9m giving operating profits of Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 11.4m) as Thorntons opened a net 12 new shops and franchised 27 others. The company said start up and launch costs associated with product development during the year had depressed UK operating margins. Total turnover in France was Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 8.73m) and operating losses were Pounds 1.74m (Pounds 960,000). The company has appointed Mr John Coyle as managing director, Europe. He is now based in Paris. The restructured operation will consist of 35 confectionery and ice cream shops, down from 60, concentrated in the Paris region. Borrowings at the year end were Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 2m) giving gearing of 19 per cent (4 per cent). Interest payments climbed to Pounds 978,000 (Pounds 565,000). COMMENT Thorntons' French folly has now cost at least Pounds 20m including accumulated losses and restructuring provisions. It bought lossmaking businesses at the top of the market and then found profits resisted the export of its management expertise and product lines. The company says the pain is over now, with the remaining shops profitable in spite of the downturn in France. Meanwhile, strength in the UK, where most of the business is based, surprised some in the market, with last year's revamp of the core ranges apparently paying off. Still, with analysts forecasting profits of Pounds 11.5m, a multiple of 14 is a discount to other specialist retailers but stands at a small premium to Cadbury Schweppes.</p>

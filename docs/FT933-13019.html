			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St Andrew Trust lifts net assets 15% ST ANDREW Trust, the smaller companies trust now controlled by the Ecclesiastical Insurance Office, reported a net asset value of 287.2p per share as at June 30. Mr David Ross Stewart, chairman, said: 'The rise in net asset value per share of over 15 per cent (against the year-end value of 249.5p) is a welcome vindication of our faith in smaller companies.' Year-on-year net asset value showed an increase of 26 per cent. Attributable revenue at this Martin Currie-managed trust dipped to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.22m) for the six month period. The chairman added: 'Our revenue from dividends is holding up well despite a general slowdown in dividend growth and significantly lower interest rates on our cash deposits'. The trust's Japanese portfolio expanded by more than 50 per cent over the period and 'good moves from other Far East markets fully justified our international stance', he added. Overseas investment currently accounts for almost 32 per cent of the portfolio. The interim dividend is maintained at 2.7p, payable from earnings of 3.51p (3.56p) per share.</p>

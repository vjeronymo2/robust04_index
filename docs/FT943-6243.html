			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Economic Watch: Surge in Italian trade surplus Italy's overall trade surplus for the first six months of 1994 could be nearly double the surplus in the first half of 1993, according to estimates published yesterday by the Italian Exchange Office. Taking into account flow of funds through the banking sector, and provisional data on debit and credit transactions, the Exchange Office estimated the trade surplus in the first six months at L16,000bn (Pounds 6.62bn). For the first half of 1993, official figures showed a surplus of L8,611bn. Excluding credit and debit transactions, Italy recorded an overall surplus in the first six months of 1994 of L4,607bn. That compared with a deficit of L2,071bn in the equivalent period last year. In June, the surplus was L2,217bn against L776bn in May, and L616bn in June 1993. The figures showed that payments for goods reached L19,242bn in June, an increase of 5.3 per cent on June 1993, while receipts rose by 13.6 per cent to L21,459bn. Consumers in the Netherlands borrowed 5.8 per cent more in the first half of 1994 than in the same period a year earlier. The Central Bureau for Statistics said consumers borrowed Fl 6.3bn (Pounds 2.3bn) in the latest January-June reporting period. Purchases of cars and video equipment were prominent among the purposes of the borrowing, the agency added. The Dutch index of manufacturing orders in hand rose to 103.7 in July from 103.5 in June, the Central Bureau of Statistics said. Orders to eastern German manufacturers rose 19.6 per cent in June from May and were up 15.3 per cent from June 1993, Germany's Economics Ministry reported yesterday.</p>

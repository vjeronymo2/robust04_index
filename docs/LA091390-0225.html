			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOKCHAPMAN'S CAMPUS RECRUITING KEEPS WATER POLO TEAM  AFLOAT  </P> <P> In his six weeks at Chapman College, water polo Coach Bill Brown hasn't had  time to scout opponents. He's been busy with major reconnaissance work on his  own campus.  </P> <P> Brown, the former water polo and swimming coach at Fullerton College, has used  creative recruiting tactics to fill out a team on a campus that doesn't have a  swimming pool.  </P> <P> The five team members remaining from last season's 11-13 team are solid  players, Brown said, but seven are needed to play a match. So Brown and his  players set up water polo information booths at a couple of campus activity  fairs and Brown also enlisted a friend in the admissions office to help with  recruiting.  </P> <P> "He screened applications and if they said anything about water he'd direct  them to me," Brown said.  </P> <P> At least one player -- Dan Gilmartin, a freshman who played water polo at San  Mateo High School -- signed up in this fashion. Brown said Gilmartin is one of  the team's top players, along with returning players Scott Law, Asher Provda,  Mark Cantin, Mike Reid and goalkeeper Eric Wetzell.  </P> <P> Other newcomers are the fraternity brothers of some of the team members, Brown  said.  </P> <P> "It's water polo or the pledge paddle," he said, joking.  </P> <P> Eight players were eventually added to the team, one short of the number needed  to hold an intrasquad scrimmage. But it was enough to run a program.  </P> <P> "Several didn't know the school had a water polo team and five had never played  before," Brown said. "But that's great. If they played youth soccer and know  how to swim they can pick up (water polo)."  </P> <P> That might be so, but Whittier defeated Chapman, 12-6, Wednesday. It seems the  Panthers have a bit more to learn.  </P> <P> Chapman had little trouble winning the Naval Academy women's volleyball  tournament last weekend, breezing through six matches without losing a game.  </P> <P> The Panthers defeated Nebraska Omaha,which was ranked ninth in the American  Volleyball Coaches Assn. preseason poll, in the quarterfinals and Juniata of  Huntingdon, Pa. -- runner-up in the Division III championships last season --  in the final.  </P> <P> "I think we did really well in the tournament in what was really our first week  of playing," Chapman Coach Mary Cahill said. "With volleyball it's hard to win  three straight (games in a match) no matter what team you play against. When we  played against weaker teams we didn't play their game, we played ours."  </P> <P> The trip to the tournament in Annapolis, Md., was partly intended as a way for  the Panthers (10-4) to get some eastern exposure, Cahill said. Chapman has had  difficulty gaining recognition in the East, Cahill said, despite playing in the  California Collegiate Athletic Assn., a conference that has won five of the  nine Division II championships.  </P> <P> After losing to UC Riverside in the regional playoffs last season and finishing  27-6 and eighth-ranked nationally, Chapman seems to be getting more respect.  The Panthers were ranked 15th in the preseason coaches' poll and moved up to  11th in this week's rankings. They will play host to eighth-ranked West Texas  State at 7:30 tonight at Chapman.  </P> <P> New blood: The Chapman women's basketball team, which has no starters returning  from last year's team, has added three experienced players.  </P> <P> They are:  </P> <P>  -- Jennifer Ballenger, a senior point guard who started three games for Idaho  last year.  </P> <P>  -- Marvette Williams, a senior post player who played two seasons for Compton  College, averaging 21 points and 14 rebounds during the 1987-88 season.  </P> <P>  -- Linda Kirby, a junior guard from Ohlone College in Fremont, averaged 22  points and six assists a game last season.  </P> <P> College Division Notes  </P> <P> Pacific Christian has filled its three coaching vacancies. Mike Sutherland, who  coaches soccer at La Mirada High School, will coach the men's soccer team.  Donna Krieger, a former National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics volleyball  All-American at Cal Baptist in Riverside, will coach the women's volleyball  team. Krieger is the wife of Gene Krieger, women's volleyball coach at Cal Poly  Pomona. Darin Grebel, who coached volleyball at Workman High in La Puente and  at a missionary high school in Kenya last year, is the men's volleyball coach.  . . . Christ College Irvine has hired Jack Robinson, who coached baseball at  Southern California College for three years in the late 1970s, as softball  coach. He replaces Mike McGuire, who resigned in June after leading the Eagles  to a share of the Golden State Athletic Conference championship. The college  also hired Darren Hoff, a former minor league player, as an assistant baseball  coach. Roger Davis, Christ College's cross-country and track and field coach  for three years, has resigned.  </P></p>

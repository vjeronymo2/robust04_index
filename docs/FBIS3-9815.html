			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Bosnia-Herzegovina Vice President Ejup Ganic: </F> "The End of an Aristocratic Play"]    [Text] What does the Pax Americana that has been signed in  Washington, the capital of European diplomacy, bring to us? In  addition to that, the visit of British Prime Minister Major, and  his view expressed in the talks that the first principle of the  London conference (forcefully taken territories are not to be  recognized), at which he was presiding, and the statement to a  CCN [as published, probably CNN] journalist after the meeting,  that pressure ought to be exerted on Serbs, is what makes the  recent days politically harmonized.    The made-in-America beginning of peace in Bosnia is bringing  about currently the most important thing -- a chance for peace.    The United States is neither a country of sentiment, nor of  charity, nor of the generous Slav soul, and even less of the  self-loving, rigid, frustrated diplomats of the former great  powers, who tried to cure their spinster-like neuroses by  dealing with Bosnia. The United States, which fortunately did  not turn proletarian, has simplified the Bosnian crisis,  breaking it down to its tiniest components, and rewound the  entire film back to its beginning. And the beginning of  everything was the Serbian aggression, in those April days of  1992, when the Serbian army massively set off across the Drina  River, following the example of great Soviet tank offensives in  World War II. In only 10 or so days, by fire and sword, with  streams of blood and incredible crimes, that army took hold of  Bosanski Brod, Zvornik, Foca, Visegrad....    At the very beginning the Americans unmistakably  distinguished between the good guys and the bad guys. What  happened later in Bosnia-Herzegovina, under the rule of European  mediation, is well known. Americans, the masters of  simplification, have gone much further: The good guys will live  together, while the bad guys may join the good guys, but the war  criminals must be brought to justice. I ask the readers not to  insist on subtleties, or details, of all those Balkan mysticisms  by which Belgrade has so skillfully befogged the war in Bosnia.  Milosevic wanted to turn his classic aggression into a civil  war, and to misrepresent all his conquests as though they were  done in self-defense....    Therefore, the paper that was signed in Washington is a  result of the systematized chronology, and of the determination  that the world should finally start dealing with things the way  that Europe should have dealt with them as early as April and  May 1992. The Washington agreement means also the end of  diplomacy's being an aristocratic play. Lord Carrington, Lord  Owen, and citizen Stoltenberg made a mistake while cribbing  their exam-paper in mathematics, and all the time they believed  they were right, until they themselves fell victims to their  delusion. They mixed up apples and pears, that is, the  aggression and the legitimate resistance of a sovereign country.  The Washington initiative has definitely pensioned them off.    Bosnia-Herzegovina, just like the phoenix, is slowly and  with  difficulty rising from its ashes. The new interior arrangement  of Bosnia is just being designed. The sooner the Serbs join the  negotiations and give back what they seized, the more  comfortable their future home will be for them.    But let us not fool ourselves that the war is over just  because the peace pipe was so joyfully smoked on Capitol Hill.  If Sarajevo is no longer so savagely shelled, while Bihac,  Maglaj, and Olovo still are, that does not mean we should be  satisfied that the war, perhaps even a more fierce one, has  moved into the interior of the country.    There will be no peace in Bosnia without peace in its most  distant hamlet. There will be no peace in Bosnia unless all  those who were expelled and displaced in the process of ethnic  cleansing (read: genocide) return to their homes. For that  reason I believe that the Washington agreement is but a first  step toward a just solution.    Because we are wiser, given the experience of one war, and  more cautious, given the prospect of peace.</p>

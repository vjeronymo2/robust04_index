			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--Taysir Qub'ah, deputy speaker of the  Palestine National Council, has stated that the Cairo agreement  on the security arrangements at the crossing points in Gaza and  Jericho is a new indicator of the threats posed by both the Oslo  agreement and the policy of selling out our people's national  rights.    Qub'ah added that the Cairo agreement clearly proves the  quality of the field arrangements and applications of the Oslo  agreement. It is also a new submission to the Israeli conditions  and the U.S.-Egyptian pressures, and includes serious  concessions which undermine our people's national sovereignty  over their land, and deals a blow to our people's supreme  interests. These interests are linked to our people's right to  self-determination and to establishing an independent national  state.    Qub'ah pointed out that in return for formal and marginal  powers for the Palestinian authority, which will save the  leadership's face a little and grant it private personal  privileges, there is recognition of Israel's full control of the  borders, crossing points, passages, and roads. Under the  agreement, the settlements remain and Israel maintains  supervision of their security as well as the security of the  Israelis in the occupied territories. Also, the Israeli  military orders remain valid without even a modest mention that  such orders would be circumvented later. Thus, the Israeli  military authorities' hegemony over both the external and  internal security will be consecrated, Qub'ah added.</p>

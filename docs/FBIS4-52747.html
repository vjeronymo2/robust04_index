			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- The Chinese Government is  moving to introduce a voluntary curb on textile exports to  Japan, a Japanese trade ministry source said Friday [13 May].    The step is designed to prevent Japan from invoking a  discriminatory curb on textile imports from China, a protective  measure allowed under the Multifiber Agreement (MFA), the source  at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said.    The source said Beijing sent MITI a letter stating it  supported the voluntary textile export cap. The letter was sent  when Hiroshi Kumagai, chief cabinet secretary, was a MITI chief.    The MFA, which took effect in 1974, is intended to protect  Japan and other Western industrial countries, major textile  importers, from possible damage to their domestic textile  industries due to massive textile exports by China and other  developing nations.    The recently concluded Uruguay Round accord on global trade  calls for a phased removal of managed trade practices, such as  voluntary export restraints.    In line with the global trade policy, Tokyo announced  earlier  this year that it will scrap a voluntary curb on U.S.-bound car  exports starting this year.</p>

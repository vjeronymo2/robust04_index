			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honolulu, March 19 KYODO -- Japanese Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii stressed Saturday [19 March] the  importance of developing capital markets in the nations of the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Fujii, speaking at a press conference after a two-day  meeting  of APEC finance ministers here, gave high credits to the  gathering but reserved his comments on making it a regular one.  "It is first necessary to create an environment that  facilitates flow of private funds in the APEC nations which has  become a world growth center," Fujii said.    In a joint statement issued at the end of the conference,  the  17 APEC ministers agreed to develop their capital markets and  improve capital flows as their principles of policy formation in  the region. Praising the first-ever gathering of the APEC  finance ministers, Fujii said, "we were able to learn together  with (other APEC) nations that are continuing to stage diverse  (economic) growth."    Fujii confirmed that the ministers agreed to meet again next  year in Indonesia but he showed a negative stance on holding it  regularly. "It moves under the atmosphere at that time."    Meanwhile, Japanese officials quoted Fujii as saying at the  meeting that the APEC nations must pursue "sound macroeconomic  policy primarily to raise domestic savings to maintain high  economic growth." They also said Fujii offered financial  support both bilaterally and multilaterally to other APEC  nations.    APEC groups the United States, Japan, Canada, China, Taiwan,  Hong Kong, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore,  Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Mexico  and Papua New Guinea. Chile was also represented at the Hawaii  meeting as it is due to join the APEC forum this fall.</p>

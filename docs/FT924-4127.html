			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Belgium (7): Impact of 'little bang' is slightly muted - Computer delay hits Belfox Belgium's 'little bang' - the government reforms which came into force at the beginning of last year - was supposed to energise the Belgian financial markets. But external events conspired to undermine some of the effects of the programme.  Whether it can yet be counted a complete success depends, to an extent, on which sector of the financial markets one looks at. Below, Andrew Hill considers its effect on the stock market, futures and options and the bond and money markets FUTURES and options have had a slow start in Belgium. Belfox, the new futures and options exchange, was sup- posed to open for business in May or June 1991. As it was, dealers did not start buying and selling futures until December 6, and the options market was launched only six months ago. Getting the British-designed computer system up and running efficiently was the main problem, according to Mr Remi Vermeiren, chairman of the Brussels-based exchange. 'The delay caused a lot of negative elements - financial- ly, psychologically and for the image of Belfox in the market,' he says. 'It also absorbed a lot of management time.' Even now, with the computer problems largely ironed out, the market is small. Two options are traded - on Belgian retailer Delhaize, and on Petrofina, the large Belgian natural resources company - and two futures, one on Belgian government bonds (BGB) and one on the three-month Belgian interbank offered rate (Bibor). Even leaving aside the technical problems, this has been a difficult teething period. The cornerstone of futures trading was supposed to be the BGB future, which Belfox hoped would capitalise on the success of the underlying government bond market. But after a reasonably buoyant start, volume collapsed in June and July. Mr Vermeiren puts the slump down to the relative inexperience of the Belgian market, combined with competition from the market in German Bund futures. Some investors thought they could hedge their Belgian franc exposure in the German market - relying on the fact that the franc is tied to the D-Mark. In addition, the more liquid German market could offer narrower spreads to futures dealers - two to three basis points, rather than eight to 10 on Belfox. That gap has now narrowed, according to Mr Jos Schmitt, Belfox general manager, with the Belgian exchange offering a four to five basis-point spread. Mr Schmitt also believes investors have begun to realise that they cannot cover all their risks on the Belgian markets with Bund futures. The situation was eased by a 'gentleman's agreement' between 15 financial instit- utions, put in place in the middle of August, when BGB futures volume was in the doldrums. The institutions agreed to deal a minimum number of BGB futures contracts until the end of the year. The effect on BGB futures trading has been dramatic: between April and August volume only occasion- ally burst through a daily average of 1,000 contracts dealt, and was mostly below 500, but in the last two weeks of October, volume averaged 2,413 contracts daily. Financial institutions now seem to be dealing contracts voluntarily, but it is clear that the first months of next year - when the gentleman's agreement is supposed to expire - will be crucial. The options market, which has faced stiff competition from the better-established Amsterdam exchange, is in need of more products. By mid-February 1993, Belfox hopes options will be available on some of Belgium's other large shares - such as Electrabel, Societe Generale de Belgique, Solvay, Union Miniere, GIB Group, and the large banks - as well as a future and an option on the Bel-20 index of top Belgian stocks. But Mr Vermeiren is not yet prepared to declare victory in his campaign to educate scep- tical investors in the delights of futures and options trading. 'I hope (the market) is recovering, but honestly speaking I have some doubts,' he says. 'I think it will only recover fully when we have a complete system and products on the (stock market) index.'</p>

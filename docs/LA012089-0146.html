			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE COLLEGES;  </P> <P> RODRIGUEZ STATUS REMAINS UNCLEAR FOR FULLERTON  </P> <P> The Cal State Fullerton gymnastics season opens tonight without a decision on  whether men's team captain Eli Rodriguez will be permitted to compete while he  awaits trial on a misdemeanor charge of aggravated assault.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was suspended after his involvement in the stabbing of a former  teammate in September.  </P> <P> Coach Dick Wolfe, citing a shortage of available gymnasts, says it will be  mathematically impossible for Fullerton to win without Rodriguez.  </P> <P> "We don't have enough people to field five gymnasts in each event without him,"  Wolfe said. "We would have to take 0's, and you can't win if you do that."  </P> <P> Rodriguez was allowed to resume practicing with the team in November after the  charge was reduced from a felony to a misdemeanor.  </P> <P> But Athletic Director Ed Carroll said the matter is "still under review" and  that he didn't know if he would make a decision before the meet.  </P> <P> "There's not a definite timetable," he said.  </P> <P> The men take on San Jose State and the women take on Stanford.

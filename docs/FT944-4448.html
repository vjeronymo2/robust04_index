			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Economic Viewpoint: The political itch to spoil it all To anyone of any political party who was pleased that the UK was showing the best prospect of sustainable non-inflationary growth for more than 30 years, the government's defeat on the second and final stage of the planned imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel was an irritating self-inflicted blow. Many Conservatives fail to realise quite how remarkable the change in the economic prospect has been. Unemployment started to turn down far earlier than normal. Pay rises have remained subdued and productivity has risen faster than expected. As a result unit wage costs have fallen. Sterling has remained steady and growth has been increasingly export-led and is set to have a strong investment component. Even the published current balance of payments deficit has been disappearing - and all at a time when the UK's recovery has been ahead of its main trading partners and a deterioration might have been expected. The continuation of these benign processes cannot be taken for granted and is vulnerable to the confidence wobbles and the waves of pessimism to which business is so prone. At this delicate juncture along come a handful of populist Conservative backbenchers, an opportunistic Labour opposition and some unprincipled small parties to defeat a commonsense measure to raise needed revenue, spread the indirect tax net - which has still far too many exemptions - a little more widely, and to make a modest contribution to energy saving and a cleaner environment. The top table shows that VAT on domestic fuel raises more from better-off than from poor families. It would have accounted for a higher proportion of the household spending of the poor  -but this would have been more than offset by the benefits package, now also withdrawn. The reaction of John Major, UK prime minister, to being re-elected with a small majority was precisely the wrong one. He concentrated on a small group of Tory hardliners with a mixture of threats and appeasement, as a result of which he is more in their hands than ever. The statesman-like approach would have been to recognise the new political balance and negotiate with Labour and Liberal members who were nearer to his own way of thinking on both Europe and other matters than are the Conservative diehards. But equally, the parliamentary opposition compares badly with the US Republicans who in the end helped President Bill Clinton to get legislation on the Uruguay Round world trade agreement through Congress. The real reason why the British parliament counts for so little has nothing to do with Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, but stems from its constituting the background noise to a non-stop general election rather than making a genuine contribution to policy. Making the increased contribution to the European Union budget a matter of confidence and treating a vote on its own Budget as an ordinary parliamentary manoeuvre was precisely the wrong way round. It is desirable for the government to honour international obligations. But if parliament had prevented an increase in EU contributions it would not have been the end of the world. One does not have to be a flag-waving nationalist to query the high-spending interventionism of Brussels. A federalist of classical liberal persuasion who believed in a strong but limited European government, confined to defence, law and order, currency and international trade negotiations, could take the same line. The EU has too much to spend rather than too little; the instances of fraud are almost an inevitable consequence of the handouts, payouts and levies, mainly but not only in agriculture, by the EU. Given everything that has happened, the package of fiscal measures to be announced today to plug the tax gap and the  1/2 per cent rise in base rates announced early yesterday morning are the absolute minimum required to maintain, not political stability - which is now all but hopeless - but business confidence and the momentum of non-inflationary expansion. There was indeed a strong case for a base rate increase - made out, for instance, in my pre-and post-Budget articles well before the VAT defeat. The signs are that expansion is gathering too much momentum. The likely increase this year of nearly 4 per cent in non-oil gross domestic product is well above the economy's underlying growth rate; and the margin of unused capacity is dwindling quickly. Kenneth Clarke's chief economic adviser, Professor Alan Budd, put the remaining margin at 1-4 per cent in evidence before the Treasury Committee on Tuesday evening; and if he is anywhere near the mark the latest interest rate increase is unlikely to be the last. The clinching evidence has come both from rising material and component prices and from growing signs that businessmen are planning to increase prices. Finally - and least emphasised in the parochial debate - are the many signs of world economic recovery advancing much more quickly than anyone had supposed earlier in the year. This shifts very starkly the balance of risks. For even if UK interest rates rise slightly too early or too far, there is plenty of world demand to maintain the momentum of recovery. On the other hand, if errors are made in the other direction, it will become difficult and costly to reverse any rebuilding of inflationary expectations. But despite these strong arguments it is hard to believe that the chancellor would have agreed so quickly and so readily to this base rate increase without the VAT defeat. Indeed, desirable though the increase was, its manner reeked of the alarms and emergencies of the 1970s - which indeed also often followed political defeats for the Labour government, itself often in a House of Commons minority. The official reason for bringing forward the meeting between the chancellor and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, from 9.30am to 8.45am yesterday was to remove uncertainty before the gilts auction. Yet the auction date is normally fixed 12 days in advance. The whole concept of these pre-announced monthly meetings was to allow for a calm and unhurried discussion. The idea cannot have been a rushed breakfast meeting followed by an announcement at 9.45. On the fiscal side, the rationalisations for not having proceeded with the increase in VAT on fuel and for not replacing it with anything else now become ever more unconvincing. For instance Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies, was not doing his duty when he belittled the Pounds 1bn at stake as a small fraction (0.3 per cent) of total public sector revenue. As one senator said to another: 'A billion here and a billion there and soon we are talking of real money.' A large part of public sector revenues comes from individually small taxes. The full 17 1/2 per cent VAT on domestic fuel was expected to raise Pounds 2.8bn - equivalent to the whole of the yield from spirit and wine duties. The most plausible sounding argument is: 'Why raise an unpopular new tax or replace it with anything else, when you know that you will be able to return it in tax cuts in a year or two?' On this basis a good part of the extra Pounds 17bn raised by the Lamont and Clarke budgets of 1993 was questionable. The missing element, however, in all the dialectics is any recognition of uncertainty. The reason why the government was right to raise taxes as soon as the economy could stand it was that the Treasury could not be sure how much of the Pounds 50bn (subsequently trimmed to Pounds 45bn) would vanish automatically with economic recovery. Today, no one can be at all confident that there will be any taxes to remit in 1995 or 1996. The government cheer-leaders (known by the peculiar name of whips) have only themselves to blame after their heavy hints about so-called income tax cuts to come.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated effects of 17.5% VAT on fuel  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Based on 1991 data  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Groups of net      Additional     Additional indirect      Change equivalent        indirect tax      tax payments as       in energy household           payments          a % of total       consumption income          (pounds per week)      spending  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 (poorest)       pounds 1.56             2.0              -9.2% 2                 pounds 1.83             1.3              -8.3% 3                 pounds 2.11             0.9              -6.2% 4                 pounds 2.18             0.7              -4.2% 5 (richest)       pounds 2.63             0.6              -1.1% All households    pounds 2.06             1.1              -5.8%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFS Paper 39, September 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TX.-  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cost of hypothetical tax changes in full year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Pounds bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 percentage point change in employer NIC                2.7 1 percentage point in VAT                                2.8 Intended VAT on domestic fuel                            2.8 (of which out-voted rise from 8 to 17.5%)                1.5 1p change in basic rate                                  2.1 1p change in lower rate                                  0.7 1p change in higher rate                                 0.5 10p increase in basic rate limit                         1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Treasury  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul has asserted  that the Lebanese Army is not stopping the resistance because  the resistance is carrying out activities against the  occupation. He affirmed the official Lebanese stance that when  Israel withdraws from the south, the Army will be ready to take  on its security duties. We guarantee that there will not be any  operations against Israel through the south. Minister Dallul  today received doyen of Lebanese editors Milhim Karam, who  interviewed him on current issues. [passage omitted]    On the Army's preparedness to assume all security duties in  the country, Minister Dallul said the Army has progressed a  great deal, but we are preparing it to be able to restore  security to the south when Israel withdraws. [passage omitted]    Doyen Karam asked whether the Army was strong enough in the  south, especially after some U.S. doubts about this were voiced  by Ambassador Hambley. Dallul answered: If the United States  or Ambassador Hambley are suggesting that the Army is not  confronting the resistance, then this true, because the  resistance is carrying out activities against the occupation.  Does Washington want us to strike at the resistance in the  interest of the occupation? The Army's deployment in the south  is strong and extensive. When Israel withdraws, the United  States will see that the guarantees we are talking about are  serious. But for us to turn into a police force that protects  the occupier is something we shall not do. It would be treason  to our country.    Minister Dallul denied that the Government has any  information about Israeli pilot Ron Arad. When his plane was  downed, there was no legitimate authority in Lebanon. We all  know that, he said.    He added that extensive investigations are taking place with  regard to those who cooperated with Israel by allegedly leading  the occupants of the two Israeli aircraft to al-Dirani's home to  kidnap him. The defense minister refused to discuss judicial  investigations regarding the assassination of [Dany] Sham'un and  the church blast, because this is a judicial matter.    With regard to holding Ja'ja' in the Defense Ministry, he  said: As defense minister, I have to allocate one of the prisons  belonging to the ministry in which to hold the prisoner. So I  chose the Defense Ministry's building so that he can be properly  interrogated, and for his own sake. As for the way he is being  treated, it has become well-known: He asks for juice, toast, or  yogurt, and gets whatever he wants. The orders for the food he  wants are placed in the name of the officers guarding him rather  than in his own name in order to protect him. I believe that  his life is more secure inside the Defense Ministry prison than  anywhere else. [passage omitted]</p>

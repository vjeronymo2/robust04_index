			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: THOUSAND OAKS;  </P> <P> NETS MAY KEEP GOLF BALLS OFF FREEWAY  </P> <P> A plan to protect motorists on the Ventura Freeway from flying balls near a  municipal golf course will be introduced at the Thousand Oaks City Council  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The City Council will consider paying $70,000 to install 1,500 feet of  protective nylon nets around the Los Robles Golf Course on Moorpark Road.  </P> <P> Finance Director Robert S. Biery said netting up to 50-feet high may be needed  where the risk to cars from wayward balls is greatest.  </P> <P> The nets may reduce the number of claims filed by motorists whose vehicles have  been damaged.  </P> <P> Since 1988, 57 claims have been filed against the city by drivers whose cars  and windows were smashed by golf balls. The city paid $14,870 to settle the  claims, according to the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Officials are concerned that increases in freeway traffic and golfers using the  course could mean an increase in legal claims.

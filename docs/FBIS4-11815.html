			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz by an </F> unidentified NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Beirut on 31  March -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] How would you describe the current  situation in the peace process? Is it true that U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher will visit Lebanon?    [Buwayz] The latest round of [Arab-Israeli] negotiations,  undoubtedly, was somewhat deadlocked. Mr. Christopher's  upcoming visit to the region is supposed to get things going by  securing some points to encourage the resumption of the  negotiations. Anyway, I believe that progress on the  Palestinian track would push forward the other topics on the  agenda of the negotiations.    [Correspondent] Will Lebanon demand that Christopher visit  it  within his tour?    [Buwayz] We do not demand; we welcome anyone who visits  Lebanon or deals with it as it should be dealt with.    [Correspondent] How do you explain what was achieved between  the Palestinians and the Israelis in Cairo today? Does this  mean the beginning of progress on the Gaza-Jericho track?    [Buwayz] The Gaza-Jericho agreement, naturally, had some  weak  points. Any action that will in one way or another fill this  vacuum and satisfy the Palestinians will be welcome. So far, I  believe that only the incorporation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement into a comprehensive peace process can cover this  agreement in the best way.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, how is Lebanese diplomacy  handling the current Israeli acts of aggression against the  south?    [Buwayz] Lebanon and Israel have been in a state of crisis  for a long time. This crisis has not at any point stopped  progress in the Middle East talks. Just as Israel did not stop  its repeated aggressions, Lebanon conceded neither its right to  confront and resist the aggression nor its right to use all  political and diplomatic means to confront it.    [Correspondent] Mr. Minister, as regards media, the public  is under the impression that it should (?wait), and the Chamber  of Deputies was inclined to ask the government to suspend its  decision [on banning news programs on private radios] until the  media law is issued. What do you think?    [Buwayz] I clearly and realistically believe that it is  necessary to think of democracy and freedom on one hand, and  security and stability on the other, and take the requirements  of both into consideration. Talking about returning the media  to the old situation; that is, the return of more than 50  television stations and more than 100 radio stations is  impossible for any country, no matter how much democracy and  freedom it has, to tolerate and accept. But I also believe that  talking about one official station and closing the door to the  development of media -- and they actually have developed over  the past 20 years -- when a number of Stalinist countries have  renounced Stalinism, may be wrong. We need to lay down a  framework to reshuffle all these broadcasting stations so that  we can find a number acceptable to Lebanon's security and order  and satisfying the Lebanese people's ambitions for democracy and  freedom. I believe that four or five television stations and  four or five radio stations -- controlled by the valid laws on  sectarian sedition, insults to Lebanese or foreign officials,  and provocation of the sentiments of the public -- may be a  realistic solution that reconciles Lebanon's democracy, which  has always been an integral part of the Lebanese situation and  entity, and security requirements. We cannot ignore the fact  that Lebanon is living on a sensitive Middle East volcano and  cannot tolerate disorder, which no democratic country allows.</p>

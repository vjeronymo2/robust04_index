			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: In Germany, it may get worse Chancellor Helmut Kohl last week quoted Goethe to explain how Germany had to solve economic problems stemming both from the cyclical downturn and from the country's structural deficiencies. 'Intent alone is not enough: we must pass to action.' One widely-held view is that Germany's corporate and political leaders now agree on the therapy to lead it out of the deepest recession since the 1940s. All that remains to be done, according to this argument, is to wait for already-decided measures - government deficit-cutting, industry restructuring, trade unions' accord on lower wage rises - to bear fruit, assisted by eventual upturn in east Germany and a revival in world trade. This view is starting to look complacent. There are grounds for believing that Germans have not yet grasped the full import of the challenges resulting from world-wide deregulation, the opening of eastern Europe, and the specific burdens of German unification. If this thesis is true, then Europe's most important economy stands at the beginning of efforts to adapt its industrial and social structure to harsh new realities. The latest sign of these strains is the difficulty engineering employers and trades unions are experiencing in their current negotiations on wages and working patterns. Employers seeking reductions in labour costs and more flexible working hours are embroiled in a worsening confrontation with unions demanding a 5.5 per cent wage increase, which may even lead to strike action. This is the last thing the German economy needs as it struggles to emerge from its most serious recession since the war. For a country that built post-war recovery on exports, restoring competitiveness must take priority. Since the mid-1980s, industry has been hit by above-average increases in wage and non-wage costs and an appreciating D-Mark. The Federation of German Industry's research institute calculates that west Germany's unit labour costs in 1992 were 23 per cent higher than a weighted average of other industrial countries, compared with a position 14 per cent below the average in 1985. According to the OECD, Germany's share of world exports has fallen more since 1987 than that of any other of the group of seven leading industrial countries. Germany needs lower labour costs. One reason for the stubborn resistance to lower wage settlements is that disposable incomes are already being eroded by ever-heavier taxation and the rising cost of domestic services, which now shows up in 3 to 4 per cent inflation. Government receipts as a share of GDP are already higher than in any other G7 country, apart from France. Nevertheless, massive resource transfers to east Germany, combined with a failure to cut spending in west Germany, have led to continued rises in public sector deficits. Barring an unexpected economic spurt, the general government borrowing requirement is likely to stick at around 5 per cent of GDP for several years. After incorporation of an extra DM500bn (Pounds 194bn) of debt stemming from eastern Germany, general government indebtedness next year will also exceed the Maastricht treaty guideline of 60 per cent of GDP. So it is not too surprising that the Bundesbank has slowed down cuts in short-term interest rates. Since the summer of 1992, net purchases of fixed-income German securities from abroad have totalled an unprecedented DM340bn. In view of long-term budgetary concerns, the Bundesbank fears that premature short-term easing would provoke large foreign sales of German bonds - producing higher long-term interest rates and worsening further the fiscal outlook. Notwithstanding trade union resistance, German industry must continue to cut costs. Similarly, the next German government will be unable to avoid further action to reduce spending. Carrying either task through will be arduous, particularly so for the politicians. But the consequences of procrastination could be even more unpleasant.</p>

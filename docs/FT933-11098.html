			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Turnround at home revives GM GENERAL Motors yesterday underscored the improving US vehicle market and the fruits of its profit restoration effort in North America by reporting second quarter net income of Dollars 889m. The figure, which worked through at 92 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 703.2m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, in the same period of last year, when the company took a Dollars 749m restructuring charge at its GM Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. Excluding that, 1992 earnings were Dollars 46m. Sales and revenues were up 3.9 per cent at Dollars 36.7bn. The figures were in line with market expectations and GM's shares slipped Dollars 1/8 to Dollars 46 7/8 in early morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. GM is in the throes of a huge cost-cutting programme in its key North American vehicle operations, which last year lost Dollars 4.5bn on the basis of earnings before interest and tax (EBIT). It said yesterday it was on target to achieve its aim of break-even on an EBIT basis in North America this year. In the second quarter it made Dollars 675m, against a loss of Dollars 298m a year ago, and for the first half its earnings totalled Dollars 1.2bn, compared with a loss of Dollars 2.49bn. However, the second half of the year, which involves many model changes, is usually tougher financially than the first and GM also faces potentially difficult negotiations with the United Auto Workers over a new three-year labour contract. On a net income basis, its North American operations were still Dollars 95m in the red in the second quarter, down from Dollars 761m in 1992. Company officials acknowledged there was still a long way to go to restore North America to acceptable profitability. GM's share of the US vehicle market dipped to 34.8 per cent, against 35.5 per cent a year earlier. It said this was due to its strategy of reducing less profitable sales to hire-car companies. Its international automobile operations earned Dollars 368m, up from Dollars 284m, helped by a strong sales and financial performance in Latin America. Its European operations were profitable, despite the severe downturn in many continental markets, although profits were lower than last year. Mr Rick Wagoner, chief financial officer, said the European market might be close to the bottom. But it could bump along there for some time, with recovery only beginning in late 1994 or 1995. The group's financial services business, General Motors Acceptance Corporation, contributed Dollars 285m of income, compared with Dollars 282m, while GM Hughes Electronics made Dollars 232m, against a loss of Dollars 597m after special charges. The Electronic Data Systems subsidiary made Dollars 178m, up sharply from Dollars 157m. For the first half, GM recorded net income of Dollars 1.4bn, against a loss of Dollars 21.7bn - mostly a non-cash accounting charge. Lex, Page 18</p>

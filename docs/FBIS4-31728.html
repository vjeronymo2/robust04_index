			<p>BFN     [Text] Doboj, June 14 (TANJUG) -- Moslem formations on all  fronts in the wider region of Doboj, northern Bosnia, violated  the ceasefire agreement by bringing in reinforcements and  opening strong small arms and artillery fire at Serb (?defence)  positions and villages, the information service of the First  Krajina Corps of the Bosnian Serb Army said on Tuesday evening  [14 June].    The Moslems were especially aggressive on the eastern sector  of the Teslic front, where they are threatening Serb positions  by constant artillery barrage and small arms fire. Serb units  are forced to return equally strong fire in order to protect  their positions and defend their lives, the statement said.    Moslems also stepped up small arms and mortar attacks on the  Doboj front, especially under cover of the night. After the  Serb side returned fire, the Moslems stopped attacking. Strong  movements by the Moslems' motorized vehicles have been  registered on this front, around Doboj. The Moslems are  believed to be bringing in reinforcements from Tesanj and  amassing these troops near Serb defense positions southwest of  Doboj.    Moslems also attacked Serb positions and villages with small  arms fire on the northeastern slopes of Mt. Ozren in northern  Bosnia, and on the left bank of the River Spreca. Serb units  did not return fire.</p>

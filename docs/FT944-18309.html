			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Crystal shines light on executive salaries Mr Sanford Weill, chairman and chief executive of US financial group Travelers, was overpaid by Dollars 39m last year, according to a report by an American executive pay expert. The analysis, by Professor Graef Crystal, found Mr Weill's pay package totalled Dollars 45.8m in 1993 but that he should have been paid Dollars 6.8m. The report concludes that over the past three years Mr Weill has been paid Dollars 90.7m more than he should have been in light of the company's performance - measured by returns to shareholders - and its size. 'Weill's performance at the company has been excellent,' Prof Crystal says, 'but this shows that even excellent performance can be vastly overpaid. As far as we are concerned Mr Weill owes his shareholders Dollars 91m, though we doubt that payment will ever be forthcoming.' The next most overpaid executive after Mr Weill is Mr Alan Greenberg, chief executive officer of Bear Stearns, who earned Dollars 16.2m last year. Prof Crystal says he should have received less than Dollars 4m, a difference of Dollars 12.3m. The survey examined the pay packages of the chief executive officers of 200 of the US's largest public companies and it found some large variations. The lowest paid chief executive officer was Mr Raymond J. Noorda of Novell, who received Dollars 290,000 last year. The report states that because of the company's performance and size he should have been paid Dollars 5.7m - a difference of Dollars 5.4m. Other CEO's were underpaid, including Mr Bernard Marcus of Home Depot who has earned a total of Dollars 28m less than he should have done over the last three years and Dollars 9.5m in 1993 alone. The average total compensation paid to the 200 chief executive officers in 1993 was about Dollars 3.5m. Prof Crystal was able to find only a small relationship between the pay of top US executives and the size and performance of the companies they manage. However, he found top pay was influenced by geography with 'an extremely large pay premium predicated on working in the New York area', says Prof Crystal. Another important influence was the number of long-term incentive plans the CEO received during 1993. The analysis found when a company adds a new long-term incentive plan it typically fails to cut back the size of awards under the first long-term incentive plan, or to cut back enough. 'The result is higher and higher total compensation,' says Prof Crystal. The analysis found that total pay for the 154 top executives that were included in last year's survey remained about level, after having risen on average by 21.6 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Total pay for each executive includes base salary, bonus payments, any long-term incentive plans, and Prof Crystal's valuation of share options granted to each executive during 1993. Total pay is put against a combination of two figures - company performance over the past 10 years and during each chief executive's tenure, plus company size - to evaluate the amount each CEO should have been paid last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PROFESSOR CRYSTAL'S TOP TEN  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company             Chief          1993 total  Recommended  Difference                     executive    compensation       salary                                   (Dlrs, 000)  (Dlrs, 000) (Dlrs, 000)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

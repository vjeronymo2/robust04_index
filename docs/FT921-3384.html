			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (The Budget and You): The Week Ahead BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services conglomerate, is expected to report a 9 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits to about Pounds 1.05bn on Wednesday. Eagle Star, its insurance subsidiary, is still suffering heavy losses on its domestic mortgage indemnity business. Analysts will be interested to hear how higher premiums are affecting other underwriting business - for motors, buildings and house contents. However, the final dividend should benefit from the strength of the tobacco business, which is enjoying increasing market share in the US and higher prices in Brazil. Guinness is expected to produce another creditable set of figures on Thursday. Forecasts of pre-tax profits for 1991 range from Pounds 947m to Pounds 970m, the top end representing 15 per cent growth in the year. The rate has slowed, though, from 23 per cent in 1990 and 33 per cent in 1989. Shareholders will be rewarded with a dividend increase of about 12 per cent on last year's total of 9.7p. WPP, the world's largest marketing services group, is likely to unveil on Monday a halving of pre-tax profits for 1991 to about Pounds 45m. Revenues are likely to be down slightly to Pounds 1.26bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Staff levels have been trimmed by 8 per cent during the year. WPP is believed to have been seeking additional financing of some Pounds 100m from its bankers, who are interested in seeing some disposals, particularly of the US agency Scali McCabe Sloves. Guardian Royal Exchange on Thursday will follow the loss-making trend of the insurance sector. Forecasts range up to Pounds 250m for 1991 compared with a year-earlier loss of Pounds 157m. Some analysts believe it will maintain its 11.9p total dividend for the year but that cannot be taken for granted after Royal Insurance's decision to omit its final. Wimpey is expected to turn in on Tuesday a loss for the year ended December of around Pounds 20m against pre-tax profits of Pounds 43.3m a year earlier. The final dividend is likely to be cut to make a total for the year of 8p (10.5p). Against the backdrop of the deep construction industry recession, Wimpey will take a Pounds 12m provision on its Channel Tunnel involvement plus write-downs on land and property. Although Delta, the electrical cables and engineering group, has a reputation for limiting the damage of recession, pre-tax profit in 1991 is expected to be nearly 30 per cent down at between Pounds 60m and Pounds 65m. It has not been able to buck the UK trend, although its cashflow performance is thought to have been strong. Delta has for some time been looking to acquire, possibly to build up its US presence and its safety-related business. A strong balance sheet and healthy share-price performance gives it considerable scope.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY NEWS SUMMARY  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TAKE-OVER BIDS AND MERGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                Value of              Price        Value Company         bid per    Market   before       of bid bid for         share**   price**      bid  Pounds ms**  Bidder  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Prices in pence unless otherwise indicated  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lawrence (W)  52 1/2      52         23       25.54      Raine Inds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Macarthy          365++   344        321      100.46     Lloyds Chemists  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Polymark Intl      37*     36         34        4.33     Polyfinance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Do.

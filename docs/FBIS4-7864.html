			<p>BFN     [Text] Szczecin, 6 Apr--Boguslaw Liberadzki, the minister  of transport and maritime economy, who took part on 6 April in a  meeting of the Szczecin Maritime Lobby, has announced the  introduction in our country of a free register of ships sailing  under various flags.    In practice, this means the birth of a Polish flag of  convenience, similar to that of Panama or Liberia, under which  shipowners from various countries will be able to register their  vessels. There are many who are interested in "changing the  flag" of their ships.</p>

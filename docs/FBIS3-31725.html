			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with the head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, </F> Vuk Draskovic, by Sibylle Hamann in Belgrade; date not given:  "`Extend Example of Sarajevo!'"]    [Text] [Hamann] You say that you would rather go to  Sarajevo than to Pale, the center of the Bosnian Serbs?    [Draskovic] My people are not only situated on the hills  around Sarajevo, but are also living in the city. Since the  beginning of the war there have always been more Serbs in  Sarajevo than around the city -- and they suffer more. This is  the wrong place and the wrong time to side with the Bosnian  Serbs demonstratively.    [Hamann] Do Bosnia's Serbs no longer deserve any support  from Belgrade?    [Draskovic] By destroying Sarajevo, Karadzic has destroyed  Serb tradition. He does not represent the Serb nation, merely  an extremist minority. I belong to a great nation; it is my  duty to defend the honor of the Serbs. But the propaganda is in  the hands of the extremists.    [Hamann] Is peace in Bosnia possible as long as Milosevic is  president of Serbia?    [Draskovic] Do not be surprised if Milosevic and (Croatian  President) Tudjman present themselves as peacemakers now. This  is not logical, this is not honest -- but this is politics. I  am worried that the world might forget that the key to peace  lies in Bosnia itself. The international community has the duty  to extend the example of Sarajevo to all of Bosnia, until the  ultimate aim, disarmament down to the knives, has been achieved.  This would require 50,000 UN soldiers.    [Hamann] What would the effect on Serbia be?    [Draskovic] After disarmament in Bosnia, the democrats in  Serbia and Croatia will grow wings. New people will be in power  here overnight.    [Hamann] But people are hardly prepared to bring the regime  down.    [Draskovic] How could they? The sanctions have not harmed  Milosevic, but me. Of my supporters, 300,000 have fled Serbia.  If the West wants to support democratization, it will have to  lift the embargo.</p>

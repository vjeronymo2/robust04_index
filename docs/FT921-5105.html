			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Templeton Galbraith up to Dollars 69m A JUMP in profits from its treasury activities helped Templeton, Galbraith and Hansberger, the Bahamas-based fund management group, to announce yesterday a 9.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits in the calendar year 1991. Operating profits of the company, which reports in dollars, edged only slightly up from Dollars 55.5m to Dollars 56m (Pounds 31.8m), but other operating income - consisting of profits on treasury activities such as bond trading - grew from Dollars 8.3m to Dollars 13.6m. This helped pre-tax profits rise from Dollars 63.1m to Dollars 69.1m and earnings per share increase from 36.3 cents to 39.5 cents. The group also announced a 40 per cent rise in its final dividend to 14 cents (10 cents), making a total of 21 cents per share (15 cents). The shares rose 10p to 317p on the news. Templeton is proposing changes in the charging structure of its mutual funds, the US equivalent of unit trusts. At present Templeton funds have a high initial charge (the so-called front end load). Much of the US industry has moved to a lower initial load, with a sliding redemption charge on investors who sell their holdings within seven years. The group believes a change in its charging structure will lead to an increase in sales. Although funds under management rose 20 per cent from Dollars 15.9bn to Dollars 19.1bn, this was mainly due to investment performance and rising markets. Lower mutual fund sales resulted in a fall in distribution costs from Dollars 62.35m to Dollars 49.9m. But administrative expenses rose from Dollars 57.8m to Dollars 69.3m, reflecting increased staff levels and competitive pressures on pay. COMMENT Templeton's shares have risen almost 50 per cent since the group last announced its annual results and now stand on a historic p/e of about 14, based on last night's foreign exchange rates. Despite the confident 40 per cent increase in the dividend, investors might be wondering whether it is time for the shares to take a breather. The company is about to undertake what might be a difficult shift in its mutual fund charging structure; its administrative costs have risen sharply; the bulk of its profits increase came from the (perhaps unrepeatable) treasury gains; and the US stock market has had a very good run. That said, the company's financial position is strong and those who agree with Templeton's bullish views for equities in the 1990s will not be daunted.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / International Company News: Bethlehem Steel declines to Dollars 10.3m Bethlehem Steel, the US's second-biggest steelmaker, saw after-tax profits fall to Dollars 10.3m in the third quarter, from Dollars 30.7m the year before, as an overhaul of some of its production facilities added to costs. The figures come in the face of a 17 per cent increase in quarterly sales, to Dollars 1.2bn, reflecting higher prices and demand for flat-rolled steel. Bethlehem's results were held back by three projects, which added Dollars 60m to costs in the latest quarter: a rebuild of a coke oven, which is due to come back into operation in December, a reline of one of the plant's two blast furnaces and construction of a coal-injection facility for one of the blast furnaces. The company's structural products business, meanwhile, was hampered by higher costs and weak demand. The company plans to phase out the loss-making iron and steelmaking operations in this part of its business by next year. At the pre-tax level, Bethlehem's profits were Dollars 11.3m, up from Dollars 9.2m in the 1993 quarter, when it benefited from a tax credit. After the payment of dividends on preferred stock, the company reported a break-even position at the earnings per share level, compared with income of 22 cents a share a year ago.</p>

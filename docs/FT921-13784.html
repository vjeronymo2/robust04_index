			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Management: In line but out of step At British Telecom there are 5,000, at Philips 4,500, not to mention the 1,000 at BP. All over the country, middle managers are being laid off. Those who still have jobs face challenges through new information technology, quality programmes and fashionable flat management structures. Yet you would not know it from talking to them. In a survey* of the middle ranks of British management, some 80 per cent say future restructuring would pose no threat to their jobs and 75 per cent complacently expected to remain as managers for their entire careers. The survey, published today by the British Institute of Management, shows middle managers to be an optimistic lot: three quarters were expecting a promotion shortly, and not one of the 1,000 asked saw demotion as likely. Almost none of the managers expected their jobs to be changed much by trends towards sub-contracting or greater use of computers. By far the biggest change in work practices was expected to come through Total Quality Management, but even in this area, two thirds of middle managers expected no change. These replies are sharply out of line with the responses given to the same questions by the employers. Most of them said that middle managers would be bearing a greater burden in the future, but that the work would be done differently, with more emphasis on teams. Pay would increasingly be tied to performance, they said. Employers also expected middle managers to become generalists rather than specialists. As work practices changed, they would no longer be line managers but would start managing specific projects. The report urges managers to keep their skills up to date, to put emphasis on team work and to press for more career guidance. *The Future of Middle Management by Malcolm Wheatley. BIM.

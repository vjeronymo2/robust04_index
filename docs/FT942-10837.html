			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / London may buck job trend London will buck the trend towards replacing full-time jobs with part-time ones, and its manufacturing companies are set to create more jobs than those in financial services, says a report published today. The survey of 1,000 companies by Centec, central London's Training and Enterprise Council, found twice as many would increase full-time jobs as would create part-time jobs. Mrs Gwynneth Flower, Centec chief executive, said: 'This could be one of the first real indications that full-time employment is coming back, and that London is leading the way.' Business services and manufacturing anticipate most growth in full time jobs over the next three years. However, financial services companies continue to expect a net reduction in staff. Opportunities for Growth. Centec and the Department of Management Studies, Brunel University. Centec, 156a Tooley Street, London SE1X 2NR.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / International Company News: Canal Plus chairman quits board of top shareholder Mr Andre Rousselet, chairman of the Canal Plus television company and one of the most influential figures in French media, yesterday resigned as a director of Havas, the leisure group. He was protesting against at its plans to raise its stake in Canal Plus by forming a concert party. Canal Plus issued a statement saying that Mr Rousselet, 71, a close friend and regular golfing partner of Mr Francois Mitterrand, the French president, was in 'total disagreement' with Havas over the proposed concert party. Havas had earlier announced an agreement with Generale des Eaux, the industrial group, to pool their respective 23.5 per cent and 20.1 per cent stakes in Canal Plus in a new holding company controlled by Havas. Societe Generale, the bank, has promised to add its 5.1 per cent stake to the new company. The three groups will then collectively control 48.7 per cent of Canal Plus. The announcement of their agreement, after months of complex negotiations, follows a recent reform of French broadcasting legislation that raised the maximum holding in a television company from 25 per cent to 49 per cent. Under French law any investor, or concert party of investors, owning over one third of a company must usually bid for two thirds of the shares. However, Havas, Generale des Eaux and Societe Generale have persuaded the Paris stock market authorities to waive this requirement. Canal Plus's other institutional investors yesterday reacted angrily to the news of the waiver. 'It's a classic French stitch-up,' said one London-based institution. 'It depresses the value of everyone else's investment by taking away the bid premium.' Mr Rousselet had objected to the concert party's plans throughout the negotiations. His split with Havas comes at a highly-sensitive time for Canal Plus, which has just started to renegotiate the terms of its pay-TV franchise with the French government. The company, which until recently was a star of the French stock market, is also under financial pressure after recently warning that it was set for a sharp fall in net profits for 1994. This follows a modest increase in profits to FFr1.2bn (Dollars 215m) in 1993 from FFr1.1bn in 1992.</p>

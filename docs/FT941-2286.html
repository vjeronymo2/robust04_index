			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Non-EU trade deficit narrows The UK's visible trade deficit with non-European Union countries narrowed to Pounds 672m in February from a revised Pounds 788m in January. But the improvement disguised a continued deterioration in trade volumes. Over the three months to February the volume of UK imports - excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones - was 3.5 per cent higher than in the previous three months, while exports rose by only 2 per cent. Import volumes in February were the highest ever recorded. The Central Statistical Office estimates that, on a trend basis, import volumes are rising by 1 per cent a month while exports are broadly unchanged. The deterioration in volume terms has been disguised by an improvement in the terms of trade. British exporters have been increasing their prices while import prices have been falling. Over the three months to February, export prices were 7 per cent higher than in the same three months a year ago, while import prices were 1.5 per cent lower. The main reason for the improvement in the headline figure in February was the oil balance, which improved to a surplus of Pounds 14m from a deficit of Pounds 75m in January. If oil and erratics are excluded the trade deficit widened to Pounds 673m in February from Pounds 612m in January. In the three months to February the deficit, exc-luding oil and erratics, was Pounds 1.76bn, compared with Pounds 1.71bn in the previous three months. One encouraging trend is that, according to the CSO, imports of intermediate and capital goods increased in the three months to February while imports of consumer goods, excluding cars, fell. This suggests that the rise in imports is due to manufacturers expanding capacity rather than a consumer boom sucking in imports. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said the outlook for exports was relatively bright as world trade grew and Britain remained competitive. Figures for trade outside the EU are compiled separately from, and published earlier than, those for trade with Britain's EU partners. The EU figures for December were published earlier this month and showed a sharp deterioration, with a deficit rising to Pounds 903m from Pounds 543m in November. The trade figures for the EU are compiled under a new system - Intrastat - which is based on value added tax, and the statistics are regarded as unreliable.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EU COUNTRIES Balance of payments basis, seasonally adjusted (pounds m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Ex oil and erratics*                   Exports  Imports  Balance  Exports  Imports  Balance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1992               46,682   56,431   -9,749   40,624   48,097   -7,473 1993               57,407   66,919   -9,512   49,910   57,530   -7,620 1993 Q1            13,572   16,652   -3,080   11,697   13,958   -2,261      Q2            14,144   16,305   -2,161   12,048   14,024   -1,976      Q3            14,505   17,002   -2,497   12,635   14,497   -1,862      Q4            15,186   16,960   -1,774   13,530   15,051   -1,521 September           4,819    5,757     -938    4,215    4,884     -669 October             5,257    5,619     -362    4,667    5,033     -366 November            4,863    5,604     -741    4,328    5,005     -677 December            5,066    5,737     -671    4,535    5,013     -478 1994 January        5,054    5,842     -788    4,454    5,066     -612 February            5,158    5,830     -672    4,358    5,031     -673  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Defined as ships, aircraft, precious stones and silver.

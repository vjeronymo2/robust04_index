			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Ju Mengjun (0215 1322 6511) and Zhou Shuchun </F> (0719 2885 2504)]    [Text] Almaty, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Chinese  entrepreneurs delegation accompanying Premier Li Peng during his  visit to four Central Asian nations had extensive contacts with  the enterprise circles of the host countries during the visits  and signed more than 20 cooperation documents, achieving  fruitful results.    As of today, representatives of the five large enterprises  who accompanied Premier Li Peng have signed four agreements, two  contracts, and more than 20 letters of intent on economic  cooperation in petroleum, natural gas, construction, metallurgy,  textiles, electronics, and other industries.    At a recent meeting with the entrepreneurs' delegation, Li  Peng said: This is the first time a Chinese entrepreneurs'  delegation has accompanied a state leader on a foreign tour.  This is a beneficial experiment: good results have been  achieved and we may continue the practice. In developing  economic and trade cooperation with Central Asian nations,  Chinese enterprises should give play to their own strengths and  fully use the resources of the countries with which they  cooperate. Cooperation must be on a equal and mutually  beneficial basis, and we must take reality into consideration  and pay attention to the economic results of cooperation.    Li Peng also pointed out: We must pay special attention to  the quality of Chinese export products and must prevent  counterfeit, fake, and substandard products from entering  Central Asian markets. At the same time, we should protect the  Chinese people's legal business activities in the area and crack  down on speculation and profiteering.    Li Peng stressed the importance of building a modern "silk  road" between China and Central Asian countries, saying that,  without a free transportation channel, it will be difficult to  greatly develop economic and trade relations with these  countries.    Zheng Hongye, head of the Chinese entrepreneurs' delegation  and president of the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade; and persons in charge of China Construction  Engineering Corporation, China Petroleum and Natural Gas  Corporation, China Steel Industry Trade Group, China Textile  Products Import and Export Corporation, and China Electronics  Products Import and Export Corporation, who accompanied Premier  Li Peng on his visit, jointly held a news conference this  afternoon to brief reporters on their companies' trade talks  results.    They unanimously said: Chinese and Central Asian countries'  economies are highly complementary to each other and the  potential for cooperation is huge. As the cooperation climate  improves, the level and quality of cooperation gradually will be  raised. Chinese enterprises should be farsighted in developing  economic cooperation with these countries.</p>

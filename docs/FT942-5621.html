			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: MEPC advances to Pounds 47.6m - Further moves made into retail and industrial property MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 47.6m for the six months to end-March, compared with Pounds 43.8m in the first half last year. Lord Blakenham, chairman, described the half year as 'very active', as the group pursued its strategy of moving further into retail and industrial property and of building its overseas base. MEPC has bought Pounds 363m of property since its last year end, including shopping centres in Los Angeles and Atlanta in the US and in Derby, a portfolio of office and industrial properties in the West Midlands and an office building in Brisbane, Australia. The shopping centre in Northridge, California, which was severely damaged by earthquake, is likely to be open, following refurbishment, in March 1995. The pre-tax profits, generated from net income ahead from Pounds 108.6m to Pounds 112.6m, were boosted by Pounds 2.3m of property sales, against losses and provisions of Pounds 8.7m. MEPC said that the movement in relevant property indices suggested an increase in value of about 12-14 per cent in the value of its UK portfolio in the six-month period. Although there has been no revaluation of the property portfolio, net asset value per share has increased by 4 per cent from 416p to 431p. That reflects an element of retained profit, currency movements plus the premium on the share issue for the acquisition of American Property Trust which took place in December 1993. Mr James Tuckey, chief executive, said that signs of rental growth were 'patchy'. MEPC does not expect an early resumption of its development programme, although a few small developments were underway within its existing portfolio. Net interest costs rose from Pounds 52.5m to Pounds 62.8m. Earnings per share increased from 7.8p to 8.3p and the interim dividend is held at 5.25p. The comparisons with last year's reported figures are affected by the adoption of FRS 3 and 4. COMMENT After slightly disappointing interim profits, MEPC looks set for a stronger performance in the second half as additional income from new acquisitions kicks in and rent-free periods fade out. Pre-tax profits for the full year of about Pounds 105m seem possible, but the second half is likely to be weaker than the first in terms of asset growth, since the market has lost some of its momentum in the last few months. However, with gearing at just 50 per cent, net assets per share are unlikely to exceed 520p at the end of September. That puts the shares, which rose by 5p to close at 455p yesterday, on a discount of 12.5 per cent. Given a yield of 5.5 per cent, assuming the dividend is not cut, the shares offer reasonable value.</p>

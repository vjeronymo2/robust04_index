			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: Dunedin looks east for recovery - At a glance Dunedin Fund Managers this week launched a Japanese investment trust to take advantage of what it sees as early signs of recovery in the Japanese economy. Shares are offered in units, priced at 500p, of five shares with one warrant attached. The warrant entitles the holder to buy one ordinary share at 100p in the month of September in any of the years 1995-1999. The minimum initial investment is Pounds 250, and the offer period closes on Friday July 23. For the first five years, Dunedin will donate 35 per cent of the 1 per cent annual management fee to the charity Barnardo's, to be used for a series of community projects around the UK. In exchange, Barnados is sending details of the fund to its 185,000-strong mail list.</p>

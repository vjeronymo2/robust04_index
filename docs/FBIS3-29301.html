Attending the meeting were Politburo members of the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea -- Premier of the  Administration Council Kang Song-san, Vice-President Pak  Song-chol, Chief of the General Staff of the Korean People's  Army Choe Kwang -- and other cadres of the party and government,  anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters, heroes, frontrankers in  beautiful communist traits, noted scientists, artists and  sportsmen, provincial delegates of the children's union and  school children in Pyongyang.    A children's union ceremony took place prior to the meeting.    Flags bearing portraits of the great leader President Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il entered the  meeting hall, escorted by members of the children's union.    Reports were made by the column heads.    Choe Yong-hae, chairman of the Central Committee of the  League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea, made a  congratulatory report at the meeting.    He said that the school children are sturdily growing to be  future masters equipped with knowledge, a good moral character  and good health, enjoying the happiest life in the world under  the loving care of the dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il.    "The children's union members should prepare themselves more  firmly as loyal and filial sons and daughters through a vigorous  movement of learning from the glorious youth and childhood of  the dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il and thus defend and glorify the  Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses generation  after generation," he said.    Then followed a ceremony for the admission of children to  the  Korean Children's Union.    Children who were admitted to the KCU made an oath and party  and government cadres, anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters,  heroes, scientists, officers of the Korean People's Army tied  neckerchiefs around their necks and pinned badges on their  chests.    The children responded with their first children's union  salute, shouting "we will always prepare ourselves" to the call  "let us always prepare ourselves as reserves of communist  construction!"    Then columns of KCU members marched past.</p>

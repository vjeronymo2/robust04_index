			<p>BFN     [Text] On the eve of Leonid Kravchuk's visit to west  Ukraine, its press came out in support for him as a presidential  candidate. Kravchuk's tour of the Lvov Oblast is beginning  today, two weeks before the election. Ukrainian political  analysts are wondering why the nationalistic oblast, which only  three years ago pledged its allegiance to Vyacheslav Chornovyl  -- Kravchuk's opponent at the first presidential election -- is  now supporting Kravchuk in the same way.    Is this a desire to spite the eastern area, which wants  close  cooperation with its Russian neighbor or do they now see  Kravchuk as a nationalist patriot number one?    Significantly, as a part of his pre-election tour, Kravchuk  today opened in Lvov city center a monument to Mikhail  Grushevskiy, the first Ukrainian president of 1918, a historian  and a politician who declared the country's independence.    Thus the incumbent will raise his popularity even more.  Local leaders believe that Galichina [historical name of the  Lvov area] should again assume the historic role of the state's  savior. Leonid Kravchuk is the one at the forefront here.</p>

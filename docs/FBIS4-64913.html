			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bernard Tapie, Left Radical Movement leader, </F> by Philippe Reinhard; place and date not given: "Tapie Is  Self-Confident: `My List Is Going To Be a Success'" -- first  three paragraphs are LE QUOTIDIEN DE PARIS introduction]    [Excerpts] Bernard Tapie will be a major troublemaker  within the Left. Doubters need only read the following  interview to be convinced. Looking for all the world like he  could not care less about the scandals he has been plagued with,  he rises gamely to the fight. This man plays a mean poker game;  blessed with psychological insight and unafraid to resort to  bluff, he goes for high stakes. Should he win the game (10  percent or more in the European election), nobody will be able  to ignore him. Especially nobody within the Left, as success  for him would dash [Socialist Party, PS, First Secretary] Michel  Rocard's hopes [of being appointed the party's presidential  candidate].    While President Francois Mitterrand and his entourage  maintain they have had no hand in the Tapie phenomenon, it is  crystal clear that, over the past few years, Mr. Mitterrand has  used Mr. Tapie as a wild card. Has the president developed a  fascination for the self-made, sligthly loutish billionaire, or  does he merely view him as a pawn in his anti-Rocard strategy?  Either way, the president has backed Bernard Tapie too often  for his denials to sound genuine. Therefore there is no need to  give a detailed account of the improbable and grotesque session  in which he supposedly chided his aides for squandering their  benevolent attention on Mr. Tapie. The truth is simpler. The  Tapie move has already been successful beyond the president's  wildest dreams. So continued overt support to Bernard Tapie  might damage the PS' party presidential image. This would not be  the best way to go about imposing on this party another  candidate than Michel Rocard. Mr. Mitterrand must change tack  somewhat, but nobody is likely to be fooled.    Should Bernard Tapie's list "be a success," as he himself  puts it, one can foresee major disruptions on the French  political scene. As the new leader of the MRG [Left Radicals  Movement], he has adopted a resolutely left-wing stance. For the  time being, that is. He has already warned that his next battle  will entail an attempt at breaking the "binary" rhythm which has  traditionally dominated French politics. This means -- although  he denies it -- that he might model his conduct after Silvio  Berlusconi's. In any case, one thing is now certain: The  political class will not get rid of Mr. Tapie by merely calling  him supposedly ignominious names such as "populist" or  "demagogue." Mr. Rocard may become his first victim, but  everybody else has now good reasons to worry. [passage omitted]    [Reinhard] You head a list for the European election. Do  you have a plan for Europe that distinguishes your list from the  others?    [Tapie] I am positively certain that Europe can only work if  we build a federal Europe.    [Reinhard] This is not exactly the most popular position  these days.    [Tapie] Actually, it is the most unpopular there is. Which  goes to show once more that I am rather less of a populist than  all the others, including those "Europeans at heart" who want to  build Europe, albeit not this one because their first concern is  to tell the public what they think it wants to hear. Quite  frankly, I think that is disgusting.    [Reinhard] This is supposed to be the position of Dominique  Baudis [who heads the majority's list]; why are you making his  territory your own?    [Tapie] Because I believe in a federal Europe and I am not  afraid of saying so. Baudis does not have the guts to do it  because that is unpopular. [passage omitted]    [Reinhard] Your list is mostly disruptive for the Left. Why  are you fighting the people who took you to the top?    [Tapie] These people never respected me. They used me.    [Reinhard] What will happen if Rocard suffers a severe  setback in the 12 June election?    [Tapie] Can one change everything without changing anything?  Are we one day to acknowledge at last the fact that we cannot  change anything without shuffling things and people around a bit?    If Rocard succeeds, it will mean his presidential potential  is good. Will that be enough to beat the Right? This is a  question that is rather more pressing for the Right than for the  Left. If they keep up their internal bickering, everything is  possible.    [Reinhard] But what if Rocard fails?    [Tapie] If Rocard fails, not only the Left will suffer.  There will be a general redistribution of all political cards.  French politics has traditionally been an unavoidable binary  system which had nothing to do with the aspirations and opinions  of the electorate, nor with what has been going on elsewhere in  the world. Thanks to the European election, this nonsense has  now been exposed for what it is. For example, the Rocard list  has much more in common with the Baudis list than the latter has  with that of De Villiers [leader of the anti-Maastricht list],  or Rocard's has with that of [former Socialist Defense Minister  Jean-Pierre] Chevenement.    [Reinhard] However, the presidential election will take  place in a year, and the Left needs a champion. So if Rocard is  not it, who else?    [Tapie] If Rocard fails, this does not mean that the Left  will collapse. It will redefine itself around someone else.    [Reinhard] Someone from the Socialist Party?    [Tapie] We shall see. If Rocard fails, there might not be  anybody else that is able to win. However, there is no shortage  of men on the Left. There are Delors, Lang, and Kouchner. And  why not Badinter, or a newcomer.    [Reinhard] You said recently that you did not feel ready for  the part. Are you betting on becoming the game's referee, short  of being the Left's candidate?    [Tapie] Of course I am. This is why they do not want me to  obtain a good score. I wish I could be there when they pick  their man, so as to be sure that those who are with me are well  represented.    [Reinhard] What is your measure of Rocard's hostility toward  you?    [Tapie] Rocard refuses to have a debate on television with  me. And yet, left-leaning French people would certainly like to  know exactly where the Left stands today. They want to  understand the difference between Radicalism and Socialism.    [Reinhard] And what is the difference?    [Tapie] There are those who think that solving the  unemployment problem is a matter of working only four days a  week for four days' worth of pay, and those who, like myself,  believe that we need to work more than we used to. I think that  we need to work six days a week, not five, because the only way  to create wealth is to work harder. Rocard thinks the solution  is working less rather than working more. There is a difference  here, and people have a right to understand why.    [Reinhard] Rocard will not debate with you, and that is fair  enough. Is this the only thing you hold against him?    [Tapie] There is also the anti-Tapie lobbying campaign that  Rocard's buddies have been conducting. This lobbying of the  editors of LE MONDE, LIBERATION, LE NOUVEL OBSERVATEUR, or LE  POINT is being led by lawyer Tony Dreyfus. And that is  intolerable. It is ineffective and intolerable. It is such an  irritant that I might lose my temper during the last days of the  campaign.    [Reinhard] Some commentators believe that the president has  helped you recruit people for your list. A case in point is  Catherine Lalumiere, whom he reportedly encouraged to join.    [Tapie] First of all, my list is a good list. And we did  not need anybody's help to put it together. As far as Catherine  Lalumiere [former Council of Europe Secretary General] is  concerned, she did not ask the president's assent, and had she  done so, she would not have got it.

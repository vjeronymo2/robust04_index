			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 10 May (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad  Husayn Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has  stated that the Egyptian Armed Forces are working to achieve the  right "balance" between their size and the level of their  armament.    He said that achieving a reasonable and correct size relying  on modern and advanced armament is better than keeping  "outdated" weapons that require expensive maintenance and many  troops, which is a burden and does not achieve the required  benefit.    He said this is why the Egyptian Armed Forces are constantly  working to develop and modernize their weapons.    In a statement, Field Marshal Tantawi said there is constant  action within the framework of military cooperation between  Egypt and the United States to agree on the new weapons that the  Egyptian forces need. He noted that this will be one of the  main issues that he will discuss with U.S. officials during his  current visit to the United States. He also said that current  cooperation between Egypt and the United States covers three  main fields: training, armament, and maintenance.    The defense minister stressed that Egypt has its own concept  of its Armed Forces' size and armament. He said that this  "precise formula" needs careful study because an increase in the  size of the Armed Forces will make them "overmanned." He added  that the difficult point in the formula lies in a reduction in  size requiring to be offset by advanced armaments that will  replace the outdated weapons.    Field Marshal Tantawi regretted the fighting in Yemen.  Answering a question, he said that no party can achieve real  gains or emerge victorious from this fighting. The Yemeni  people will be the loser.</p>

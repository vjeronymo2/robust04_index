			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Bush and the comeback kid MR ROSS Perot has done a double service to his country. His campaign for the White House demonstrated the depth of dissatisfaction felt by many Americans about their political system and thus gave a salutary shock to both main parties. But his timely withdrawal has also removed an element of confusion. It would have been ironic if Mr Perot's populist campaign had taken the ultimate choice of the next president away from the voters and placed it in the hands of politicians. A Perot presidency would certainly have been a great disappointment to his supporters, because the premise on which his campaign was based is wrong. That premise was that there are simple solutions to America's problems, and that all that is lacking for the application of those solutions is competent leadership. Such a perception is common among people looking at politics from the outside, especially perhaps from the world of business. It neglects the fact that in a democracy those who take decisions in the general interest face coalitions of those who believe their particular interests are being damaged. Overcoming this problem is the essence of political leadership. Effective leadership is unlikely to come from a man who denies the existence of the problem. It is somewhat odd that Mr Perot, having decided to withdraw, should now encourage his followers to keep his name on the ballot and remain in being as an organised pressure group, seeking to influence the main parties. To do that they will have to draw up a programme and stress the importance of specific policy positions, precisely what Mr Perot himself refused to do. A campaign focused on policy issues would, however, be a welcome change. In theory it should now be possible. There is a clear choice between two candidates. They do not represent utterly opposed political philosophies. On the contrary, both represent the moderate wing of their respective parties, and therefore should in theory be well placed to compete for the middle ground. Mr Clinton seems to have made a shrewd move in breaking with convention and choosing a vice-presidential candidate close to him both politically and geographically, thereby stressing that the new orientation of the Democratic party reflects more than a temporary balance of forces within the party. But the two candidates do differ in their priorities, and the campaign should help to clarify that. On issues ranging from taxation through health care and the environment to the type of judge nominated to the Supreme Court, it will make a significant difference which of them occupies the White House for the next four years. On Mr Clinton's side is the argument that the Democrats are almost certain to retain control of both houses of Congress, and that a Democratic president may therefore stand a better chance of breaking the deadlock on the federal budget. On Mr Bush's side is his much greater experience of, and interest in, international affairs. Although happily Mr Clinton, unlike Mr Perot, is not challenging the basic commitment of the US to free trade and to a leading role in global security, foreigners will worry lest these matters get a lower priority. On the other hand effective US action to address its most acute domestic problems is not an alternative to, but in the medium term a condition of, its remaining an effective superpower. World leadership begins at home.</p>

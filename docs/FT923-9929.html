			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow cautiously approaches record high Wall Street WALL STREET consolidated its mid-week rally by posting modest gains yesterday as the market headed toward record levels, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.89 to close at 3,393.78 after briefly breaking above 3,400 at 12.45pm. The Dow reached a record high of 3,413.21 on June 1. The overall tone of the market, however, was mixed with advancing issues leading those declining by a slim margin of 970 to 783. NYSE volume was fairly light, with just over 174m shares changing hands. The market's restrained advance was reflected in the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500, which rose 0.32 to 424.20. The Nasdaq composite was up 2.03 at 580.83. The Dow, which started the week at 3,285.71, added 12.70 on Thursday to close at 3,391.89. Among the economic news of the day was the release of stronger-than-expected new factory orders for June, which rose 2.3 per cent. Orders for durable goods were revised up to 2.7 per cent from an earlier reported gain of 2.3 per cent. In addition, personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5 per cent in the month, while personal income was flat. Equities were largely unmoved by the deluge of data, but second quarter results continued to have an impact on individual stock movements. McDonnell Douglas tumbled Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 36 3/4 following second quarter net income of Dollars 1-a-share against Dollars 2.01 in the same period of 1991. Shares in Aetna, one of the largest US composite insurers, tumbled Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 in active trading on the back of a loss of 46 cents a share on continuing operations compared with net income from continued operations of Dollars 1.13 a share the previous year. Among other big insurers, Travelers edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 22 1/2 , Equitable slid Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 9 1/8 and Cigna eased Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 54 3/4 . Fleet Mortgage, a unit of Fleet Financial, was the most active issue of the morning. The stock was quoted at Dollars 23 3/8 at the close of trading. An 8.3m initial public offer was made at Dollars 23-a-share. Other active big board issues included RJR Nabisco Holdings, unchanged at Dollars 8 3/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb, steady at Dollars 69 1/2 and Baker Hughes, off Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 22 3/8 . Paramount Communications fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 45 5/8 . The US entertainment group said it was expanding into the theme park business through the acquisition of King's Entertainment in a deal valued at about Dollars 400m. In Nasdaq trading, Microsoft fell Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 72 3/4 , Dell Computer climbed Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 23 and Apple Computer lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 47. Canada TORONTO share prices posted a solid gain in moderate trading, bucking the downward move shown by most world markets. Based on preliminary data, the composite index was up 17.79 points, or 0.52%, to close at 3,443.42. On the week, the composite index added about 44 points. Winning issues led losers by 324 to 217, volume rose to 25.734m shares from 24.328m the previous day and trading value was CDollars 329.8m against CDollars 226.2m.

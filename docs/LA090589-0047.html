			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CUBAN IN CONGRESS SPELLS END OF HISPANIC  </P> <P> As near as I can determine, I disagree with almost every political position  taken by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the Cuban-American elected to Congress last week  from the Miami area. Still, I'm glad the Republican state senator was chosen to  fill the seat held by the late Rep. Claude Pepper, a Democrat.  </P> <P> But not because she will increase the seven-member Congressional Hispanic  Caucus by one and give that group its first woman member and its first  Republican since Manuel Lujan of New Mexico left Congress to become secretary  of the interior. In fact, if Ros-Lehtinen is consistent to the extreme  right-wing positions she took during her campaign, she may even undermine the  Latino unity that the Hispanic Caucus is supposed to symbolize.  </P> <P> That's precisely what I expect her to do. And every time Ros-Lehtinen does  something that sets her apart from her Latino colleagues in Congress, all of  them moderate-to-liberal Democrats, it should remind us just how diverse the  Latino population in this country is. Particular attention should be paid by  those Latinos who propagate the myth that there is an interest group in this  nation that can properly be called "Hispanic."  </P> <P> In fact, it is rare for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to vote as a bloc on  anything, unlike the Congressional Black Caucus and several state congressional  delegations that hang together on issues important to, say, Texas or  Massachusetts.  </P> <P> The most noteworthy political milestone the Hispanic Caucus has achieved in the  13 years since it was founded didn't occur until last year. Then caucus members  persuaded Congress to expand the nation's annual Hispanic Heritage Week, first  proclaimed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1968, to Hispanic Heritage Month.  (I pause here for the impact of this monumental achievement to sink in.)  </P> <P> For the record, Hispanic Heritage Month runs from Sept. 15 through Oct. 15. It  encompasses the dates that mark the independence days of Mexico and several  Central American countries, as well as the date of Columbus' discovery of the  New World, celebrated here as Columbus Day and in Latin America as El Dia de la  Raza, the Day of the New Race.  </P> <P> Of course, the members of Congress who pushed this thing through meant well.  Rep. Esteban Torres (D-La Puente), for example, said he hopes schools,  colleges, corporations and Latino organizations use the month "to commemorate  Hispanic culture and achievements."  </P> <P> Fine. But I hope Mexican Americans also use the time to ponder what the term  Hispanic implies, and why some of us resist using the word.  </P> <P> "Hispanic" has been in the dictionaries for centuries, but first came to be  widely used in this country in 1970 when the Census Bureau needed a convenient  term to encompass all people of Latin American extraction living in the United  States. Since then it has been popularized -- and grossly misused -- by Latino  activists who adopted the term for blatantly self-serving reasons, foisting it  on the mass media in the process.  </P> <P> These Latino activists saw themselves as competing with African Americans for  government services and jobs under antipoverty and affirmative-action programs.  They adopted a term that lumped Mexican Americans in with Puerto Ricans, Cuban  Americans and others simply because it increased their numbers and, presumably,  their clout.  </P> <P> It was a shortsighted strategy.  </P> <P> Even in crass political terms, it was self-defeating. The term Hispanic allowed  other Latinos to use a large and growing Mexican American population to  increase their influence. Add up all the Cubans and Puerto Ricans on the East  Coast, for instance, and they are still outnumbered by all the Mexicans in the  Los Angeles area alone.  </P> <P> But my concern goes deeper than who is using whom politically. For the term  Hispanic also casts Chicanos in an erroneous light. It reduces us to just  another political interest group. We are more than that.  </P> <P> While many Chicanos and other Latinos have been victims of racial  discrimination similar to that experienced by black Americans, our historical  experience has been different. Indeed, Mexican Americans are a unique ethnic  group in this country, neither fully immigrant nor fully native. Some Chicanos  share the traditional immigrant experience of the Irish, the Chinese and many  other nationalities that came to this country from abroad, others come from  families that were here before the first English colonists arrived at Plymouth  Rock.  </P> <P> When the Chicano Movement began to assert itself 25 years ago, inspired by the  civil-rights struggle, Chicano leaders and thinkers began trying to define  precisely who we are and how we fit into this special country. That profoundly  important process of self-definition was sidetracked when some of us began  letting ourselves be called "Hispanic" -- in effect, allowing someone else to  define who we are.  </P> <P> Having written about this in the past, I know that many Mexican Americans  disagree with me. I urge them to reply vociferously. We must re-energize the  process of self-definition that ended so prematurely. By getting the dialogue  going again, we can at least make Hispanic Heritage Month useful.  </P></p>

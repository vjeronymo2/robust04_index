			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 5 (AFP) -- General Charles Ritchie,  chief of staff of the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] in former  Yugoslavia, dismissed Tuesday reports that the eastern enclave  of Gorazde was about to fall to a separatist Serb onslaught.    "It is not our assessment that it is about to fall," Ritchie  told reporters here.    Regarding "the more dramatic reports" of Serb incursions  into  the enclave, he said: "I'm afraid we have nothing to confirm on  that."    Bosnian Serb chief of staff Manojlo Milovanovic confirmed  earlier that his forces had breached Bosnian Army defence lines  at Gorazde, succeeding in landing on the western bank of the  Drina river which flows a few kilometres (miles) to the east and  south of the town.    An UNPROFOR spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity,  warned of a "very serious" situation in the enclave.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Israel released 389 Palestinian prisoners from the  Qezi'ot jail today. Buses took them via Nahal 'Oz to the Gaza  Strip. Most of the freed prisoners are members of the Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad groups which  oppose the peace process. Hundreds of Palestinians welcomed  them in Gaza with a large procession.    The Israeli Army says about 4,000 Palestinian prisoners have  been released since the Cairo agreement with the PLO signed on  the 4th of May. Under the agreement Israel said it would free  some 5,000 prisoners.    The Palestinian police in Jericho said it would refuse to  let  in the 200 prisoners due to be taken there today. The prisoners  signed statements that they would remain in the self-rule areas  and not oppose the Israel-PLO peace accord with violence.</p>

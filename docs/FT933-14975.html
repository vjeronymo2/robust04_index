			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Iraq inspection team quits Mark Silver, leader of a team of United Nations weapons experts, during his ill-fated visit to Iraq to seal off missile testing sites. After less than 24 hours the team members left because Baghdad refused to let them do their job. US vice-president Al Gore said force was an option if Iraq continued to defy the UN. Iraq, meanwhile, called on the Security Council to prevent any attack by the US. Page 4</p>

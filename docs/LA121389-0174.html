			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'DICK TRACY' BEATTY DOES A COP-OUT ON 'MISERY'  </P> <P> CHANGES: Warren Beatty was supposed to do Rob Reiner's new movie, "Misery," but  the star and director of the coming "Dick Tracy" has now backed out. He will be  replaced by James Caan . . . and Kim Basinger was supposed to follow "Batman"  with a movie for 20th Century Fox, a first independent project there by Leonard  Goldberg, with screenplay by "Rainman" Oscar winner Ron Bass, to be directed by  Joe Ruben. However, "Sleeping With The Enemy" is not to be for Kim it now  seems, and Fox is negotiating with Julia ("Steel Magnolias") Roberts to take  over the leading role.  </P> <P> THE UNITED NATIONS has often been criticized since its founding in 1945 as not  being progressive enough, not taking enough stands on issues and, in general,  being a fairly useless body of delegates. However, something exciting and long  overdue may be happening soon at the United Nations. Rumor has it that Kenya's  U.N. ambassador, Michael George Okeyo, is being groomed to take the top spot of  secretary-general. If this happens, Okeyo would become the first ever black  head of the world body.  </P> <P> JODIE FOSTER is bringing considerable excitement to the office of Secretary of  Labor Elizabeth Hanford Dole these days. Not that Dole's office isn't always a  hotbed of important doings, but having an Oscar-winning actress on the premises  does goose things up. Jodie is in Washington filming Orion's thriller, "Silence  of the Lambs," wherein she plays an FBI recruit, tracking down a serial killer.  Dole's inner sanctum was selected as the set for the office of the director of  the FBI because of its dramatic, cinematic view overlooking the U.S. Capitol.  </P> <P> This Jonathan Demme film also stars Anthony Hopkins as a psychopath aiding  Jodie in her search for the killer. And Roger Corman, the veteran film director  and producer of all those great Vincent Price horror films, will appear in  "Silence of the Lambs" as the head of the FBI. (A scary thought for sure,  though not nearly as scary as the director we actually had at the FBI for  years.)  </P> <P> "LBJ: The White House Years" by Harry Middleton, director of the LBJ Library,  will be published this spring by Abrams to coincide with a series of gala  "homecomings" and forums for LBJ intimates to take place in Washington, D.C.,  and Austin, Tex., in April, May and June. The book is a true insider's  perspective of the LBJ Presidency. The cumulative effect of Middleton's  incisive text and the hundreds of photographs, by chief presidential  photographer Yoichi Okamoto, show how the White House functioned during LBJ's  tumultuous era of war and radical social change.  </P> <P> Middleton's positive approach is in contrast to Robert Caro's coming second  volume on Johnson also due this spring. Caro takes a far more jaundiced view of  the controversial President. Lady Bird Johnson's former press secretary, Liz  Carpenter, says of Middleton, "He knew LBJ intimately, so it's an honest  portrayal -- on all sides. His book is an insider's view."  </P> <P> SIMON McCORKINDALE, that terrific British actor, and James Brady, that terrific  American journalist and author, have agreed on an option deal for Brady's  elegant 1977 best seller, "Paris One." This was Brady's first novel, his baby,  which has since been published in a dozen editions around the world.  </P> <P> Actor McCorkindale sees "Paris One" as a four-hour television movie. I guess  James must see it that way, too.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BIG DEFENSE LIFTS ROYAL TO WIN OVER CHAMINADE  </P> <P> Royal High figured that if it kept the score close going into the fourth  quarter, it might have a chance to beat favored Chaminade on Friday.  </P> <P> So when Royal found itself behind by only one point with 10 minutes left,  things looked pretty good. And, sure enough, the Highlander defense came  through.  </P> <P> Senior linebacker Jesse Rosen returned an interception 24 yards for a touchdown  and Scott O'Neil recorded a safety on a quarterback sack to spark a 19-11 upset  at Simi Valley High.  </P> <P> "It's a better start than last year," said Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt, whose  team was beaten 28-12 by Chaminade in last year's opener.  </P> <P> Chaminade, a playoff team last year, opened this season with a young offensive  line and an inexperienced quarterback -- not a promising combination when it  comes to scoring points.  </P> <P> The Eagles' leading rusher, Colin Havert, could muster only 30 yards in 11  carries. And Jeff Meyer, a junior starting his first game, had two passes  intercepted.  </P> <P> But Meyer wasn't the only player who appeared nervous. Royal running back Rob  Smith fumbled on the game's first play and Meyer fumbled it back on the next  play. Then, Royal quarterback Charles Snyder returned the favor, fumbling the  ball back on the ensuing snap.  </P> <P> All told, the two teams suffered five fumbles and two interceptions.  </P> <P> There were 224 yards in penalties.  </P> <P> Chaminade opened the scoring in the first quarter when Mike Terzian kicked a  42-yard field goal.  </P> <P> Royal got rolling in the second quarter. Aided by an awakened running game and  two pass-interference penalties, the Highlanders drove 50 yards for a touchdown  and a 7-3 lead, Jon Banton scoring from 10 yards.  </P> <P> With 59 seconds left in the half, Chaminade failed on a fourth-down attempt  near midfield and Royal capitalized. Snyder threw 44 yards to Sean Mitchell and  Matt Brinkman kicked a 27-yard field goal with six seconds remaining to give  Royal a 10-3 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Chaminade came out storming in the second half, though. Felix Goodson returned  a kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown and the Eagles made good on a two-point  conversion to lead 11-10.  </P> <P> The score stayed that way until early in the fourth quarter when Rosen provided  his heroics, picking of a screen pass and running untouched to the end zone.  </P> <P> "It's a big win," Rosen said. "It's the way to start the season."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China slammed Thursday a  US State Department report that criticised Beijing's human  rights record, labelling it "utterly unreasonable" and a gross  distortion of the facts. [passage omitted]    The publication of the report and China's aggressive  response  is sure to further hamper Sino-U.S. negotiations over  Washington's renewal of China's most-favoured-nation (MFN)  trading status, which President Bill Clinton has tied to  significant progress in human rights.    [Foreign Ministry spokesman] Wu also accused Washington of  using the human rights issue to undermine China's sovereign  rights, reiterating that Beijing is "resolutely opposed to  interference in our internal affairs under the excuse of human  rights." In a clear reference to the detention of political  prisoners, Wu stressed that the functioning of China's judiciary  "is something that the Chinese government cannot interfere in,  let alone any foreign forces."    "It is not appropriate to mix human rights issues and legal  issues," he added.    The U.S. report said China had released some prominent  political dissidents, but continued to hold hundreds and perhaps  thousands more, and often engaged in torture in prisons,  especially in sensitive regions such as Tibet. "Fundamental  human rights provided for in the Chinese Constitution frequently  are ignored in practice, and challenges to the Communist Party's  political authority are often dealt with harshly and  arbitrarily," the report said. [passage omitted]    Asked if China was willing to make gestures in the human  rights area in order to make it easier for Clinton to recommend  MFN renewal, Wu simply reiterated the government's position of  holding dialogue with other countries "on the basis of equality  and mutual respect."</p>

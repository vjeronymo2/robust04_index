A NODONG SINMUN analyst says:    What he said at the press conference boils down to the  praise  of his "achievements" whereby he embellished his treacheries as  patriotism with flowery words, the advertisement of "policy"  without any concrete proposal and deceptive, infeasible  "commitments." His self-praise was intended to defend his  monstrous crimes against the country and the nation in the first  year of office and avoid his responsibility for them.    Kim Yong-sam got on the nerve of the North, groundlessly  charging it with the "nuclear problem." He cried for "military  reform and modernization" and "security posture" to cope with  possible "provocations" by the North. He obtrusively blared  that they have the "final say" as regards the "Team Spirit"  joint military exercises and the United States "respects" their  will.    This year, too, he, far from showing his willingness for  reunification, intends to seek North-South confrontation as he  did in the first year of office marked by treacheries. He is  really a traitor to the nation and a human dreg who deserves  condemnation by the 70 million people of our nation.    Regarding the internal problems of South Korea, Kim Yong-sam  cried for "continued progress of change and reform" and  "internationalization of the whole society," as if he would do  something in the second year of office. He, however, failed to  put forward any concrete proposal.    His voluble eloquence at the hurriedly called press  conference in the new year is the extension of the old game of  the political prostitute to attain the "security of power" by  quelling the protest of the people against such treacherous acts  of the "civilian" regime as rice market opening and taking the  edge off their anti- "government" struggle.    A MINJU CHOSON analyst says that whatever honeyed  "commitments" the "civilian" traitor may make, while enriching  outside forces and the privileged circles at the sacrifice of  the people, no one will be deceived.</p>

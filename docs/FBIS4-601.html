			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by C. Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban April 12 SAPA -- There are divergent views on  whether free and fair elections can be held under the state of  emergency in Natal/kwaZulu. On Tuesday [12 April], Independent  Electoral Commission [IEC] Vice-Chairman Dikgang Moseneke told  students at the University of Natal, Durban "it is still  possible to have free and fair elections under the state of  emergency which is directed at curbing violence".    But, in a recent memorandum to the Transitional Executive  Council [TEC], a host of community organisations called for a  review of the emergency, claiming it had failed to control  violence or bring stability to the region. After convening last  week at a summit organised by the Institute for a Democratic  Alternative for SA, the organisations said: "Far from  stabilising the volatile situation in our province, feedback  from communities indicates the state of emergency has served to  heighten resistance to the election and political polarisation."    They asked the TEC to review the purpose of the emergency to  ensure it was not geared to creating conditions in which the  people of kwaZulu/Natal could go to voting stations, but could  not go to their homes.    "There is no way this forthcoming election can be free,  fair,  safe or in any way a celebration of the advent of democracy, if  people can only go to the polls under armed guard."    The memo added that the SA Defence Force's role had to be  defined more clearly.    In his address on Tuesday, Mr Moseneke said he had just  returned from a security meeting where he had been told the  number of deaths in Natal in the past 48 hours had decreased in  comparison to the previous two-day period. The lower the levels  of violence, the easier it would be for people to choose to  vote, he said, adding that a national security plan was in place  to ensure voters could go to the polls safely in just over two  weeks.    Although there would be "difficulties" in Natal, "we should  be able to secure each (polling) station".    "The IEC will run elections in Natal as near perfect as it  could be in any other part of the country," he said.    Mr Moseneke said South Africans should not allow fear to  stand in their way of voting, adding that people convinced they  should vote could encourage others to do so.</p>

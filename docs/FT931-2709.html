			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / British Coal to study pit proposal BRITISH Coal said last night it is to consider National Union of Mineworkers' proposals to resolve the future of the 10 pits not included in the current coal review by referring them to an independent body that could report within 12 weeks, Robert Taylor writes. Mr Kevan Hunt, British Coal employee relations director, said: 'While we have some serious reservations, we will pursue the NUM proposals as a matter of urgency.' The decision follows a meeting yesterday between British Coal and the NUM at which the union acknowledged that local and area consultation had taken place over the future of the 10 collieries and proposed there should be no national appeal over them.</p>

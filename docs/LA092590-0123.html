			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> DIO BLARES HIS STUFF IN WICKED SHOW OF FORCE  </P> <P> Considering how effective blaring rock music was in rousting Manuel Noriega out  of Panama some months back, perhaps our military should consider a similar  tactic in resolving the Persian Gulf crisis. Of course, it's armed millions  we're dealing with there, so we'd need a bigger audio nuisance, like that  produced by the Dio-and-Stryper-headed metal mega-bill at the Pacific  Amphitheatre on Sunday.  </P> <P> Just set them up on the Iraq border and Ronnie James Dio's Wagnerian excess of  blackboard-screeching vocals and bombastic rock could cause even the most  fanatic hordes to gnash their teeth in despair, and the show's incessant flames  and explosions made a wicked show of force. And if there's any doubt in the  Middle East that we're the Great Satan, Dio's devil-horn hand signals and  garish skeletal rib-cage stage design should settle the matter.  </P> <P> His 18-song (counting keyboard and guitar showcases) show ranged from his  Blackmore's Rainbow days with "The Man on the Silver Mountain" to the  well-crafted crunch fest "Lock Up the Wolves" title track from his current  album.  </P> <P> Dio's lyrics tend to be direct and to the point, such as on "Stand Up and  Shout," in which he screamed "Stand up and shout! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!  Shout! Shout! Shout!" or "Don't Talk to Strangers" where he reminded, "Don't  talk to strangers! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!" You get the idea.  </P> <P> Former Yngwie Malmsteen keyboardist Jens Johansson did a neoclassical solo on a  synth that was suspended from wires. And, in true neoclassical style, the  instrument exploded when he was finished.  </P> <P> Rowan Robertson, an 18-year-old guitar whiz, did a similar solo turn displaying  his metal fret-board technique, a style so aptly described by Frank Zappa as  going "weedle-weedle-wee" a whole lot while making faces and waiting for the  smoke bombs to go off (Yup, Robertson got a climatic explosion, too).  </P> <P> Dio's album covers are coveted by anti-rock proselytizers, as they invariably  show priests being cast into pits of fire or damned masses shuffling into hell.  </P> <P> Perhaps his fans were attempting to mimic that hell-bent ethos because the  small but wild crowd was awash in spilled beer and some acrid,  chemical-smelling smoke. (One partaking gentleman was polite enough to identify  what he was smoking as PCP before he went thoroughly cow-eyed.)  </P> <P> It doesn't necessarily help that kids have such great role models as KNAC-FM  deejay "Dangerous Darren" who, when announcing Stryper a couple of hours  earlier, burbled, "Hey man, it's not even Dio yet," then describing his  condition with a vulgarism.  </P> <P> Having eschewed its overtly Christian bent, second-billed Stryper now seems  nearly indistinguishable from countless other plodding metalers.  </P> <P> The lyrics of the Orange County-based quartet's current "Against the Law" album  may still differ in lyrical content -- supporting fidelity, clean living and  such -- but the group's lackluster delivery (complicated further by problems  with drummer Robert Sweet's equipment) failed to put any conviction behind the  performers. And certainly their message seemed lost on this crowd.  </P> <P> Third-billed Love-Hate, on a lineup that also featured Dogs D'Amour and Cold  Sweat, proved equally vapid in its 30-minute set.  </P></p>

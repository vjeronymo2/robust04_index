Instead, much of the money appeared to have been paid to the benefit of a Mr Kitallides, they said. The court renewed injunctions against Mr Lloyd-Wright and his company, the Delaware-based Lloyd-Wright Investment Corporation, freezing all assets worldwide pending further SIB inquiries. Lawyers for Mr Lloyd-Wright said he denied any dishonesty.</p>

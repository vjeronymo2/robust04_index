			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS;  </P> <P> CHEVRON, MOBIL NET OFF; PHILLIPS GAINS  </P> <P> Phillips Petroleum Co. on Tuesday reported improved earnings in the second  quarter, due in part to higher crude oil prices, while Chevron Corp. and Mobil  Corp. both reported lower earnings.  </P> <P> Chevron's earnings dropped 22.3%, in part because last year's numbers included  an unusual gain; Mobil's dropped 22.7%, in part because this year's figures  included a loss from the sale of assets, and Phillips' rose 15.9%.  </P> <P> All companies benefited from higher crude prices and better refining margins  during the period, though Phillips reported high costs from extensive scheduled  maintenance on its refineries. The companies also reported lower income from  chemical businesses, though Mobil reported an increase from the sale of its  interest in a chemical company.  </P> <P> Chevron Corp.  </P> <P> Net income for the quarter ended June 30 was $404 million, compared to $520  million in the like period of 1988.  </P> <P> Last year's second-quarter earnings included a $148-million gain mainly from  Chevron's sale of its interest in the mineral company AMAX Inc.  </P> <P> This quarter's earnings were reduced by $10 million in adjustments, including  special items and the effects of foreign exchange. Revenue for the quarter was  $8.2 billion, compared to $7.3 billion in 1988.  </P> <P> Mobil Corp.  </P> <P> Estimated earnings for the second quarter were $401 million, compared to $519  million in 1988.  </P> <P> The 1989 figure included a $140-million loss on the sale of business operations  in South Africa. Without that loss, earnings would have increased about 4% over  last year, due mainly to improved income from refining and marketing operations  and lower financing costs.  </P> <P> Earnings also improved from recent acquisitions, including a refinery in  Louisiana, the domestic oil and gas interests of Newmont Mining and a chemical  plant in Texas.  </P> <P> Revenue for the quarter was $14 billion, unchanged from a year earlier.  </P> <P> Phillips Petroleum Co.  </P> <P> Net income was $197 million, compared to $170 million in the like period a year  ago.  </P> <P> Earnings were helped by a $21-million gain from the settlement of a dispute  involving an interstate pipeline company, Phillips reported. Revenue for the  quarter was $3.3 billion, compared to $2.9 billion a year ago.  </P></p>

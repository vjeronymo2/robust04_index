			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of Birmingham and the West Midlands (12): Financial services expands again - Sectoral performance / Paul Cheeseright looks at different parts of the regional economy The regional financial services community, centred on Birmingham, reports increasing business. Mr Peter Willis, chief executive of Birmingham City 2000, which acts as an umbrella group for the sector, says some firms are considering whether to resume recruitment. 'Activity levels are rising. Part of (the reason) is that there's a huge backlog of projects which have been shelved over the past four years,' he explained. Ernst &amp; Young, accountants, said its management consultancy activities had increased by 30 per cent over the past year. 3i, the largest venture capital group in the UK, reported that, in the West Midlands, it had invested more during the first half of 1994 than in the whole of 1993. There is increased activity, too, among solicitors. Eversheds declared a 5 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 16m at its Birmingham office during the year to April, and observed that the increase was accelerating this year. Edge &amp; Ellison said its business was running 15 per cent ahead of last year, although there was pressure on margins. The financial services community in Birmingham has started to grow again. During the recession some of the London merchant banks withdrew. Now, Henry Ansbacher has arrived. BWD Rensburg has joined the ranks of the stockbrokers, a small community where the leading operator is Albert E Sharp. In spite of the revival, the main preoccupation of the financial services community is to keep regional business within the region. 'Once an initial transaction has gone to London, there is much less opportunity for the local financial community to service it,' said Mr Willis. Flows of business are difficult to monitor, but there appears to have been some success in stopping business drifting to London. 'There have been a load of management buy-outs in the last five years which would have been done in London before,' said Mr Digby Jones, deputy senior partner of Edge &amp; Ellison. There have also been some highly publicised transactions using wholly West Midlands services - for example, the arrangement by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, accountants, of the Leyland Daf Vans management buy-out from the receiver in 1993. That also showed how accountants have been moving into the market gap left by the merchant banks. The difference between Birmingham and the much larger London financial services community is that the latter has a life of its own. Birmingham does not. Manufacturing, said Mr Willis, is absolutely vital: 'We cannot get away from the fact that the skills of the West Midlands are transferring materials into products. That is the core of financial services activity. Other things become important adjuncts to that.' Growth of the sector thus becomes a matter of preventing local business from going elsewhere and developing an international approach to business, which ties in with the more export-oriented manufacturing companies. 'We could be a professional stepping-stone for those who want to do business in Europe. Why should London be the only stepping-stone?' asked Mr Willis. PROFILE: 3i. The venture capital group invested Pounds 26m in West Midlands companies during the year to March, and now Mr Chris Rowlands, the regional director, reports increased business. Buy-in and buy-out activity has continued strongly in 1994. Demand for expansion capital, mainly from companies seeking to make acquisitions has also been growing, 3i reports. Alongside this corporate activity, the demand for 3i funds from existing companies, to assist expansion, has been sluggish. Mr Rowlands said that, in the late 1980s, about 40 per cent of 3i funding had gone into such projects. Now, it was more like 20 per cent. He has noticed another difference. 'Over the last 18-24 months, there has been a significant change in the way the mid-size corporate deals - for companies with turnovers between Pounds 15m and Pounds 50m - are being done. 'Predominantly, they are being handled by regional professionals. What are organisations going to do if they are based only in London?'</p>

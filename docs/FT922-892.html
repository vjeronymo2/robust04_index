			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (12): Fresh demands on designers - Innovation The designer of the executive car finds himself increasingly surrounded by pressures and constraints. In order to remain competitive, it is essential that he strives to make his next car even more comfortable, better equipped and safer. For the first time, however, he is also under pressure to make it smaller and lighter. Audi's chairman has already said that the recently announced new Audi 80 will be the last of that company's cars to be heavier than its predecessor. Mercedes managers admit that for all its apparent sales success, the current S-class would have been smaller and lighter if they had begun work on it 18 months later. Two factors are at work here. One is sheer social pressure. In a few years, one senior car designer has suggested, it will be about as socially acceptable to drive a large, heavy, thirsty car as it already is to wear a wild fur coat. The other factor is Corporate Average Fleet Economy (Cafe) - the official test fuel consumption averaged across all the cars made by a company in a given year. Cafe targets have long been set (together with penalties for non-compliance) in the US. They are about to be increased, and they may also be adopted in Europe. There are several engineering techniques available to improve fuel economy. The problem is that the most easily available have been exploited already. Ever since the energy crises of the 1970s, cars have had more efficient engines, more gear ratios and better aerodynamics. The only thing left is weight reduction. It has become increasingly clear that significant weight savings can only be achieved by abandoning current principles of car construction, and in particular the sheet steel body. Today's car structures have already been ruthlessly optimised by computer analysis, yet cars are getting no lighter. That is why so many leading car manufacturers are beginning to look very seriously at aluminium as an alternative to steel. The alternative lightweight material, plastic composite, is very much 'on hold' because of today's emphasis on easy recycling. Audi, working in conjunction with Alcoa, has actually committed itself to part-aluminium construction for its next new model. By reducing body structure weight by perhaps 30 per cent, aluminium opens the possibility of a benign spiral of weight saving. A lighter body implies a smaller engine to achieve the same performance, driving throughout a lighter gearbox, with lighter brakes, and so on. The only question is whether car designers will actually work in this direction and so achieve better economy, or whether they will be tempted to retain existing drivelines and turn the body weight saving into even better performance. The social pressure argument, and the looming threat of 'European Cafe', suggests not. Some designers also suggest that savings could be made by changing the shape of the executive car. Most of them have been surprised by the success of 'one-box' designs such as the Renault Espace. There is no doubt that executive cars designed along similar lines could offer as much space as existing models, and more comfort and convenience, in a more compact (but taller) shape. The question is whether enough buyers would be prepared to abandon the trend towards ever longer, lower but essentially conventional-looking models. It is at least possible, therefore, that the executive car of the future may look more different than it really is under the skin. It is certain, for example, that nothing is likely to replace the reciprocating internal combustion engine in the foreseeable future, although some engineers remain enthusiastic about the long-term prospects of a 'hybrid' car with electric drive and a very small gas turbine to provide the power generation. A pure electric executive car seems most unlikely; the electric-car quota soon to be demanded by US legislation is certain to be fulfilled by city-runabout designs. Transmissions are also unlikely to see any drastic change. The majority of executive cars in 10 years' time are likely to have five-speed automatic transmissions, although their control systems will have become much more ingenious both in their ability to shift smoothly and to assess the driver's style of progress and adapt to it. This is just one of the many ways in which electronics will make cars easier to drive and more comfortable. Certainly, electronics will spread ever more from engine and transmission management, where it already holds such sway, into chassis engineering. Development departments everywhere are looking at means of exploiting electronic control to achieve a smoother ride and more secure stability and handling. Many such developments will depend on the ability of systems to tolerate faults without endangering safety, which is why engineers are concentrating so hard on failure analysis, duplicated systems and the most secure means of communication between different electronic modules. This area of engineering interlinks with the other likely advance of the coming decade, into intelligent guidance systems to assist the driver and take an increasing share of the decision load. Most big car companies can now demonstrate prototypes which are capable, for example, of automatically tracking lane markings and of maintaining a safe distance from the vehicle in front, enabling the car to be put 'on autopilot'. Such systems can interface with 'intelligent' roadside signs and other data transmitters, and potentially also with other vehicles, to provide automatic navigation. We are reaching the stage where such concepts, many of them developed under the pan-European Prometheus programme, are beginning to look really promising - so long as hardware prices can be contained and the necessary standardisation of systems achieved. Prometheus is about safety as well as convenience. Because most accidents are in the final analysis the result of a driver being presented with one more decision factor than he was able to cope with, such 'ergonomic unloading' should make travel by car much safer. It is certain, in fact, that apart from being much lighter, slightly smaller and much more economical, the executive car of tomorrow will be far safer and easier to drive.</p>

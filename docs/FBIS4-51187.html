			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Major Move To Strengthen the Ranks of </F> Officers"]    [Text] The "Amended Active Service Regulations Governing  Active Duty Officers of Chinese People's Liberation Army" and  the "Amended Regulations on the Military Ranks of Chinese PLA  Officers" have been deliberated and approved at the seventh  meeting of the Eighth National People's Congress Standing  Committee and decreed for implementation by PRC President Jiang  Zemin. This is a major move to suit the new situation in state  and army reform and construction, to further improve the command  and management systems of our Army, and to strengthen the ranks  of officers in the new situation. It is bound to exercise a  positive, far-reaching influence in promoting the drive to  revolutionize, modernize, and standardized the Army.    The "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" and the  "Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty Officers" were  implemented as of 1 July 1988 and 1 January 1989 respectively.  Since their implementation, they have played a positive role in  straightening out the work relationship of cadres and in  improving the quality and maintaining the stability of cadre  ranks. On the whole, they have been applicable. With the  development in state and army reform and construction, there  have been many new developments in cadre work and the building  of cadre ranks, and there have been considerable changes in the  composition and structure of officer ranks. For this reason,  some provisions in the two "Regulations" can no longer  completely suit the needs of the new situation and tasks. In  the past two years, the Central Military Commission has  reaffirmed and formulated many important policies and provisions  on cadre work, and some of them need to be defined in the  "Regulations." Under the direct leadership of the military  commission, by extensively listening to the views of leaders at  all levels and all kinds of cadres, conducting full  investigation and appraisal, and properly drawing on the  experience of foreign armies and local authorities, we have  adjusted and supplemented some articles in the two  "Regulations." The two amended "Regulations" are more  compatible with the objective law governing the building of  officer ranks in peace time and the need of our Army building in  the new period.    In amending the two "Regulations," we have persisted in  taking Comrade Deng Xiaoping's idea on army building in the new  period and the relevant instructions of the party Central  Committee and the Central Military Commission as the basis,  proceeded from the actual situation in our Army, and set our  eyes on further advancing the cause of making our ranks of  officers more revolutionary, younger in average age, better  educated, and more professionally competent. The two  "Regulations" have the following features: First, they  conscientiously carry out the series of instructions of the  party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission on  cadre work in the new period and reflect the fine traditions of  our party and our Army in cadre work. Before and after the 14th  CPC National Congress, Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a lot of  brilliant expositions on Army cadre work and the building of  Army cadre ranks. In line with the needs of the situation and  tasks and the reality of the building of Army leading bodies,  the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission  with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core have further defined many  important principles of cadre work in the new period and adopted  a series of practical measures. As a result, acute problems in  cadre work that have existed for some time have been  satisfactorily solved and new achievements and progress have  been made in the building of our cadre ranks. These have been  fully reflected in the two amended "Regulations" and made the  basic principles in the "Regulations" which must be observed in  cadre work more complete. Second, we set our eyes on improving  the age pattern of cadre ranks and thus provide an institutional  guarantee for the normal replacement of old cadres by the new in  leading bodies. The work of selecting and promoting outstanding  young cadres and solving the question of successors has a  bearing on the long-term construction of the Army and the  lasting political stability of the country. The amended  "Regulations" have made proper adjustments to the tenure of some  officers and the maximum age of active duty officers. Thus,  conditions are created for the smooth growth of outstanding  young cadres and the echelon formation of leading body members.  Third, the two "Regulations" have further defined the post  duties of officers and straightened out the chain of command.  In line with the post duties of officers, the amended  "Regulations on the Military Ranks of Officers" have laid  emphasis on revising the table of organization [T/O] ranks for  various posts, changing the T/O ranks for the posts of military  commission member, chief of staff, and director of the General  Political Department from two to one, the T/O ranks for regular  military region posts down to deputy division-level posts from  three to two, and abolishing the base military ranks [ji zhun  jun xian 1015 0402 6511 6902]. Fourth, the two "Regulations"  have, as far as possible, taken into account the immediate  interests of officers, which is conductive to increasing the  cohesiveness of the troops. In recent years, the party Central  Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military  Commission have adopted a series of measures to solve some  practical problems among military cadres. While retaining the  previously stipulated benefits, the amended "Regulations" have  added some new content. The readjustments of T/O ranks for some  professional and technical officers, in particular, have further  demonstrated the principle of "respecting knowledge and talents."    The "Active Service Regulations Governing Active Duty  Officers" and the "Regulations on the Military Ranks of  Officers" are two basic rules governing the cadre work of our  Army. All cadres should grasp their implementation with a  positive, conscientious attitude. It is necessary to take the  two "Regulations" as basic teaching materials and conduct  restudy of and reeducation in cadre policies and regulations so  that the vast numbers of cadres can gain a profound  understanding of the great significance of amending and  implementing the "Regulations," master the basic content, and  bring their ideas into line with the policy decisions of the  military commission and the spirit of the "Regulations." It is  necessary to conscientiously subordinate ourselves to the  overall interest and correctly approach individual interest.  The amendment of the two "Regulations" shows that we have not  only proceeded from the overall interest of the state and army  building, but also taken into account the immediate interests of  officers. Due to the constraints of many factors, some  individual desires cannot be satisfied. Through propaganda,  education, and thoroughgoing and painstaking ideological work,  the vast numbers of cadres should be made to correctly  understand the rationality and scientific nature of the  "Regulations" from the needs of the overall situation, to have a  stronger sense of dedication and responsibility, and to mobilize  their work zeal. In the course of implementation, party  committees at all levels should, in line with the requirements  of the "Regulations" and in conjunction with the actual  situations of their own units, make overall plans and consider  the building of cadre ranks in their own units. Attention  should be paid to an overall understanding and correct  implementation of all policies and provisions in the  "Regulations"; we should not oversimplify them nor should we  attend to too many things at the same time, or stress one aspect  but neglect another. Since the two "Regulations" are legislated  and promulgated by the state's highest organ of power, they  should be implemented resolutely. Party committees and  political organs at all levels must further enhance their  awareness of the need to observe the rules, act in strict  accordance with the "Regulations," safeguard the inviolability  and authority of the "Regulations," and ensure their smooth  implementation. In short, we must study, publicize, and  implement well the two amended "Regulations," constantly raise  military competence, political quality, and scientific and  educational levels of the ranks of officers, and push ahead the  drive to revolutionize, modernize, and standardize our Army.</p>

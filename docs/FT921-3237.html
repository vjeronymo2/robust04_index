			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Kinnock's team 'bad for Britain' THE clear message of the survey is that business leaders believe a Labour government would be bad for the country (88 per cent said it would be 'very bad' or 'fairly bad'), but not quite as damaging for their individual businesses (58 per cent). The respondents were equally unenthusiastic about any coalition which might be formed in the event of a hung parliament. Four fifths say it would be bad for the country and three fifths think it would damage their business.</p>

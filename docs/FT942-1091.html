			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: New look for a high-fryer - Nicholas Lander enjoys one of Britain's most satisfying meals / Great British Eating Fish and chips are not what they were. The great standby supper dish for the British working classes is changing its profile - and so is the industry that supplies it. Some 10,000 fried fish shops in the UK generate annual sales of more than Pounds 600m, frying more than 60,000 tonnes of fish and 600,000 tonnes of potatoes. One of their leading proponents is John Barnes, ebullient chairman of Britain's most famous chippie, the publicly-quoted Harry Ramsden's. He visited the first Ramsden's shop at Guiseley, Yorkshire, in 1968 and liked the product so much that he bought the company. Barnes says: 'Our aim is to make eating fish and chips fun, using the original Guiseley design from the 1930s as the setting for all the restaurants.' There are now 10, including one in Hong Kong, and other overseas outlets are to open soon in Melbourne and Singapore. Requests for information are frequent, many from overseas; they are answered by the company's own public relations department. But Ramsden's is only part of the story. If you walk into any restaurant today serving modern British food, there is bound to be a variation on fish and chips. It has also become a fashion food, with top chefs eager to outdo each other in their style of presentation Indeed, cod and chips with a mint pea puree (Pounds 9.95) were on offer last week to millionaire author Jackie Collins and politician Cecil Parkinson who were eating (separately) at London's fashionable Le Caprice restaurant. Fish and chips is a simple, unpretentious and relatively inexpensive dish ideal for the 1990s. But as more chefs serve roast cod (healthier than frying), it will inevitably make this increasingly scarce fish even more inaccessible. Already, it is almost the same price as farmed salmon. To find a fish and chip restaurant that bridged the gap between tradition and modernity, I took the boat train to Harwich, Essex. There, at the the Pier Hotel, I discovered a restaurant tinged with history, romance, and a little sadness. The original Pier Hotel was built in 1860 and it prospered for 90 years as the quays bustled with ferries to and from continental Europe. Then business fell away and the hotel was bought in 1977 by two local businessmen, Gerald Milsom and Richard Wheeler. Milsom had an established restaurant, Le Talbooth, at Dedham near Colchester, Essex, while Wheeler was chairman of a Colchester wine merchant, Lay &amp; Wheeler. On trips to Boston, in the US, they had seen the popularity of such restaurants as Jimmy's Harbourside, where fresh fish was cooked simply and sold cheaply and the queues never seemed to disappear. Their aim was to offer the same at the Pier, where the sea is 50 yards from the front door. The romance was supplied by the appointment of Chris Oakley as chef. Today, he is in partnership there with his Swiss wife, Vreni, whom he met at Le Talbooth. Indeed, Oakley was cooking in Davos, Switzerland, when Milsom asked him to take over at The Pier. Oakley is perhaps the most highly-trained fish and chip chef in the country, having spent two years at catering college followed by another two years at Claridge's, one of London's top hotels. He immersed himself in the job, often visiting the famous Seashell fish restaurant at Lisson Grove, north London, to see how it operated. To choose the batter for his own fish, he set up a blind tasting of seven different versions - including beer, egg, yeast, and flour and water. That decided, he found that living near the sea was no guarantee of getting fresh fish. 'When I arrived, I thought it would be quite easy for me to buy the fish I wanted from the local fishermen, but it took me several years to win their confidence,' he says. He has no regrets, though. 'In the summer months the fish here - turbot, bass, brill, crab, lobster and Dover sole - are wonderful, and sometimes in such abundance that I can let other chefs know about the day's catch.' The restaurant is on the first floor, from where you can look out over the estuaries of the rivers Orwell and Stour to Constable country and watch the fishing boats, yachts and ferries. My cod and chips were delicious, although I kept an envious eye on the spanking fresh Dover sole being eaten alongside me. Oakley's formal background was obvious: an exciting array of four different types of bread rolls before the meal and at the end some stunning petits fours with the coffee. This, however, is where the touch of sadness comes in. There is no denying the popularity and success of The Pier, which serves 45,000 customers a year and is one of the town's biggest employers in an area with unemployment well above the national average. But it is too far from the real action. The restaurant is in the centre of Harwich town, which used to be the gateway to the quays. Now, though, most of the traffic which passes in and out of Harwich en route to the Continent use a modern terminal at Parkeston Quay, two miles away. The Pier offers the great British meal of fish and chips in style. But, to flourish for another 100 years, it needs a new location.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Liat Collins] </F>   [Excerpt] Some 35,000 tons of hazardous waste have piled  up at the Ramat Hovav toxic waste dump with no means for its  disposal, the environment minister's adviser, Aharon Vardi, told  the Knesset Interior and Environment Committee yesterday.    Environment Minister Yosi Sarid has ordered the purchase of  an incinerator capable of destroying 15,000 tons of hazardous  waste a year, but the ministry plans for all incineration to be  carried out at another site within four years, Vardi said.    Committee chairman Yehoshu'a Matza (Likud) was surprised to  learn from ministry Director-General Yisra'el Peleg the  government had decided not to privatize the site. Matza said  the toxic waste buried at the site threatens water sources and  expressed concern over the recent discovery of radio-active  waste at the site.    Matza was further shocked to discover that hazardous waste  is  being imported, despite the fact Israel has signed the Basel  Treaty which restricts the international movement of this type  of waste. The subject was raised by MK [Knesset Member] No'omi  Blumental (Likud).    In response, the Environment Ministry's legal adviser, Bo'az  Oren, said the treaty has not yet been ratified. After  regulations have been authorized, no hazardous material will  enter the country without the ministry's permission, Oren said,  but in the meantime there is no restriction. He noted that  although the treaty was signed in 1989, it was only ratified by  the EC last month.    Matza asked that the ministry establish regulations as soon  as possible to close the current loophole. [passage omitted]</p>

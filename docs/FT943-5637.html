			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bank Bumiputra reports impressive profits leap Bank Bumiputra, Malaysia's second biggest bank which in the past has been dogged by financial scandal and mismanagement, seems to have put the bad days firmly behind it with a big leap in profits. For the year to end-March, Bank Bumiputra recorded a pre-tax profit of MDollars 450m (USDollars 176m), compared with MDollars 81m in the previous year. Group income for the year rose almost 90 per cent to MDollars 990m. Directors said that fee-based income and foreign exchange earnings made up about half the group's income, while the recovery of bad loans contributed considerably towards the leap in profitability. Bank Bumiputra is wholly owned by the Malaysian government. In the mid-1980s, it was involved in a loans scandal centred on the exposure of its Bumiputra Merchant Finance subsidiary in the Hong Kong property market. Later, the bank faced bankruptcy over bad loans, this time in the Malaysian market. On both occasions Petronas, the Malaysian state oil company, had to come to the bank's rescue. The Malaysian government intends to privatise the bank.</p>

Having a  hand in its creation were such organizations as the Russian  Orthodox Church; the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Towns  of Russia; the Russian Union of Self-Government; three cultural  funds headed by Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksandr Krutov, and  Vyacheslav Klykov; and the Agrarian Union, provincial commercial  structures, and so forth. Besides, the revived Zemstvo movement  counts on assistance from the heads of administrations,  noteworthy among whom is Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris  Nemtsov, and help from experts such as Aleksandr Tsipko and  Valeriy Zorkin. Although the movement was not active in the  recent parliamentary elections, according to an RZM spokesman,  some 50 percent of State Duma deputies, especially in the  Democratic Party of Russia faction, share Zemstvo supporters'  views.    The fundamental objectives of the movement are the "revival  of moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society and  restoration of this country's traditions of organization of  power and the state." In the opinion of RZM Chairwoman Yelena  Panina, the key areas of activity at this stage should be a  quantitative and qualitative expansion of the movement, and the  evolvement of a concept for reforming local administration.  According to Mrs. Panina, the best model for a system of local  administration that could not only fill the vacuum of power but  that would also be organic for Russia, would be a combination of  Zemstvo structures and the organs of government administration.  The draft text of a law on so-called Zemstvo Reform prepared by  experts of the movement should be submitted for scrutiny in the  Duma. In addition, specific programs are being evolved aimed at  solving ecological and educational problems, the development of  small and medium-sized businesses.    Speaking before journalists, Yelena Panina outlined things  that are supposed to form the "object of thoughts and work of  not only Zemstvo supporters, but also of all the other  nationally thinking people." In her opinion, this is a rallying  of public forces on the basis of the revival of traditional  Russian spirituality and healthy patriotic, rather than  nationalist, ideas.    According to Mrs. Panina, RZM initiatives are meeting with  understanding of Boris Yeltsin, with whom leaders of the  movement had a two-hour discussion, and with understanding of  members of the president's staff, with whom fruitful cooperation  has been established. Zemstvo supporters are hoping to come to  terms with the prime minister as well.    Although RZM proposals on a local government reform are not  likely to be taken up adequately by the Federal Assembly, the  movement, which has structures in 72 regions of Russia, would be  able to influence in no small way the course of elections to  local bodies of power.</p>

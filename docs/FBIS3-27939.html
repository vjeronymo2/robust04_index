			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Tokyo office economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki; from the </F> "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series; part two of a  three-part series of articles on the Labor Ministry:  "Ministry's Leadership Questioned"]    [Editorial Report] Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese  carries on page five of its 17 January Morning Edition a  2,100-character article by economic reporter Yasuhiro Suzuki as  the second installment of a three-part series on the Labor  Ministry in its "Kasumigaseki at the Crossroads" series.    The article reports that despite Labor Minister Chikara  Sakaguchi's fury at the Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] 7  January report, entitled "Overwork and Health Hazards," which  indirectly criticizes the Labor Ministry's failure to implement  adequate measures to reduce working hours, the ministry chose  not to protest to the EPA for fear of rekindling a controversy  between labor and management on the issue.    Suzuki writes that the cornerstone of the Labor Ministry's  postwar labor policy is to maintain political neutrality between  labor and management, although, admittedly, the labor minister  sometimes works behind the scenes to bring about agreement  between the two sides during the spring labor offensives. As a  result, spring offensives over the years have always agreed on a  wage level commensurate to obtaining economic conditions.    However, Suzuki observes that under the current coalition  government, labor has gained more influence -- for instance, a  rule limiting weekly working hours to 46 was passed in December  despite protests from management. Moreover, with the present  pressing labor issues, such as unemployment and reduced working  hours amid the economic recession, the Labor Ministry's stance  of complete political neutrality is now being questioned. The  ministry is now being asked to exercise leadership in labor  issues, which it hesitates to do for fear of provoking the  promanagement Liberal Democratic Party.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALICE KAHN: GOING TO BAT FOR THE GIRLS OF SUMMER  </P> <P> "I know the score, but I don't play the game." I once actually uttered these  words to a boy when I was 14 years old. He was trying to get to first base.  </P> <P> Metaphor was as close to baseball as I ever got. Things were different in the  bad old days when I was growing up. Nice girls didn't let a boy score, and they  also didn't play baseball.  </P> <P> It's another world for my daughters. One is a teen-ager who is a devoted fan.  She not only knows the score of every game, she knows the players' stats. Once  I feared that she would hang out in her room with posters of Jon Bon Jovi and  other vain dementos. Instead, she started putting up posters of  wholesome-looking bat swingers.  </P> <P> And my younger daughter is actually playing baseball. "It's called softball,  Mom," she says, as if I know nothing about anything. But come on. They swing  bats, they own mitts, they run bases. And furthermore, they have two practices  a week -- or, as I like to call them, rehearsals.  </P> <P> Because it is a girls' softball league, there are certain modifications. The  games last five innings or 1 1/2 hours -- whichever comes first. An inning  lasts three outs or 10 batters -- whichever comes first. Usually it's 10  batters.  </P> <P> Some of the modifications seem geared to protect the girls emotionally.  Recently, when I showed up in the middle of a game, I asked the adults keeping  score what the score was.  </P> <P> "We don't like to tell the score in the middle of the game," the parenting  person said. "When we did that last time, some of the girls got upset. We don't  want them to feel competitive."  </P> <P> Since it's hard to win when you don't feel competitive, my daughter's Yen Ching  team (named after the sponsoring Chinese restaurant) is 1 and 8 so far this  year. You would think that might be discouraging, but spirit was high at Yen  Ching's recent apres-game pizza party. Yen Ching had just lost 17-15 to the  Nelson &amp; Meyer Band. (It's named after the sponsoring orthodontists, Drs.  Nelson and Meyer.)  </P> <P> The local Round Table Pizza will send a guy to videotape your game if you will  then come and eat their pizza and drink their root beer while you watch it on  their big TV. The Yen Chingers certainly sounded competitive as they booed the  other team on the large screen and then went nuts as they replayed the precious  moments of success in their earlier loss. Fifteen runs are nothing to sneeze  at, although they have lost games with 25 runs. It says a lot about defense.  </P> <P> It's been an uphill climb for Yen Ching. The team is composed largely of  first-time players. My daughter, Hannah, a veteran of three seasons, is in her  last year of the 8- to 10-year-olds' league. Next year she moves up to the  older girls' division, where they actually get to pitch instead of using a  machine or having Jerry or Barry or Robin (the coaches) do it.  </P> <P> I thought Hannah would hate playing on a team with so many novices. Even though  her previous teams -- Black Oak Books and the Mallard Plumbing Ducks -- had  significantly more wins, Hannah said that "Yen Ching is the best team I've ever  played on."  </P> <P> "Why is that?" I asked her.  </P> <P> "It's like we're all friends and we all like each other," she said of the Yen  Ching team. Most of them are girls she had never met before spring training.  </P> <P> As I drove Hannah and teammate Elizabeth home from the pizza party, they talked  animatedly about the game. About the snotty girls on the other team. About how  Yen Ching has the most spirit. "I just hate it when my dad and Jerry and Barry  are all yelling at me what to do at the same time," Elizabeth said. "I just  listen to my dad."  </P> <P> It may not be a winning strategy, but it's a wise one. This spring, these girls  of summer are getting a taste of the irrelevance of defeat. They don't know the  score. But they still play the game for all it's worth.  </P></p>

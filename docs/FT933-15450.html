			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rare pest threatens UK wheat UK WHEAT farmers are reporting attacks on their crops by a rare pest at levels that have not been seen for 100 years. The orange blossom midge, a flying insect whose larvae attack developing grain, was last seen in the UK in Yorkshire in 1976-78, according to Mr Peter Limb, chairman of the National Farmers Union cereals committee. 'We are getting reports from Wiltshire through the grain growing areas to Yorkshire, right round the coast,' said Mr Limb, who estimated the area affected at half the UK grain crop. In badly affected areas crops could be reduced by 25 to 30 per cent, he said, although nationally the yield should be reduced by only between 2 and 5 per cent. However, the milling wheat used for bread making suffers more from the insect than feed wheats. UK bread wheat prices are already forecast to end this year at the same level as last year in spite of reforms to the European Community's common agricultural policy aimed at cutting cereal prices. The Home Grown Cereals Authority is quoting bread wheat for delivery in the final quarter at Pounds 135 a tonne, unchanged from the 1992-93 final quarter. The sharp devaluation in the green pound and a tight balance between supply and demand in the coming harvest have combined to keep prices high. The green pound - the artificial exchange rate at which EC guarantee prices are converted into sterling - has suffered a net devaluation of around 19 per cent since July last year following the withdrawal of sterling from the EC Exchange Rate Mechanism. This has helped to offset the cut in EC grain intervention prices from Ecu 150 to Ecu 117 (Pounds 89) a tonne this year. Observers point out that grain prices in EC countries with strong currencies, such as France and Germany, will see a marked reduction in cereal prices. The CAP reform provisions for setting aside productive land have led to a fall of 13 per cent in the area of UK land sown to wheat. But the area for bread wheat is down by less than 1 per cent. According to the HGCA, if milling variety yields average 6 tonnes a hectare, production will be more than 2.5m tonnes, while demand is expected to be between 2.5m and 3m tonnes. The National Association of British and Irish Millers has already warned that bread wheat supply could be very tight this year, especially if the weather is poor at harvest.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Production problems hit Magellan Production problems at Magellan Industries yesterday forced the lingerie and swimwear manufacturer to issue a profits warning which sent the share price tumbling 44p to 168p. The company said it had been unable to meet demand from retailers, including its main customer Marks and Spencer, because it had failed to recruit enough workers for its Midlands and south coast factories and had encountered problems with some raw material supplies. Mr Charles Ryder, chief executive, said sales in the year to December 31 were 12.5 per cent below expectations in spite of strong demand. 'This frustrating situation has inevitably had a very significant impact on profitability because of the high operational gearing of the business,' he added. The profits warning is a blow for the company, formerly known as Celestion Industries, which only returned to the black in 1992 following extensive restructuring. In September, it reported first-half 1993 pre-tax losses of Pounds 174,000 (restated Pounds 93,000). Mr Ryder said Magellan was embarking on 'radical action' to recruit more workers and to streamline its management structure. He also forecast stronger sales in 1994 after changes to improve productivity and overcome supply problems.</p>

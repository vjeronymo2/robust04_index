			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HEALTH;  </P> <P> BODY'S DEFENSES TIED TO SEIZURES  </P> <P> The body's own defenses against disease can go awry and attack proteins that  carry cholesterol through the body, triggering the dangerous buildup of  artery-clogging deposits that causes heart attacks, researchers reported today.  </P> <P> Dr. William Hollander of Boston University said his latest research supports  the idea, which he pioneered two decades ago, that hardening of the arteries is  an autoimmune disease -- the body's misguided destruction of itself.  </P> <P> "I would say that our findings indicate that immune factors play a key role in  the formation of the fibrous lesions that are the fundamental cause of heart  attacks and strokes," Hollander said.  </P> <P> Hollander's theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as  doctors try to identify the forces that cause the blood vessels to fill up with  fatty deposits like rust-encrusted pipes. This process, which doctors call  atherosclerosis, results in a heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally  squeezes off the flow of blood entirely.  </P></p>

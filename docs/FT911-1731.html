			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Capital Markets: OM launches German stock index contract THE first German stock index option contract, launched today by the Swedish-owned OM exchange in London, will fill a gaping hole in the market, according to traders. Until now, fund managers or traders wishing to hedge positions in the German stock market have only been able to use over-the-counter products, individual stock options, or the DAX future traded on the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), the German derivatives exchange. OM's specially-developed GEMx index, based on 20 actively-traded German stocks, is well designed and closely tracks the DAX, the standard German stock market index, according to traders. However, the unfamiliarity of the GEMx compared with the DAX is likely to discourage some potential users, options experts suggested. 'The GEMx option contract stands a reasonable chance of success,' according to one options specialist. 'But the natural place to trade German index options is the DTB.' The DTB now hopes to launch its DAX index option on August 9. Traders say OM's best chance for success is further delay in the DTB contract, or a period of volatility in the German stock market to bolster activity. But the DTB has already found to its cost that lost business can be hard to recover: the exchange has so far had little success in winning back German Bund futures business from the London International Financial Futures Exchange, which was quicker of the mark. However, the DTB's successful DAX future provides a foothold. That contract trades around 4,000 contracts a day, and the exchange is planning to launch an option on the future (in addition to the index option) early next year. OM also has a strong core business, with an investor base ranging from UK fund managers and traders to Swedish retail investors. Its OMX Swedish index option is one of the most actively traded index products, with 20,000 to 25,000 contracts a day on average.</p>

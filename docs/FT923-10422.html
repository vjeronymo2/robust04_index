			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Lloyd's too dependent on US business Sir, While insiders and outsiders wrangle at Lloyd's, the fundamental business problem of that market continues to be ignored. It is the excessive dependence on American business which underlies so much of its present financial woes. The deadly cocktail of capricious courts mixed with liability risks has produced such problems as asbestosis, environmental pollution and now possibly smoking-related claims. These are burning like an underground coal fire, destroying the foundations of the market. Who is now prepared to join a market that contains such latent and unquantifiable hazards? And what is being stored up for the future in today's underwriting? Lloyd's needs to cut off its current exposure to old American risks (possibly by leaving the American Trust Fund to 'run off' its existing exposure) and to require all future policies to have an absolute aggregate limit and to be subject only to UK law and jurisdiction. This might decimate Lloyd's income (not such a problem if its capacity is shrinking anyway) but it will surely increase its profits ten-fold to compensate.

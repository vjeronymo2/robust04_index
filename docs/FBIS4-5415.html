			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A policy study group of  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) urged its  leadership on Monday [11 April] to initiate a bid to sweep  former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe to power to succeed  outgoing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa.    The suprafaction group, "Liberals," chaired by former  parliamentary Vice Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, issued the  appeal after adopting it at a meeting of 20 of the group's 36  legislators at LDP headquarters.    Kakizawa was vice foreign minister when Watanabe held the  portfolio of the foreign minister under the administration of  former Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. Watanabe was not present  at the meeting.    The group's appeal urged the LDP leadership to put an end to  the current "futile" political structure, where LDP forces and  anti-LDP forces clash with each other in a bid for power,  members said.    The LDP lost its 38-year grip on power last August after a  series of defections led to the establishment of a seven-party  coalition government.    The group called on the leadership to strive to create a new  coalition government that would not be paralyzed by  intracoalition conflicts over crucial policy issues such as  diplomacy or defense.    The group urged the formation of a new administration led by  Watanabe that would keep the "same distance from all political  forces" that now comprise the governing coalition.    Shokei Arai, a member of the group, told a news conference  that followed the meeting, "Our vision is not to have Mr.  Watanabe take advantage of Shinseito and Komeito."    The two parties -- key forces within the ruling coalition --  are widely deemed as willing to name Watanabe as the next leader  of a new coalition government due to his political influence and  his parliamentary strength as head the LDP's third-largest  faction, which has 46 members.    Seiichi Ota, another member, did not rule out the  possibility  that the group's appeal for support for Watanabe might lead to  the establishment of a new political party led by Watanabe.    "There could be a range of variations" on possible political  forces, he said.</p>

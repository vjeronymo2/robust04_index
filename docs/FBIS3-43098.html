Popov, </F> Belorussian State University; UDC 621.382.82.001]    [Abstract] Two algorithms are proposed for automatically  selecting subsets of A-conjugated vectors having a simple  configuration for a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE)  with a symmetric positively determined matrix. New computation  methods of conjugated gradients are developed based on these  algorithms. A numerical study was carried out of the developed  methods for a two-dimensional modeling problem of an insulating  metal-oxide-semiconductor structure with oxide in the shape of a  ``bird beak'', containing non-planar boundaries. With these  methods, the modeling time can be reduced by a factor of two.  Figures 3, references 8: 5 Russian. 3 Western</p>

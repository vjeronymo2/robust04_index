Rafael Gonzalez Lastra, the Chiapas Government secretary  general, has told a news conference that the EZLN "aggressors"  left the mayors offices in Las Margaritas and Chanal today and  that Mexican Army troops are in the city of Comitan, south of  San Cristobal, to guarantee peace.    The EZLN forces violently seized the mayors offices in San  Cristobal de las Casas, Las Margaritas, Chanal, Altamirano, and  Ocosingo on 1 January in what constituted a violent guerrilla  outbreak.    The guerrillas left San Cristobal on 2 January and moved  toward Rancho Nuevo, where they have sustained several clashes  with the troops stationed at the 31st Military Zone Garrison.    The EZLN presence continues in Ocosingo, where there have  been clashes, and Altamirano, Oxchuch, Huiztan, and Cuxulja,  which they occupied on Sunday.    Certain reports stated that a group of rebels has taken over  Guadalupe Tepeyac, in Las Margaritas Municipality.    Gonzalez Lastra said he trusts that order will be  reestablished in Ocosingo and Altamirano "within the next few  hours."    Media reports, which authorities have not confirmed, state  that the troops arrested 12 civilians in Comitan. Near the city  an EZLN unit kidnapped former Chiapas Governor Absalon  Castellanos on Sunday. His whereabouts are unknown.</p>

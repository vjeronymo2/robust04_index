			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EFFORTS TO TRAP WILD ANIMALS STEPPED UP  </P> <P> A dramatic increase in the number of wild animals wandering from parched  hillsides into urban neighborhoods for food and water has prompted animal  regulation officials to step up efforts to trap and return the creatures to the  wild.  </P> <P> "It's been a bumper year for opossums," said Dennis Kroeplin, a city wildlife  control officer, who has relocated more than 1,600 opossums trapped in the San  Fernando Valley this year.  </P> <P> "I've never caught so many opossums before," said Kroeplin, as he prepared to  release his latest load Friday in the San Gabriel Mountains. His van was loaded  with 32 grunting and hissing opossums and seven stoically silent raccoons.  </P> <P> Twice a month, the city's six animal shelters from Chatsworth to San Pedro  bring wild animals to Van Nuys Airport, where they are taken by helicopter to  remote areas, often near Pyramid Lake in northern Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> The Department of Animal Regulation started the airlifts in 1969 and usually  ferries about 30 to 40 animals each trip. But this year, up to 90 animals --  opossums, raccoons, snakes and an occasional fox -- are being airlifted each  time, said Lt. James Phipps of the North Hollywood shelter.  </P> <P> Phipps and Kroeplin blamed the increase on the lingering drought and the spread  of new housing tracts into once wild canyons and hills.  </P> <P> The extra airlifts are another example of how drought and development have made  wild animals and humans uncomfortable neighbors. Recently, bears have been  raiding the snack bar almost nightly at Pyramid Lake, ripping open food lockers  in search of hamburger patties and ice cream.  </P> <P> Phipps said he trapped 113 coyotes in the San Fernando Valley during the last  year. That's an increase of about 25% over the previous year. Coyotes have  taken to traveling the flood control channels and are showing up in unlikely  venues such as West Hills and Van Nuys, he said.  </P> <P> Other animal control agencies are responding to growing numbers of complaints  about wild animals drinking from swimming pools or gobbling up food left  outside for pets.  </P> <P> In Pasadena, opossums, raccoons and skunks have descended on the city "by the  droves," said Susan Niemeyer, operations manager for the Pasadena Humane  Society.  </P> <P> "It's the dryness in the hills and the lack of food," Niemeyer said. Still, it  is normal during the late summer months for large numbers of animals to travel  down from the hills, she said.  </P> <P> A scheduled airlift from Van Nuys airport was scrubbed Friday for mechanical  repairs, so Kroeplin loaded up raccoons and opossums collected from the San  Fernando Valley's two shelters and drove to a secluded canyon in the Angeles  National Forest above Sunland.  </P> <P> "This won't be a mad dash for freedom," he observed as he prepared to release  the first opossums of the day.  </P> <P> He was right. Opossums are not swift creatures, and although they may not be  dumber than a box of rocks, they are not a whole lot smarter.  </P> <P> When Kroeplin opened the cage door, the opossums just stared ahead before  slowly padding away. Some of the marsupials didn't leave until Kroeplin shook  the cage. One critter took a full 30 seconds before leaving. The raccoons,  however, tend to rocket to freedom.  </P> <P> He released the animals far from the mountain road for their own protection.  "They're liable to go right up to the road and get killed," he said of the  opossums.  </P> <P> They're that dumb?  </P> <P> With a slight nod, Kroeplin said: "They're that dumb."  </P> <P> Nor are they overly graceful.  </P> <P> After freeing the animals, Kroeplin heard a rustling of leaves in a nearby tree  and looked up to see an opossum plummet from a high branch like an overripe  avocado.  </P> <P> The opossum righted itself, regained its bearings and waddled off into the dry  riverbed.  </P> <P> Also contributing to this story was Times staff writer Benjamin Sullivan.  </P></p>

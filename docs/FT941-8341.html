			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Nato lifts threat of early air strikes: UN finds substantial withdrawal of Serb guns - West warns ultimatum remains Tension over Bosnia eased early today as the United Nations said Nato air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo were unnecessary 'at this stage'. But western officials warned that the threat of air strikes remained unless the Serbs continued to observe the Nato ultimatum issued earlier this month. Soon after the deadline for ending the Serb artillery siege of the Bosnian capital expired at midnight, the UN said there had been substantial withdrawal or regrouping of the Serb heavy weapons. Mr Yasushi Akashi, the UN special envoy in former Yugoslavia, said: 'On the basis of the information available to me, and pending further verification, I have decided that it is not necessary at this stage for me to request Nato to use air power.' In Washington, the White House said all Bosnian Serb heavy guns around Sarajevo had been neutralised 'or soon should be'. As a result, UN and Nato commanders had concluded no air strikes were necessary 'at this time', a senior official said. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there had been effective compliance with the Nato demand to remove heavy weapons more than 20km from Sarajevo or put them under UN control under pain of air strikes. 'Nato's resolve to end the shelling of Sarajevo does not end today,' he added. 'We shall continue to verify compliance. . . We will remain vigilant.' The military threat receded after the Nato alliance had assembled in Italy and the Adriatic Sea the largest forces of air power since the Gulf war. The Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday urged Nato to go ahead with air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. It accused the UN of conniving with the Serbs to avert air strikes. In a bid to reassure the Moslems, General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, warned that if there were any breaches of the Nato ultimatum, 'I will have no hesitation in calling air strikes'. In relaxed remarks before the deadline, Gen Rose appeared concerned to defuse tension. Asked where he would be at the midnight deadline, he told reporters: 'In bed.' Pentagon officials said that poor weather made it difficult to determine immediately how many guns might still be within 20km of Sarajevo. Air strikes were unlikely to be ordered before a complete assessment could be made in the daylight today, they added. But US officials warned that the Nato ultimatum was open-ended, and that air strikes could be launched at any time if the Serbs did not continue to comply. They also said western allies would this week discuss expanding the Sarajevo ultimatum to ease the plight of other besieged Bosnian cities. Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the 'next step is to consider whether other places in Bosnia should have a comparable treatment', including the towns of Srbrenica and Gorazde. Shortly before the midnight deadline, 400 Russian UN peacekeeping troops moved into Sarajevo to act as a buffer between Moslem-led forces in the capital and the Serbs who have been besieging the city for 22 months. The soldiers, in a convoy of 70 armoured vehicles, trucks and jeeps, were moved from Croatia and will be followed by another 400 men from Russia. Mr Worner thanked Russia for its role in Bosnia in the past few days, when it lent its weight to secure Bosnian Serb agreement to withdraw heavy weapons. 'The just and lasting peace that we must now try to achieve in Bosnia involves close Russian involvement,' he added. 'We all must try to maintain the momentum and reflect on further steps.' President Bill Clinton phoned Russian president Boris Yeltsin yesterday and told him he was encouraged by Serb efforts to comply with the Nato ultimatum, a US official said. Mr Vitaly Churkin, Russia's deputy foreign minister and Moscow's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, warned earlier that Nato's Partnership for Peace agreements with former Warsaw Pact states in eastern Europe could be one casualty of any air strike. 'The point here is not air strikes; it is peace,' he said. As the west seeks ways to capitalise on the ceasefire around Sarajevo and move the peace process forward, Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, will today hold talks with Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart. Senior officials from the European Union, the US, Russia and the UN are due to meet tomorrow in Bonn. Mr Christopher said that finding a settlement which met the reasonable requirements of the Bosnian Moslems was a high priority, and that the apparent success of Nato's new resolve over Sarajevo would boost peace talks. Removal of the Serb artillery eases but does not end the siege of Sarajevo and its 380,000 inhabitants. Serb forces still control all access to the city, although UN troops are monitoring the latest ceasefire, which has restored some degree of normality. Further reports, Page 2</p>

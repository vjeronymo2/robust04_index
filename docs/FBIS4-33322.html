			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Guillermo Endara at ceremony bidding </F> farewell to the U.S. 193d Infantry Brigade (Light) at Fort  Clayton; broadcast in progress--live relay, with  passage-by-passage translation into English]    [Text] ...these obligations also included the operations  of the military bases in the canal area. My government has  strived to comply to the letter with the 1977 treaties; this is  why the creation of the Interoceanic Region Authority reflects  our concern to design and establish an efficient system leading  to the best use of the reverted and soon to be reverted areas.    Moreover, we have begun to adopt the necessary steps to  ensure that the administration of the canal, of which we will  formally and completely assume control by the end of the  century, will continue to operate with the same degree of  reliability that it has had during its entire existence.    Today's ceremony is nothing more than an irrefutable and  palpable demonstration of the United States' willingness to also  fully comply with the commitments acquired under the canal  treaties.    We have gathered here to witness a very important and  historic event. After 32 years in Panamanian territory, the  193d Infantry Brigade will be leaving our homeland. It is the  last combat infantry unit that will be leaving Panama. Memories  of missions accomplished and friendships cultivated will remain.    With the permission of the translator, I will briefly refer  to one of the missions accomplished by one of the battalions of  the brigade. In three days, on 6 June, we will be marking the  50th anniversary of the allied invasion of Normandy, which  marked the beginning of the end of Nazi tyranny in Europe. This  brigade's Paratroopers Battalion had the great honor--and we  have the great honor of being here with it today--of  participating as one of the first teams that entered territory  occupied by the Nazis before the invasion per se. With great  pride of being here with heroes to whom we owe freedom the world  over, I give you a special salute on this day when you are  leaving our homeland.    There are new horizons in the future for those who will be  leaving and for those of us who will remain. I am certain  members of this brigade and members of the Armed Forces who will  follow them through 1999 will find new challenges and new paths  to serve their country.    This is why our words of farewell contain a goodbye full of  the best wishes for the men of arms who are leaving today. The  citizens of this country, who will now gradually assume  possession of high-value property, have a very serious challenge  ahead. Our main goal is to ensure the entire canal area will  become a center that will attract activities that will produce  benefits for the rest of the country. In this manner, the  wealth generated by this area will be spread throughout the  Republic, especially to the benefit of the poorest and most  needy segments of the population.    I am pleased my government has established the bases to  ensure the materialization of this distribution of justice in  our country. Future generations of Panamanians will enjoy the  benefits of so many meritorious plans we are implementing. They  must recall that all of this is possible thanks to a clear and  friendly policy of full compliance with the 1977 treaties  between our two countries. Today's ceremony is evidence of this  policy.    To those who leave Panamanian soil today, I say: Goodbye,  may God be with you. I hope you always remember with warmth the  experience in our homeland. [applause]</p>

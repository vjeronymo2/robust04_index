			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (13): The need for longevity - Competiton in the after-market A DECADE ago, the buyer received only one thing when he bought a car: a metal box on four wheels, covered grudgingly by a rudimentary warranty sometimes as short as six months or 6,000 miles. How the car fared after its first few months in service; whether it rusted or fell apart or broke its owner with huge spare parts costs and service bills was the very last concern of the smiling salesman. He washed his hands of the deal. Things have changed dramatically. Compared with life in the early 1980s, today's car market competition is cut-throat, and the rise of consumerism - helped by the fact that the car market has been in the buyer's favour since the end of the 1980s - has led business buyers to judge a car on how it is supported in the after-market. Fleet manager or user-chooser, today's business car operator is attracted by long warranties and free breakdown recovery deals, rust warranties and low service charges, 'own brand' insurance schemes and fast-fit spares operations. And an increasing number want to hear, at the end of their car's life, how it will be recycled. They are right to be concerned. A recent survey by City-based automotive consultancy Ludvigsen Associates shows that a car's retail price accounts for only 40 per cent of its whole-of-life cost. The remaining proportion consists of fuel costs (33 per cent) and standing costs, servicing and repairs. Some car companies have reacted quickly to the trend, having learnt in the middle 1980s that the crowded car market was reaching saturation point and that repeat business was going to be crucial in the years ahead. A salesman might sell the first batch of cars, one dealer group chief famously said, but the service department staff would sell the second, third and fourth. In a bid to sell more cars to its US clientele, GM has recently been encouraging its existing customers to become Mastercard users, and then to 'turn plastic into steel'. Two million people reportedly became GM cardholders in the scheme's first six months. Vauxhall is believed to have its eye on the idea. The biggest recent UK improvement in after-market care has been in warranty cover. Every car has at least 12 months' unlimited mileage mechanical warranty these days, and some much longer. In 1983, Mitsubishi cars began to carry a three-year unlimited mileage warranty, still the most comprehensive mechanical cover available in Britain as part of any new car's purchase price, and this has spurred others to improve their cover. Most other Japanese makers and some Europeans now have three-year cover though many impose a 60,000 mile expiry limit. Jaguar, which introduced a three-year warranty last year, claims it caused sales to surge in August. Even the cheap Russian-built Lada cars have a two-year mechanical warranty. Those companies which cling to only one-year warranties (Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and, perhaps surprisingly, BMW and Mercedes-Benz) offer warranties at extra cost, stretching to five years and occasionally beyond. Today's cars also carry so-called rust warranties, which are claimed to cover the car against corrosion from the inside or 'perforation'. Until the mid-1980s, that was a common problem in nearly all cars, though several Italian marques unfairly bore the brunt of the criticism. These rust warranties commonly last for six years but the all-galvanised Audi term is for 10 years. Though manufacturers make much play about presenting 'plain language' warranties, the truth is that rust warranties are hard to claim against, not least because some require regular, inconvenient inspections to retain their validity. Others still require a car to be regularly treated with rustproofing compound. Their main value, however, is that they have forced car-makers to improve rustproofing at manufacture so that it is simply not an issue in the car's first six or eight years of use. The market has been demanding lower service costs for years, but manufacturers resisted for quite a while, fearful that the move would harm their dealers' profits. Citroen showed the way in the early 1980s with its 'loves driving, hates garages' slogan for the BX family hatchback. Since then, most makers have extended their service intervals and cut labour costs. Grease nipples, so beloved of 1950s and 1960s suspension designers, are a thing of the past. Nearly every car now goes 6,000 miles between intermediate 'oil' services and 12,000 between 'full' services. Today's VW Golf needs only about four hours' workshop attention every 20,000 miles, and the bill for this, even in central London, should not be more than Pounds 250. Even a Porsche 911, doing 12,000 miles a year, costs less than Pounds 600 for annual servicing. Because today's cars require less frequent workshop visits, manufacturers are anxious to keep customers loyal to their own dealer network. They have watched askance at the rise of chain car-servicing businesses that stress low cost and while-you-wait convenience, such as ATS, Kwik-Fit and Halfords service centres. Nowadays, they fight on three fronts to keep business: by opening own-brand fast-fit centres (Ford, Vauxhall and even luxury makers such as Saab have recently begun to do it), some (notably BMW) have made a big play of reducing spare parts prices and nearly all car-makers now have a 'menu' of servicing and repair costs for their cars, so that even a Mercedes-Benz or a Rolls-Royce owner can know what a job is going to cost in parts and labour. Meanwhile, competition to impress after-market customers continues on an ever-widening front. Many companies offer 'own brand' finance, insurance and leasing details which they claim can be tailored to an individual client's needs, whether he buys one car or 500. For the future, the buy-back scheme looms. Porsche already has one operating for its 968 model: customers who pay Pounds 36,000 for the car now can get 55 per cent of their money back in three years, when the car has done 36,000 miles. Big companies like Ford (with Options) and Vauxhall (with Choices 1-2-3) are also moving towards buy-back. They already offer a form of personal leasing which allows a customer to take a new car for a fixed term and finance only its depreciation over the term. Mercedes-Benz has a similar scheme working for both its new and used cars: it looks particularly attractive as Mercedes cars lose value more slowly than most others. Recycling is an after-market issue which has yet to raise its head in the UK, though few industry-watchers doubt that it will. BMW recently became the first company to open a British car recycling plant, at Bolney in West Sussex. Eventually, says the company, 16,000 BMWs will be scrapped annually through recyclers. At that stage, the company will truly be looking after the car from the cradle to the grave.</p>

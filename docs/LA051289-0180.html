			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GREEK COURT OKS EXTRADITION ORDER  </P> <P> Greece's Supreme Court today upheld an extradition order for a Palestinian  wanted by the United States in the 1982 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over  Hawaii in which a Japanese teen-ager was killed.  </P> <P> Mohammed Rashid had appealed a lower court's decision that granted a U.S.  request for his extradition. Washington considers the case a test of Greece's  willingness to fight terrorism.  </P> <P> "The court rejects Mohammed Rashid's appeal by majority of votes," said Nikos  Sakelaropoulos, president of the Supreme Court's five-member criminal division.  </P> <P> The final say on whether Rashid is sent to the United States must be made by  the minister of justice, according to Greek law. It is unlikely that a decision  will be made before the June 18 general elections, however, and Rashid still  has time left to serve for crimes prosecuted by Greek authorities.  </P></p>

In an interview with Interfax news agency on Sunday, he gave  a highly negative response to the outcome of the Geneva talks  between Georgia and Abkhazia including the problem of Georgian  refugees. In his view, Russia cannot act as mediator because of  Moscow's role in the conflict leading to the loss of Abkhazia.    Chairman of the national security and defence commission  Nodar Natadze was likewise sceptical about the Geneva talks.  The deployment of Russian troops along the Inguri river  separating Georgia and Abkhazia as asked by the negotiating  teams will prevent Georgians from crossing it and turn  Abkhazia's Georgian population into slaves or hostages, he told  Interfax.    Natadze says, "if Russia is really keen to see Georgia as a  stable and integral state, it ought to deploy troops not along  the Inguri but Psou river on Russia's border with Abkhazia".</p>

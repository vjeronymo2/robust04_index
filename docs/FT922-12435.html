			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Markets (Wall Street): Dow bounds ahead on recovery hopes HERE COMES the recovery. In the last week a host of US corporations have reported first quarter earnings that exceeded market forecasts, an indication that business conditions have improved significantly since the end of last year. The good news gave Wall Street a rush of energy. In the first five trading days of the quarterly reporting season the Dow Jones index jumped 172 points, or 5.4 per cent, setting record highs as investors rushed into big industrial and cyclical stocks in anticipation of a sustained recovery in corporate profitability. Admittedly, the broader market fared less well, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 holding below its all-time high and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks still handicapped by the hangover among biotechnology issues. The underlying tone of the market, however, remains firm, aided by the fact that last week's unexpected policy ease suggests the Federal Reserve is prepared to put its foot down on the monetary accelerator any time the recovery looks like stalling. The recent evidence, however, indicates that the corporate economy is picking up speed. Aluminum Company of America, known as Alcoa, opened the season with first quarter profits of Dollars 76m, three times better than the consensus of analysts' forecasts. The reward was a 12 per cent jump in Alcoa's share price over the following three days. After Alcoa, results tumbled out, revealing higher earnings across a spectrum of US industry. Goodyear, Hilton Hotels, IBM, International Paper, American Home Products, Pfizer and CBS were some of the big names to report improved profits that exceeded expectations. Unsurprisingly, in the wake of buoyant financial markets and heavy stock and bond underwriting activity, the biggest first quarter gains were seen from Wall Street itself, with securities houses J P Morgan, PaineWebber, Bear Stearns and Charles Schwab all posting record profits. If the first quarter is turning out to have been the opening stage in Corporate America's recovery, the rest of 1992 should see companies building on those gains. According to the Institutional Brokers Estimate System (IBES), which tracks Wall Street earnings estimates, corporate profits are forecast to rise 41 per cent this year. The heavy demand for stocks from investors this past week suggests they have placed their faith in the forecasts, because stocks look expensive at the moment in terms of past earnings, with the S&amp;P 500 currently selling at about 26 times trailing earnings. The index, however, sells at just over 18 times prospective 1992 earnings if the IBES numbers are used, which makes the market look more affordable. The underlying economy is also perkier, judging by this week's economic numbers. At first glance the February business inventories (unchanged-to-lower), and the March retail sales (down 0.4 per cent) and industrial production (up just 0.2 per cent) numbers inspired little confidence. However, a closer examination revealed that business inventories were flat or weaker because companies continued to run down stocks to meet increased demand. Retail sales were lower on the month, but over the first quarter real retail sales (adjusted for inflation) increased sharply, the biggest gain since late 1988. As for industrial production, the monthly increase was modest, but on an annual comparison March industrial production was up 2.1 per cent, reflecting a recovery in output last summer. The performance of US stock markets this week was especially impressive considering that the derivatives markets in Chicago were out of action for most of the week because of flooding. The lack of futures and options trading meant stock market traders in New York could not hedge their trades with index options and futures, and program traders could not participate in computerised stock index arbitrage. This kept volume down and reduced volatility in stock prices. For several of the older dealers on Wall Street it was all a happy reminder of the 'good old days', when equity markets were untroubled by the machinations of program traders.

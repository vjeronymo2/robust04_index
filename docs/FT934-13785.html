			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Observer: No way station Pugnacious Gerald Corrigan, who captained the New York Fed through many a market crisis, is happiest in the thick of things. So what on earth is he doing emerging chez Goldman Sachs to run 'special projects', head the bank's group of outside advisers and glad hand important clients - guaranteeing himself everything, in fact, except proximity to the epicentre of one of Wall Street's leading investment banks? The 52-year-old former Fed chief, who will no doubt be more than generously remunerated, sees his position as 'flexible but highly substantive'. Does that mean he is being lined up as a future chairman? He laughs off the suggestion, as does Goldman chairman Stephen Friedman, who is nevertheless expecting his new recruit to view this as 'home for his career, not a way station'. However special the deal, meanwhile, Corrigan does not come in as one of the fabled general partners, who even in 1991, before Wall Street's current bonanza started, had a share in profits reckoned to run to Dollars 1.15bn. Eyeing the long list of partners to which his name will not be appended Corrigan claims, a trifle unconvincingly, to be 'just a footnote'.</p>

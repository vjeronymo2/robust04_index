			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICHARD EDER: IN MURDOCH COUNTRY, THE GODS WEAR TWEED;  </P> <P> THE MESSAGE TO THE PLANET BY IRIS MURDOCH (VIKING: $22.95; 563 PP.)  </P> <P> The ground in Iris Murdoch's novels perpetually shifts beneath us. At one  moment, her clutch of assorted English intellectuals and artistic types are  engaged in perfectly ordinary exercises of speculation, lust, ambition, greed  and depressiveness. At the next, an aura of the supernatural falls upon them,  as if the old gods were alive and wore cardigans and good shoes.  </P> <P> These characters are commonplace if snobbish, clever if long-winded, we think;  and then, suddenly: No, they are quicker and more spectral than life. The  humdrum declares itself magic, and the magic promptly declares itself humdrum.  As in a roller-coaster -- often with the same sense of being lifted out of our  own gravity -- we never quite know where we are. Except, and unmistakably, in  Murdoch country.  </P> <P> Her painters, lawyers, academics, failed clergymen, musicians and writers tend  to be on the verges of middle age. They are uneasy or morose and, despite their  talents and comforts, subject to an acedia close to spiritual death. Their  women seem subdued, but they are accumulators of the electricity that builds up  in the oppressive air, and they can flash out like lightning.  </P> <P> Into this uneasy stasis moves a guru-like figure, a man of enigmatic  intellectual and moral force, an enchanter. He provokes thunder storms,  displacements, violence, wild leaps, odd changes; and by the time the book  ends, at least some of these high-strung people will find themselves upended.  It is a kind of conversion: Like so many New Testament Sauls, they are knocked  off their mounts, though when they re-mount, they usually find themselves not  St. Pauls, but Sauls still.  </P> <P> "The Message to the Planet" follows the pattern. Marcus Vallar was a  mathematical prodigy, then a painter, then a linguist searching for the roots  of a universal language. He fascinated and unsettled those he met. Vallar  alternately helped and quarreled with Jack, whose brilliant painting career he  inspired. His corrosive questioning led Gildas to lose his faith and quit the  priesthood. He made an ardent disciple out of Ludens, a scholar, only to savage  him and drive him away. He put a curse on Patrick, an Irish poet. And then he  disappeared.  </P> <P> When the book starts, years later, Patrick is dying of a mysterious disease.  Jack, Gildas and Ludens speculate that Vallar's curse may be responsible.  Ludens, still worshipful, searches and finds him living in a country cottage,  aged, paranoid and scribbling what Ludens is certain must be a mighty though  obscure philosophical work.  </P> <P> Ludens brings Vallar back to London along with the latter's Gypsy-like  daughter, Irina. Vallar climbs into bed with Patrick and embraces him. It is a  comically awkward scene; Vallar seems half-hearted and fumbling about it,  almost as if he didn't really know what to do and were simply humoring Ludens.  Yet Patrick promptly recovers.  </P> <P> The heart of the book concerns Ludens' effort to be disciple to a figure he has  decided is somewhere between Spinoza and Christ. Murdoch leaves it open as to  whether Vallar is an authentic magus or a burnt-out, half-mad old man. Ludens'  need to find a master endows Vallar with a prophetic glow, one that includes  Irina, with whom he falls loftily in love.  </P> <P> To him, she is the magician's daughter, and touched with his magic. In fact --  or almost fact, granting Murdoch her ambiguities -- she regards her father as  "barmy." She places him in an expensive sanitarium in the countryside, takes  care of him in a cottage on the grounds, and waits for him to die so she can go  off and have fun.  </P> <P> Ludens' need to believe makes his attendance upon Vallar a quixotic quest that  is both goofy and deadly serious. He brings notebooks and an expensive  fountain-pen; he asks the old man whole lists of philosophical questions, all  in an effort to get the great work out. He takes Vallar's resistance, his  quirks and oddities, as signs of inspiration. And he is overwhelmed and shoved  aside when a band of New Age pilgrims, on their way to Stonehenge, invades the  sanitarium and camps outside the cottage, waiting for revelations by charisma  instead of by the book.  </P> <P> Comedy entangled in mystery, fraud indistinguishable from saintliness are the  elements of this, as of previous Murdoch conundrums. Jack comes down to visit,  along with his wife and mistress, both of whom live in the same house with him  and battle each other in highly arcane fashion. So do Gildas, Patrick, a rabbi,  a priest, and other assorted characters. Each works upon his or her entirely  tangential obsessions. A tangency that doesn't quite touch is Murdoch's pattern  of people's relations to each other and to the universe. Across the  infinitesimal gap, her sparks fly.  </P> <P> If "Message" has the complexity, the wonderfully unexpected talk, the fey and  jarring balances and imbalances of Murdoch's other recent novels, it is  something of a falling-off. Energy is lacking. There is lethargy in it despite  the wit. The characters say interesting things, but they are not particularly  interesting or distinctive in themselves. The enchanter figure, this time, is  more vague than exciting.  </P> <P> But as always, Murdoch's itchy intellectual seekers and slobs create a world  that is entirely artificial and yet infinitely inhabitable. It draws us in, and  when we finish one of her books, we miss it. Each new book resembles the  others, and yet a Murdoch fan is glad to be back.  </P> <P> It's rather like being a Wodehouse fan. You know everybody. And a Murdoch  enchanter, to tell the truth, is a kind of Jeeves. Her highbrow Bertie  Woosters, having made a terrible mess of things and flapping out of control,  are hopelessly stuck. The enchanter arrives, gets them going, and in his  drastic and disruptive way, restores a sort of order. He is not as unflappable  as Jeeves, but he is as mysterious, as unquestionable, and quite often as  funny.  </P></p>

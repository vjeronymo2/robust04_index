			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Too early for requiem The majority of people who operate in the media have never been slow to pronounce the doom of competitive liberal capitalism. This majority includes many of those who write for financial institutions, admittedly in more guarded style, but whose views are regarded by politicians as representative of the markets. Indeed market participants themselves are often bad at making the case for what they are doing and too often give the impression of turkeys celebrating the coming of Christmas. The combination of prolonged recession, boom and bust in financial markets, and above all Bill Clinton's victory in the US presidential election has put new heart into the anti-capitalist forces, and the sound of their celebrations will go on awhile. Let me not begrudge people their moments of happiness. Those of us who take seriously the adjective 'liberal' before capitalism will not shed any tears over the failure of Mr Bush's campaign, with its mobilisation of intolerant religious fundamentalism and its near-McCarthyite search for dirt against those who opposed the Vietnam war and who experimented with stimulants other than tobacco and alcohol. The best antidote to anti-capitalist triumphalism, as to most fads, is a little history. The present swing of the pendulum is mild indeed compared with the permanent state of opinion up to a decade or two ago. Go into any library and pick up at random political or economic books written between the wars or in the first postwar decades. You will find in most of them the assumption that some form of collectivism - in the shape of more government intervention, ownership and control - is the wave of the future and the only argument was how quickly and by what route it would arrive. Today the great shadow over comprehensive planning and state ownership is the ignominious collapse of the Soviet Union and its satellites. Only a fool would have expected a successful capitalism to emerge from the ashes in a couple of years. The fact that a carefully nurtured system of law, legislation, customs and habits and - of course infrastructure - is required should surprise no-one except a few equilibrium economists. There is, moreover, no beckoning 'third way' between communism and capitalism. The country which most nearly offered this, Sweden, is busily dismantling many of its most interventionist institutions, reducing public spending and tax percentages, and is suffering from the recession and unemployment usual in an attempt to squeeze inflation out of the economy. The one large country enjoying successful growth appears to be China, which combines an emergent capitalism with a ruthless political dictatorship reminiscent of the Pinochet regime in Chile. It may appeal to those capitalists - certainly not liberal ones - who put measured economic growth above personal liberty and civil rights. Moreover China's success is so far merely relative. It is growing rapidly from a low level. Too many capitalist supporters allow their views to be guyed by opponents. For instance, the taxation of the bulk of the population to help the least well off or the victims of change is of course part of a civilised capitalism. Ideally, redistribution should take the form of cash - which respects the choices of the recipient. But when, as in the case of medical services, cash transfers do not work well, a publicly funded system does not take us along the road to serfdom. The fatal stage is later, where in the name of preventing that most British of crimes - queue jumping - the provision of private alternatives is prevented. When it comes to evils such as environmental pollution, remedies which use the price mechanism or redefine property rights are infinitely better than the top-down approach that have caused such havoc in eastern Europe. The US has been unable to afford a decent safety net, not because of capitalism, but because of interest group democracy that purloins an excessive share of resources for the middle-class welfare state and the military-industrial complex. If Bill Clinton can roll back these interest groups I shall be the first to go to Washington as a humble and penitent pilgrim. The most recent war cry of those who realise that old style socialism is dead is to say that the supposedly planned Japanese and German variants of capitalism are better than the more buccaneering Anglo-American variety. (How about the Italian, which is the most buccaneering of all?) These slogan-mongers seem not to have noticed the hash which the German social partnership has made of reunification or the financial collapse in Japan. It is no longer so fashionable to praise the French system. Yet what aspects of it are threatening the Gatt round? It is not the more competitive spirit in industry and commerce, but state support for French farmers. If there is to be a requiem it should be for knee-jerk and producer-driven interventionism.</p>

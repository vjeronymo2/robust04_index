			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'AMERICAN LANDSCAPE VIDEO' EXHIBIT BREAKS NEW GROUND  </P> <P> In case we were becoming complacent, 15 terrible seconds last month gave us all  the proof we needed of nature's freakish and terrible willfulness. With TV  images of the San Francisco earthquake burned into our minds by constant  replay, a new exhibit at Newport Harbor Art Museum seems particularly timely.  </P> <P> Organized by the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, "American Landscape  Video: The Electronic Grove" (to Dec. 31) presents six large video  installations produced during the last decade by Bill Viola, Rita Myers, Dara  Birnbaum, Frank Gillette, Doug Hall and Steina Vasulka.  </P> <P> Their landscape imagery ranges from the grandiloquent turbulence and shock  effects of Hall's "The Terrible Uncertainty of the Thing Described" to the  cerebral calm of Gillette's "Aransas."  </P> <P> Hall offers large-screen images of raging fire, billowing smoke and torrential  floods -- and a real jolt of lightning that leaps between two tall metal chairs  screened off by a high-wire fence in the gallery. Gillette surrounds the viewer  with monitors displaying peaceful distant and close-up views of the woods and  marshes of Aransas County, Tex., in a slow, rhythmic sequence.  </P> <P> For many viewers, the idea of a video "portrait" of landscape may be hard to  reconcile with the familiar, hand-crafted qualities of landscape painting -- or  even with a stationary photographic image.  </P> <P> But the landscape tradition in American art already has undergone great changes  during the last century, from abstract painting to Earth Art. By turning to  video, artists gain a number of advantages lost to cutting-edge art since the  19th Century, as well as others perhaps undreamed of by earlier generations.  Video, after all, offers not only intimacy and directness, but also the  user-friendly, non-elitist quality of TV viewing.  </P> <P> Working outside the loop of TV's consumer culture, however, artists are free to  use the special features of video medium (including the ability to fragment,  rearrange and instantly replay footage) to present unusual, unsettling and  difficult ideas.  </P> <P> In the installations, video monitors either create an "environment" all by  themselves or function as elements within a larger sculptural or architectural  setting.  </P> <P> Viola's "Room for St. John of the Cross," from 1983, is a particularly  evocative blending of video with other media -- a superb example of the power  of video to convey serious, humanistic ideas as well as flashy, nihilistic  ones.  </P> <P> St. John of the Cross was a 16th-Century Spanish monk imprisoned by the  religious Establishment after introducing a new austerity into the Carmelite  order.  </P> <P> In a darkened gallery, Viola places an imagined replica ofSt. John's tiny cell  with its thick walls and earthen floor. A small table inside holds a glass and  pitcher of water -- and a miniature portable TV displaying the image of a  snow-capped mountain peak.  </P> <P> In Spanish, a recorded male voice softly recites St. John's intensely spiritual  poetry. On a huge video screen outside the cell, the same mountain peak lurches  and trembles in black and white, as if laboriously photographed, bit by bit,  with a hand-held camera.  </P> <P> The small, unchanging view of the mountain is symbolic ofSt. John's  contemplative state, a serene and focused view of the true purpose of life. The  jerky large view of the mountain seems to represent the confused, distracted,  partial understanding we have of life as we rush through it, oblivious to  higher things.  </P> <P> In Myers' "Rift Rise," images of destruction (fire, charred tree branches) and  renewal (rushing water, green leaves) play on both sides of opposing banks of  monitors, one made of sharp-edged black slabs, the other covered with live  birch trees. At once very simple and very grand in scope, the installation  offers a five-minute meditation on the cycle of life.  </P> <P> Vasulka's "The West" is the most visually complex piece in the show, though  ultimately it seems to have less meaning than the others. Images of man-made  and natural sights from the New Mexico desert play over 22 double-stacked  monitors for 30 minutes, subjected to lots of fancy cutting and coloristic  manipulations. But sheer technical wizardry overshadows the inherent wonder and  grandeur of the subject.  </P> <P> Birnbaum's "Will-O'-the-Wisp" (part of her "Damnation of Faust" series, begun  in 1983) is the most elusive of the six works. Three color monitors are mounted  on a 36-foot-wide photographic enlargement that can just barely be read as a  woman's face.  </P> <P> This latter-day Marguerite (the woman Faust seduces) appears in the video as a  dreamy face surrounded by green foliage. Eventually, the foliage turns autumnal  red and there are quick glimpses of children gathered at a doorway. Meanwhile,  the woman's voice murmurs inaudibly on the sound track, recounting her  abandonment by her lover.  </P> <P> The piece -- which, to be fair, was partly malfunctioning last week -- seems to  be about the way the environment colors memory and affects mood. But the clues  were vague and the repeated image of the woman's face unsettlingly reminiscent  of insipid commercials for intimate products.  </P></p>

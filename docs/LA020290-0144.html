			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> RETIRED AF COLONEL TO MANAGE CHAMBER  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce has hired Edward (Lee) Heinz as executive  manager. Heinz replaces Arlene Schafer, who held the position for three years  before resigning in December.  </P> <P> Heinz has been executive vice president of the Lompoc Valley Chamber of  Commerce for the last two years.  </P> <P> Heinz served 28 years in the Air Force before retiring as a full colonel in  1988. He was commander of the 659th Test and Evaluation Group at Vandenberg Air  Force Base in Lompoc.  </P> <P> A doctoral candidate in public administration at the University of La Verne,  Heinz holds two master's degrees from USC, in international relations and  systems management. He also holds a bachelor's degree in political science from  UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> "Costa Mesa is very diverse in terms of affluence," Heinz said. "It has South  Coast Plaza on one end of the spectrum and plenty of small mom-and-pop  operations on the other. I want to make sure that the chamber represents  everyone. But first, I plan to do a lot of listening. Then, in about 30 days,  I'll be ready to make my first recommendations."  </P> <P> Russell T. Gilbert, president of the Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, said  Heinz's leadership background, particularly his emphasis on long-range  planning, would contribute toward the future growth and success of the chamber.

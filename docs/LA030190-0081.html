			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> PLANNED PARENTHOOD GRANT  </P> <P> A $25,00 allocation to Pasadena Planned Parenthood, reluctantly approved in  December by the city Board of Directors, will not be needed this fiscal year  after all.  </P> <P> City directors were informed Tuesday that the family planning agency will  receive its full state funding to operate a clinic at 1045 N. Lake Ave.  </P> <P> Although Gov. George Deukmejian had cut statewide family planning funds last  year, the Legislature restored the money in a bill passed in January.  </P> <P> However, if Deukmejian pursues funding cuts already proposed for the next  fiscal year, Pasadena Planned Parenthood could draw on a second $25,000  allocation approved by directors in December.  </P> <P> After the board approved the appropriations to Planned Parenthood and two other  social service agencies, it created a committee that is devising a city policy  governing aid to nonprofit agencies.  </P></p>

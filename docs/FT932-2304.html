			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Charges over blast deaths HICKSON &amp; WELCH, the chemicals manufacturer, was yesterday committed for trial at Leeds Crown Court on charges connected with an explosion last year at its plant in Castelford, West Yorkshire, in which five workers were killed and two were seriously injured. The company faces charges, brought by the Health and Safety Executive, of failing to ensure the safety of employees under section 2 of the Health and Safety at Work Act. The company's solicitor agreed to the lifting of reporting restrictions on yesterday's hearing before Pontefract magistrates. Mr Michael Elliker, prosecuting, said the blast happened as workers cleaned out a tank containing a hazardous residue sludge. It was the first time in 20 years that the tank had been cleaned. He said they heated the sludge and cleaned it out using a dangerous method.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 26 (AFP) -- Russia has set no  preconditions for joining NATO's Partnership for Peace (PFP)  programme but wants the Alliance to respond to a series of  proposals for cooperation before signing up, Defence Minister  Pavel Grachev said Thursday [26 May].    He presented the proposals, notably on creating a mechanism  for consultation on security issues worldwide, and on increased  military and political cooperation, to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation Wednesday.    The statement, a copy of which was received by AFP Thursday,  was headlined the "practical participation" of Russia in the  Alliance programme.    It stated: "One of the goals of the partnership should be  the formation of a collective security and stability system in  Europe."    It also also cited as an issue of "special importance"  possible cooperation over Russian-led peacekeeping operations in  the former Soviet Union.    A well-placed NATO source said Wednesday that Grachev had  proposed levels of participation proportional to Moscow's  military weight, indicating an enthusiasm exceeding all  expectations.    "We thought (Russia) was only prepared to dabble its toe in  the PFP, but Grachev indicated it was ready to dive in," the  NATO source said.    But Grachev also called for a formal system of consultations  between Moscow and NATO on European and world security.    He reiterated Russia's wish for regular and automatic  meetings with NATO at all political and military levels,  something the Alliance has thus far resisted.    "NATO is not ready or willing to give any droit de regard  (right to influence) or even worse a veto over its activities,"  NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino told a press  conference Wednesday.    The Russian text added that the Partnership should help  coordinate activities of NATO and other structures, notably the  Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the  North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), the document said.    The CSCE comprises all European countries plus the United  States and Canada, while the NACC is the NATO body responsible  for consultation with former Warsaw Pact countries.    "In principle, the CSCE and the NACC should seek to  coordinate the efforts of NATO," and other bodies including the  European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),  the text said.    Political partnership would operate via consultations on  European and world security issues which would function "both on  a regular and emergency basis," it stated.    Balanzino, the chairman of Wednesday's meeting, suggested  that NATO was willing to accept the evolution of a "constructive  and substantial dialogue" if Russia embraced the military  partnership.    But NATO rejected a treaty formalising bilateral relations  with Russia, although it did not rule out a less formal  declaration when Moscow signs the PFP.</p>

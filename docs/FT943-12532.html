			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Biographies for the beach - Reading Matter For those considering recent biographies for a good summer read, a spate of lives of French literary masters should provide some predictably intoxicating blends of art, sex and money. Graham Robb's Balzac (Picador), the first English biography on this subject for 50 years, tells the splendid tale of the author who coldly calculated that 'each night of love cost half a volume', an equation which did not disturb his contemporary Stendahl who, according to his biographer Jonathan Keates (Stendahl, Sinclair Stevenson), boasted of his sexual exploits by marking the dates of his conquests on his braces. Moving on a few decades, but still in the same spirit of restless decadence, Joanna Richardson's Baudelaire (John Murray) tells the tragi-comic story of the improvident youth who inherited a fortune at 21, only to blow much of it on an exotic mistress who gave him the syphilis from which he died; there are parallels with Mallarme, who, according to Gordon Millan's account (Mallarme: A Throw of the Dice, Secker &amp; Warburg), also failed to reconcile his tormented existence with the radiant purity of his poetry. But who needs 19th century French glamour and scandal when there remains a Kennedy to write about? Joe McGinniss's The Last Brother, the Rise and Fall of Teddy Kennedy (Little, Brown and Company) observes that the man who was probably never fit for presidential office in the first place was further and fatally handicapped by the guilt-driven revenge of the American press who belatedly recognised their inadequacies in exposing the foibles of Teddy's elder brothers. It is a long way from the quiet, unsophisticated life of Joseph Chamberlain. Peter T. Marsh's astute life (Joseph Chamberlain: Entrepreneur in Politics, Yale University Press) sees Chamberlain at the centre of many of the 19th century's greatest social reforms, but denied the ultimate prize of prime ministerial office in Britain by his errors of judgment and changes of mind  -the archetypal politician of great influence but little power. Another forgotten man in need of rehabilitation is Giuseppe Mazzini, the neglected theorist of Italy's Risorgimento. Denis Mack Smith's eponymous volume (Yale University Press) attempts to redress the balance of praise which has usually been lavished more unreservedly on the more glamorous Cavour and Garibaldi. Any man who manages to be admired by both John Stuart Mill and Friedrich Nietzsche . . . The outstanding biography of the last few months is Lyndall Gordon's Charlotte Bronte: A Passionate Life (Chatto and Windus), a radical reappraisal of a woman more often seen as a waif whose timid genius was destroyed by years of hardship; Gordon instead offers a portrait of a fierce survivor who managed, unlike her sisters, 'to die with human love on her lips'.</p>

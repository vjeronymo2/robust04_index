			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Eavesdropping diplomats left guessing THEY'VE wined and dined senior politicians, listened to newspaper editors, eavesdropped on the constituencies and compared notes among themselves, but in the final run-up to polling day, foreign diplomats in London found it as hard as anybody else to make a firm prediction. 'Everyone is very confused. If you ask me who is going to win. We don't know,' said one Spanish diplomat, barely hiding his frustration at failing to make a firm prediction in his latest report to Madrid. All the foreign embassies in London have kept a watching brief on the election campaign, but a small group of countries, including Spain, have devoted particular resources to the event. It is not so much Gibraltar as the wider context of Europe that has drawn Spanish interest: 'After the recent electoral reversals of the socialists in France, we thought it was very important to see what happens here', said one Spaniard. Territorial issues seem to be of more exclusive concern to the Argentine embassy, where diplomats have been experiencing frustration of a different kind. They have witnessed the apparent reluctance of the Labour party to reaffirm its 1990 policy review document statement that it would adopt a more conciliatory attitude towards Buenos Aires on the issue of sovereignty over the Falklands Islands. For the US embassy, which has had to be less on its guard on issues such as defence policy than during the last British election campaign, some half-a-dozen diplomats have been following the hustings and feeding back information on grass-roots opinion. The embassy believes its feel for the political pulse has been enhanced by the longstanding links of Mr Raymond Seitz, the current US ambassador, who is on his third diplomatic posting to London. Yet one senior US diplomat said he was only prepared to telegram a guess about the outcome of the general election the night before the poll. 'We're scratching our heads like everybody else,' one US diplomat confided a few days ago. His final report has remained a closely guarded diplomatic secret. Two weeks ago, the German embassy commented, in response to a journalist's question, that the German way of measuring inflation rates was not comparable to the British. The statement was jumped on by the Labour party as evidence that Mr Lamont had misused his comparisons. It was the closest any embassy so far has come to getting embroiled - seemingly unwittingly - in a campaign controversy. And it probably explains why the Germans have in recent days steered clear of any comment whatsoever. As one German diplomat put it: 'To ask any diplomat what he thinks about the British election is a very sensitive question.'</p>

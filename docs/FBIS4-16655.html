			<p>BFN     [Text] The founding congress of Russia's Great Power Party  took place at the Lesnoy Gorodok holiday home in the Moscow  countryside on Sunday. It endorsed the party's program and  rules and elected the central bodies. The leader of the  Officers Union Stanislav Terekhov was elected chairman of the  party.    Last February, Lieutenant-Colonel Terekhov was released from  the Matrosskaya Tishina prison on an amnesty declared by the  Duma for all participants in the events in Moscow in  September-October, 1993. Military investigators claim that he  led an attack on the CIS Army Headquarters in late September,  1993, as a result of which a policeman and an elderly woman were  killed. Addressing the congress, Terekhov declared that his  party would work to revive Russia and its armed forces  spiritually and patriotically. The party intends to interact  with left-wing communist parties and the Russian Orthodox  Church, he said.</p>

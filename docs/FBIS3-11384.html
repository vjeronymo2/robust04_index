The White House's second most important man, who will be  arriving from Bolivia this evening and will leave for Brazil  tomorrow, will hold two meetings with Argentine President Carlos  Menem and his advisers to examine the so-called Summit of the  Americas, which is scheduled to take place in Miami, Florida, in  December.    Gore has plans for tours to other regional countries in  April. It was this statesman who, during his visit to Mexico in  January proposed, on behalf of President Bill Clinton, the  celebration of the hemispheric summit. According to officials  preparing this conference, the Miami encounter will be the main  issue of the conversations Gore will hold with his hosts.    The meetings in La Paz, Buenos Aires, and Brasilia will  permit the U.S. Government leader to return to Washington  knowing how the regional leaders with whom he will meet during  his tour think.    Government sources here have reported Menem will ask Gore at  that summit that the continent be declared "zone [word  indistinct] of agricultural subsidies." Menem will also seek  support for his idea to participate in an effort he calls "white  lines" to fight poverty in the world.    Official spokespersons want to postpone for another occasion  discussions on "points of discrepancy" so as not to mar the  dialogue, but certain sectors fear during the visit these issues  could crawl in to the center of attention.    Before making the trip here, the U.S. President praised the  Argentine economic model and other Menem administration  initiatives, such as its active participation in UN military  missions sponsored by the United States.    An independent source has reported in addition to the  announced summit and to the UN military expeditions, Gore and  Menem will discuss regional integration and free trade agreement  processes, such as the one signed by Canada, the United States,  and Mexico.    Argentina's forming part of that pact has become a top  objective of the Argentine Foreign Ministry and Presidency.    Despite this, the Clinton administration is conditioning  that  step to the approval of a medicines-patent law, which would  negatively affect Buenos Aires.    The U.S. ambassador in Argentina, James Cheek, said this  week  the patents issue is a "top priority" of his mission in  Argentina. This statement drew criticism from opposition  politicians who accused him of pressuring the South American  country.    Argentine observers have explained the law (on trademarks),  whose discussion the Argentine parliament has delayed one year,  would help the U.S. medical industry and harm 20 Argentine  pharmaceutical laboratories.    Local experts have said the market in question involves  approximately $2 billion annually. They report, despite the  fact there are no essential differences between Washington and  Buenos Aires over Argentina forming part of the free trade  agreement, time is against a quick solution.    The U.S. side wants to have established by the end of April  the countries with which it will negotiate their participation  in the free trade agreement, but the Argentine Congress will  debate the patents matter at the beginning of May, and there is  no guarantee it will approve it, said Jose Genoud, president of  the Senate Industries Commission.    Gore and Menem, who will preside over the opening session of  a world meeting on telecommunications tomorrow, will also  discuss matters related to the strengthening of the struggle  against drug-trafficking, a polemic issue considering the  meddling attitude made evident in U.S. statements.    In addition to suggesting a series of legal measures against  money laundering and other similar issues, the United States has  pointed to the suitability of Argentine soldiers fighting the  scourge (drugs), something Argentine laws forbid.    U.S. investments in Argentina are another important issue on  the Gore-Menem agenda. Two U.S. giants, AT&amp;T and GTE, among  others, will invest $200 million at the end of this month to  purchase the rights of Mobile Cellular Telephone in the  country's interior.    While waiting for Gore's visit, Menem met twice with U.S.  millionaire David Rockefeller who said he has "much trust" in  Argentina's future.</p>

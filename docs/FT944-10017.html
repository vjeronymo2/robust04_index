			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: GEC/British Gas Mr Roy Gardner's decision to leave GEC for British Gas suggests intriguing prospects for two of the UK's largest companies. His departure as GEC-Marconi's managing director makes his successor Mr Peter Gershon front-runner to take over from Lord Weinstock when he retires as GEC's managing director. Meanwhile, Mr Gardner's arrival as Gas's finance director should further plans to shake up the former state-owned monopoly's bureaucratic culture. Though Lord Weinstock himself may prefer to hand over GEC's reins to his son Mr Simon Weinstock, institutional investors are hostile to the idea. Mr Gershon has proved himself a tough manager during four years at GPT. Not only does Mr Gardner's departure remove one rival for the top job; after a spell at Marconi, Mr Gershon will have had experience running GEC's two largest subsidiaries. Meanwhile, Mr Gardner joins a small but growing team of outsiders at the top of Gas, led by Mr Richard Giordano who took over as chairman earlier this year. One of Mr Gardner's main tasks will be to ensure that Gas does not waste shareholders' funds as it presses ahead with its global ambitions. Investors can take comfort from his time at STC where its ICL subsidiary was sold to Japan's Fujitsu and the remaining telecoms business was then flogged to Canada's Northern Telecom. Though there was some hand-wringing when two national champions slipped out of British control, shareholders made handsome profits.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Travel: Violent landscape in bubbling repose - Michael J Woods flies above the volcanoes of Rotorua, climbs into their craters and bathes in their sulphur springs HOT sulphurous steam belched from the mountainside and rose in stifling clouds from the main crater, rolling upwards towards the rim before being torn to shreds and melting away to invisibility in the powerful south-westerly wind. The helicopter, insignificant against this great mountain, banked over the crater, bucking in the uplift. As it did so I stared into the volcano's evil depths to glimpse the sump of viscous grey liquid in the bottom. Only the bilious yellow of sulphur coloured the moonscape. Like iodine around a wound, the sulphur had left a saffron deposit round every vent and crack. The helicopter landed on the slippery surface of the old mudflow, deeply scored by water channels, where the wind piled in from the sea between two cliffs. This was White Island, an active volcano 31 miles off the east coast of New Zealand's North Island. Fishing boats may shelter in its lee and gannets and mutton birds may nest on its outer edges, but the interior is far less hospitable - the living planet in the making. White Island is at one end of a volcanic region which stretches inland south-west to Ruapehu volcano, 150 miles away, and contains all New Zealand's historically active volcanoes. One of its most notable manifestations is Mount Tarawera which erupted in the early morning of June 10 1886 to cause New Zealand's biggest natural disaster. We flew over it on our return from White Island, looking down into a gigantic cleft 850ft deep, blasted out of the mountain's three-domed summit in a rift eruption which runs for more than 10 miles. While a helicopter ride gives you a good overview, nothing beats climbing down into the crater, so later I was driven close to the top before slip-sliding down a long, steep scree slope into the crater itself. Stand still and the silence is almost overwhelming. But the earth has not finished its business here. Although my guide repeatedly reminded me that the giant beneath Tarawera was only sleeping, there was no sign of geothermal life. Go down the hill to the south-west and cross Lake Rotomahana into Waimangu Valley and there is enough activity to satisfy the most ardent enthusiast. And it would be harder to find one more ardent than Bradley Scott, from the volcano surveillance team of New Zealand's Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences, who took me there. He regularly monitors temperatures and water levels of the two lakes, Frying Pan Lake and Inferno Crater Lake. As they gently steamed before us, he explained that the two swap water via a freak underground chamber from which it is forced as if from a subterranean pressure cooker. Over a 38-day cycle, the level of Inferno Crater Lake can vary by as much as 39 feet, by far the largest such fluctuation in the world. By keeping an eye on things here, Brad should be able to predict any further eruptions and avoid the surprise that Tarawera sprung just over a century ago. In volcanic terms that was a minor eruption. Far larger ones have taken place here in the past, throwing out huge amounts of molten rock. Tourism based on hydrothermal activity was already growing before the 1886 eruption. Displays in Rotorua museum, located in a failed turn-of-the-century bath house, explain that Europeans were then making the long journey to New Zealand to bathe at the magnificent pink and white terraces which looked like two great glaciers pushing into the original Lake Rotomahana, except that these were created by heat rather than cold. They were regarded as one of the wonders of the world in their day. The Victorians enjoyed describing these delicate silica cascades in flowery tones. The hottest, deepest pools were at the top, cooler, shallower ones at the bottom. The topmost pools on the pink terraces contained shimmering blue water. Sadly, the terraces were blown away during the Tarawera eruption, Brad assured me, but, to his obvious amusement, optimistic expeditions still arrive occasionally, intent on excavating the terraces from the mud which buried the two Maori villages of Te Ariki and Moura and partially engulfed a third during that fateful night. This last, Te Wairoa, has been excavated and can still be seen on its site, south-east of Rotorua. It was here that visitors to the terraces would stay overnight before setting out by boat or on horseback with Maori guides, often purchasing freshwater crayfish on the way to cook in the terrace pools. The introduction of a cash economy meant that the destruction of their money-spinner was an even greater disaster for those who survived. It is still possible to enjoy a soak in the steaming opaque Polynesian pools. The acid and alkaline baths are open to the sky and at night they are dimly lit by strings of white fairy lights. The half-naked figures which silently came and went through the thick plumes of steam made my baths here a relaxing but surreal experience. Today there is a growing fascination with geothermal activity, and the Maori arts and crafts institute on the edge of Rotorua is partly funded by its popular guided visits to the boiling mud pools and geysers in its grounds. The institute fosters the craft of Maori carving. An evening at a Maori marae (meeting house), where a concert is followed by the customary hangi (meal cooked under the ground), gives an insight into the rituals of these people. The arriving party is treated as a rival tribe by the residents of the village and various rituals are observed. Warriors come forward with appropriately fierce threats and gestures until the peaceful intentions of the visitors are established. The night I went we were approached through the darkness by a tattooed, spear-wielding, grunting warrior. I am not sure which impressed me most  - this ferocious man or the unintentional helicopter acrobatics over White Island's yawning maw.

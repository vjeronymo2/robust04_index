			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / World News in Brief: Sterling tumbles below Dollars 1.50 to hit six-year low Sterling fell below Dollars 1.50 yesterday, closing at Dollars 1.487 in London and New York to hit a six-year low against the dollar as international investors shied away in the wake of Tuesday's surprise 1-point base rate cut. It also weakened against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.3925. Equities soared after the rate cut as borrowing costs fell to their lowest level since 1977 before profit-taking and the prospect of rights issues pared gains. The FT-SE 100 dropped 9.7 to 2,807.2, but gained 26 over the week. Currencies, Page 11; London stocks, Page 13; Editorial Comment, Page 6; Lex, Page 22; Markets, Wkd Page II</p>

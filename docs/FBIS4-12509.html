			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Abu-Muhammad Mustafa, Hamas representative </F> in Syria, by Sana' al-Imam, in Damascus; date not given; from  the weekly "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mustafa] The purpose of the 'Afula operation was  to avenge the martyrs of the bloody Ramadan dawn in the Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron. Revenge was inevitable. Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] is confident that 'Arafat will not go back  on the negotiations. He has burned all his bridges. He will  not return to the trench of the people, the intifadah, and the  resistance. The only thing he has left is to pursue the  conspiracy to the end. It is like a person who falls in deep  mud; whenever he tries to come out of the mud, he sinks deeper.  We are really astonished at the U.S. position and that of the  Security Council and some nations that condemned this great  operation of martyrdom, carried out for revenge and to deter the  Zionist usurpers from committing more operations. It took the  Security Council three weeks to issue a resolution condemning  the crime of the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. On the other hand, it  was only a matter of hours before it condemned this revenge  operation, which is part of the resistance against occupation  and usurpation. Does the Security Council act upon U.S-Zionist  orders? Is it no longer a council for world peace and world  peoples?    [Al-Imam] Hamas is not satisfied with this operation. It  has threatened to fire rockets at the homes of settlers in the  occupied territories. On what basis did Hamas launch these  threats? Will these threats be carried out? I wonder if Hamas  really has the weapons required to carry out such threats?    [Mustafa] First of all, the Palestinian people, Hamas, and  all free men, are demanding that the usurper occupiers leave our  land and go to their original home. They will live in peace  after the return of four million Palestinians who were made  homeless by Zionist usurpation. Those Zionist settlers and  soldiers are practicing killing, terrorism, and deportation.  They are practicing rape and violating sanctities. This is the  demand Hamas has made to those settlers. Otherwise, it has  threatened them with rockets, just like the Zionists launched  rockets against our people and villages and safe and defenseless  homes before and during the intifadah. When Hamas declares  this, it is aware that the Palestinian people know Hamas keeps  its promises. It has earned its credibility through its  successive statements and positions. This is not credibility  won by propaganda and fame. It is true credibility won on the  battlefield. Therefore, the threats Hamas has launched to fire  the rocket shells, which God has given it recently, as stated in  the recent military communique, represent a true announcement.  This is not cheap propaganda. It is not to win fame. Hamas  and the al-Qassam Battalions have proven this during the  intifadah.</p>

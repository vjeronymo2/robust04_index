			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Nesterovich, RIA-NOVOSTI special </F> correspondent specially for ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA: "The Crimean  Knot"]    [Text] Simferopol-Moscow -- The situation on and around  the peninsula is being normalized, but no fundamental changes in  the various sides' positions have occurred. Confrontation may  nevertheless be resolved through talks.    Claims that the situation in and around Crimea are now being  normalized are unfortunately not true. In fact there has only  been a drop in tension. Kiev and Simferopol have moderated the  belligerent tone of their statements and have begun talking less  about direct confrontation and conflict between the military  units and other force structures on the peninsula. However, no  fundamental changes in the various sides' positions have  occurred.    The Republic of Crimea authorities are acting on the basis  of  the restored Constitution of 6 May 1992, which gives them  extremely wide-ranging powers to resolve the peninsula's  internal problems. As far as mutual relations with Ukraine are  concerned, in the Crimean authorities' opinion there are no  insoluble problems here. The Constitution clearly notes that  Crimea is part of Ukraine. For its part, Ukraine is pointing to  the incompatibility of this document with its own Fundamental  Law. However, the Crimean authorities' everyday activities are  being described by the Republic's capital as separatism dictated  by a desire to leave the Ukrainian state.    In this confrontation President Yuriy Meshkov and the  Crimean  Supreme Council are relying on the unconditional support of an  overwhelming majority of the population, which unequivocally  gave its opinion on this issue in the poll of 27 March this  year. Therefore, a comparison between Crimea and Bosnia is at  the very least improper.    Regarding the Crimean Tatars, who, as was stated in the  Assembly of the Crimean Tartar People, now comprise  approximately 10 percent of the Crimean population, their  pro-Ukrainian sympathies have their limits.    Today, all Crimea's influential political forces as  represented in the republic's Supreme Council are stressing that  they do not oppose incorporation into Ukraine, but only for the  establishment of mutual relations with Kiev on a treaty basis  [sentence as published]. The demarcation of the two side's  powers should be defined as a result of negotiations. But  nobody in Simferopol or Kiev knows when these talks will begin.  For the time being the delegations from Supreme Councils of  Ukraine and Simferopol [as published] have only managed to  secure agreement on establishing a working group of experts  which by 15 June are required to submit to the Crimean  parliament their recommendations for eliminating inconsistencies  between the constitutions and other legislative organs [as  published] of Crimea and Ukraine.    Yevgeniy Saburov, vice prime minister and leader of the  Crimean Council of Ministers, believes that the present process  of talks between Kiev and Simferopol will begin after the  presidential election in Ukraine. At the present time, serious  talks between the two sides are impossible, because Crimea is  one of the main topics of the election campaign. Nevertheless,  he believes, Kiev will sooner or later arrive at a federative  structure, bearing in mind that several more regions of the  country are striving for greater autonomy within Ukraine.    For the time being, however, Kiev has practically reached  the stage of imposing economic sanctions on Crimea. Emissions of  finance to the peninsula have been suspended, which in the  inflationary conditions that exist in Ukraine may certainly be  regarded as a sanction. The construction of a water pipeline to  Simferopol, where people can obtain water for just one hour  every day, has been halted. Saburov also regards the policy of  whipping up tension around Crimea as an element of the sanctions  campaign, which has practically wrecked the tourist season. It  represents a direct undermining of Crimea's economic base and an  attempt to prevent revenue from reaching the Crimean budget.  Sanatoriums in the greater Yalta area, for example, are only 30  percent full, which right now means they are only just managing  to survive.    It has not been ruled out that the situation will sorted  out,  that a normal talks process will be established between Kiev and  Simferopol, and that the two sides will succeed in overcoming  all their disagreements, primarily their deep suspicion of one  another. In my view, this is currently the main obstacle on the  path to finding a compromise.    As debates in the Ukrainian parliament regarding Crimea have  shown, in this complex situation Leonid Makarovich [Kravchuk]  has successfully demonstrated his political skill and managed to  secure the most advantageous position in the election campaign.  He has been greatly helped in this task by the national  radicals. Particularly useful, for example, has been the remark  by Vice Admiral Vadim Kozhin, former Ukrainian Navy commander,  who not only demanded the immediate imposition of presidential  rule and martial law in Crimea, but also the withdrawal of the  Russian Black Sea Fleet from the peninsula within 24 hours.  Against this background, in the eyes of Ukrainian public  opinion Leonid Makarovich looks like a serious and responsible  politician who, while concerned for the unity of Ukraine as a  power, is not ruling out other, more strong-arm methods of  resolving the Crimean problem.    But the danger of a sharp deterioration of the situation in  Crimea is possible even in the absence of any political  complications. In an interview he gave to me, Colonel General  Valeriy Malikov, first deputy chairman of the Ukrainian Security  Service, who has been stationed in Crimea for a considerable  length of time, put forward the idea of establishing a working  group under the Crimean Supreme Council to clarify possible  misunderstandings between the troops stationed on the peninsula.  General Vladimir Lepekhov, head of the Republic of Crimea  Security Service, basically agrees with this proposal.    Malikov believes that the situation in Crimea became acute  in  May because of, among other things, the lack of coordination  between various military units which during that period were --  in accordance with Soviet tradition -- checking out the training  which troops had received for the winter and spring period.  There are more than enough troops in Crimea: The Black Sea  Fleet, which includes a coast defense division and brigade of  marines, naval units, a motorized rifle corps, a brigade of the  Ukrainian National Guard, and in addition to this, the Crimean  militia, which is subordinate to the Republic of Crimea  Government. This whole mass of armed men is concentrated in a  very restricted space; they are often practically on top of one  another.    Nor should we ignore the various special services. According  to my incomplete data, there are over 10 Ukrainian, Russian, and  Crimean organizations of this sort operating at various levels  in Crimea.    A mundane misunderstanding or fateful combination of  circumstances is all it would take to trigger an uncontrollable  sequence of events whose consequences would be simply impossible  to predict. A powder keg cannot be kept in a fire-risk zone  forever. Some day it will all go up in a ball of flames.    Therefore, alongside talks between Crimea and Ukraine on  normalizing their mutual relations, and between Russia and  Ukraine on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet, a no less important  task is the establishment of a kind of coordinating center  comprising representatives of the power structures operating in  Crimea. This center should at the very least coordinate the  activity of power departments and provide the civilian  authorities and the public with prompt information about all  uncoordinated actions and misunderstandings between these  departments. The situation will not deteriorate as a result of  this. On the contrary, trust will develop between the various  sides involved in the conflict, the people of Crimea will at  last be able to breathe more freely, and the number of people  deciding to vacation by the Black Sea will undoubtedly increase.</p>

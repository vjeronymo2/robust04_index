			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (9): Demand rises for new products - Equipment makers INSIDE the control room of PowerGen's Ferrybridge C power station in West Yorkshire is a television screen which alternates between giving information on the day's forecast power demand and the privatised electricity supplier's share price. The stockmarket display is not the only evidence at the 2,000MW coal-fired station of the changes sweeping the electricity supply industry. Earlier this year, Dunn International, a subsidiary of Hull-based Prospect Industries, became the first company to be appointed as lead contractor with responsibility for virtually all the overhaul and maintenance work at a UK power station. The long-term deal, won against tough competition, reflects the customer's wish to contract out of such work, reducing its workforce and saving money in the process. If it goes well, similar deals could follow. 'Our competitors are hoping we'll fall flat on our faces, but we won't,' says Mr Philip Wilbraham, Prospect's chairman and chief executive. Recent events at Prospect mirror the changing face of the power supply industry, which is creating new opportunities to suppliers of equipment and services but also forces them to be more responsive. Apart from the Ferrybridge C contract, Prospect last year paid Pounds 10.1m for Davenport Holdings, which builds and refurbishes water cooling towers. The aim is to add an important international dimension to the company in the US and, increasingly, in continental Europe. This is the kind of deal characterising a period that, on the face of it, might seem relatively quiet following the heavy recent restructuring of the European power equipment industry. The two major companies formed from the mergers of the late 1980s, the Anglo-French GEC Alsthom and the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri, have now been in business for five years. Along with Siemens of Germany, these three companies turn up regularly on the short lists for virtually all the European contracts for gas and steam turbines and - depending on the country - there are a handful of other names that can be guaranteed to be bidding. However, while there have been no takeovers or mergers of such a scale since the late 1980s, there is plenty of activity, which can be categorised in a number of ways: Deals reflecting the changing shape of Europe: the collapse of the eastern bloc communist regimes has fuelled intense interest in their power equipment suppliers, which is making the concept of two separate western and eastern industries less valid. ABB in particular has led the way into eastern Europe with power-related takeovers and joint ventures in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Siemens, too, has been in on-off negotiations with Skoda Plsen of Czechoslovakia on a joint venture involving conventional thermal power plant, and both it and GEC Alsthom have negotiated gas turbine joint ventures with companies in St Petersburg. In the short term at least, the value of the eastern companies to their western owners or joint venture partners is more as a manufacturing source than as an entree to eastern markets, whose equipment needs have yet to be matched by finance. In contrast, the acquisitions and joint ventures undertaken by the big equipment suppliers in eastern Germany have borne much greater fruit in terms of business won, because of the restructuring and modernisation of the ageing power industry in the new German states. Deals involving non-European companies: the big US equipment suppliers have strengthened their networks of licensees and associates in Europe. General Electric signed a series of agreements in 1991 with Elin of Austria, and a year later with Germany's Blohm + Voss, adding to the presence it has achieved in Europe in its own right and via agreements such as its 10 per cent stake in GEC Alsthom's European Gas Turbines unit. Westinghouse earlier this year signed a two-year co-operation agreement with Finland's Haka Stroi to develop opportunities in the Baltic states, and last year announced a far-reaching partnership with Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine group, which should strengthen both companies' position in the European market and elsewhere. Sectoral activity: restructuring and reorganisation has continued in product sectors where suppliers that have traditionally relied on national buying preferences are having to adapt to global market opportunities, technological competition, and their own manufacturing overcapacity. The boiler industry, for example, has seen a number of deals in recent years involving companies in the US, western and eastern Europe. Long lead times and shortage of work have also brought changes in the European nuclear plant supply industry. The co-operation between Siemens and France's Framatome to develop EPR, the European Pressurised Water Reactor, is an example. Internal restructuring and reorganisation: the mega-mergers of the late 1980s were only the start of a process that has led to big increases in productivity and improvements in manufacturing effectiveness. In Europe, the mergers have led to a concentration of production of key components such as gas turbines, and some closures of plant associated with the relatively unfashionable large steam turbines, or with the nuclear industry. This has reduced the problems caused by manufacturing overcapacity in Europe, although the eastern Europe expansion has partially offset that. Looking ahead, the big question is whether any further major restructuring of the European power plant industry is likely. At present, it is difficult to foresee anything on the scale of ABB or GEC Alsthom being created. Demand for new power capacity in Europe may be growing at only about 2 per cent a year, but the suppliers are operating in a global market where there is enough work to keep the equipment producers reasonably busy. But the European suppliers will be continuing efforts to increase their profitability through further internal cost-reduction efforts, bringing it more in line with that of their US rivals.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Rao sends rival to riot-hit Bombay INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, who is battling to rebuild his authority after months of bloody communal unrest, has sent Mr Sharad Pawar, the defence minister, to take control of the local authorities in Bombay, the city which bore the brunt of the violence. Mr Pawar, who is from Bombay, resigned from the cabinet yesterday to become chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay. The move is being presented as an effort to bolster the state administration with a strong and experienced leader who has held the job of chief minister three times already. But Mr Rao's decision is widely viewed as an attack on Mr Pawar, who sees himself as a potential future prime minister. While Mr Pawar said he was 'happy to do my job as a disciplined soldier' of the ruling Congress (I) party, his supporters did not hide their dismay. Mr Rao's action follows weeks of turbulence in Congress party circles in Bombay, which ultimately escalated to the point which forced him to impose his authority or risk a local rebellion. The trouble began with a long-running power struggle in Bombay between Mr Pawar and Mr Sudhakarrao Naik, who was chief minister until he was forced to resign last month. Mr Naik was in office during the riots which hit Bombay in December and January after the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Mr Pawar persuaded Mr Rao to get rid of Mr Naik - but, as it has turned out, this week, only at the cost of his own cabinet job.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- The Soviet block in Eastern Europe  may have collapsed but according to a senior Army officer,  Indonesia must be vigilant against a communist revival.    "Communism remains a latent danger in Indonesia now and in  the future," Brigadier General Agum Gumelar, the chief of the  Army's elite force Kopassus [Special Forces Command], told  reporters yesterday.    "Communism will return if the condition of society becomes  chaotic," Agum said during a rare press conference given by him  at the command's headquarters in Cijantung, East Jakarta, in  connection with Kopassus' upcoming 42nd anniversary.    The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) has been outlawed since  1966.    Kopassus spearheaded the Army's move to quash the communist  forces immediately after the failed coup attempt by PKI in 1965.    The highly disciplined force has also been prominent in most  major military operations in Indonesia, including putting down  separatist rebellions in Aceh, East Timor and Irian Jaya.    Agum said leftist and rightist elements are constantly  trying  to replace the political system in Indonesia which has been  painstakingly built since 1966, by criticizing and attacking the  system at every opportune moment.    He felt that they immediately blame the system for any  mishaps, adding that the right elements would also exploit  religious issues to further their cause.    He also warned against other elements, particularly from  Western- educated liberal-minded intellectuals, who constantly  demand political and economic reforms.    "They focus on labor and land conflicts to attack the  government. Such movements, if not controlled, will worsen the  social, political and economic conditions," he said.    He accused non-governmental organizations [NGOs] of using  such issues as democratization, political openness,  environmental protection and human rights to discredit the  government and the Armed Forces (ABRI).    "We know many NGOs have become vocal, both at home and  overseas, on human rights and environmental issues in their  efforts to discredit the government and ABRI. They are also  against the constitution and Pancasila [The ideological basis of  the Indonesian state]," he said.    "What do Princen and Adnan Buyung Nasution really hope to  achieve by advocating the human rights of criminals?" he asked,  referring two of Indonesia's most outspoken human rights  campaigners. "Tell me which is more important. Protecting the  human rights of criminals or those of the good guys?" He said  ABRI and the government were open to criticism, provided they  were aired with the intention to help the government improve the  people welfare and not to replace the system.    "What would become of this nation if there was a revolution  to overturn the Pancasila democracy?," he asked. "We will go  back to square one after people have been waiting for a long  time to enjoy a good standard of living. "    Despite many shortcomings and weaknesses, people should give  credit to the present government for improving their welfare, he  said.</p>

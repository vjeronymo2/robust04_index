			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Investors face a glut of global bond indices - A growth industry THE international fixed income markets face a glut of global bond indices. Widely used as tools to measure the performance of fund managers, indices have been standard products in the US fixed income markets since the early 1970s. It was not until 1986, though, that Salomon Brothers produced the first global bond index. The number of indices is growing rapidly. The JP Morgan index, launched in 1990, has won a strong following, and other banks are now revamping or creating their own versions, among them Merrill Lynch, UBS (which published its own last week) and Lehman Brothers (which expects to go public early this autumn). Salomon also dusted down its own product last month. The European bond commission has also been working to produce an index with Bloomberg, the electronic information company. Indices have become an important part of the banks' fight to win business from fund managers - at considerable expense. Salomon, for instance, estimates it has 20 people working full-time on its global index. 'It seems surprising that people should want to spend money coming into a business which doesn't at first sight offer much return,' says Mr John Gillies of Frank Russell, the US-based performance measurement company. The returns can be considerable. If a fund manager is following a particular bank's index, it creates an instant relationship between the two. The investor needs regular information on the performance of the index, and is likely to want to talk over its composition. This often goes one step further, as investors open their international bond portfolios to the bank concerned to discuss how they can change their holdings to better match particular aspects of the index. That way, the bank gets the chance to bring the full weight of its technical analysis to bear on the portfolio - and the chance to recommend and carry out particular trades. Investment banks need bond indices for other reasons. They are used to price over-the-counter derivatives. Without its own, a bank would have to price derivatives based on a market against some other house's index, putting it at a disadvantage. Another reason for the proliferation of indices is simply that they have become cheaper to produce. 'Technology has made it easier to compute index returns,' says Mr Richard Pagan of Salomon. Not all indices are likely to be successful. The different make-up of the indices is one factor that will determine which gain the biggest following. WM, another performance measurement company, decided 18 months ago to recommend the JP Morgan index over the Salomon one, a preference which seems also to have been followed by Frank Russell. They were swayed by factors such as Morgan's decision to calculate its index daily, rather than monthly, and to use foreign exchange rates taken from the close of business in London, rather than New York. The difference in foreign exchange rates, for instance, amounted to a variation of as much as 50-100 basis points a year in the returns shown by different indices, says WM. Salomon has now changed its index to match these and other expressed preferences for the Morgan index. It has also extended the number of countries it covers - as has Morgan - to reflect the growing spread of markets covered by international bond fund managers. Substantial variations remain, though. The prices used to calculate indices are particular to each house, and there are big differences in the policy on which bonds to include and exclude. The proliferation of indices also looks set to extend to more specialised areas. JP Morgan yesterday announced a new Emerging Markets Bond Index, tracking the performance of bonds issued as a result of debt restructuring agreements by lesser developed countries. A similar index was launched by Salomon two years ago, but the likelihood of Argentina and Brazil reaching agreement with their foreign bank creditors in the coming months will double the amount of bonds in issue and could attract new investors to the high-yield markets.</p>

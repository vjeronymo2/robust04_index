			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bizarre result is against wishes of residents Sir, I was very concerned to read your prediction ('Council reform faces further setback', November 1) that the Local Government Commission will recommend no change in most of the county areas in the second phase of their review. Last week, the commission published its recommendations for nine county areas. In six of these, including my own county of Cheshire, the commission made a U-turn and recommended no change. The big question that I and the electorate in Cheshire and other county areas will now be asking is: 'Why has the commission spent more than two years reviewing local government at a cost nationally of in excess of Pounds 8m a year, and is coming out with absolutely no positive results?' All the arguments for scrapping the present system and creating new unitary councils in Cheshire and other counties are as powerful today as when the commission advanced them in its draft recommendations last June. Two-tier local government costs residents more, it is inefficient, unaccountable, confusing and unpopular. It is bizarre that the commission should now recommend after all its own research and evidence to the contrary, the retention of the status quo. We in Chester consulted our residents about their wishes on several occasions. On the last occasion, a Gallup Poll undertaken in October showed that there was still a clear majority of Chester residents who preferred unitary local authorities and that indeed 67 per cent of them wanted a unitary council based on Chester. In view of this substantial public support in Chester, and no doubt elsewhere, it seems preposterous that the residents of cities like Chester should not get the same benefits of unitary local government as will now be enjoyed in the future by the cities of York and Bath and Chester's neighbouring town of Wrexham in North Wales. We in Chester, in common with other towns and cities, will be pressing the government strongly to reject these totally unacceptable recommendations.

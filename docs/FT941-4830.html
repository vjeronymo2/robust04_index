			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc renews Merieux bid Rhone-Poulenc, the recently privatised French chemicals group, is reactivating plans to take full control of Institut Merieux, the Lyon-based pharmaceuticals company. Last October, the two companies announced terms for an offer whereby Rhone-Poulenc, which owns 51 per cent of Merieux, would buy all the remaining shares. However, the offer was suspended in December when Pasteur Merieux, a subsidiary, was forced to stop production of its albumine vaccine because of regulations over the collection of human placentas, the basic raw material. Under the terms of the original offer Rhone-Poulenc was to offer 77 of its own shares for every five Institut Merieux shares. Under the new offer, the chemicals group is offering 15 shares for each share in Merieux. Merieux is a world leader in the development of vaccines. However, it is a relatively small player in an intensely competitive industry, with net profits of FFr396m (Dollars 67.1m) on sales of FFr6.6bn in 1992. Rhone-Poulenc said at the time of its initial offer that it expected, by taking full control of Merieux, to benefit from potential synergies between their human and animal health businesses.</p>

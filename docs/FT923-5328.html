			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Yugoslav president backs Panic MR MILAN PANIC, prime minister of the unrecognised rump state of Yugoslavia, was yesterday fighting for his political survival, as the country's president, Mr Dobrica Cosic, swung his weight behind him. He faces a no-confidence motion, possibly on Friday. It is seen as the beginning of a showdown in his power struggle with Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Cosic, a writer regarded as the spiritual leader of all Serbs, said he was 'surprised' by the motion brought against Mr Panic by Serbia's governing Socialists. Defeat for Mr Panic could mean an end to the peace process and the London conference, which has already lost momentum since failing to agree a timetable to halt fighting in the Balkans. Mr Cosic is said to be prepared to back Mr Panic, the Belgrade-born US millionaire seen by many Serbs as the only figure who can rescue them from international isolation. In a TV interview last night Mr Panic said: 'We (Yugoslavia) have promised a lot and signed at least 60 agreements but we have never said 'Sorry it's our fault' when the agreement was broken. The world, I must say publicly, sees Mr Milosevic as a man who does not keep his word.' His interview is likely to shock viewers in Serbia unaccustomed to criticism of Mr Milosevic and Serbia's role in Bosnia. The motion of no-confidence in Mr Panic is being backed by 68 Socialist and ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical deputies, who accuse him of betraying Serbian interests at the London conference. Serb forces yesterday were reported to have lifted their five-month siege of Gorazde. The mostly Moslem defenders gained control of the town where 70,000 people have been trapped with little food and medicine. Serb fighters withdrew 12 miles from the town, according to eyewitnesses. It was unclear whether fighting would continue. Five members of the UN force in Sarajevo were wounded in a mortar attack last night, Reuter reports. An Egyptian colonel and two French officers were seriously injured and two other French soldiers slightly wounded.</p>

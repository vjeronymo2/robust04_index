			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (9): Venerable institutions to tempt the cautious - They are virtually unrestricted, explains Bethan Hutton, yet have a solid UK base Many people steer clear of the stock market, or anything linked to it, because of a vague feeling that companies go bust, stock markets crash, and the world of stocks and shares is populated by fly-by-night outfits which take your money and run. Perhaps even the most truly cautious might stick a toe in the water if it were possible to entrust their money to institutions which had been managing money since before their grandparents were born, and had survived every stock market crash this century. Such institutions do exist: a good number are to be found among the 20 or so trusts in the international general investment trust sector. Half of them were launched before 1900, and only four are post-war - the first world war, that is. Like the giant, long-lived tortoises on the Galapagos Islands who met Darwin when he first passed by, and are still munching placidly away a century and a half later as hordes of eco-tourists follow in his wake, they have seen it all before. When the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust, the most venerable and most gigantic of them all, came into existence more than 125 years ago, the emerging markets of the Far East and Latin America were all the rage. Since then investment fashions have gone through many phases before returning full circle to the 'newly emerging' markets of the Far East and Latin America. But these trusts are not lumbering creatures still living in the last century. Their advantage is their flexibility. You want emerging markets? The international generalists have got them. You want European privatisations? UK small-cap stocks? Latin American telephone companies? Japanese game manufacturers and Australian mines? Foreign &amp; Colonial, Alliance, Bankers Trust, Mid Wynd, Scottish Mortgage and their like will probably have them all - if they are worth having, that is, not just this month's gimmick to launch a new trust. International general trusts are virtually unrestricted in their investment policies. They all have a solid base portfolio of UK shares, but can move funds anywhere in the world if they see markets turning nasty in one corner of the globe while investment opportunities open up elsewhere. They can invest in the largest blue-chip stocks or the tiniest start-up venture, as they see fit. The one thing they do not all have is fully Pep-qualifying status. Some, like Scottish Mortgage, have decided to go for Pepability, and so make sure that their funds are always at least 50 per cent invested in the UK and Europe. But others, notably Foreign &amp; Colonial, treasure their complete investment freedom so that although at times their portfolio may be less than 50 per cent invested outside the EU, they make no promises that it will remain that way. Therefore investors can only put up to Pounds 1,500-worth of these trusts' shares into a Pep each year. However, most of the management groups run other fully Pepable funds which can use up the rest of your Pep allowance if you prefer to keep your Pep under one roof. Because these trusts spread their assets so widely around different markets, they are never caught up in the kind of wave of enthusiasm which can pluck more narrowly-focused trusts from obscurity (and a hefty discount) and make them flavour of the month (pushing them to a premium), only to drop them when the next fad comes along. General trusts tend to roll steadily along at an average sort of discount, neither in nor out of favour. Investors in highly-specialised trusts can find that when their speciality falls out of favour, they are hit by a double blow as the share price plummets and the discount widens to as much as 20 or 30 per cent. But it would take a collapse in all world markets - not impossible, but not a frequent occurrence - to deal a heavy blow to the international generalists. International general trusts provide the ideal basis for the first-time equity investor's portfolio. They give you a little bit of everything, without too much exposure to some of the heart-stoppingly volatile individual markets. This may mean that you never triple your money in six weeks, in the way your broker swears you could have done if you had shovelled it all into emerging market warrants and Latin American debt at the right moment. But you will also be spared the experience of seeing your money disappear into a black hole as you try to sell last month's hot tip at the same time as everybody else. Independent adviser David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says the Foreign &amp; Colonial trust is a long-standing favourite of his. 'I think of it very much in the light that it will never reach extremes and be at the top of the performance tables, but it is solid, and it has downside protection.' Another handy feature for cautious or small investors is that most international generalists have savings schemes which allow you to invest small, regular amounts, sometimes as little as Pounds 25 a month, to build up a holding in the fund. This also means you can ride out the ups and downs of the stockmarket, and avoid investing lump sums at the peak of the market (see above). Foreign &amp; Colonial was the first to offer a savings scheme, 10 years ago, and it continues to evolve: now you can even take out a Foreign &amp; Colonial personal pension plan. If proof were needed, that gives a clear signal that these trusts expect to be around for a long time yet.</p>

The weekly was funded by the  former Central Committee of the CPSU. Its publication was  stopped by the order of the former Ministry of the Press and  Information of the Russian Federation after the events of August  3-4 last year. Late in January the court annulled the ministry's  decision, stating that the weekly had not been published from  September 9 and so could not have been involved directly in the  bloody events in Moscow.    The publication founded by the work collective of the  editorial office has been renewed as an "all-union political  weekly", Alexey Veretennikov, assistant editor of GLASNOST, told  ITAR-TASS. The weekly has not changed its political positions.  It declares "for the restoration of the USSR and unification of  the communist parties". The assistant editor said that among  contributors to the publication are Anatoliy Lukyanov, Oleg  Shenin, Nikolay Ryzhkov.</p>

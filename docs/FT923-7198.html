			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian silk industry aims to boost export appeal - The second biggest producer has to import fibre to meet overseas demand INDIAN EARNINGS from silk goods exports rose by nearly 55 per cent to Rs6.76bn (Pounds 125m) during the year to March 1992, but the industry and the federal government remain dissatisfied with the industry's position as a minor player in the world market. Although it is the second largest producer of silk after China it has only about a 6 per cent share of world trade in the commodity and mostly exports low value silk goods. The Indian government is thinking of linking up with China in an effort to correct the technological deficiencies of its silk sector. According to Mr S. Shah, president of Silk Association of India, the modernisation programme will have to cover every aspect of sericulture (silk-worm breeding) and silk processing. India aims to produce 14,465 tonnes of silk in 1992-93 but it will be depending almost totally on imports of raw fibre, mainly from China, for the production of silk goods for the export market. Indian silk has good lustre, but because of the lack of strength and unevenness of the yarn it cannot compete with the China's strong, wash-proof fibre. Indian processors are allowed to import raw silk against export and value addition commitments ranging from 75 per cent to 150 per cent. According to industry representatives, Indian silk production will get a boost both in terms of quantity and quality provided the Rs5.5bn national sericulture project funded by the World Bank and the Swiss Development Corporation is implemented faithfully. Under this project, sericulture is being introduced in many non-traditional areas. Indian productivity of 37 kg of raw mulberry silk a hectare is woefully low, experts say, and they believe it can easily be doubled. For a long time to come, however, Indian exports of silk goods will have to depend on import of raw fibre. Besides the poor quality of indigenous silk, the domestic market for silk goods is large enough not to leave any surplus for export. Following a 26 per cent devaluation in the Indian currency, the export target of Rs10bn by 1994-95 appears easily achievable. But Mr Shah says a breakthrough in exporting will have to await a switch from manual to machine spinning, weaving, dyeing and finishing. The Indo-German Export Promotion Project has observed that if India is to have a bigger share of the German silk market than 6 per cent it must introduce modern weaving, dyeing and finishing techniques. Germany is the second biggest market for Indian silk goods after the US. The other big buyers of Indian silk goods are the UK, Italy, Spain and France.</p>

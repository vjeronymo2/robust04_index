			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / UK Company News: The flotation of a mixed bag of shops - House of Fraser heads for stock market with Pounds 450m price tag Visitors to House of Fraser stores in a few weeks' time will be offered more than just the opportunity to buy new clothes or a sofa. They will be able to register to buy shares in the company. The group, which stretches from Inverness to Plymouth and includes names like Dickins &amp; Jones, Army &amp; Navy, Rackhams and Binns, will announce on Tuesday that it is to be floated on the Stock Exchange before Easter - somewhat earlier than envisaged when the flotation, minus the flagship Harrods, was proposed last July. The pathfinder prospectus, which will be published at the end of the month, is expected to show operating profits for the year to January of about Pounds 40m. With the group likely to take on about Pounds 100m of debt from its current owners, the Fayed brothers, analysts expect the price tag in March to be about Pounds 450m - broadly in line with the stores sector price/earnings multiple of about 20. The flotation will end the involvement of the Fayeds, who acquired the chain, including Harrods, for almost Pounds 600m in 1985 after a bitterly-fought battle with Lonrho. The group's directors admit that the House of Fraser name was damaged in the feud which ensued between the Fayeds and Lonrho, but insist the stories of neglect and starvation of funds to enable the Fayeds to pay off their debts are wrong. Mr Brian McGowan, the former chief executive of Williams Holdings who was tempted out of retirement aged 48 to become non-executive chairman, says the Fayeds spent Pounds 110m on the chain, and closed lossmaking stores, leaving it financially sound and possessing great potential - although more investment is required to bring all stores up to 1990s standards. Analysts who have been whisked around the chain in recent weeks in Mr Ali Fayed's helicopter have found a mixed bag of shops, operating under 17 different names in 52 cities, ranging from 30,000 to 300,000 sq ft. The stores also range widely in standard of decor, from Frasers in Glasgow, which recently had Pounds 8m lavished on refitting departments around a sparkling new atrium, to the likes of Cavendish House in Cheltenham, where the last real investment was Pounds 500,000 in 1984, and before that, in the 1960s. The result is a somewhat top-heavy chain which makes more than 35 per cent of its Pounds 695m turnover from six stores - Rackhams of Birmingham, Kendals of Manchester, Frasers of Glasgow, DH Evans and Dickins &amp; Jones in London, and Howells of Cardiff. However, only four are now lossmaking and the directors are confident even moderate investment can produce a significant uplift in sales and profits from many stores. Mr Tony Hancock, operations manager, believes all the stores should be able to achieve a 10 per cent return on sales. To achieve that, the group has a two-prong strategy. Firstly, it plans a Pounds 50m-plus investment programme over three years. The model for the investment will not be Glasgow, but rather the Pounds 2.5m spent on a mainly cosmetic refit of Howells of Cardiff, which has lifted annual turnover from Pounds 25m two years ago to close to Pounds 30m. The priority is a Pounds 3m refit of Dickins &amp; Jones of Regent Street - which will take over from Harrods as the London flagship - including a new atrium and network of escalators and other improvements. Some 18 other projects this year include revamps of Bournemouth, Lincoln, Birmingham, Manchester, and of Army &amp; Navy in London. Secondly, the group is revising and slimming down its range, while introducing new designer labels, and trying to strengthen the own-label brands. 'We have a vision of being a fashion-led business, both fashion in the home and fashion apparel,' says Mr Andrew Jennings, managing director. Other services - such as beauty salons, restaurants and left luggage offices  -will be introduced. Mr Jennings says these will emphasise the group's value-added image and help it fend off competition from lower-price opposition such as warehouse clubs and discount outlets. He adds that the group has a strong ABC1 customer profile, often very loyal indeed to their local store, but needs to attract more customers in the 25-35 age group in addition to the 35-59 core. 'We already attract the older Mrs Jones, but we also want the more contemporary Ms Dickins,' he says. Convincing the City that such a transformation is possible may not be easy. Analysts point to the stores' poor sales per square foot figure compared with rivals such as Debenhams and the John Lewis Partnership, and express reservations about the future of the department store format. 'I think it's interesting in terms of what they can do with the stores,' said one analyst. 'But I think it will be a steady growth story, not a recovery stock.' Mr Jennings insists the department store sector is coming back into its own. While high street specialists thrived in the late 1980s, they are now saddled with high rents on leasehold properties. Some 92 per cent of House of Fraser's property is freehold or long leasehold, substantially reducing its costs. Perhaps most importantly, he says, the chain has no direct competitor. Debenhams specialises in clothing, much of it own-label, for a more downmarket audience, while the John Lewis Partnership is particularly strong in housewares. 'There is a big opportunity for fashion-led department stores selling designer labels,' he says. 'No one else is doing it.'</p>

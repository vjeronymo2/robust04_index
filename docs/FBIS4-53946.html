			<p>BFN     [Text] Nagoya, May 23 KYODO -- House of Representatives  member Tadao Otani on Monday [23 May] partly admitted in court  to charges against him that he evaded income taxes, but refused  comment on other allegations that he conspired with his  supporters to evade taxes.    Otani, 58, admitted to the bulk of the charges in his first  hearing at the Nagoya District Court that while he was in the  prefectural assembly he falsified declarations on political  funds, but maintained that any tax evasion on the part of his  supporters was a separate matter.    He has refused to comment on whether or not his actions with  a former secretary Susumu Ochiai, 51, who also faces charges in  court, and his supporters constitute a conspiracy.    Otani served four terms in the prefectural assembly before  leaving the LDP to join Shinseito, the core party of the  governing coalition. He left Shinseito in January after  admitting to most of the charges.    The prosecution alleged that Otani took advantage of a  system  under which persons giving a donation to a political group can  reduce their tax payout by attaching a receipt from the group to  their tax return. Prosecutors allege that some of the claims by  his supporters of donations paid never existed.    The prosecution alleges that as a result of the false  claims,  Otani and 72 of his supporters received a total of some 56  million yen in refunds as tax deductions.    In his statement at a press conference following the  hearing,  Otani apologized to his supporters, but distanced himself from  the period when he was a prefectural assemblyman, saying that  since entering the Diet he had assumed new responsibilities.    "I will decide how I will assume my responsibilities in the  future, on the basis of the opinion around me and the judgment  of the court," he said, in referring to questions on whether he  would resign his Diet seat.</p>

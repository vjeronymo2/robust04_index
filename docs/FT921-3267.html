			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Sex and the single company: Dominic Lawson thinks that a womens' magazine and a condom company make strange bedfellows One of the few perks in the otherwise austere life of a magazine editor is that he or she is constantly being sent free copies of every other magazine. The perk lies in not reading them. But sometimes curiosity overcomes judgement. Elle magazine caters for curious editors by publishing a special 'SEX' section. Just in case we don't get the point, the word SEX is written in red letters six inches high. It's size that counts. But one should not be flippant. Elle has recently forged links with The Guardian newspaper and must, therefore, be taken seriously, if not actually believed. 'Imagine,' the SEX section begins, 'a woman standing straight and proud, facing the world head-on. In one hand she carries a briefcase, symbolising her control over her working life; in the other she brandishes a vibrator and a packet of condoms   . in the 1990s this woman is becoming a reality.' This, of course, is absolutely right. Women walking around with symbolic briefcases in one hand, and condoms and vibrators in the other are a common sight these days, and I'm surprised no one has noted this fact before now. Presumably the condoms these women brandish are manufactured by Durex. You see, Durex has sponsored the Elle SEX survey, and it would be ungrateful to brandish imaginary condoms made by a rival company. Durex, naturally, would like every woman of child bearing age to run around brandishing its wares, and it pays to advertise; the subliminal message, as they say in the Ad Biz, is that if you don't do Durex you do get AIDS. But not all the readers of Elle, sadly, have yet absorbed this vital message. 'Has AIDS changed the way we love?' it shrieks: 'A staggering 54 per cent of our sample did not consider themselves at risk from AIDS. Understandable perhaps, given that many of them are in relationships, but worrying, given the statistics on fidelity. Even more concerning is the fact that over a third claim not to have changed their sexual behaviour because of HIV/AIDS.' I do indeed find it staggering that 46 per cent of Elle readers consider themselves at risk from AIDS, and that two thirds of its readership have changed their sexual behaviour because of HIV/AIDS. The most recent statistics from anonymous tests carried out in British ante-natal clinics show the incidence of the HIV virus among women in central London as 0.04 per cent or one in 4,000. Outside central London the incidence of HIV is 0.016 per cent, or one in 16,000. These, remember, are figures from ante-natal clinics, essentially women between the ages of 18 and 38. Such tests among the total female population would most likely show an even more minuscule incidence of the HIV virus. These figures do, admittedly exclude one category of intravenous drug users, the only element among the female population genuinely at risk from HIV/AIDS. This, on the other hand, has nothing to do with SEX. And Durex cannot help to reduce the risks for these unfortunate auto-injectors. For some reason, however, Elle, in association with Durex, have not seen fit to inform their readers of the true risks of AIDS to women. Instead they are jointly promoting a new condom for women. According to the Elle editorial, 'Durex have come up with Assure, a condom that still retains the high quality and reliability of Durex, but which is packaged discreetly and stylishly . . . no need to wince if they drop out of your handbag.' Handbag? Whatever happened to the symbolic briefcase? Doubtless Durex will succeed in its aim to increase the acceptabilty and sales of its product. But I still think that magazines should not get into bed with condom manufacturers. The readers have no protection. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

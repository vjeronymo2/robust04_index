			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASKETBALL CAPSULES;  </P> <P> TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Moorpark  </P> <P> COACH: Tim Bednar, 2nd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 14-10; 2nd in league, 7-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Jodie Kitt (6-foot-3), who averaged 10.5 points and 6.7  rebounds a game as a sophomore last season, moved to Georgia, but Moorpark has  benefited from the transfer of two other players. Junior Rob Salone (6-1)  transferred from Alemany and Marcus James (5-7) moved from Indiana. Salone, a  junior, played football at Alemany last year but sat out the basketball season.  "Salone is a good jumper and can post people," Bednar said. "He's a complete  player, and James has an outside shot." Forward-guard Kim Kira (6-1) and guard  Ryan Huisenga (5-11) return and forward Lupe Solano (6-1) complete the starting  five. Bednar plans to employ a full-court zone defense and a spread offense.  "We will try to pressure people."  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Defending league champion Bishop Diego is the favorite, according to  Bednar, "But I look at the five guys we have coming off the bench and the five  basketball players on the court and I think we'll be in the thick of the race."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oak Park  </P> <P> COACH: Nate Sims, 1st season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 8-15; 6th in league, 3-7  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The success of the football team has put hardships on the  development of the basketball team. Chris Kelly (6-1), Zach Siciliano (6-1) and  Tarik Smith (6-0) played on the football team, which advanced to the Division  IX semifinals, and only began practice with the basketball team this week. Dave  Shaw (5-11) is the lone returnee on a team that features no player taller than  6-2. Sims calls Damian Delfino (6-0) the best outside shooter, but he said that  everybody will have to score to make up for the lack of height. "We'll run the  passing game with strong aggressive motion," Sims said. Joey Ryan (5-10), Eric  Pryor (5-11) and Mike Chang (5-9) also should play a lot.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: "I'd like to say that we should (be either) first or second in  league," Sims said. "We're going to play a very tough preseason and that should  help us down the line."  </P> <P> </P> <P> St. Bonaventure  </P> <P> COACH: Marc Groff, 8th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 9-13; 3rd in league, 4-6  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Youth and inexperience abound on a team that has one senior  and includes two sophomores and a freshman. Forward Todd Tushla (6-1), the lone  senior and returning letterman, averaged 7.5 points and 4.5 rebounds in limited  action last season. Junior Max Romero (6-1) will be the other forward and  sophomore John McNamara (6-2) will be at center. Juniors Jeff Wright (6-0) and  Gary Hubbard (6-0) will be at guard. Wright and Tushla are the team's  three-point shot specialists. Peter Houston (6-0), quarterback for the football  team, will be given significant playing time off the bench. "We're going to try  to mix it up and play pressure, full-court man defense," Groff said, "but we're  going to be controlled and run a set offense."  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: St. Bonaventure has qualified for the playoffs five years in a row and  Groff believes the team is capable of continuing the streak. "We're a young  team and virtually inexperienced," he said. "Realistically, we'll be shooting  for third behind Carpinteria and Bishop Diego."  </P></p>

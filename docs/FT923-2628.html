			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Federal Express profits fall 29% in first quarter DETERIORATING results in its home market caused Federal Express, the largest overnight delivery company, to report a 29 per cent profits fall in its first quarter. In the three months to end-August, Fedex said it made Dollars 12.25m after tax, compared with Dollars 17.2m a year earlier. Turnover was Dollars 1.86bn, little changed on last year's Dollars 1.82bn. The Memphis-based company has been bedevilled by losses on its international side and has therefore relied on its core domestic operations. It released the results late on Monday, after stock markets had closed. Yesterday, trading in its shares was delayed at the outset, and by the close the price was Dollars 36 7/8 , down Dollars 2 7/8 . The international business showed an improvement in the first quarter. Operating losses were down to Dollars 57.1m on revenues of Dollars 523m, compared with Dollars 98.1m and Dollars 573m a year ago. Fedex said this was partly due to a Dollars 12.5m reduction in estimated settlement costs from its previously-announced European restructuring. However, Fedex said the profitability of domestic op-erations had fallen 'well below last year's level as declines in yields have recently outpaced our ability to reduce costs'. Average US domestic revenue per package had fallen 10 per cent year-on-year, the company said. It blamed the weak economy; discounting of rates; a switch by customers from next-morning deliveries to cheaper next-afternoon or two-day deliveries; and a similar growth of high-volume, higher-discount deliveries versus less-frequent shippers. Overall, operating profits fell from Dollars 75.2m to Dollars 73.5m. The company warned that pressure on domestic profit margins would continue 'at least through the second quarter', with results being below previous expectations. On the international side, it said there should be an improvement over the Dollars 69.6m loss recorded in the second quarter of 1991.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUFACTURING GROWTH OF .9% FORECAST FOR '91;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR'S PERFORMANCE WILL CONTINUE TO LAG THAT OF THE  SERVICE SECTOR, THE GOVERNMENT PREDICTS. EXPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE STRONG,  HOWEVER.  </P> <P> Industry will continue to grow slowly in 1991 as export activity helps to  counteract economic weakness at home, the Commerce Department said Sunday.  </P> <P> Overall, the manufacturing sector will grow 0.9% next year, compared to about  1% this year, the department said in its annual Industrial Outlook, which  covers 350 U.S. industries.  </P> <P> The manufacturing sector has been slumping for some time, and Michael Farren,  undersecretary for international trade, said service industries will continue  to outperform the manufacturing sector next year.  </P> <P> In the latest sign of manufacturing weakness, the Commerce Department said  orders for big-ticket durable goods plunged a record-tying 10.5% in November.  Such weakness is seen as evidence that the economy has entered a recession that  is expected to last at least through the first quarter.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Commerce Department survey shows plenty of bright spots in  the manufacturing sector.  </P> <P> High-technology industries will continue to do well, particularly computers and  semiconductors, the report said.  </P> <P> Among other fast-growing industries, the report listed surgical and medical  material, medicines, poultry processing, aircraft, dental equipment and  supplies.  </P> <P> Those expected to lose ground include mobile homes, boat building and repair,  creamery butter and frozen bakery products, motors and generators, sawmills and  electric housewares.  </P> <P> "Exports will provide an important source of vitality for many industries,  partially counteracting weaknesses in other elements of the U.S. economy,"  Farren said.  </P> <P> Other projected growth areas include aircraft, engines and parts, and machine  tools.  </P> <P> Of machine tools, Farren said: "This is an indication that businesses will  continue to invest in new equipment needed to raise efficiency and productivity  in today's increasingly competitive environment."  </P> <P> More than 60% of the industries surveyed should grow, and they represent about  75% of all manufacturers, Farren said.  </P> <P> But, "on the negative side, two major segments of the economy -- construction  and motor vehicles -- are again expected to decline," he said.  </P> <P> Those weaknesses would affect the economy broadly. They have a slowing  influence on steel, building materials, household durables, wood products and  other industries.  </P> <P> Farren predicted that the 1990 trade deficit will be $105 billion -- and 1991's  shortfall about the same -- due to higher oil prices triggered by the Persian  Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> The 1989 deficit was $109 billion.  </P> <P> Farren said the department estimated overall 1991 growth at 1% to 3%, with the  mostly likely outcome 1.3% to 1.4%.  </P> <P> The Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development recently  projected U.S. growth for 1991 at 0.9%.  </P></p>

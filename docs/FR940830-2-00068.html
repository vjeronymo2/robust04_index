L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SDS program is a program of grants to health professions and nursing schools for the purpose of assisting such schools in providing scholarships to individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds who are enrolled (or accepted for enrollment) as full-time students in the schools, as well as to undergraduate students who have demonstrated a commitment to pursuing a career in health professions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The law requires that in providing SDS scholarships, the school give preference to students who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and for whom the cost of attending an SDS school would constitute a severe financial hardship. Severe financial hardship will be determined by the school in accordance with standard need analysis procedures prescribed by the Department of Education for its Federal student aid programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Funding Preference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A proposed funding preference was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on June 20, 1994, at 59 FR 31643, for public comment. Three comments were received during the 30-day comment period which were in support of the proposed funding preference. One commentor called attention to congressional report language which directs the Department to give highest priority, among allied health applicants, to dental hygiene programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accord with the Congress' directive, the final funding preference will be revised as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For fiscal year 1994, among allied health schools or programs, preference will be given to the following baccalaureate and graduate programs: dental hygiene, medical laboratory technology, occupational therapy, physical therapy and radiologic technology. The priority for dental hygiene will be implemented by taking the total funds allocated to the allied health disciplines in the initial allocation and recalculating this part of the allocation. Dental hygiene schools will receive double credit for their disadvantaged enrollments in the reallocation of the allied health funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Programmatic questions should be directed to: Mr. Bruce Baggett, Chief, Student and Institutional Support Branch, Division of Student Assistance, Bureau of Health Professions, Health Resources and Services Administration, Parklawn Building, Room 8&hyph;34, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, Maryland 20857, Telephone: (301) 443&hyph;4776, FAX: (301) 594&hyph;6911. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Number for the Scholarships for Disadvantaged Students program is 93.925.

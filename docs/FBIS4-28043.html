			<p>BFN     [Text] THE Supreme Command spokesman denied yesterday that  the military was contemplating any move in the face of the  current political tensions in the country.    Spokesman Lt Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, however, confirmed  that a group of Thai military officers met in Hong Kong recently  to discuss the current political situation.    "They did talk about politics but it did not amount to  anything concrete," Anuson said.    Anuson was commenting on a press report that a group of  senior military officers met secretly in Hong Kong early this  week as domestic political tensions grew over Chalat Worachat's  hunger strike.    "It was a coincidence," Anuson said of the Hong Kong  meeting.  The spokesman insisted that the military was not making any move  in response to the political situation.    "The military just monitors the political situation. But it  has no intention of making any move."    Anuson said the military believed that despite the tensions  the political situation "poses no concerns". "There is nothing  of concern yet. We don't anticipate any violence," he said.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Gummer set for row with developers: Environment minister acts to curb supply of rural land for new houses Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, has moved to restrict the supply of development land in one of the country's most sought-after housing markets. His intervention comes as the government struggles to recapture its traditional supporters in southern England, many of whom oppose further housing development in rural areas. However, Mr Gummer's action will anger housebuilders who have warned that a shortage of development sites is pushing up housing land prices. Environment department officials have suggested to Berkshire county council that the government would prefer it to limit the supply of housing land in its forthcoming structure plan to 40,000 homes between 1991 and 2006. This is one-sixth less than the 48,000 homes recommended by DoE inspectors following a public inquiry last year. The intervention is non-binding but is understood to reflect Mr Gummer's desire to strike a balance between the needs of development and of protecting the countryside. Berkshire councillors, who had proposed a lower development limit of 37,000 homes, will meet next week to discuss the department's letter. The structure plan is due to go to a meeting of the local authority's environment committee for approval next month. Mr Gummer may then overrule the council's plan. The issue is regarded as a 'landmark planning decision' by the Housebuilders' Federation, which proposed a development target of 52,000 homes. It will be the most controversial structure plan to be endorsed since the introduction of the 1991 Planning and Compensation Act which gave more power to local authorities to determine planning issues. The outcome in Berkshire, housebuilders say, will set the tone for future structure plans drawn up by other county councils. Pressure for residential developments in southern England is expected to increase as the housing market recovers. The federation has warned that a shortage of development sites has already pushed housing land prices up by 50 per cent in the south-east during the past year - 'stoking inflationary pressures in the rest of the economy'. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, which supported Berkshire's limit of 37,000 homes, is also likely to be dissatisfied with the 40,000 figure, which it says does not recognise environmental damage. The need for the Tories to regain ground in southern England was highlighted in last month's local elections when they won only 27 per cent of the overall vote - the same figure as the Liberal Democrats who are seen by local electors as being strong on environmental issues.

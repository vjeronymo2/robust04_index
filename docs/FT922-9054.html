			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Wine: Montrachet's cosmic dust - Jancis Robinson meets a new female force in the world of wine FOR THE organic wine movement Anne-Claude Leflaive must be the best thing to have happened so far. Or perhaps the second best thing after this year's saga of illegal chemical traces in various Italian wines. Organic, ecologically-conscious vine cultivation has been increasing in recent years, but mainly on the fringes of the wine world. Anne-Claude Leflaive, new co-manager of the world-famous Domaine Leflaive in Puligny-Montrachet, is so far the only world-famous wine producer in Bordeaux or Burgundy publicly to embrace what to many seem self-evident principles of planet protection. Her new system for Leflaive's enviable spread of top quality vineyards is not just any old organic one, but the Steiner-inspired biodynamie, which integrates wholly natural treatments with the movements of the cosmos. A warm, frank woman of 36, she is the eldest child of the courtly Vincent who ran the Domaine Leflaive until serious illness in 1989 took him away from the day-to-day decisions he shared with his nephew Olivier (who also runs the separate wine merchant business Olivier Leflaive Freres). Burgundian inheritance laws are famously complicated; Anne-Claude gives the impression that the US presidential race is relatively clean-cut compared to the question of Vincent's succession. But in June 1990 she finally managed to convince her family, as well as herself, that this was the job she had been seeking all her life. Now she has managed to solve one of the potential problems (by living near Nuits-St-Georges rather than Dijon where her engineer-husband works) even if she has substituted another (her third child is expected in August). She had for years 'done the vintage' at the Domaine, and even spent the freezing winter of 1989 in the vineyards there immersing herself in the all-important soil, as well as forging links with the vineyard staff that were to stand her in good stead when she came to apply her new methods. 'I think I am very tied to this village,' she admits with proud resignation. Even when she took a sabbatical sailing trip round the Caribbean with her husband and children, she claims, 'all the time I was thinking of the vines'. Her rapport with the Domaine's dedicated and reserved winemaker Pierre Morey, and with Olivier, mean that she can spend a high proportion of her four days a week in those vineyards - to which has just been added the final piece in Leflaive's jigsaw puzzle of grands crus, an extremely expensive pocket handkerchief of the most famous white burgundy vineyard of all, about a fifth of an acre, or Pounds 600,000 worth, of fully mature vines in Le Montrachet itself. 'If only Leflaive had some Montrachet,' has long been a refrain of the world's wine enthusiasts, eager to see the Domaine's incomparably elegant style of winemaking applied to the greatest vineyard of all. There will not be much to show - hardly 30 cases of 1991, picked by Anne-Claude and Pierre Morey themselves last October - but even in a recession they can presumably expect some help with the interest payments when the wine is finally offered for sale or, more likely, allocated, at around Pounds 200 a bottle. I asked how Vincent, who still occupies his vast desk in the Domaine's handsome first floor office, had reacted to his daughter's conversion to cow dung, camomile, nettles and the lunar cycle and was surprised to hear 'He is a hundred times more convinced than I am. I always have a image of my father sitting outside after dinner looking up at the stars. I think he understands their language.' For Anne-Claude the revelation came at a lecture given by the appropriately named Claude Bourguignon, warning that the soil of Burgundy had become so worn out by over-application of fertilisers, pesticides and fungicides that it was effectively nearly dead. Since then she has organised a conference for fellow Burgundian producers, as well as a pilgrimage to see organic vineyards such as Huet's in Vouvray. She is convinced it was the rugged rationality of former maths teacher Noel Pinguet of Huet that convinced so many of her neighbours that the principles were sound. They are yet to put them into practice but some, such as Christophe Roumier of Domaine Georges Roumier and Pascal Marchand at Clos des Epeneaux are moving in that direction. Certainly, there is many a Burgundian peasant who still bottles his wine according the moon and the wind, so the region should be more biodynamically receptive than, say, Bordeaux where fewer decision-makers actually get their hands dirty. It is far too early to be sure of the results of the Leflaive experiment on a selected two and a half acres, although Anne-Claude notes that the all-important yield is reduced, the vine leaves and soil already look quite different and she thinks she can detect more direct flavours in the fruit. Some Leflaive fans may worry that the famous elegance could be compromised by this new regime. But, as Simon Loftus points out in his fascinating new book Puligny-Montrachet (Pounds 19.99 Ebury Press) evolution is inevitable and we should rejoice in the 'one essential continuum in the history of Domaine Leflaive, the passion for quality.' Anne-Claude's medium-term ambition is certainly appropriate to a continuum - to establish what is literally a co-operative compost heap in Puligny - and she describes it with real animation: 'Like in the Middle Ages when they recycled everything. It was fantastic in the Middle Ages, you know, even for women. I think I should have lived in the Middle Ages.' Leflaive's white burgundies can be bought, at Pounds 20 (and up) a bottle, from merchants such as Adnams of Southwold, John Armit of London W11, Corney &amp; Barrow of EC1 and Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester.</p>

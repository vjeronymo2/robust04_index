			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Arts: A Rooster on top of the pops - Why Britain's flagship modern dance company is being sent to the breakers' yard Looking at London Contemporary Dance Theatre on Tuesday night at the beginning of its autumn season, I saw again what I have been seeing for 20 years: a superlative dance ensemble. When the company came into being at the end of the 1960s it was sometimes raw but always eager, always intensely committed. Across the next decade standards of physical attainment - stunning skill; whole-hearted and whole-spirited energy - were testimony to the guiding presence of Robert Cohan and the spiritual concern of Robin Howard, who had made the enterprise possible. After ten years the company was a world-beater. Since then it has, astonishingly, improved, in matter of physical finesse, and adaptability to the demands of many choreographers. (Works by Martha Graham and Paul Taylor most honourably done; Cohan's choreographies perfectly shown; pieces by Richard Alston, Siobhan Davies, and others - all products of the organisation - given transcendent execution.) Now, for reasons which are not as clear and straightforward as press-releases and apologists would have us believe, the troupe is to be reduced in size. Britain's flag-ship modern dance troupe is to be sent to the breakers' yard, to be replaced by a smaller ensemble under Richard Alston, as part of a 'National Centre for Contemporary Dance'. Alston's appointment is good news. It is more curious that the Rambert Dance Company (from which Alston was summarily removed last December) is to be expanded to 25 dancers, with an orchestra, and is reportedly to become a 'neo-classic' group adapted to the work of its forthcoming director Christopher Bruce, and also supposed to be capable of playing a Balanchinian repertory. (Hmm]) The dismantling of a superlative company, the fruit of an unrivalled school, in favour of a new unproved ensemble, is policy gone mad. The Luddites are in charge. It is even more ironic that the greatest success LCDT has on its hands (and ebullient feet) at the moment is Christopher Bruce's Rooster. First made for the Geneva Ballet, it takes as its text awful songs by the Rolling Stones, but explores them in dances of whizzing vitality which LCDT bring off in fire-cracker style. It came as a wonderful end to a programme in which the dancers rescued two less than convincing pieces. Aletta Collins' Shoes is indeed about shoes - multi-coloured, clunky, better off than on. There is a score of abrasive minimalism by Steve Martland (well played by a group under Nicholas Mojsejenko) and stylish design by Tom Cairns. The cast are in street clothes; the theme  - I suppose - suggests that shoes are conformist, and that we are better off bare-foot. It is all rather flaccid, and terminally long. But when Miss Collins lets her cast dance, the steps fly, and we see how amazingly gifted the troupe is - elegant in means, formidable in prowess, absolute and loving servants of their text. They make the piece exhilarating. Nothing, no-one, can make the other novelty, a ripe piece of Euro-trash, bearable. It is entitled Sand Skin (no explanation given, though an addled programme note talks about 'mutations necessary for the survival of a species'), and it is by the French-based Angelin Preljocaj. Fourteen dancers are hideously garbed. (Caroline Antenski has concocted what look like failed unisex underclothes in funereal black; tights that are more hole than fabric; black shoes) and behave morosely. They may be in quest of a cure for the steps, or merely exercising their psyches. They do their grand best, but look very sad indeed, and I do not blame them. Fortunately Rooster restores them to life. This is given with glorious vitality, a throw-away bravura and a muscular sophistication - the impossible made not only easy but witty - that explains exactly why this great company (and I use the words advisedly) should not be sacrificed to policy. There have been mis-routings in recent years with LCDT - failures in artistic direction - but the troupe is a national treasure. We do not have anything comparable. There is nothing comparable in Europe. To sacrifice it on the altar of expediency and a chimeric re-organisation is criminal. Policy can be altered. To alter the company will be to deny its history - LCDT and its School made possible the whole modern dance movement in this country - its splendid present, and its potential for the future of dance in Britain.</p>

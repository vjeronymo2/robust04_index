			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Exclusive" program] </F>   [Text] The Latin American Economic System [SELA] on 3 June  condemned the U.S. blockade of Cuba during the closing of its  20th ministerial council in Mexico City. A resolution to  promote the integration of Cuba, Suriname, and the Dominican  Republic into the association of Caribbean states, scheduled to  meet in Barbados in July, was also made. The 27 nations that  make up SELA stated unanimously that free trade contributes to  the economic development and well-being of the people. They  also stressed the convenience of strengthening commercial  relations in the hemisphere. They reject the implementation of  unilateral measures that could affect international free trade  and urge that the economic, commercial, and financial blockade  of Cuba be lifted and manifest their support of the U.N.  resolution on the issue. This is the first time since its  creation in 1975 that SELA adopts an energetic attitude against  the United States' hostile policy toward Cuba.</p>

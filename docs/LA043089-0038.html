			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN "A" FOR THE CRITIC  </P> <P> Poor Jayne Simon (Letters, April 16). She gives critic Dan Sullivan an "F" for  his comment that Los Angeles actors need "a Brit . . . who will teach them how  to speak Shakespeare in American." Then she asks how could splendid  performances already given in this area be "improved by an English accent?"  </P> <P> Ask any responsible high school drama teacher preparing for the annual  Shakespeare Festival here about working to rid students of phony, stagey  British accents and of fighting to get them to love the words and really say  the words. The Bard was a poet!  </P> <P> Too bad Ms. Simon doesn't understand that Dan Sullivan knows that and was not  talking about laying on accents.  </P> <P> JOAN PETERSON  </P> <P> Drama teacher  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

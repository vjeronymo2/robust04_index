			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Oscar Eid Franco, president of the Movement of the  Revolutionary Left [MIR], this morning reported an attempt to  abduct and arrest former Susana Seleme, former President Jaime  Paz Zamora's private secretary.    Eid Franco also confirmed that former President Paz Zamora  testified as a witness before the military court in Tarija in  connection with the TAB [Bolivian Transportation Airline] case  on the alleged irregular purchase of five aircraft during his  government.    [Begin Eid recording] I want to confirm that at 1700 on 3  March at his residence (?El Picacho), Jaime Paz Zamora was  questioned as a witness by the Supreme Military Court regarding  the TAB case. This legal procedure was fulfilled on 3 March and  the Military Court already has the necessary information at hand.    I also would like to protest and report the attempt to  abduct  and arrest fellow partisan Susana Seleme on 3 March in Santa  Cruz, a procedure that fully violates our laws. We regret this  sort of thing happening in democracy, especially because we  already have asked Congress to carry out an investigation.  Therefore, these procedures only mar the image of our  organization because the only information valid for the adoption  of legal measures then will be from an investigation. [end  recording]</p>

Managers who took part in the annual meeting on general  merchandise, which closed here few days ago, said they believed  that competition in the market will become more intense. As a  result, the companies engaged in retail and wholesale will have  to adjust their business structures and change their management  mechanisms.    Over the past few years many of the state-owned wholesale  companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou have made  great achievements in broadening their business scopes and  shifting their management mechanisms, according to the meeting.    Among the more than 300 members of the national general  merchandise association, 46 retail and wholesale companies have  so far adopted the joint stock system, and 16 have been listed  on the country's stock exchanges.</p>

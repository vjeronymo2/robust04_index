			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Taiwan promised liberalised markets: New central bank governor wants to make island a regional financial centre Taiwan's new central bank governor, Mr Liang Kuo-shu, took over yesterday with a pledge to liberalise Taiwanese financial markets with the aim of transforming the island into a regional financial centre during his five-year term. He promised to push on with reforms in order to upgrade Taiwan's regulatory framework and bring more foreign financial institutions, capital and expertise into the country. Mr Liang - who in his previous position as chairman of Chiao Tung Bank, a state-owned development institution, last year scuppered a planned joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace to produce short-haul passenger jets - vowed to boost lending to local manufacturing and industry. The accession of Mr Liang, 63, who holds a doctorate in economics from Vanderbilt University in the US, to the top banking job is viewed favourably by analysts and bankers. His experience in commercial banking was acquired during stints at the helm of each of the three leading state-run commercial banks. Mr Liang also served as deputy central bank governor from 1975 to 1979. Known for speaking his mind, Mr Liang might have become central bank governor several years ago had he not made enemies along the way. Soft-spoken but strong-willed, he is likened by one financial sector operator in Taipei to a 'thunderstorm' when angered. His predecessor, Mr Samuel Shieh, at times become embroiled in public stand-offs with the Finance Ministry and other government agencies. However, Mr Liang has close personal ties to President Lee Teng-hui, under whose auspices the central bank falls. He has been a financial adviser to Mr Lee for some time. Mr Liang's wife, Ms Hou Chin-ying, is an economics professor and belongs to one of Taiwan's most influential families. Analysts cautioned that while Mr Liang was firmly in the camp of the reformers, it would be difficult to change quickly the thinking of the central bank bureaucracy. Saying that 'we have to invite more international financial institutions to introduce more financial products to Taiwan', Mr Liang told a news conference yesterday: 'To do so, we have to accelerate revising many out-of-date rules and establish new systems to attract them. 'The first step is to expand our foreign exchange market as a regional funding centre.'</p>

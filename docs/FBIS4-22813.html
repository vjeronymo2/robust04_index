Kargin, Polytechnical Institute,  Stavropol; UDC546.47'221+539.216.2]    [Abstract] Growing interest in zinc sulfide as a material  for use in optical-electrical devices precipitated the problem  of preparing this substance having the required properties of  microcrystallinity, departure from stoichiometry, content of  basic substances, etc. In the present work a study was made of  the effects of some technological factors on the properties of  zinc sulfide films and the possibility of regulating their  physical chemical properties during the growth process. Thus the  rate of zinc sulfide formation at constant magnetic field  stress, was found to be significantly affected by the presence  of iron impurities in the solution. Also, the strength of the  magnetic field affects the structure of the water and the zinc  salt complex becomes a factor. As the field strength increases,  old structures break down and new ones are formed. Increasing  the concentration of iron ions in the solution only increases  the overall rate of the reaction. Particle size data on zinc  sulfide powders shows that raising the pH from 11.40 to 11.44  results in a marked improvement in structure and mirror finish  of the film.

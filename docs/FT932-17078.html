			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Technology: PCs obey the spoken word - Worth Watching Personal computers which carry out spoken commands have largely proved expensive and unreliable. Applied Voice Technologies (AVT), of London, has developed a speaker- dependent system which can be used with Windows software and costs Pounds 250 for the board, software and microphone. By voicing words such as 'save' or 'exit' the user can work through commands which would take several seconds to execute using the standard mouse. VoiceServer can store 1,000 words for each user and can search a list of 300 words for any single window. AVT: UK, 071 454 1224.</p>

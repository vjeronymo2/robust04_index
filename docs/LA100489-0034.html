			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK LOAN PROGRAM IRKS GOLDEN MALL SHOPKEEPERS  </P> <P> The Burbank City Council agreed Tuesday night to provide financial assistance  to Golden Mall merchants, many of whom say they have lost as much as half of  their business since construction work began to reopen the mall to vehicle  traffic.  </P> <P> But some of the merchants complained that the program was "too little, too  late."  </P> <P> The council voted 5 to 0 to appropriate $25,000 to fund the low-interest loan  program. The money is intended to help shopkeepers restock their shelves for  the Christmas holiday season or to make needed repairs or improvements to their  businesses.  </P> <P> The Golden Mall, which stretches from Olive Avenue to Magnolia Boulevard, is in  the heart of a downtown area targeted for redevelopment by the city. The mall  has been closed to traffic since 1967. The $2.1-million street reopening  project, which began in May, is scheduled to be completed by Oct. 20.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Revitalized Downtown'  </P> <P> "I think this is a good program," said Councilman Thomas E. Flavin before the  vote. "It will provide businesses with an opportunity to upgrade and become  part of a revitalized downtown."  </P> <P> But several of the 50 merchants along the mall on San Fernando Road said that  the loan requirements are too stringent and that they will not participate in  the program.  </P> <P> "I've talked to all the people that were originally for a loan program, and not  a single one is going to take advantage of this particular package," said  Vernon Michel, owner of Michel's Records and Tapes. "It wouldn't make good  business sense."  </P> <P> Michel and other merchants said the main problem with the program is that it  requires that they apply for a minimum loan of $5,000 or a maximum of $10,000,  to be paid back within 12 months.  </P> <P> "With a monthly payment of $700 or more, it would be more of a burden than a  help," Michel said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assistance Plan  </P> <P> Alan Goodstein, vice president of Morey's Shoes, agreed that the assistance  plan was "too little too late. This was the least they could come up with. They  don't care about the mall merchants. They just want the big developers to come  in here, and that's it."  </P> <P> City Treasurer Jim Rogers said merchants who want to take advantage of the  program would be required to apply for a loan from one of eight participating  banks in the city.  </P> <P> "If the bank approves the loan, we would then buy down the interest rate to 8%  and pay any loan fees," Rogers said.  </P> <P> If a loan were not approved, the city would consider providing a guarantee of  repayment upon review of the borrower's application by the City Treasurer's  Finance Committee, Rogers said.  </P></p>

			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Sinn Fein rules out unionist veto on unity The prospects for peace in Northern Ireland appeared to be receding yesterday after Sinn Fein toughened its terms and Mr John Major, the prime minister, again refused republican demands for 'clarification'. In a toughly worded interview Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, ruled out a unionist veto on constitutional change, and demanded British action to 'persuade' unionists to accept Irish unity. Mr Adams told The Observer newspaper that 'the unionists will not move, and we cannot expect them to move, until the British persuade them to. They have no right of a veto over any policy'. His comments suggest a hardening of the Sinn Fein response to the Anglo-Irish joint declaration on Northern Ireland, which gives the unionists an explicit veto on constitutional change. However, Mr Adams also acknowledged that a united Ireland could not be achieved without the participation of the unionist majority in Northern Ireland. In a separate statement issued in Belfast, Mr Adams repeated demands for 'clarification' of the joint declaration, which offers Sinn Fein a place at the negotiating table within three months of a permanent IRA ceasefire. The statement said Mr Major's refusal to clarify the declaration was 'an abdication of his responsibilities and a clear indication that he has no real commitment to building the peace process'. It said Sinn Fein was prepared to 'assist' Mr Major to bring about peace. 'The sooner he stops play-acting and stringing this out, the sooner we can all move towards an end to conflict and towards a new beginning.' Downing Street said a letter setting out Sinn Fein's request for clarification had not been received. But Mr Major made clear that no clarification would be offered. Mr Major told Sir David Frost on BBC Television that he was prepared to wait 'for a little while' for a definitive republican response to the joint declaration. But he said the government would not be 'drawn into negotiations by the back door' by responding to questions from Sinn Fein in advance of a permanent IRA ceasefire. 'What at present is going on is that they are seeking to muddy (the) issue, to enter into negotiations effectively without giving up violence,' he said. 'That is not on offer. They do have to give up violence and then the way forward to a democratic future is perfectly clear, and the way forward for them to get into the talks about the democratic future for Northern Ireland is perfectly clear.' Mr Major said the three-stranded talks process between London, Dublin and Belfast, which began in 1992, would be intensified whatever Sinn Fein's response to the joint declaration.</p>

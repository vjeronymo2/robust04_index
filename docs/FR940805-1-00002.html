Key provisions of this proposed regulation include: lengthening the allowable loan period for insured and guaranteed electric loans for distribution, transmission, and improvements to generation facilities to 4 years; clarifying REA requirements for supplemental financing concurrent with municipal rate loans; substantially modifying the requirement that borrowers develop and maintain certain levels of equity; and clearly setting forth the documents required for a complete loan application. This regulation is intended to facilitate the application process for borrowers and reduce administrative costs to the government. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments must be received by REA or carry a postmark or equivalent by October 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments should be addressed to Sue Arnold, Program Support Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Electrification Administration, room 2230&hyph;s, 14th Street and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500.

The Administrator of REA has determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .) does not apply to this proposed rule. The Administrator of REA has determined that this rule will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment as defined by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> .). Therefore, this action does not require an environmental impact statement or assessment. The program described by this proposed rule is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs under number 10.850 Rural Electrification Loans and Loan Guarantees. This catalog is available on a subscription basis from the Superintendent of Documents, the United States Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402&hyph;9325. This proposed rule is excluded from the scope of Executive Order 12372, Intergovernmental Consultation, which may require consultation with State and local officials. A Notice of Final Rule titled Department Programs and Activities Excluded from Executive Order 12372 (50 FR 47034) exempts REA electric loans and loan guarantees from coverage under this Order. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. If adopted, this proposed rule: (1) Will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule; (2) Will not have any retroactive effect; and (3) Will not require administrative proceedings before any parties may file suit challenging the provisions of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Information Collection and Recordkeeping Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing recordkeeping and reporting burdens contained in this proposed rule were approved by OMB pursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .), under control numbers 0572&hyph;0017, 0572&hyph;0032, and 0572&hyph;0103.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

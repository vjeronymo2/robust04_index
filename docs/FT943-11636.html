			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Kimberly-Clark choose UK for European headquarters Kimberly-Clark, the US consumer products group, is to locate its European headquarters in the UK after investigating sites in the Netherlands, France and Belgium, Andrew Taylor writes. The company is to consolidate its existing European offices in Paris, the Hague and in Tonbridge, Kent in one building. It has eight factories in the UK, two in France, two in Germany and one in the Netherlands. One of the attractions of the UK is thought to be labour costs, estimated to be a third of those at continental locations. Kimberly-Clark has appointed property consultants Grimley J R Eve to find premises to accommodate more than 500 staff around the south and west of London between the M23 and A3. The company will consider building a headquarters on a greenfield site if a suitable building cannot be found. It said the UK was attractive because of international schools and access to international airports at Gatwick and Heathrow.</p>

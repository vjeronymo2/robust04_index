			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Pulling together for UK agriculture - Renewed drive to capture a greater share of the domestic market BETTER management; better budgeting and better marketing; 'these three, but the greatest of these is better marketing'. Such have been the texts on which sermons to British farmers have been preached for generations. But the truth is that most British farmers are far more interested in better production. History has conditioned us to derive satisfaction from growing bigger and better crops and from persuading cows to give more milk and hens to lay more eggs. The UK has always been in deficit for food; always relied on imports, first from the empire and more recently also from the European Community. Indeed at the start of the Second World War Britain produced only 30 per cent of its food at home. Today domestic production represents about 55 per cent of total food requirements - 70 per cent of what could be produced in the British climate. The improvement is a direct result of government encouragement, over many years, to expand home production and help the balance of trade. But there is still a substantial food trade gap - the difference in value between what is imported and exported, which Food From Britain, the government-sponsored promotional organisation, has put at more than Pounds 5.5bn. Of that well over half could be produced at home. In recent years, as the urge to grow more has been modified, the food and drink trade gap has grown to record the highest ratio of imports of any major economic sector. And an increasing proportion of those imports have been coming from other northern European EC countries. In other words they mainly consist of commodities produced under similar climatic conditions to those of the UK and could just as easily have been produced here. The question is why are British consumers buying foreign food? One of the main reasons is undoubtedly the comparative lack of marketing expertise and organisation in the UK agricultural sector. Farmers in competing countries, like Holland, Denmark and France, which have relied on agricultural exports for many years, were long ago forced to co-operate to bulk up commodities for overseas sales. Many of these have since merged to become powerful marketing organisations able to supply UK retail chains with large quantities of produce to agreed specifications. As British supermarkets grew to control more than two-thirds of all food purchases and their buyers became more demanding, individual growers and the UK's much smaller co-operatives increasingly found themselves losing sales to the continental producers. It was not that the foreign food was necessary better nor that it it always cheaper, but it could be supplied in sufficient bulk to be spread, in identical form, around hundreds of stores. Hence the growing penetration by EC competitors of the British food market and widespread concern at the trend, which has extended all the way to the prime minister's office. Last week the great and the good of the British farming, food processing and retailing industries gathered at 10 Downing Street for the second time in 15 months to discuss ways of improving opportunities for British food suppliers. Under the chairmanship of the prime minister they determined, among other things, to collaborate to try to source more food from UK producers; to focus Food From Britain's activities on exporting and to assist farmers and growers to become more market orientated. Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union, accepted Mr John Major's invitation to chair a small group to follow up the seminar and to monitor progress. Farmers will wish him and the top level initiative every success. Moreover, at least one supermarket group, Safeway, claims to have switched Pounds 41m worth of purchases from overseas to the UK since the first Downing Street meeting in November 1991. Safeway further states that 82 per cent of the food it retails is now sourced in Britain and that there is potential for a further Pounds 150m worth within three years. The other retail giants are a little more coy about their achievements and plans, but it seems probable that they may be moving in the same direction. They are not philanthropists, however. The pound's devaluation last autumn has mad it much more expensive for them to import and so, for the time being at least, commercial interest coincides with patriotism. Meanwhile the fundamental marketing deficiencies of British agriculture remain: the lack of organisations big enough to apply real leverage against the retail giants and a piecemeal approach to promotion and quality assurance. Whether it is a realistic objective even to try to build groups to match the strength of the supermarkets is doubtful. As someone pointed out at a farming conference a few days ago, to be equal in turnover to Sainsbury alone it would be necessary to control 20m acres - half the UK. A potential marketing strategy which has never been fully exploited, however, might be to promote the real qualities of British food in a co-ordinated way so that it became natural and automatic for consumers to buy items that were home produced. Attempts at this have been made before. Food From Britain, for instance, launched 'quality certified' British food a few years ago. That was inadequately focused and did not take off. The NFU came up with its 'Food From the Countryside' initiative in 1991, but it too has failed to make a significant impact. And there are dozens of individual commodity schemes through which producers and retailers are seeking to gain commercial advantage by advertising some special assurance of quality. They are all too small, however, to impress the busy housewife and most of the limited cash available for such schemes is being wasted. What is required is a strategy to ensure the quality of UK produced food and to promote it to consumers. Effective UK policing of EC regulations already means that the quality and safety of British food is equal to or above that of most competitors, even though this fact is largely unrecognised by the public. It is high time capital was made from this superiority and all supermarkets fulfilled their collaborative assurances to the prime minister and submerged their own-brand marketing ploys on behalf of farmers and the nation. They should co-operate to initiate a nationally co-ordinated strategy involving all those represented at 10 Downing Street last week and many others. It should establish production criteria acceptable to consumers. It should set standards for ethical, responsible and safe methods by which food should be produced. And it should provide a system of verification that the quality standards being claimed are achieved. It would not be easy, because of factional interests. But the reward for attempting it could be a truly integrated British food industry serving the interests of the government, the farmers and the consumers.</p>

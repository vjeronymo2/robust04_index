			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HOFFMAN PROBE WON'T REOPEN  </P> <P> The Bucks County coroner, ignoring calls from citizens groups, today said he  has no intention of reopening the investigation into the suicide of political  activist Abbie Hoffman.  </P> <P> The Citizens Commission on Human Rights and the Prozac Survivors Support Group  -- both offshoots of the Church of Scientology -- had asked the coroner to  reopen the case after it was learned Hoffman took the controversial  anti-depressant Prozac six weeks before his death.  </P> <P> Dr. Thomas Rosko ruled that Hoffman committed suicide on April 12, 1989, in  Solebury Township by taking an overdose of the sedative phenobarbital and  alcohol.  </P> <P> Hoffman, 52, had filled a prescription for Prozac before his death, but Rosko's  autopsy did not find any traces of the drug.  </P> <P> A Harvard study published in February found that 3 1/2% of Prozac users  developed suicidal thoughts that lasted up to three months after taking the  drug.  </P></p>

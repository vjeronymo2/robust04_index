			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Observer: Aspirational Headhunters' delight on the Mexican job market these days is Pedro Aspe, Mexico's long-standing finance minister left out of Ernesto Zedillo's new cabinet, seemingly at his own behest. Aspe, who had aspired to Zedillo's job himself, is apparently being courted, for a lucrative 10-year contract, by Mexican plutocrat Roberto Hernandez, who runs the Banamex financial group. Aspe's availability is also engendering a certain amount of excitement on Wall Street - though it is not known if he would condescend to work for the gringos. In any event, Aspe has not, unlike many of his predecessors, left office fabulously wealthy. So a few years on a chunky salary would presumably be welcome - allowing him, for instance, to trade up from the holiday time share he has in Puerto Vallarta.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMISKEY PARK HEADS INTO FINAL INNING;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: AFTER SUNDAY'S GAME, THE NEXT BALL IN THE OLDEST STADIUM IN THE MAJOR  LEAGUES WILL BE THE WRECKING BALL.  </P> <P> At 80 years, Comiskey Park is the oldest major-league ballpark and the only one  remaining where Cy Young pitched. It is where Babe Ruth homered to win the  first All-Star game and Bob Feller pitched the only opening day no-hitter.  </P> <P> Cherish such memories, though, because after Sunday's game between the Seattle  Mariners and the Chicago White Sox, the next ball seen in Comiskey Park will be  a wrecking ball.  </P> <P> The "Baseball Palace of the World," as it was touted when built at the corner  of Shields Avenue and 35th Street in 1910, will be razed next month.  </P> <P> A new Comiskey Park -- across 35th Street -- will be completed for next season.  The original will be a parking lot.  </P> <P> "I was the first black to play with the White Sox in 1951," Minnie Minoso said.  "I hit a homer on the first pitch off the Yankees' Vic Raschi. From the first  day, the fans were great. Friendship is like a glass. You have to polish and  protect it or it will be shattered. I'll always think of Comiskey that way,  even after it's gone."  </P> <P> Comiskey Park is one of the great cathedrals of baseball, one of a class that  has dwindled to a precious few. Fenway Park in Boston, Tiger Stadium in Detroit  and Wrigley Field in Chicago's North Side are the only remaining major-league  parks built before World War I.  </P> <P> With Comiskey Park's demise, there will be one fewer link -- like Ebbets Field,  the Polo Grounds, Sportsman's Park, Connie Mack Stadium and Forbes Field -- to  baseball's generations, one less place where history resonates.  </P> <P> Comiskey Park is not revered like Fenway Park with its Green Monster, and it's  not charming like Wrigley Field with its ivy-covered outfield wall.  </P> <P> Comiskey Park is a lunch-pail place, in the South Side.  </P> <P> Forty-one iron girders obstruct the views of fans. The park's electrical,  television, radio, water and life-support systems are an exposed web of  grime-layered membranes hanging from the ceilings. Paint is peeling. Water  seeps through cracks in the five levels of concrete.  </P> <P> These furrows reveal Comiskey's age.  </P> <P> Look beyond these lines to appreciate its uniqueness: The shower and barber  chair: Both are in the center-field bleachers. Pull the chain and get cooling  relief on a scorching day. Or sit and get a shave and haircut while watching  the game.  </P> <P> The center-field scoreboard: Fireworks and smoke spew from the scoreboard and  nine pinwheels whirl after each White Sox homer. In answer to the fireworks in  the early 1960s, New York Yankees' Manager Casey Stengel often would light and  wave sparklers in the dugout after a Yankees' homer.  </P> <P> The scoreboard, built in 1960 under the direction of colorful owner Bill Veeck,  probably will be donated to, or purchased by, a university or college. One of  the reported candidates is Notre Dame.  </P> <P> The clubhouse: "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, Ted Lyons, Luis Aparicio and Billy  Pierce dressed in the closet-like White Sox side. And in the even-smaller  visiting clubhouse, Ruth, Ted Williams, Ty Cobb, Reggie Jackson and Walter  Johnson laced up their spikes.  </P> <P> The spacious dimensions: Originally, the fence was 363 feet down the lines and  420 to center. Today it is 347 down each line -- the longest in the American  League -- and 409 to center.  </P> <P> Minoso looked from the White Sox dugout and said, "You'll always have memories,  but it's time. It's time for a new park."  </P> <P> Engineers say Comiskey is ready to totter. No major park renovations can be  done because it is not structurally sound.  </P> <P> Home plate, the bases and other prized objects will be placed in the White Sox  Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> "Each player is supposed to get a few seats," infielder Steve Lyons says. "I'll  never give them up. I'll pass them on to my children."  </P> <P> The new Comiskey, which rises above its predescessor, will be a baseball-only  grass-field park that will seat 43,000. It will have a new scoreboard in center  field. And yes, it will be an exploding one.  </P></p>

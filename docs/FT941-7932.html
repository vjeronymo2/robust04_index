			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Greece being too quickly criticised over Macedonia (1) Sir, Your editorial, 'Greek disgrace' (February 18), has left at least one Greek reader quite unhappy. Your paper has been too quick to chastise the Greek presidency for the 'affront' to its EU partners on the subject of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). I ask you, who can forget the recent diplomatic blunder both Britain and Germany committed by visiting Turkey without even notifying their Greek partners? How are Greece's EU partners justified in, on the one hand, condemning the country's consistent foreign policies regarding FYROM and, on the other, praising its history and heritage that form the basis of the modern western civilisation? It is, after all, this history and heritage that Greece wishes to defend from the usurpers of the Vergina flag and the Macedonian name. Stabilisation in the region is, indeed, in Greece's interests and everybody hopes for a quick solution on the FYROM problem. However, fuelling EU impatience and 'intense irritation with Greece' and suggesting what the best strategy should be 'for a country so heavily dependent on EU funds' do not, in my opinion, represent constructive criticism. Inflammatory comments and the passing of such judgment do not fit the serious profile of your paper. Nikos Chloros, 46 St Petersburgh Place, London W2 4LD</p>

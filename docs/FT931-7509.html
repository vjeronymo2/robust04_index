			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Escapism, both good and bad - Television Was it not perverse, they say, for the television critic to take a seven-week sabbatical starting on the very day that the new-look ITV was launched? On the face of it that seemed true. Yet abandoning Britain and ITV at the end of December and returning to the old green sofa in mid-February was rather like switching your gaze between two of those 'spot the difference' cartoons: you know there are supposed to have been all sorts of changes, yet you cannot actually see any. Mention this sotto voce to your colleagues and they say 'Well, what about the breakfast stuff? There has been a lot written about that'. They do not say that they have watched and there are differences, mind, merely that there has been a lot written about it, which is true. But then breakfast television on the commercial channels is for pre-school children (hence the toy advertisements). Why would sane adults watch such tosh when they could be reading a decent newspaper or listening to the radio? How many of your friends have enthused over the new look breakfast television? Quite. Well then, say your better informed and more addicted informants, how about the local news? It is true that the presenters of the 10-minute regional news which follows News At 10 look unfamiliar - but then they always did. In common with all the Londoners I know, I have only ever watched this peculiar adjunct by mistake. So much of the national news comes out of the metropolis anyway that it seems contrived to tack on another 10 minutes just because the Scots or the Devonians need the time to keep in touch with their local affairs. Anyway there are precious few interests common to all the millions of Londoners: we would need Kentish Town news or Battersea news to be of any real use. Finally your patient informers begin to name individual series: Head Over Heels, The Good Sex Guide, The Beat and . . . er . . . A Day In The Life. It is true that these programmes (and perhaps there are more, though they do not spring readily to the minds of my acquaintances) have been made by the new companies, but had they been screened by the old ITV nobody would have batted an eyelid. Moreover scores of programmes, the overwhelming majority every night, remain completely unchanged. Tonight's ITV schedule features This Is Your Life, Coronation Street, News At 10 and two old American movies  -scarcely a revolution. Still, tonight's one new programme may, perhaps, be a straw in the wind. It seems that Life is to offer 'factual entertainment' comprising 'a global compendium of human triumphs and tragedies' plus astrology, and, tonight, a tarantula in the studio. In other words, bitty tabloid journalism. True, this column has been charting the increase in such material for a couple of years, but it may well be that the opening of the new ITV will accelerate the process. On Wednesday afternoons Londoners can now watch The Chrystal Rose Show where, we are told, 'audience and guests alike talk about their passions and confess their sins': an English version of The Oprah Winfrey Show, Chrystal Rose being another black woman. The chances of a normal looking, normal sounding, white English male presenter getting a job on any of these new 'infotainment' shows looks pretty slim. Loyd Grossman is going to present The View which promises to 'tackle serious questions of broadcasting policy and politics combined with humour and a genuine enthusiasm for telly trivia' (guess where the emphasis will lie) and Grossman is white and male, but of course he has that Martian accent which puts him in the weirdo category along with people such as Pyke and Bellamy. Life is to be presented by a woman and a black man, and The Good Sex Guide is not so much presented as hurled at us by the blokish Margi Clarke. Yet another series which, from the advance publicity sounds like bitty, tabloid, 'human interest' current affairs material, begins tomorrow evening: 3D. It will be presented by Julia Somerville. So although ITV may not look dramatically different, it does seem as though more and more of its programmes are being aimed at Sun readers, and more and more of its output, even in slots supposedly devoted to journalism, may turn out to be escapist trivia. As 1993 progresses we may be thanking our lucky stars increasingly often for the existence in Britain of BBC2 and Channel 4, networks which still see it as part of the function of television to tell a nation the truth about itself. Last Thursday Newsnight on BBC2 used a journey down the A1 to illustrate the erosion of Britain's manufacturing base, and the appalling miasma of despondency caused by unemployment. The minister in the studio who made the pained observation that a journey down some other obscure road could have revealed a new Japanese factory merely reinforced the point. Then in the first of a new series of Opinions on Sunday Channel 4 gave a platform to former defence minister Alan Clark to argue for a radical reappraisal of Britain's difficulties and an equally radical programme to solve them. Even if you disagreed with him it was heartening to see such stuff on television. Better still in a way were the first two programmes in a new series produced by old hands at the documentary game, Roger Graef and Paul Watson. Decades ago Graef made the seminal verite series The Space Between Words about communication within human institutions. His new three-part C4 series Turning The Screws is said to be about 'life inside Wandsworth Prison' but the first episode with its union negotiations suggested that it is still the business of communication that really fascinates him. Almost as long ago Watson made the notorious series about the Wilkins of Reading, The Family, and much later was responsible for a memorable episode in 40 Minutes called 'The Fishing Party' about four Hooray Henrys. Now he has been made editor of 40 Minutes and his opening edition, directed by Ted Clisby, was again about fishermen, this time builders, mostly unemployed, who fished and gossiped about the state of the nation in a slow and gentle yet curiously telling programme. Best of all, though, is Dennis Potter's new six-part dreama (a Freudian spelling error which I have no intention of correcting) on Channel 4, Lipstick On Your Collar. After the miming to 1930s popular songs in Pennies From Heaven and to '40s songs in The Singing Detective the wonderful shock element is missing when the bumf merchants at the 1950s War Office start to bump and grind to a '50s song in this production. Yet even Potter free-wheeling and re-using a previous formula is more entertaining than most television dramatists using something brand new. Perhaps this time there is slightly too much dwelling upon the period detail  -everything from Ascot water heaters to an authentically hefty suspender belt - and the narrative seems, uncharacteristically for Potter, rather stretched out. Yet he is quite incapable of making an uninteresting drama, or one without acid social comments, and sure enough he has much to remind us about this time concerning Britain's international role and standing at the time of Suez, the stultifying effects of the British class system, especially in the armed forces, and, as ever, the desperate size of the gap between the sexual ambitions of young men and their actual sexual experience. It makes for splendid television. Thank heavens for BBC2 and Channel 4.</p>

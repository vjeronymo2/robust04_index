			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Susana Alcelay report: "UGT and CCOO will Call General </F> Strike in June Unless Industrial Policy Is Negotiated"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- The UGT [General Workers Union] and  CCOO [Workers Commissions] have called a large demonstration in  Madrid on 17 May to protest against the industrial crisis and to  demand a pledge from the government to conduct negotiations on  the future of industry. A refusal from the government would  prompt the holding of "much tougher" actions in June, the  secretaries general of the metalworkers, Manuel Fernandez "Lito"  and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, said yesterday.    In order to secure negotiations on industrial policy, the  trade unions have drawn up a strategy for exerting pressure that  will begin 17 May with a large rally in Madrid, which they  forecast will be attended by 10,000 trade union delegates from  all over Spain.    At the same time they will draw up a document setting out  what form industrial policy should take, which will be presented  to trade union officials at the rally and which will  subsequently be submitted to Industry Minister Juan Manuel  Eguiagaray.  <H5>  Warnings </H5>   If, after these two actions, the government does not pledge  to conduct negotiations on the future of industry, the major  trade unions will organize "much tougher" actions in June, the  secretaries general of the UGT and CCOO metalworkers, Manuel  Fernandez "Lito" and Ignacio Fernandez Toxo, announced  yesterday.

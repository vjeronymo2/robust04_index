			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: ALTADENA;  </P> <P> DRIVE FOR TOWN HALL GAINS  </P> <P> A financial drive to convert the Hawkins House into a town hall has reached  $100,000.  </P> <P> An official from Nottingham Ltd., the firm that plans to develop the house's  site, at the corner of Lake and Sacramento avenues, gave $20,000 last week to  the Altadena Town Hall committee.  </P> <P> An estimated $300,000 is needed to relocate and renovate the 99-year-old  Victorian home. Community leaders have two months to raise the additional  $200,000 before the house's site is cleared.  </P> <P> The committee plans to move the 6,000-square-foot house, built in 1891 by Los  Angeles grocer G. D. Rowan, to a site on El Molino Avenue between the county  sheriff's and fire stations. It would house community meeting rooms, a museum,  a theater and a meeting place for the Town Council.  </P></p>

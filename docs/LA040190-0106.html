			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> QUIET RACE AVOIDS ISSUE OF COSTLY CIVIC CENTER  </P> <P> With only days remaining before the Beverly Hills city election, challenger  Trisha Roth issued her campaign poster, an acid-rock-inspired graphic  denouncing the evils of alcohol.  </P> <P> City Councilman Max Salter turned over nearly $20,000 in contributions to the  city's schools, short of his goal of $70,000 outlined in a campaign promise.  </P> <P> And fellow incumbent Robert K. Tanenbaum trudged door to door on Bedford Drive,  speaking of his achievements at City Hall.  </P> <P> Such is the scene these days in Beverly Hills, where the council race is so  polite that no one is hammering away at the city's biggest and most  embarrassing headache -- multimillion-dollar cost overruns on Beverly Hills'  lavish Civic Center.  </P> <P> In an election that was almost canceled for lack of interest, the nearly  $100-million price tag of the Civic Center has emerged as the phantom issue --  with the project nearly completed, everyone seems aware there is no turning  back.  </P> <P> The Civic Center -- a renovated City Hall, parking structure, fire station,  police station and library -- was originally estimated to cost $36 million and  became a subject of dispute when the contractor quit for two months, claiming  the city wouldn't pay its bills.  </P> <P> Salter, who contends that what amounts to a financial crisis in Beverly Hills  would be good fortune in another city, tells residents that the Civic Center  issue has been overblown.  </P> <P> Now serving as mayor, Salter told guests at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast  Thursday that the city is as prosperous as its reputation, with a portfolio  worth $128 million as of Feb. 28.  </P> <P> "I want to tell you about the crisis of the city," he fumed. "Every city in the  country would like to be in the condition that Beverly Hills is in. And that's  the honest-to-God truth. It's absurd."  </P> <P> Salter spent about $100,000 getting elected when he first ran for office four  years ago. He hoped to raise a similar amount this year and give most of it to  charity, together with a matching grant of his own.  </P> <P> But he said this week that the response has been disappointing. So far he has  turned over checks totaling about $19,000 to the Beverly Hills Educational  Foundation, but he promises at least $50,000 to the foundation.  </P> <P> He said the state of the schools is more troubling to Beverly Hills residents  than the cost of the Civic Center, especially because the Beverly Hills Unified  School District is largely supported by state funds.  </P> <P> "There's your crisis," he said. "When you have to lay off teachers . . . when  you're talking about taking a school district that was one of the best in the  country and reducing it, then you have problems."  </P> <P> The election, moved up from April 10 to Tuesday so as not to conflict with  Passover, was about to be canceled when Roth declared her candidacy. The  incumbents welcomed her challenge.  </P> <P> "When you don't have an election, there's a latent feeling of resentment toward  the elected officers, and that's just not healthy," Tanenbaum said.  </P> <P> A pediatrician and political novice, Roth turned to local politics after making  a name for herself stressing alcohol, drugs and AIDS.  </P> <P> The incumbents she is challenging are entrenched in Beverly Hills and are  formidable opponents: Salter is a garment industry tycoon whose chain of Beno's  stores covers much of the state; Tanenbaum is an attorney, novelist and  screenwriter.  </P> <P> Roth has chosen not to play the Civic Center issue to the hilt during most of  her campaign -- although her husband on Friday did place a full-page ad in a  local paper reading, "Vote for Trisha Roth. $100 Million for the Civic Center  So Far."  </P> <P> Some observers question whether Roth's concerns match those of the community.  </P> <P> "She's focused her attention on this alcohol bit, which is a magnificent effort  and will serve the community, but it doesn't run the show at the City Council,"  said Herm Shultz, president of Concern for Tenants Rights of Beverly Hills, a  renters' group.  </P> <P> "To the extent that she forced the election, she's done a service, but to the  extent that she's made it interesting, she hasn't," said Rudy Cole, a public  relations consultant who managed Salter's campaign in 1986 but has kept out of  this year's race.  </P> <P> He said that his organization endorsed Tanenbaum and Salter but that Roth got  almost as many votes as Salter in the 17-member board's secret election.  </P> <P> Roth said that if elected she will seek an investigation of the Civic Center  cost, more money for schools, a regional traffic plan, formation of a  substance-abuse task force and other goals.  </P> <P> Public discontent may indeed boost her chances in Tuesday's election. "This is  one election where not being an incumbent is an advantage," Roth said. "As the  price of the Civic Center goes up, my stock goes up."  </P> <P> Indeed, the Municipal League sent out a mailing last week declaring Beverly  Hills to be "a city in crisis."  </P> <P> Without endorsing anyone, the citizen group's board of directors called for an  independent audit of the Civic Center project and asked, "Who is minding the  store?"  </P> <P> For his part, Tanenbaum agrees with Salter that the schools' budget crisis is a  prominent issue in Beverly Hills. People are also concerned about public safety  and the Civic Center, which he has denounced as a Taj Mahal.  </P> <P> Both Tanenbaum and Salter took the opportunity this season to remind voters of  their achievements in office. They said those include securing more money for  schools and building new public parking garages.  </P></p>

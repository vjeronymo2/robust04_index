			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television Someone should write a PhD on connections between the age of television staff and the subject matter of comedies. In the 1960s when television was full of young people there were lots of comedies about young people sharing flats. As the broadcasters matured the popular subject became young families with children. Now, with a log-jam of 50-somethings in television, series are about dealing with senile parents, grown up children, and marriage breakdown. Whether ITV's new comedy, Conjugal Rites, fits into this pattern we shall see. We are told it is about a couple's struggle to stay together after 21 years of marriage. Gwen Taylor and Michael Williams play the husband and wife (8.00). Anglia's police series The Chief deservedly gets another series. In the first batch Tim Piggott-Smith played, not a detective up against city hall, but a chief constable up against the conservative Establishment. At the start of the new series (9.00 ITV) he is about to accept a post with Europol in Brussels. Also starting another run is BBC2's Have I Got News For You, an idea pinched from Radio 4's 'News Quiz'(10.00 BBC2).</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, April 1 (AFP) -- North Korea's  unwillingness to allow inspections of its nuclear installations  could leave the country very isolated, the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] warned in the Romanian capital Friday [1  April].    "Without nuclear transparency, there will not be confidence  in the outside world, and I'm sure isolation will increase if  there is a lack of confidence in their nuclear programme," IAEA  director general Hans Blix said Friday at a press conference  during a four-day visit to Romania.    The warning, the latest during a long standoff on the issue,  came after the UN Security Council Thursday urged Pyongyang to  allow international inspections of suspect nuclear facilities,  saying the Vienna-based IAEA should report back on compliance.    Foreign observers fear that the country, one of the last  hardline communist regimes, is developing a military nuclear  capability under the cover of its energy programme.    Blix said that if North Korea responded favourably to the UN  request, he was ready to take up inspections again if they could  be carried out in a "thorough" manner. "I hope they will be  ready to do it," said Blix.    Allowing IAEA access was not a "privilege" to the Agency but  a "service" to the country which would allow it to dispel  suspicions, he added.    During a mission at the start of March, IAEA experts were  stopped from taking samples at a radiochemical laboratory in  Yongbyon, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) from Pyongyang.    In Tokyo, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe dismissed  North  Korea's attitude over inspections of its nuclear installations  as "unacceptable."    Juppe, who raised the issue in talks with Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, told a press conference that Pyongyang's  attitude was "unacceptable and greatly increased the risk of  (nuclear) proliferation."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the Disarmament Committee,  Lieutenant General Manken Kigawa, has expressed concern that  some members of the (?disbanded) Malawi Young Pioneers movement,  MYP, and a substantial amount of arms and ammunition still  remain unaccounted for.    Lt. Gen. Kigawa expressed this concern at the Army  headquarters in Lilongwe when he briefed the press and diplomats  on the progress so far made in disarming the MYP. He said it  was sad that after receiving the MYP [word indistinct] and  government efforts to find ways and means of absorbing some key  members of the MYP, the question of repatriation of over 2,000  former MYP believed to be in Mozambique, was still unresolved.    He said the Army was doing its best to ensure that the  matter  is resolved as soon as possible. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army  will remain vigilant and will not tolerate any groups or  individuals who may want to support violence in the country. He  therefore advised the general public not to possess unlicensed  arms. Lt. Gen. Kigawa said the Army will ensure that the  forthcoming presidential and parliamentary general elections are  free and fair.    Also speaking at the press conference, the secretary for  youth, sports and culture, Mr. (Michael Timotu) appealed to  those who are in the MYP movement to identify themselves to the  police for their assistance saying if they were caught with arms  they would be prosecuted.</p>

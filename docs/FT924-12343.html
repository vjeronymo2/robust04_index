			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / People: 'Clearing of the decks' at Sheldon Jones - Strachan joins Douglas Strachan, former chief executive of ProNed, is joining Sheldon Jones, the USM-listed pet-foods to timber and DIY company, as non-executive chairman, replacing Richard Sheldon, who remains on the board. Although the family holding - represented on the board by Sheldon, 57, and John Jones, 47  -now stands at 55 per cent, the last year has seen a considerable management restructuring and capital injection. David Gwyther, the new chief executive, joined last November, and two venture capital companies, Murray Ventures and County NatWest Ventures, took part in a refinancing earlier this year. All this allowed the company to 'clear the decks for future development', as Gwyther puts it. Sheldon had been non-executive chairman since July 1991. Gwyther says Strachan possesses a breadth of experience and collection of contacts that hitherto the company did not have on the board. A director of Allied Lyons from 1976-1985, and Allied Breweries from 1977-1985, Strachan ran ProNed for the next four years. He is also currently a non-executive director of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society. Gwyther, who has known Strachan for some years, is himself an ex-Allied Lyons man, on the wines and spirits side. Sheldon Jones is a former animal feeds specialist that has changed direction since the imposition of milk quotas in the late 1980s. Gwyther hopes to develop the fast growing pet foods division, currently under the Pascoe's brand name, as well as expanding into other branded consumer areas. ***** Giles Henderson, 50, has been appointed senior partner of City solicitors Slaughter and May in succession to George Inglis who will retire at the end of the year after 36 years with the firm, seven of them as senior partner. Henderson takes over at a time when Slaughters' supremacy as the leading City law firm is under attack in an increasingly competitive marketplace for commercial law services. One of his first tasks will be to resolve the internal debate over whether the firm should follow the lead of most of its competitors and market its services or whether it should continue to rest on the strength of its reputation. Having read law at Magdalen College, Oxford, he joined Slaughters in 1968, becoming a partner in 1975. His practice has been in the firm's core areas of work - general corporate and corporate finance - and he has spent the past 10 years working on UK privatisations, leading the firm's team on the privatisation of British Telecom, British Gas and the electricity industry. He was awarded the CBE in 1991.</p>

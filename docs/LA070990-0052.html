			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASA SCIENTISTS UP IN AIR OVER 'BLIND' HUBBLE  </P> <P> Scientists trying to correct the faulty vision of the Hubble Space Telescope  have found themselves in the dismal position of an optometrist trying to  provide eyeglasses for a patient he can only contact by telephone. Providing  the glasses is the easy part. Diagnosing the disease may be impossible.  </P> <P> In the end, according to the experts, it may well be that the challenge will  prove too great, and Hubble will never see with the clarity that had been so  eagerly awaited.  </P> <P> Scientists faced with such a challenge normally would spend months in the  laboratory, working on the telescope itself, examining the tiny flaw in its  optics with microscopes and measuring every subtle change in the curvature of  its 94-inch primary mirror and its 12-inch secondary mirror with the most  sensitive instruments in the world of precision optics.  </P> <P> They would not be content until they could produce photographs with electron  microscopes and perfect measurements of a flaw that is probably no larger than  one-fiftieth the thickness of a human hair.  </P> <P> This time, they cannot do that. Since extensive tests failed to reveal the flaw  when the mirrors were manufactured nearly a decade ago, the telescope was  launched into orbit with optics that have left the giant scope virtually blind.  It is 381 miles above the Earth, far removed from the labs that could make  short work of finding the flaw -- or flaws -- if it were on the ground.  </P> <P> Scientists cannot go up and get it because returning the telescope to the  ground would subject it to such contamination during the descent through the  atmosphere -- when vents in the shuttle's cargo bay must be left open -- that  it would probably be destroyed.  </P> <P> So they will have to work with the telescope where it is, unaided by the  traditional tools of optical engineering, and there is a real possibility that  they will fail.  </P> <P> To succeed, scientists and engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in  Pasadena must manufacture a series of eight tiny lenses, each no bigger than a  human thumb, that will refocus the light from the 94-inch primary mirror and  remove the flaw. And that is the easy part.  </P> <P> Before they can do that, scientists must determine the exact nature of the flaw  and where it is in the telescope's optical system. And no one is sure they can  do that.  </P> <P> "The only thing I worry about at night, the only thing that causes me to lose  sleep, is not getting the diagnosis correct," said John T. Trauger, JPL's  project scientist on the "second generation" camera that will replace the one  aboard the Hubble.  </P> <P> The replacement camera is scheduled to be launched in about three years, and  astronauts are to pull out the flawed telephone booth-sized camera and slip in  the new instrument.  </P> <P> If scientists have done their work right, the new camera will for the first  time allow the telescope to live up to its highly publicized promise. But what  if they fail?  </P> <P> "We won't get a second chance," Trauger said, because costs and political  pressures would probably preclude ever trying again.  </P> <P> "There's going to be a lot of reputations on the line," he added.  </P> <P> James Westphal of Caltech, who labored 13 years as the project scientist on the  camera now rendered useless, agrees that if the wizards of JPL, aided by scores  of experts across the country, are unsuccessful, the telescope will probably be  regarded as one of the space program's most spectacular embarrassments.  </P> <P> "It would be a total disaster," Westphal said.  </P> <P> Westphal, Trauger and the teams that will be working with them during the  coming months must try to resolve a problem they did not create. There is  nothing wrong with the camera that is aboard the telescope.  </P> <P> The mirrors serve the same function as a telephoto lens used by photographers  on Earth. But it doesn't make any difference how good the camera is if the  telephoto lens itself is flawed.  </P> <P> Experts at JPL will spend the next two months studying images from the  telescope to see if they can equip a new camera with corrective lenses to cure  the Hubble's fuzzy vision.  </P> <P> Modifications to an upgraded camera that the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration had already planned to add to the telescope in 1993 could  correct the flaw by deliberately introducing errors that would offset those  caused by the faulty mirror. In this case, two wrongs could make a right.  </P> <P> The scientists are looking for help from the technical record dating back to  the period, nearly a decade ago, when the telescope's mirrors were under  construction at Perkin-Elmer Corp. in Danbury, Conn. Perkin-Elmer, which was  acquired about a year ago by Hughes Aircraft and renamed Hughes Danbury Optical  Systems Inc., is one of the world's leading manufacturers of precision optics.  But somehow during the fabrication of the mirrors for the Hubble, something  went terribly wrong.  </P> <P> It may be that in the records of the manufacturing and testing of the mirrors  some clue will be found: some slight error in the formula for the curvature of  the mirrors or some piece of faulty equipment. That would make the job a lot  easier. A committee set up by NASA is looking for clues, but a lot can happen  over the years to cloud the record.  </P> <P> For now, scientists must assume that they have to solve the problem themselves  by carefully analyzing images from the telescope, in hopes of pinpointing the  nature of the flaw and exactly where it is in the complex optical system.  </P> <P> Trauger and others suspect that the flaw lies in the telescope's primary  mirror. The huge piece of glass had to be polished to the highest degree of  precision ever. Making the job more difficult, the primary mirror in the  telescope is not shaped like a sphere, which would be easier to grind. It is a  parabola, which means the shape changes according to the distance from the  center so that it can focus all the light falling on its entire surface on a  single point.  </P> <P> As the grinding wheel moves out from the center, it has to constantly change  its position according to mathematical formulas that will give the mirror its  correct shape. Most experts theorize that -- possibly because of something as  simple as a typographical error -- the mirror flattens out slightly toward its  outer edge. Light striking that area would be scattered over the focal plane  instead of concentrating at the center, producing a fuzzy image.  </P> <P> Scientists are analyzing scores of images from the Hubble to see if they reveal  the nature of the flaw. The images the scientists are producing consist of  computer graphics, not celestial photographs, designed to help diagnose the  problem. The amount of light falling on the camera's electronic "eye" is  measured and simulated on a computer, producing the graphic.  </P> <P> If the telescope was working properly, the light would be concentrated at the  center of the image and appear as a spike on the computer monitor. The spike  would rise from a flat base because all the light would be focused on a single  point.  </P> <P> But a flawed optical system produces a spike rising from a turbulent base,  looking like a mountain peak rising from a series of foothills, because some of  the light is diffused. Buried in the hills and valleys at the base of the peak  is the secret of Hubble's problem.  </P> <P> If they can figure out the nature of the flaw, the scientists will create a  computer image of a celestial target as it should appear. Then they will point  the telescope at the target and see if they get the same thing.  </P> <P> They will do that over and over until they are confident they have isolated the  flaw. Once they know exactly what it is, Trauger said, new lenses can be built  for the second-generation camera.  </P> <P> "If you give us an error, we can fix it," he said. "But first we have to know  what it is."  </P> <P> For the next two or three months, scientists will grapple with understanding  the precise nature of the flaw.  </P> <P> "Nobody said it would be easy," Trauger said.  </P> <P> If they succeed, the only thing left will be to fly the new camera up to the  telescope aboard the space shuttle, put it on and hope nothing else goes wrong.  </P> <P> By then, perhaps, NASA will have figured out what gremlin caused the problem in  the first place. The space agency is struggling to explain how such an error  could have gone undetected and the telescope could have been launched with a  flawed optical system.  </P> <P> There were many tests, by both Perkin-Elmer and NASA, aimed at preventing just  this sort of thing from happening, and many scientists are astounded that the  error could have slipped through.  </P> <P> The mirrors were tested independently, not as a single optical system, because  testing them together would have been so expensive and time-consuming that it  was considered impractical. It would have been necessary to have built a huge  structure and several other lenses to the same precise standards as the  telescope to detect any errors.  </P> <P> Those tests, NASA officials insist, would have cost at least $100 million,  probably much more.  </P> <P> Besides, the record clearly shows that in the early 1980s, executives at the  space agency had great faith in Perkin-Elmer's performance, despite the fact  that the project was running months behind schedule and cost overruns were  soaring.  </P> <P> James M. Beggs, then NASA's administrator, testified before a congressional  committee in 1983 that the company was six months behind and slipping further.  He was asked to explain why NASA had given Perkin-Elmer $2.5 million in "award  fees" despite what one congressman called "a very poor technical performance."  </P> <P> "Because the award fee was based on the technical progress that they had  demonstrated," Beggs testified. "They had also delivered a mirror that exceeded  specifications. They had also done an above-average job in our judgment on the  remainder of the optics. In short, on that part of the job, they have performed  superbly."  </P> <P> Despite the overruns, Perkin-Elmer continued to receive bonus payments.  According to a 1989 NASA inspector general's audit, the contractor was awarded  $6 million through April, 1987. If NASA had fully considered the cost overruns,  the bonuses could have been reduced by $1 million, the audit said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Edwin Chen contributed to this report from Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Solving The Hubble's Problems  </P> <P> To solve the problems of the ailing Hubble Space Telescope, scientists and  engineers at the JetPropulsion Laboratory will have to rely heavily upon  computer graphics that they hope will reveal what is wrong with the telescope's  optics. The chart on the left shows how light from a distant star should appear  in a computer graphic-as a single peak rising from a flat base-if the telescope  were working correctly. But because of a flaw in the telescope's mirrors, the  peak of starlight rises from a hilly surface (right). The hills at the base of  the peak result from light that cannot be focused because of the optical flaws,  and they would make the star appear fuzzy. By studing the "hills" at the base  of the peak, the scientists hope to correctly analyze the flaws in the optical  system and add correcting lenses to a new camera that will be attached to the  telescope in about three years.  </P></p>

Notice of the proposal appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 1, 1994. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  The Commission received no comments on the proposal. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ITS is a National Market System (``NMS'') plan approved by the Commission pursuant to Section 11A of the Act and Rule 11Aa3&hyph;2. The ITS was designed to facilitate intermarket trading in exchange-listed equity securities based on current quotation information emanating from the linked markets. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19456 (January 27, 1983), 48 FR 4938.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants to the ITS Plan include the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE''), the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX''), the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CSE''), the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''), the Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE''), and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33520 (January 25, 1994), 59 FR 4731.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal makes several technical amendments to the ITS Plan to: (1) Provide for use of a back-up system in the event ITS becomes inoperable; (2) recognize the use of the Regional Computer Interface (``RCI'') by the Amex; (3) eliminate references to line costs and line sharing; (4) require a biennial rather than an annual audit by an independent public accountant; (5) change all references to the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (``MSE'') to CHX; and (6) correct the addresses of the CHX, CSE, and PSE.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal adds Section 15 to the ITS Plan to provide for the use of a back-up system. In the event the ITS system becomes inoperable, ITS would utilize a designated NYSE operating system (``NYSE System'') on a preemptive and priority basis. The NYSE System is comprised of computers and peripheral equipment sufficient to operate ITS at a minimum 50% of the ITS's rated 17 messages per second capacity and 75% of the ITS's disk capacity. The NYSE System would assume the functions of the ITS within two hours in the event of a limited disaster and on the next day in the event of a full site disaster.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal amends the ITS Plan to provide for the use of the RCI by the Amex through the Amex Display Book Manager (``DBM''). The Amex DBM is a computerized system that when fully implemented will, to some extent, replace the original ITS stations on the Amex trading floor. The proposal will permit communications, through the Amex DBM, between the ITS and the Amex floor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

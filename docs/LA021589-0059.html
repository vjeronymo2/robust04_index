			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Voters in a special primary put Tuskegee Mayor Johnny Ford, who is seeking to  become Alabama's first black congressman this century, into a runoff against  Secretary of State Glen Browder. The winner of the Democratic runoff on March 7  will face state Sen. John Rice of Opelika, who won the Republican nomination  amid a light GOP turnout. The general election, on April 4, is to fill a  vacancy created by the Dec. 13 death of Rep. Bill Nichols, a Democrat first  elected in 1966. In unofficial final returns, Browder, a 46-year-old former  Jacksonville State University professor, received 14,701 votes, or 25%,  followed by Ford, also 46, with 14,434 votes, or 24%. Seven other candidates  shared the remainder.  </P></p>

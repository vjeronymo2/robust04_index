			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDINANCE EVICTS 75 FROM RUN-DOWN MOTEL IN SAN GABRIEL  </P> <P> Some cried when they were told to leave. Others became angry. Three-year-old  Jeremy Ginsvach got scared. He grabbed his favorite kitten and stuffed it in a  suitcase.  </P> <P> About a dozen destitute families, many with small children and infants, were  evicted this week from a dilapidated San Gabriel motel because of a city  ordinance that forbids stays in a motel of more than 21 days over a three-month  period.  </P> <P> In what looked like a succession of modern-day wagon trains, about 75 guests at  the Valley Motel packed up their tattered lives in station wagons and pickup  trucks and headed down Valley Boulevard in search of another place to live. The  motel, facing a series of health and safety violations, was closed after the  last family left.  </P> <P> Some of the families had lived at the motel for more than six months, unable to  leave because they could not afford the deposit to rent an apartment or house.  Most of the families depend on welfare checks, Social Security and sporadic  employment to pay their bills -- as high as $250 a week at the motel -- which  rarely left anything for savings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Lows in Last Week  </P> <P> Jeremy, his three sisters, mother and grandmother had lived in Room 17 at the  back of the motel since June, spending all but $500 of their monthly income on  lodging. Jeremy's life at the 35-room motel with its murky green swimming pool  and run-down guest rooms had had its ups and downs. But the last week brought  new lows.  </P> <P> For two days, Jeremy and his sisters ate a paste of flour and water for dinner  because there was no money to buy food. Last Friday, his grandmother was told  to move the family by Monday, but she had no idea where to go or how to get  there since her car had been stolen from the motel carport.  </P> <P> Then, as the family pulled together its belongings, Jeremy's mother, Michelle,  came upon an awful discovery. Jeremy's favorite kitten, the one with the white  and gray patches that the little boy had hidden in the suitcase for  safekeeping, had smothered to death.  </P> <P> "You have to look at it this way," said Jeremy's 71-year-old grandmother, Nell  Snyder, who was forced from her rented Bell Gardens home in March when the  owner sold it, "Today may be bad, but tomorrow may be worse. It isn't easy, but  you have to take what life dishes out."  </P> <P> Snyder and a dozen or so other guests said they had never been warned about the  San Gabriel law limiting stays to 21 days. Valley Motel Manager Ken Tang said  he rented rooms well past the 21 days because the city never enforced the law.  Last week, he posted a photocopy of the statute on the motel's office window  for the first time after being contacted by the city.  </P> <P> San Gabriel city officials said they pressured the motel's owners last week  about the long-term guests because of problems there, including alleged drug  dealing, prostitution, robberies and child neglect. Officials said there is not  a citywide crackdown on the residency ordinance. But police said problems at  the Valley Motel were far worse than at any other motel in the city.  </P> <P> Police Capt. David Lawton said that since the first of the year there have been  seven robberies, six stolen cars, 10 assaults and about 15 narcotics-related  arrests at the motel.  </P> <P> In addition, an inspection of the motel last Thursday uncovered dozens of fire,  building and health code violations, City Administrator Robert Clute said,  ranging from an unsanitary swimming pool to heaters with gas leaks.  </P> <P> "It is terrible," said San Gabriel Police Lt. James Gardner, who helped several  elderly guests find other places to stay. "It is like holding somebody up  without a gun."  </P> <P> The motel, The Times learned, has been operating without a business license  since January, apparently with full knowledge of some city officials. Tang  applied for a change of business ownership in January when he took over as  motel manager, but the license was never issued because an inspection by the  city's planning, building and fire departments revealed numerous code  violations.  </P> <P> Anthony Estrada, the city's code enforcement officer, said the motel was given  until May 4 to correct the violations, which included such things as faulty  wiring and non-removable iron bars over windows. Estrada said the city extended  the deadline until mid-June, but never went back to inspect the motel until  last week when the Police Department complained about conditions there.  </P> <P> "It is due to the amount of work we have here and the lack of staff," said  Estrada. "That is what it comes down to. We have a lot of files that haven't  been looked at in months. That is just the lack of staff. You can quote me all  the way to China, I don't care."  </P> <P> City officials identified the owner of the motel as a partnership including  Eddy Liu, a developer who has proposed tearing down the complex of stucco  buildings and replacing it with a luxury hotel. Liu would need special approval  from the city's Planning Commission and City Council to build the hotel because  of a construction moratorium in San Gabriel.  </P> <P> A man at the motel on Monday, who would identify himself only as a co-owner of  the property, confirmed that the partnership has considered tearing down the  motel. The man said the owners, Stel Associates Inc. of Alhambra, were also  considering renovating the complex. But he said the owners had no plans to  immediately evict the guests.  </P> <P> "The police are the ones who drove these people out, not us," the man said. "We  don't want this to happen."  </P> <P> The man referred other questions about the motel to Patrick Huang, an attorney  for the owners, who was unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Moving has become a way of life for many of the families forced to leave the  Valley Motel, but that didn't make it any easier for them on Monday. There were  sad tales in every corner of the beige and brown motel, whose marquee beckons  passing motorists with the poetic promise: "Stay here tonite. The Price is  Right."  </P> <P> For some, the eviction aroused old feelings of resentment toward a society that  they feel has abandoned them. Many directed their anger at Tang, who moved to  the area from China two years ago. They said Tang shouldn't have rented out  rooms to long-term guests if he knew about the 21-day law.  </P> <P> Abel Moya, a 45-year-old Vietnam veteran, drowned his sorrows with a few  friends and a case of beer on the porch outside Room 7. He said Tang owed him  several hundred dollars for rent paid in advance. Without the money, Moya said,  he had no where to go with his wife and four children.  </P> <P> Several rooms away, two teen-age boys fired a BB gun at a window. Around the  corner, another boy set a large stuffed animal on fire. At a nearby pay phone,  Susie Rivera, mother of six, desperately tried to find a lawyer to help them.  </P> <P> "All we need is more time," said Rivera, who paid $1,000 a month for Room 23,  which reeked of mildew because its carpet had been drenched by a leaking  faucet. "How can they expect us to find a place with such short notice?"  </P> <P> John E. Rittmayer, an attorney with the nonprofit Legal Services Program in  Pasadena, wrote a letter on behalf of the guests demanding advance notice of at  least one week before the eviction, but it did little good. The guests complied  with the eviction notice, even though some said they would sue later.  </P> <P> At the advice of a security guard hired by the owners, Tang locked himself in  the motel's office as the guard, Michael Gauvin, urged the guests to pack their  things on Monday. By mid-afternoon, water, gas and electricity had been shut  off. Families used pool water to flush their toilets.  </P> <P> By early evening, nearly all of the families had moved on. Some went to stay  with relatives, while others found another motel. Some just drove away, not  knowing where they would spend the night. Four families showed up at nearby St.  Anthony's Roman Catholic Church, where Father Patrick Thompson took $275 from  the parish's poor fund to put them up for two nights in a neighboring motel.  </P> <P> By Tuesday afternoon, police said, all but a few stragglers had left the motel  and by Wednesday, they said, the owners had blocked the front entrance with a  security fence. Even the cats were gone, taken by Gauvin to an animal shelter.  </P></p>

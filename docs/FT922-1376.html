			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: 'No malign effect' of stock index futures trade THERE is no evidence that trading in stock index futures increases volatility in the underlying UK stock market, according to a report commissioned by the Securities and Investments Board. The Financial Markets Group of the London School of Economics was commissioned to examine the linkage of cash and derivatives trading in the UK equity market, after concern about the negative impact of futures trading following the 1987 stock market crash. The report goes some way to refuting suggestions that futures trading increases volatility and undermines traditional markets. 'That the study finds no indiction of such malign effects in the UK is reassuring,' the SIB commented. The report comes at a time of mounting concern about the risks inherent in derivatives trading, particularly among bank regulators. Mr Gerald Corrigan, who heads the Basle-based Committee on Banking Supervision, and Mr Richard Farrant, head of banking supervision at the Bank of England, are among supervisors to have expressed concern recently. In a speech in London in March, Sir David Walker, then chairman of the SIB, also warned of the risks inherent in derivatives business. 'This is a market for management to watch with particular care,' he said. The SIB has invited comments on the LSE report in an effort to build a broader picture based on the views of market participants. Meanwhile, the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank, is about to begin a wide-ranging review of the risks which have built up in the financial system as a result of the explosive growth of derivatives markets in the last decade.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE'S RULING IN BABY KILLING  </P> <P> When I was a medical student in Sacramento in the 1970s, I was a member of a  multidisciplinary team of professionals who worked hundreds of hours a year  attempting to help children who were battered, tortured, and mutilated by  people who unfortunately had the biological capability of bearing them.  </P> <P> One particularly disgusting example was a female who had killed one of her  children, severely tortured two others, and finally managed to kill a third,  who had been sent back into the home by a "compassionate" judge who felt that  the biological mother was more valuable than a foster one. This woman was  admitted to our hospital in Sacramento to bear another child.  </P> <P> Our child abuse team reacted quickly, obtaining a court order to take the  newborn child away. The woman sued, but quickly dropped the case, deciding to  move to Nevada and "have all the babies I want." I felt a profound sense of  nausea, sadness, and anger for weeks following that horrible case. The outcome  caused one of our social workers to resign -- she just couldn't handle these  situations anymore.  </P> <P> I felt the same sense of nausea, sadness, and anger when I read the article  regarding Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald's ruling in the case of Sheryl Lynn  Massip's battering and eventual murder of her infant son ("Judge Clears Mother  Who Killed Baby," Part I, Dec. 24).  </P> <P> From my previous reading about the case, there would appear little doubt that  the woman battered and killed her son. A jury of her peers came to this  conclusion after a long, and I am sure, emotionally difficult trial. There is  little doubt in my mind also that the woman was emotionally distraught when she  murdered her baby.  </P> <P> But criminally insane? A much more profound proposition! When I worked as a  family physician, I delivered hundreds of babies, and followed these kids and  their mothers through the early years of their lives. No murders. A few  distraught mothers who needed to talk out their frustrations, but no murders.  What happened with Sheryl Lynn Massip?  </P> <P> If Massip was criminally insane, why were the examining psychiatrists and her  jurors unable to realize this? In explaining his reasoning, Judge Fitzgerald  said, " . . . I didn't have any choice but to find her insane. . . . She was  bonkers." Well, judge, I think you had two other fairly obvious choices: First,  you could do your job as described by law; you could administer an appropriate  sentence based upon the verdict handed down by the jury. A murder conviction  demands a murder sentence.  </P> <P> Second, if you truly bought the concept that the defendant was insane on the  basis of postpartum depression, and was therefore totally out of control, you  could have acted to save the lives of her future babies by ordering that the  woman undergo sterilization. If she was truly insane as a result of her  postpartum hormonal imbalance, why should she be any less insane with her next  baby?  </P> <P> DANIEL S. LEVY, M.D.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

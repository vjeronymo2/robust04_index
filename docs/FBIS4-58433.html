			<p>BFN     [Text] Here are some of the major points in the agreement  between the PLO and Israel which appear in the document received  by our Arab affairs correspondent Ehud Ya'ari:    Both parties stress their determination to live in peaceful  coexistence. Israel will withdraw from the Gaza Strip and  Jericho within three weeks.    Both parties will take all the steps necessary to prevent  terrorism, crime, and any acts of violence. Israel will be able  to take interdictory measures in the areas where it is  responsible for security with the intention of bringing any  incidents to a rapid conclusion and turning them over to the  Palestinian police to handle. The use of firearms will be  prohibited, except in the case of immediate danger. Shots will  be fired solely for the purpose of deterrence.    Israelis, including IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers,  will be permitted to use the roads in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho. Palestinians will be able to travel on the roads  crossing through the Israeli settlements.    The Palestinian authority will be composed of 24 members and  will be responsible for all legislative, executive, and judicial  powers. The judicial powers of the Palestinian authority will  not apply to Israelis. Israel retains judicial authority over  the Israeli settlements.    The Palestinian authority will have no powers in the field  of  foreign relations, and it will be unable to establish embassies  and consulates.</p>

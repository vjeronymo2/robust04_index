			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 27 (ANTARA) -- Indonesia Friday hailed  reported efforts by private parties in the Philippines to have a  controversial conference on East Timor in Manila called off.    "We feel relieved and appreciate the efforts of the  Philippine Government, the Indonesia-Philippine Association and  all parties concerned to have the conference barred," Irawan  Abidin, information director at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,  said.    News agency reports from Manila had said the Quezon City  court Friday issued an order putting a 20-day hold on the  conference after receiving a petition from the  Indonesia-Philippine Association that described the conference  as a violation of a treaty binding member countries of ASEAN  (Association of Southeast Asian Nations).    The friendship association, which is headed by Jose Laurel,  member of a Philippine political group, charged that the holding  of the conference was a dangerous threat to the Philippines'  national security and interests.    It also said the planned conference could harm the friendly  relations among and The Treaty of Amity and Cooperation of the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations signed by the  Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand in 1976.    Under the Quezon City court order the rector of the  University of the Philippines where the conference was to take  place, will have to disallow the holding of the conference on  university premises for 20 days.    The conference was to open on May 31.    Abidin said the Indonesia-Philippine Association would  possibly make further efforts for the complete cancellation of  the conference or its relocation to another country.</p>

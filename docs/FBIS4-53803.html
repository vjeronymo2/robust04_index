			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article in seven installments: "Winds of Political Reform"] </F> <H5>  * National Assembly Passes Reform Bills </H5> <F P=106> [First installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 5 March issue on page 3: By reporter Kim  Tong-chol]    [Text] With the completion of political-reform  legislation, Korean politics have reached a great turning point.  In this article, we examine the question of whether the  integrated election law, the Local Autonomy Law, and the  Political Funding Law, created aiming for a new political  climate of "clean politics" and "elections that do not take  money," can actually recreate Korean political culture, the  blueprint presented by political-reform legislation, and  concrete problems associated with putting the legislation into  action.    Will "elections that do not take money" and "clean politics"  actually be realized?    The three pieces of legislation (Public Election and  Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, Political Funding Law,  and Local Autonomy Law) passed in the Assembly plenary session  have various institutional mechanisms for the realization of  clean politics.    An integrated election law, the Public Election and  Election-Irregularities Prevention Law, in particular has many  more new provisions regulating money-corrupted elections than  any of the succession of election laws before it. When viewed  only as a legal statute, it provides for the realization of  elections that do not take money, the foundation of clean  politics.    First of all, it limits to a great extent various kinds of  election expenses. In the case of a National Assembly election,  it set a limit of an average of 65 million won [W]. It in fact  abolished the salaried-election-campaign-worker system, pointed  out as the main culprit behind overheated, corrupt elections,  and changed election campaigns to make them volunteer-service  oriented.    Also, it prohibited party-unity rallies and the street  distribution of small-sized, leaflet-type printed material  during the campaign period, both of which have caused trouble  every election. Instead, the Central Election Management  Committee [CEMC] reduced the burden of personnel expenses  resulting from distribution by forwarding to each household the  small-sized printed material of each candidate.    To this was added the strengthening of institutional  regulation so that such mechanisms for the minimization of  election expenses could be effective.    In the past, each candidate reported election expenses to  the  CEMC as a total amount after an election. In the future,  however, receipt and payment of money must be done only through  a deposit account and expenses must be recorded in detail as  follows and presented to the CEMC:    --date and time,    --location,    --person receiving money,    --address, and    --resident registration number.    It also authorized the publication of election-expense  details and the viewing of these by opposing candidates and  voters. It made it possible for the CEMC, when there are  suspicions of misconduct, to request materials from the  appropriate financial institution, despite the financial  real-name system emergency order.    Additionally, it strengthened penal regulations. For cases  in  which a fine of W1 million and above or a suspended prison  sentence and five years and above is given for election-law  violations, a ten-year restriction is placed on the violator's  right to hold a public-service leadership position. Also, the  range of joint responsibility resulting in election annulment  was expanded to include election officials, persons in charge of  accounts, spouses, and even direct descendants. Therefore, if  exposed in connection with illegal, corrupt election  campaigning, not only will a person be driven from public  office, but it is as plain as day that he or she will end up  ruining his or her self and family.    "It is a law strong enough to have the effect of a  guillotine  on candidates," explains one person associated with the Special  Political Committee.    The problem, however, is dependent on how reality supports  the ideals of this law. The fact is, few people believe past  election practices, described as unjust, corrupt, and excessive,  will disappear with just a revision of the law. As always,  illicit exchanges of gifts and money will not disappear from the  election process. Some even foresee that the tricks used will  become more sophisticated.    Even the lawmakers who passed the politics-related laws  confess that it leans too much toward the "idealistic," hinting  at the difficulties which lie ahead until the purpose of the  legislation is actually fulfilled. There are actually many  among lawmakers of the opinion that "It is a fantasy law, made  by those bewitched by ideals."    That is, it is pointed out, as voter awareness and the mood  of society are not changing, it is excessively ambitious to try  to realize clean politics by creating laws based on the election  laws of the United Kingdom, a politically advanced country.    On the premise, "The three main elements of an election are  organization, funding, and personality," one ruling-party  lawmaker asserted, "It is too much to expect us to carry out an  election with organization and funding cut off."    In short, for the forces with vested interests, the disposal  of this politics-related legislation was definitely unwelcome.  However, despite the negative perspective of some, there are  many more of the opinion that the "will for clean politics"  contained in these election laws should be rated highly and  definitely must be realized. It is as plain as day that, if for  nothing else than to clear up the public's deep distrust and  cynicism toward the political world, politics must be cleaned up  and that the first step must be election reform.    In this sense, assessing this disposal of politics-related  legislation as "the greatest result of the civilian government's  reform, a new milestone for the advancement of politics," the  ruling party core is praising the integrated election law in the  extreme, even using the term "revolution." That is, in spite of  the fact that there were also mechanisms for clean elections in  the previous succession of election laws, these were not  supported by the will of the ruler to put them into action; thus  they became dead letters. In consideration for this fact, the  election laws passed this time were meant to suggest that the  ruler's will and a strong enforcement of the laws will follow.    Together with the passage of the election laws, the fact  that  the local-autonomy elections to take place in the spring of next  year are forecast by those in the periphery of politics to be  the "slaughterhouse of violators" can be understood as a reading  of the inner thoughts of the ruling-party leadership.  <H5>  * Effects of Political Reform Law </H5> <F P=106> [Second installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 6 March issue on page 3: By reporter Yi Chae-ho]    [Text] In response to a question on 5 March asking about  the future influence of the new politics-related legislation on  the political domain, Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] Secretary  General Mun Chong-su said this instead of answering.    "Now we have no choice but to run with our feet. There's  nothing else we can do. Even so, at least we are a little better  off..."    His words, "We are a little better off," seemed to be  permeated with the confidence of the old Democratic Party [DP]  faction within the ruling party of having long carried out  elections from a position of financial and organizational  inferiority. Does this then mean that the Democratic Justice  Party [DJP] faction has been put at a relative disadvantage?    The new politics-related laws have content which will bring  change to politics worthy to be called a revolution. They  severely restrict money and organizations, and free up speech.  With money and organizations restricted, the form of elections  cannot help but change. As a result, this can lead to a change  of the political class and structure.    With the establishment of the new election laws, Mr. Y (41),  who has been an aid to members of the National Assembly for over  ten years, made up his mind to run for office in the 15th  General Election. His constituency is K-ku [as published], with  a population of over 80,000. According to the new laws, he must  prepare about W600,000 in campaign funds. Money having been his  greatest worry, there is now no longer a reason for him to  hesitate. An "election that does not take money" offers him an  unparalleled opportunity. This is because, first of all, the  entrance fee into the political arena for newcomers has dropped.    "It is a fact that political newcomers are now in a  favorable  position for challenging the establishment," said DLP lawmaker  Choe Pyong-ryol. Will not the young, conscientious people of  local society, who had avoided running because of fear of money  and the established organization of the ruling party, think of  trying at least once, he asks. If only the laws are enforced,  the merit of money and financial power will disappear, he said.    DP lawmaker Yi Chol made a similar prediction. "Although,  due  to the continued existence of government organizations, it  cannot be said that the organizational advantages which the  ruling party has enjoyed in successive elections have completely  disappeared, there will at least be a change in the aspects of  elections which had been decided by money," he said.    If opportunities are broadened for political newcomers, it  could become that much more difficult for those with vested  political power to defend their positions. If the utility of  money and organization disappears, character, achievements, name  recognition, novelty, and morality will become more important  variables. The prediction that a change of personnel will be  brought about in the political arena due to the new laws is  based on this.    In its recent selection of chief organizers for 14 problem  local party chapters, the DLP excluded "financial power" from  its list of qualifications examined for each candidate. Thus, an  item has been dropped which until now has been considered  important, in examinations for party nomination of parliamentary  candidates, by Korea's conservative political parties,  regardless of whether they were ruling or opposition parties.  Secretary General Mun said, "In the future, there will have to  be a revolutionary change in the selection standards of  candidates for public office."    The DLP plans to first begin putting things in order with 30  weak local chapters and increase this as the election draws near.    Since the time they came out last year, some lawmakers  within  the DLP have taken the new election laws as a sign that  personnel changes were going to take place.    Change is unavoidable in the opposition parties as well. It  is still difficult to determine what changes will come to  districts with deep-rooted, "incumbants-first" traditions.  However, if "elections that do not take money" are brought about  properly, at least the opposition parties will have no  justification for selling nominations for candidacy to run for  the nationwide constituencies in order to provide for campaign  funds. Until now, one of the most important justifications  opposition parties have had for selling ahead of time  national-constituency seats has been "for the party to provide  campaign funds for candidates with no money."    "Elections that do not take money" may also bring change to  the traditional, factional politics of opposition parties. This  is because if a candidate does not receive funding support from  a faction boss, the need to form and maintain a servile  relationship with the boss will become that much diminished.    The probability of a change of personnel through party  nominations is predicted to be relatively lower for the  opposition parties. "Despite the new laws, a hacking-style  change of personnel is unlikely for our party due to involved  human relationships unique to an opposition party," said a DP  official. However, there are no opposition figures confident the  opposition parties can continue to survive merely by maintaining  these traditions.    Changing people through party nominations is a "top-down  change of personnel." Traditionally, the range of these  personnel changes has been broad for the ruling party and narrow  for the opposition parties. Apparently, the political-reform  legislation will be somewhat of a shock to this tradition.  However, what is drawing more attention is the "bottom-up  change of personnel." If the political-reform legislation brings  change even to the political awareness of voters, the "bottom-up  change of personnel" will be even more conspicuous.    If a political culture is established in which policy and  vision have power instead of money and agitation, and voters  respond to this or instigate it, as is the aim of the  political-reform legislation, then personnel changes in the  political arena will come about more rapidly and broadly than is  generally anticipated.    In an interview with a reporter asking for one thing most  needed for political reform, a high-level figure of the ruling  party said bluntly, "changing people." It was a pointed  reference to the urgent need for a change of personnel. This  time, this will of the political world even got the support of  institutional reform. The results cannot help but be closely  watched.  <H5>  * Parties Face Major Changes </H5> <F P=106> [Third installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 8 March issue on page 2: By reporter Chang  Pyong-su]    [Text] The organization and structure of our country's  political parties are huge compared to their normal operations.  They have long suffered "chronic obesity."    In United States and other politically advanced nations,  there are many cases in which local-party-chapter organization  is practically non-existent. The few full-time workers of even  party headquarters cannot be compared with those in Korea.    Why does this strange phenomenon continue to exist in years  without elections, with its hundreds of paid party members  watching the enormous central party building, even though they  have little to do?    The Korean thinking that "a political party must have party  influence, and for party influence it must have a very strong  organization and a large number of personnel," has been pointed  out as the main reason for this. Also, because of the climate in  which one has to make one's face known around the party to have  an advantage in party nominations, political hopefuls have  crowded into the periphery of the party. Some even understand  the inclusion of these people, not based on any general  principle, to have resulted only in the growth of the  organization.    It is inevitable that the political-reform legislation  passed  this time operate on this serious illness of our political arena.    First of all, in the case of the ruling party, with  political  funding having been greatly reduced, it has no choice but to  greatly cut back personnel costs. With the creation of political  funds more difficult due to the implementation of the financial  real-name system, apart from organizational downsizing there is  no other method available for doing this, it is explained.    Last year, the DLP brought in about W36.7 billion: a  government subsidy of W8.48 billion, a designated trust fund of  W19.9 billion, and party fees and support funding from the Party  Supporters Association of W8.2 billion. However, party finances  are left in the red when total expenditures are at W40.4  billion:     -  operational expenses, including personnel  expenses, W23.5 billion;    -  organizational-activity expenses, W8.6  billion;    -  policy expenses, W7.5 billion; and    -  publicity  expenses, W700 million.     Fortunately, the DLP last year sold the plot of its  Karak-tong training institute, bringing in over W70 billion.  With the interest it was able to make up its deficit. The DLP  has about 780 salaried officials: over 300 clerical personnel at  the central party headquarters and municipal and provincial  branch offices; and 474 secretariat directors and organizational  department directors at 237 local party chapters. A  characteristic of the party is that, due to the aftereffects of  the three-party merger, people from the three factions are  "evenly" dispatched to be full-time personnel; hiring is not  centered on ability or work.    Even apart from causes such as financial pressures, public  opinion is growing for the entire political culture to be  reformed. The DLP is considering "getting rid of the flab" in  party operations from various angles.    In the central party, a proposal is being actively  considered  to leave a few committees, such as organization, policy, and  public relations, but reduce the number full-time personnel as  much as possible. There are also some who observe that local  party chapters will move centered around an operations  committee, with one full-time employee, and that the number  chief organizers at the tong, t'ong, and pan [t'ong and pan are  administrative subdivisions of a tong] level will be cut back on  a large scale.    In the DP, persons are working who have long stood in the  front lines of the struggle against dictatorship, in the  "democracy-versus-anti-democracy" political framework of the  past, making artificial reduction of the organization unlikely.  Because of this, in the Supreme Representatives Council held on  7 March, all that was decided upon was the principle that in the  next meeting of the Executive Committee the issue of forming a  special committee for organizational strengthening would be  discussed and party-organizational-reform proposals would be  reviewed.    However, a large-scale reorganization of the system is  unavoidable in order to cope with the new political environment,  according to the analysis of the Party Policy Committee given  through this day's policy report. "An improvement of the  presently lax party operational structure and a reordering of  the central party and local party chapters in keeping with the  new law is urgently needed," the Policy Committee pointed out.    With 191 full-time personnel at its central-party office,  the  DP's expenditures totaled over W7.68 billion last year. It  brought in a total of over W8.72 billion: a government subsidy  of W6.72 billion and party fees of W1.63 billion [as published].  Its settlement of accounts ended in the black purely because of  "stingy management," it insists.    The DP's policy-promotion expenses for last year were W83.2  million, less than 1 percent of its total expenses. In keeping  with the mood that now opposition parties too must seriously  pursue policy development, policy-related expenses this year are  predicted to increase tremendously so finance management will be  as tight as always, says a party source.    Saying he thinks policy development to be the only way for  the opposition party to survive in keeping with an era demanding  new politics, DP Secretary General Kim Tok-kyu stressed that now  the opposition party too would make considerable investment in  the policy field.    There are many voices stating that a new party management is  unavoidable for both ruling and opposition parties, and there  many of the opinion that ultimately a climate will have to be  created in which at election time party representatives directly  select candidates for public office, as is the example of  advanced countries. It is clear that only this bottom-up  political reform is capable of uprooting the wrong practices of  central politics.    Together with political-reform legislation, ruling and  opposition parties are preparing for various future elections  and promising to put things in order internally. This beginning  will become a yardstick for measuring ahead of time "clean  politics" in the 1995 local-government elections and in the 1996  general election.  <H5>  * Reform Law's Flaws Outlined </H5> <F P=106> [Fourth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 9 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong  Un-taek]    [Text] Passed unanimously in the National Assembly on 4  March by both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers, the three  politics-related laws are in the spotlight for having prepared a  framework for political reform. However, there are also shadows  concealed by that light.    These shadows are cast by the inability of each of the  negotiating parties, the ruling party, the opposition, and the  Ministry of Home Affairs, to shake off their own interests. This  is also something to watch carefully in the succeeding process  of revision by the president, National Assembly regulations, and  regional ordinances. In this integrated election law, the ruling  and opposition parties charged the Electoral District  Demarcation Committee [EDDC] with debating the issue of  adjusting electoral districts, which had long been done  arbitrarily. This is a step forward.    As a result of this, however, the right to adjust the  electoral districts of local assemblymen is exercised as always  by the National Assembly. This is self-contradictory. This makes  possible the observation that, even while it is being claimed  that local autonomy is being greatly expanded, the conception  remains that local assemblies are agencies subordinate to the  National Assembly.    The question of how to compose the National Assembly EDDC is  not simple either. There is a great probability of conflict  arising between the ruling and opposition parties. This is  because the local-district-adjustment issue is directly related  to the political survival of individual lawmakers. Therefore,  both ruling- and opposition-party lawmakers hope the EDDC will  be composed in a way maximally beneficial to them. There is  plenty of room for conflicting interests.    The EDDC may present a proposal to reduce local-district  representatives to within the quota of 299 members for the  National Assembly and increase the ratio of  national-constituency representatives. That is how great its  power will be.    The political trust-fund system continues to exist in the  Revised Political Funding Law. This is a product of compromise.  Even so, it was decided that the revised law would not make  public the list of designated depositors, as is the case with  the present law.    Although limited to less than W500 million, a designated  trust fund is still a large amount of money. Not making the  depositors public is inconsistent with the revision's purpose of  raising the transparency of political funds.    In the Revised Local Autonomy Law, it was decided to give  local assemblymen a monthly parliamentary-activities fee. Even  so, it did not reduce the number of local assemblymen, which had  been greatly increased on the assumption that they would be  unpaid, honorary positions. This will put a great burden on  local finances.    Local assemblymen number some 5,170 persons: wide-area, 866;  basic, 4,304. As for monthly pay, in the future its upper limit  will be fixed by presidential decree and concrete amounts will  be fixed by local councils in ordinances. There will be cases in  which assemblymen from local councils with insufficient finances  will stubbornly demand salaries as large as those of assemblymen  belonging to "rich" local councils.    In several places in the political-reform-related  legislation  is included the proviso, "limited to the first election after  this law is put into effect."    First is the Public Election Law. If members of the National  Assembly or of local assemblies would run for local council  chief, they must resign from their present position 90 days  before the election. However, there is a proviso that, limited  to next year's 27 June election, all they have to do is resign  from their present position before the candidate-registration  application day.    This is the result of pressure by lawmakers desiring to  become the local council chiefs, insisting that they must start  their campaigns retaining their identities as lawmakers.  Therefore, the time of resignation was put off "to give them  sufficient time to carefully consider whether they will run for  office."    Also, the Revised Local Autonomy Law set the status of  deputy  mayors, county deputy chiefs, and district office deputy  directors as local government officials. Even so, it  characterizes them as national government officials, but this is  limited to the term of the mayors and county chiefs selected  next year. This difference in status brings a difference in the  one with the power to appoint them. If the deputy chief of a  local council is a local government official, then the chief of  the local council is the one with the power to appoint him. If  he is a national government official, then he is appointed by  the central government.    Limited to those selected next year, the central government  is supposed to appoint deputy mayors, etc. There is a reason for  this. It was done out of consideration for Home Affairs  bureaucrats who will loose their positions with city-county  unification.    The local council deputy chief was characterized as a local  government official in both the pre-revision law and in the  revised law. It was the Ministry of Home Affairs which  stubbornly insisted that, limited solely to persons selected  next year, this should be made a national government position.  Given this attitude of the Ministry of Home Affairs, there is  even the possibility the class of the position of local council  deputy chief will be adjusted upward to become a  national-government position in the future. The classification  of national-government positions is supposed to be set by  presidential decree. Upward adjustment does not require the  deliberation of the National Assembly.    That the law allows for there to be two local council deputy  chiefs in 15 cities and provinces has potential to be a problem.  Which cities and provinces can have two local council deputy  chiefs is supposed to be set by presidential decree. The problem  is the criterion.    For example, if having a population of 2 million is made the  standard, will Taejon, Kwangju, and Cheju Province, which are  excluded from this, do nothing? Does this then mean it would be  okay to have two local council deputy chiefs in each city and  province?  <H5>  * Reform Said To Benefit Opposition </H5> <F P=106> [Fifth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 10 March issue on page 2: By reporter Kim  Chang-hyok]    [Text] On 4 March, the day the "Public Election and  Election-Irregularities Prevention Bill" passed the National  Assembly, ruling-party lawmakers complained about articles 60,  62, and 141 of the bill, which was distributed to their seats,  "Now we're completely naked."    --Article 60 (Persons Who May Participate in Election  Campaigns). As public-campaign organizations established by  special laws, full-time workers, temporary workers, and the  central chairmen of organizations receiving contributions or aid  from the national government or local councils (Living Right  Campaign Council, Sae Maul Campaign Council, Korea Freedom  Alliance [Hanguk Chayu Chongyonmaeng]) may not participate in  election campaigns.    --Article 62 (Assignment of Election-Campaign Office  Personnel). The number of campaign office workers who may  receive compensation and allowances, for the election of members  of the National Assembly with local constituencies and for the  election of municipal and provincial local council chiefs, is  limited to within 1.5 times the number of up, myon, and tong in  the counties or municipalities of districts with a campaign  office or campaign liaison office.    --Article 141 (Limits on Party-Unity Rallies).  Beginning 30 days before the day of the commencement of the  election-campaign period through election day, political parties  may not hold party-unity rallies or party-member workshops in  electoral districts in which an election is scheduled or in  progress aimed at party members who are district residents,  regardless of whether for party-member training, unity, or other  purpose. Lawmakers complained because these articles choke the  life out of organization and funding, which in the past have  been called the "premium" of the ruling party.    From the exact opposite standpoint, opposition-party  lawmakers shouted with delight. In an informal gathering of DP  lawmakers quickly convened on the night of the 4th when the  election bill was passed, floor leader Kim Tae-sik declared,  "The ruling party, which has depended on funding and  organization, in now a Ben Johnson out of drugs." As though many  were reminded of the scene of Carl Lewis running past Ben  Johnson, all the lawmakers applauded. Bringing up the bill's  Article 79, which allows the use of vehicles and loudspeakers,  campaigning on roadsides, vacant lots, markets, etc., DP  lawmakers exchanged "serious talk in jest," saying that it was  now the "Era of the Opposition-Party Premium."    Has the ruling-party premium, the hotbed of past illegal and  law-evasive elections, actually disappeared to the extent that  people would be using the words "opposition-party premium"? Has,  therefore, truly equitable competition between ruling and  opposition parties been achieved, so that the will of the people  is reflected in elections without distortion? The majority of  both ruling and opposition parties answer, "Yes, for now."  Actually, during the early and middle portions of past  election-campaign periods, and at the very last, with on two or  three days left before election day, ruling-party lawmakers gave  funds to even pan [a subdistrict of a tong] organizers. The pan  organizers would then hold guest symposiums, actually  party-unity rallies, passing out money to voters. Thus, this was  only regulated in a superficial way. The new election laws,  however, stop this in a fundamental way. The covert support of  government-sponsored organizations can no longer be hoped for  either.    In the past, even though illegal campaign activities or  those  evasive of the law were exposed, a candidate could be "safe" by  avoiding directly "having blood on his hands." Now, however,  with a guilt-by-association system, election-law violations by  head election officials, spouses, direct descendants, or persons  responsible for campaign-office accounts result in the annulment  of a candidate's election. Not only this, but candidates can now  object to a prosecutor's wrongful disposal of an action as an  election offense and even apply for adjudication. Thus, it is  the DP's analysis of the election laws that it is now possible  to exclude the arbitrary application of prosecution authority  and hold fair elections.    The attitudes of ruling-party lawmakers are also changing  naturally. "I don't know about other people, but in the 14th  General Election, I myself tried very hard to keep the law,"  said DLP lawmaker Rep. K, confessing, "But at least in political  funding, you can't keep the law. I finally ended up using  several billion won." Rep. (DLP) Hwang Yun-ki too, who had been  a politics-related legislation negotiator, said, "Without the  understanding that the party in power, depending on the  situation, may become the opposition party, we can now no longer  carry out an election." In some corners of the ruling party  there is tension, and it is even said, "The real reason  President Kim Yong-sam mentions English-style clean elections at  every opportunity is to signify that he will arrest and  invalidate the election of election-law violators, even if they  belong to the ruling party and regardless of their number, as  the United Kingdom did during the early period of its election  reform." According to the evaluation (Situation Report) of the  DP, "The unfair election practices of the past, which saw the  ruling party's organization and funding square off against the  opposition's wind operations [as published], have for now been  changed into a climate in which it is possible for the ruling  party and opposition to carry out elections from positions of  equality."    However, as far as election campaigning goes, it is still  too  early to state that the ruling party and opposition have  achieved a "relationship of complete balance" with the new  election laws. For now, it is predicted that we will see  pre-election activities by private organizations, such as family  associations, hometown-friendship associations, and factional  gatherings. If private organizations end up having a decisive  influence on elections, it will no doubt be due to the  advantageous position of ruling-party candidates, who have  strong funding-raising capabilities. "The moment I looked at the  election laws, the first thought that came to my mind was that  I'm going to have to pay a little more attention to factional  gatherings composed of market merchants and to family  associations, which have only had a few personnel changes for  appearance sake," responded ruling-party lawmaker Han Chae-son.    Despite the concerns of some, it is the general consensus  that a large framework for equal competition between the ruling  and opposition parties was created with the new election laws.  Now all that remains is to create a strong will to enforce the  law at the government level as well as an intention to keep it  in the candidate, and to change the public's perspective so that  it views as a "natural spectacle" the "unfamiliar environment"  in which a ruling-party candidate does not use money.  <H5>  * Fair Election Culture To Develop </H5> <F P=106> [Sixth installment of the "Winds of Political Reform" </F> appearing in the 11 March issue on page 2: By reporter Hong  Un-taek]    [Text] With the integrated election laws enacted recently,  the tradition of drawing lots to select the order in which  speeches are to be given at joint election-speech rallies has  become more important.    At joint election-speech rallies, the person speaking first  is generally at a disadvantage. This is because afterward, one  does not have a chance to defend oneself against an attacking  opponent. One of the reasons unknown candidate Choe Uk-chol (DP)  was able to upset national political giant candidate Kim  Myong-yun (DLP) was Choe's luck in drawing lots.    Being a compound electoral district, in every one of the  four  rounds of joint election-speech rallies he got a good draw.  Taking the stage after Kim, he monopolized opportunities to  criticized Kim's parachute nominations of parliamentary  candidates and to refute in detail Kim's campaign promises.    Compared to present law, the recently passed Public Election  Law reduced the number of joint campaign-speech rallies, in the  case of candidates for the National Assembly, from three to two.  The hands of candidates drawing lots have come to tremble even  more.    Over 80 percent of the audiences going to the joint  campaign-speech grounds have been people mobilized by candidates  to show off their power. These were loudly-cheering units of  applauders. They would continuously called out their candidate's  name while another candidate was giving a speech and then  applauded when their candidate spoke regardless of what was said.    However, it is only naturally that these scenes will  disappear beginning in the next election because candidates  cannot use money, the most effective means for mobilizing people.    Now they will have to go around to places where people  gather, not gather people together. The new election laws  authorized the street campaign speeches of individual candidates  without a limit on the number given. Concerned candidate's  throats may get sore, the laws put a loudspeaker in their hands.    Accordingly, this means that whether or not one is elected  may be decided by how one makes use of a loudspeaker.    Basic loudspeaker-usage rules (based on a general election)  are as follows. First, only one authorized loudspeaker with a  CEMC seal of approval may be used. Second, one loudspeaker may  be used taking turns with one's spouse. One can now gain an  advantage because of one's husband or wife. Third, one may not  turn on a loudspeaker while moving in a vehicle. A loudspeaker  may only be used in a fixed state. Lastly, there are also  usage-time limitations: usage is authorized until 2300.    Apart from these usage rules, accountability follows the  words going out through the loudspeaker. In a position of  attack, the opposition-party candidate is wrong if he thinks he  has obtained a weapon by which he can attack the ruling party to  his heart's content. Laws against libeling a candidate have  been strengthened. If a person uselessly brings up a fact,  slandering a candidate or his or her spouse, direct descendants,  brothers or sisters, that person is subject to up to three years  imprisonment or up to a W5 million fine.    Even apart from these matters demanding special attention,  thought must be given for cases in which street  campaign-speeches degenerate into noise pollution. Even if  saying what is right, if everyone chatters away with a  loudspeaker, this of itself can stir up antipathy.    Although authorized until 2300, care must be taken not to  cause "sleep disturbance" in the vicinity of residential areas  late at night. Finding people to work for free is one of the  keys to the next election. This is because the new election laws  reduced the number of salaried election-campaign workers,  calling instead for the use of volunteers. Because of this,  people who in the past worked in social movements are even  predicted to have somewhat of an advantage.    This is also the cause of the recent increase in trips by  members of the National Assembly to their districts.    It is also the answer at which they finally arrived after  anguishing over how to gain the hearts of voters, if not with  money, organization, or wind tactics.    This is because, although it is commonly said that, in the  future, victories will have to be had with fresh policies, they  think that there is nothing like making one's face known in  one's district and scratching where voters itch to gain points.    One representative who participated in political-reform  negotiations confessed that even while carrying on daily,  night-long negotiations, the thought kept occurring to him, "I  shouldn't be here doing this." Rather than rewards and  recognition for his efforts concerning his participation in an  historical work, he is more concerned about reactions that  question why he is staying in Seoul and not coming down to his  district.    There is even concern over adverse effects of the  recently-passed Public Election Law: difficulty distinguishing  between who is a local assemblyman and who is a member of the  National Assembly.  <H5>  * Changes Seen for Voters </H5> <F P=106> [Seventh and last installment of the "Winds of Political </F> Reform" appearing in the 13 March issue on page 2: By reporter  Han Ki-hung]    [Text] "Seoul may be a little better. But the narrowly  confined country is different. Most voters are closely connected  by school, blood, all kinds of personal ties. When meeting them  after a long time, it is not easy to then just go our separate  ways. There are many times when they come out expecting food and  alcohol. Even if it costs a lot, you have to greet them without  disappointing them. If you just leave without doing anything  special for them, they'll say you are a rotten person. Apart  from the question of success or failure in an election, what  politician wants to be called that?"    Mr. K is a DP lawmaker originally from a rural area who has  been elected three times. Whether at election time or during  ordinary times, money is always a concern, but an "election that  does not take money" will not be so easy either, he says. So, as  he looked at the integrated election law passed in the National  Assembly on 4 March, he was actually worried more than anything  else, he admitted.    With their words, voters condemn corrupt elections. They  change, however, when they are the ones concerned. If someone  else takes something, it is "corruption"; if I take something,  it is "gratitude." They seem to have a duplicitous way of  thinking.    "Could it be that they're accustomed to the long years of  illegal elections? Voters feel no sense of guilt when they are  treated to dinners or are even given money envelopes by  candidates."    Voters' sense of guilt is dull or atrophying, according to  the diagnosis of Kap Nak-kyun, president of the Alliance of  Korean Women Voters [Hanguk Yosong Yugwonja Yonmaeng]. Thus, to  make "elections that do not take money" successful, the work of  restoring this atrophied awareness is needed, Kap points out.    What do voters have to say? The results of a poll of voters'  opinions by the CEMC show a significant trend.    An opinion poll was taken immediately after the March 1992  14th General Election. It asked voters who said they had taken  money, gifts, or been entertained their reasons for doing so. 36  percent responded that they accepted it, "Because I could not  refuse." However, 27.5 percent answered, "Because it is a common  occurrence during elections"; 15.2 percent, "I don't really  know"; and 9.6 percent, "Because I directly or indirectly  demanded it."    There are not many instances of voters themselves demanding  and receiving money or gifts. However, one thing was clear from  this survey: many voters think nothing of accepting money,  gifts, or entertainment.    A voter-opinion poll was taken in several districts before  the April 1993 National Assembly Special Election. The greatest  number, 37.8 percent, responded that for clean elections, voters  should not vote for candidates committing unlawful acts.  However, 87.1 percent of voters said they did not know which  candidate better obeyed the election laws. The thought that one  should not vote for a candidate who breaks the law easily  becomes hollow. Furthermore, 88.9 percent responded that they do  not report it even though they witness the illegal election acts  of a candidate.    The election laws contain statutes punishing voters  accepting  money and gifts as well as the candidate giving them. However,  the CEMC and public prosecutors have concentrated on monitoring  the law violations and evasions of political parties and  candidates. They were lenient toward voters.    Now, however, people are beginning to point out that voters  too must work jointly for clean elections, prepared to submit to  punishment if they commit illegal acts. The mood of society is  gradually increasing that, casting off the passive attitude of  merely not accepting money, gifts, or entertainment, voters must  display an active, citizen's spirit, monitoring and reporting  violations committed by candidates and voters.    CEMC Public Relations Management Officer Chong Il-hwan said,  "Although reporting by voters is increasing, it needs to become  more active." Son Pong-suk, director of the Korean Women's  Political Research Center, pledged that citizens organizations,  including the Women's Political Research Center, will lead the  way in monitoring to ensure the success of "elections that do  not take money," the aim of the newly created integrated  election law.    That voters must demonstrate a spirit of citizenship is not  merely for clean elections alone. It is also for putting  politics in its rightful place. Members of the National Assembly  and local assemblymen must be liberated from having to  participate in events for congratulations and condolences --  generally, weddings and funerals -- and local functions in order  to be faithful to their work in the legislature. The resolution  by the DP's Political Reform Group [Chongchi Kaehyok Moim]  (chief executive Im Chae-chong) not to send out money envelopes  or floral wreaths is one attempt to move in this direction. This  kind of movement must also arise among voters, or at least this  kind of determination.</p>

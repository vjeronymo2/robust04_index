			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent is becalmed in summer doldrums The high-summer doldrums begun to take their toll yesterday. Madrid was closed for a public holiday. MILAN, however, was once again unsettled by news of the arrests for alleged corruption and the raid on the offices of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group. The Comit index gave up 4.36 to 726.09 in light trade as profits were taken after last week's rally. JP Morgan, enthusiastic about the outlook for the Italian market before the general election, has reduced its target for the market for this year and next, and has cut its weighting from overweight to neutral. Mr Gary Dugan and Mr Hark Howdle said that the lack of explicit commitment to any meaningful structural change in last week's budget, and the increasing squabbles within the coalition government, had led them to reduce their BCI-30 targets from 190 to 175 at the end of this year and from 210 to 200 by the end of 1995. The index stood at 169.74 yesterday. Mr Dugan added that frictions within the coalition might, at the very least, delay the progress of necessary reform. He would have expected Mr Silvio Berlusconi to push the pace, but for now, the prime minister had lost some political power following his climbdown on the penal law decree last week, while the political developments over the weekend had served to compound the problems. Industrial stocks consolidated last week's gains with Fiat easing L20 to L7,010 and Olivetti L30 easier at L2,540. Telecommunications issues were harder hit with Sip giving up L70 to L4,517 and Stet losing L111 or 2 per cent to L5,497. PARIS was lifted by a rally in the bond market, but with turnover down to just FFr2bn there was little excitement about. The CAC-40 index rose 18.43 to 2,059.84, on the first day of the new account, as futures broke through a resistance level. Analysts noted that the last account period had been the first positive one since January - over the calendar month the CAC rose 7 per cent and 6 per cent on the trading month. Mr Michael Woodcock of Nikko Europe noted that the main factor affecting sentiment was the dollar. EuroDisney fell to FFr10, down FFr1.70, in volume of some 8m shares, as arbitrage between rights and shares intensified. FRANKFURT fell during official hours as some profit-taking emerged following the gains of last week. The Dax index ended off 14.04 at 2,136.22. In the Ibis there was a modest gain to 2,144.41. Turnover was DM6bn. In an analysis of the market written before last Thursday's Buba meeting Robert Fleming Securities said that the banking sector would continue to be held back by capital market losses 'and by the hangover of growing the loan book strongly during the recession. Both consumer and construction sectors face an uphill struggle in the medium term, and we would remain cautious.' Among the day's activity Daimler rose against the trend, up DM14 at DM786, helped, brokers said, by the positive statement from its Mercedes unit on Friday. Among groups due to report results tomorrow Deutsche Bank fell DM4 to DM728.50, Commerzbank DM4 to DM337.50 and Allianz DM43 to DM2,472. ZURICH was mixed in quiet trade, and the SMI index finished 2.0 higher at 2,601.2, supported by strength in pharmaceuticals and cyclicals. Ciba registered shares, seen as cheap compared with others in the sector, put on SFr17 to SFr798 while Roche certificates overcame some early weakness to finish SFr25 higher at SFr5,545. Among cyclicals, Alusuisse rose SFr12 to SFr682. BRUSSELS, encouraged by news that the government had reached agreement over the 1995 budget, saw the Bel-20 index lift 12.74 to 1,445.80. Turnover was BFr1.2bn. Some analysts remarked that overall strength was helped by the dollar, a rise in the bond market and optimism over the success of budget talks. Solvay and Bekaert featured, the former gaining BFr275 to BFr14,475 and the latter BFr450 to BFr27,100. STOCKHOLM was little changed although there was some selling in Ericsson shares. The Affarsvarlden general index sliped 0.7 to 1,465.0. Ericsson's B share dropped SKr8 to SKr401 in active trading. Profit-taking in the stock was seen, together with negative domestic comment. Turnover dropped to SKr1.27bn from SKr1.58bn. Volvo rose SKr10 to SKr745 on speculation that it found a buyer for all or parts of its subsidiary Branded Consumer Products. Forest sector shares continued to outperform, bolstered by the weak currency, earnings expectations and expectations of product price increases. The sector index rose 1.4 per cent with Stora up SKr7 to SKr417 and SCA up SKr4 to SKr120. OSLO finished marginally weaker as profit-taking eroded early gains inspired by the results from Norsk Hydro. The All Share index dipped 1.33 to 641.95 in turnover of NKr487m. Norsk finished NKr1 higher at NKr251, after an early NKr257.50, in response to its better than expected second quarter results. COPENHAGEN was grounded by the summer lull, the Top 20 KFX index slipping 0.37 to 107.96 in low turnover dominated by the banks. Den Danske Bank slipped DKr5 to SKr354 and UniDanmark eased DKr4 to SDr241. TeleDanmark was the most heavily traded issue, giving up DKr4 to DKr318.

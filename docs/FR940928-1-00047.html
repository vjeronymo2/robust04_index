			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 7(c)(2) of the Federal Energy Administration Act a copy of this notice has been submitted to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for comment concerning the impact of this proposal on the quality of the environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since test procedures are used to standardize the measurement of energy usage, and will not affect the quality or distribution of energy usage, prescribing test procedures will not result in any environmental impacts. The Department of Energy, therefore, has determined that prescribing test procedures under the Program is not a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment within the meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Rulemaking, which amends existing part 430 of Title 10, will not change the environmental effect of such regulation, and is an item which is ``categorically excluded (A6)'' by the Department of Energy's regulations on National Environmental Policy Act Implementing Procedures (10 CFR part 1021) (57 FR 15122, April 24, 1992) (appendix A to subpart D, Categorical Exclusion A6.). Consequently, neither an Environmental Impact Statement nor an Environmental Assessment is required for this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Regulatory Planning and Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's regulatory action has been determined not to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866, ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Accordingly, today's action was not subject to review under the Executive Order by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;345) (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires that an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and that it be published at the time the proposed rule is published. This requirement (which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency ``certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' This rule affects manufacturers of general service fluorescent and incandescent lamps. As previously discussed, the rule would not have significant economic impact, but rather, would provide common definitions and test methods. Therefore, the Department of Energy certifies that this rule, if promulgated, would not have a ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Federalism Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, Oct. 30, 1987) requires that regulations or rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requires preparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Energy has identified a substantial direct effect that today's proposed rule would have on State governments. It would initially preempt inconsistent State regulations. However, the Department of Energy has concluded that such effect is not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment for the following reason: the Act provides for subsequent State petitions for exemption. Thus, a determination as to whether a State law prevails must be made on a case-by-case basis using criteria set forth in the Act. When the Department of Energy receives such a petition, it will then be appropriate to consider preparing a federalism assessment consistent with the criteria in the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Public Comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Written Comment Procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to participate in the rulemaking by submitting data, comments, or information with respect to the definitions set forth in this notice to the address indicated at the beginning of the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments should be identified both on the envelope and on the documents as ``Definitions for Certain Fluorescent and Incandescent Lamps, Docket No. EE-RM&hyph;94&hyph;220&hyph;NOPR.'' Eight (8) copies are requested to be submitted. If possible, the Department would appreciate an electronic copy of the comments on a 3.5 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; diskette. The Department is currently using WordPerfect <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> TM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  5.1. All submittals received by the date specified at the beginning of this notice will be considered by the Department of Energy before final action is taken on the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the provisions of 10 CFR 1004.11, any person submitting information which he or she believes to be confidential and exempt by law from public disclosure should submit one complete copy of the document and seven copies, if possible, from which the information believed to be confidential has been deleted. The Department of Energy will make its own determination with regard to the confidential status of the information and treat it according to its determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

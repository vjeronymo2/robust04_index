			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Therefore, in this interim rule, we are increasing the amount of indemnity that will be paid for cattle and bison destroyed during herd depopulation. Under this interim rule, in States other than Class Free States, the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed $250 for any nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle, and $250 for any bison. For any registered cattle, nonregistered dairy cattle, or, in Class Free States, any cattle or bison from herds affected with brucellosis, the amount of Federal indemnity shall not exceed the lesser of 95 percent of appraised value, minus salvage value, or $750. These rates shall apply to brucellosis reactor cattle and bison, as well as to other sexually intact cattle and bison in the herd. (See discussion below under the heading ``Brucellosis-Exposed Female Calves.'') The appraisal is to be conducted by an independent appraiser assigned by the Administrator. The higher indemnity rates for nonregistered cattle other than dairy cattle in Class Free States are necessary to ensure that brucellosis is not spread in those States that have been freed of the disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, we will pay these new rates to owners who have brucellosis-exposed cattle or bison destroyed that were previously sold or traded from a herd that, subsequent to the sale or trade, is found to be affected with brucellosis. On April 26, 1994, we published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 21634&hyph;21635, Docket No. 93&hyph;023&hyph;2) a final rule that provided for payment of indemnity for the destruction of such animals. The amount of indemnity was the same as that provided for cattle and bison destroyed as part of herd depopulation under &sect;51.3(a)(2)(ii). Providing for payment of indemnity for these animals was considered necessary to help protect the herd to which the cattle or bison were moved, by encouraging prompt destruction of potentially infected additions to the herd. In order to provide owners with the financial incentive to destroy such potentially infected cattle and bison, we are amending &sect;51.3(a)(4) to provide the same rates of indemnity for these cattle and bison as for cattle and bison destroyed as part of herd depopulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Brucellosis-Exposed Female Calves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are also amending &sect;51.3 to raise the maximum allowable indemnity payment for exposed female calves destroyed during herd depopulation. Prior to the effective date of this interim rule, the regulations provided that the Administrator could authorize the payment of Federal indemnity of not more than $50 per head to any owner whose exposed female calf or calves were destroyed because of brucellosis. (Under &sect;51.1 of the regulations prior to the effective date of this interim rule,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exposed female calf <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  meant ``a female bovine less than 6 months of age which is nursed by a brucellosis reactor at the time such reactor is condemned.'')  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The indemnity rate for exposed female calves was lower than that for older cattle due to the relatively low value of calves. However, this relatively low rate has discouraged owners from considering whole herd depopulation. Therefore, to encourage the prompt destruction of all potentially infected animals in a herd, we are amending &sect;51.3(a)(3) to provide that the maximum $50 indemnity payment for a female calf exposed to brucellosis does not apply to female calves that are destroyed during herd depopulation. The indemnity for exposed female calves destroyed during herd depopulation will be the same as that for other cattle and bison included in herd depopulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, in this interim rule, we are amending &sect;51.3(a)(3) of the regulations to clarify that indemnity payments for exposed female calves shall apply only to sexually intact female calves. Female bovines that are not sexually intact are not capable of transmitting brucellosis, and their destruction is not necessary to prevent the spread of the disease. Our policy, therefore, has been not to pay indemnity for female calves that are not sexually intact. We are adding a definition of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sexually intact exposed female calf <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to &sect;51.1 to mean a female bovine less than 6 months of age that is nursed by a brucellosis reactor at the time such reactor is condemned, and that has not been altered to make it incapable of reproduction. Because brucellosis is a disease of sexually intact animals, steer calves, which have been castrated, do not pose a risk of transmitting brucellosis. Because male calves can be more easily altered than female calves, and it is economically more advantageous to owners to alter such male calves than to have them destroyed, the regulations do not specifically address the destruction of exposed male calves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Acceleration of Brucellosis Eradication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We estimate that, under the indemnity payment rates provided for prior to the effective date of this interim rule, it would have taken 6 to 12 years to reach the goal of complete eradication of brucellosis from domestic cattle and bison in the United States, with a cost to the Federal Government of between $14,619,000 and $25,975,000. In contrast, because the provisions of this interim rule will encourage the rapid depopulation of herds known to be affected with brucellosis, and therefore increase program effectiveness, total eradication of brucellosis from domestic cattle and bison could be accomplished by 1998, with projected costs of approximately $3,290,000. Thus, we expect the approximate cost savings to the Federal Government from the accelerated program to be between $11.3 million and $22.7 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

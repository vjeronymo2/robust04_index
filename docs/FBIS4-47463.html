Mendeleyev,  Chemical Reagents and Ultra-pure Chemicals (SRI) (IREA), Moscow;  UDC66.047.6(075.8)    [Abstract] In the chemical industry the production of  chemical reagents has a great affect on science and production  in general and also largely determines the scientific potential  and capability of producing new chemical products. The domestic  industry puts out only about 20,000 chemical reagents, while  some of the leading companies in the world produce as much as  15,000 to 20,000 items each. This is because the technical level  of domestic low-tonnage production fails to meet modern needs.  The creation of a diversified low-tonnage production system by  traditional methods is lengthy process that must be ecologically  clean and thrifty in resources, while a large assortment  stimulates production of a gamma of products at a single  location. This makes it imperative to develop diversified  chemical reagent production along the lines of a flexible  production system employing specialized equipment modules. The  present work discusses some general principles in synthesis in  flexible production of chemical reagents based on the analysis  of individual products, their properties, and effectiveness. The  procedure for synthesis is presented in the form of a whole  system consisting of three mutual sub-systems: a) automated  analysis and synthesis; b) formation of a technological  equipment park and development of equipment blocks and modules;  c) building base structures and formation of  structural-technological schemes.

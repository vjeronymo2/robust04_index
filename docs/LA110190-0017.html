			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S VETO OF CIVIL RIGHTS BILL  </P> <P> For whom is this country administered? Certainly not the "little people" as  witnessed by President Bush's veto of the civil rights bill. Certainly not for  the "little people" as witnessed by the refusal of Congress to reinstate the  progressive income tax, which would require the wealthy to pay their share.  </P> <P> This is a government of the people, by the people and for the people? Ha!  </P> <P> MARTHA KUHN  </P> <P> La Mesa  </P></p>

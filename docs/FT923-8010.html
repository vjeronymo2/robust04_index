			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Fears for missing Sudanese children UP TO 1,000 unaccompanied children and adolescents, who have fled civil war and famine in southern Sudan, have 'disappeared' under the supervision and protection of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in north-western Kenya. Senior aid workers said they were concerned that the children might have been pressured to cross back into southern Sudan and press-ganged by Sudanese rebels into joining the battle for the besieged government-held garrison town of Juba. Earlier this week, Oxfam, the British charity, said that 300,000 people trapped in the town had 'run out of food and face imminent starvation' after a food airlift to Juba was suspended last month. 'This is a very, very worrying development,' a senior aid official said of the children. 'There has been repeated international concern expressed that these children have been exploited by the SPLA (Sudan Peoples Liberation Army) and now they suddenly disappear back into the war-ravaged area under the noses of the UNHCR protectors. 'The UNHCR has not fulfilled its mandate and verified the voluntary nature of their movement and the concern is that they have been forced to become child-soldiers on the Juba front.' Mr Carrol Faubert, the UNHCR representative in Nairobi, confirmed that some refugees from Lokichokio had left the camps and been seen in Narus, in southern Sudan. He said up to 3,000 people in all could have 'gone missing' from Lokichokio but that an accurate figure would not be established until the UNHCR completed transferring the refugees to a new camp at Kakuma, much further away from the Sudanese border.</p>

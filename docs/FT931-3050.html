			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Red Bood Details): Sustained growth and low inflation at strategy's core THE Medium Term Financial Strategy sets out the framework for achieving sustainable growth based on permanently low inflation. Last autumn, following the suspension of sterling's membership of the ERM, the government put in place a new policy framework for its counter-inflation strategy. At the centre of this framework is a quantified target - to keep underlying inflation (as measured by the RPI excluding mortgage interest payments) in the range 1 per cent to 4 per cent, and to bring it down to the lower part of this range by the end of the present parliament. This target implies a path for the growth of money GDP - total spending in the economy in cash terms - averaging about 6 per cent a year over the next three years, and falling gradually thereafter. It is the role of macroeconomic policy to deliver this. The purpose of microeconomic policy is to improve the efficiency of markets and strengthen the supply performance of the economy, so as to raise the growth rate of output compatible with a given inflation path. MONETARY POLICY The conduct of monetary policy involves a judgment on inflationary trends in the economy and whether the government's objective is likely to be achieved. While sterling remains outside the ERM, decisions about interest rates are based on a continuing assessment of monetary conditions, measured principally by the growth of narrow and broad money, and movements in the exchange rate and asset prices. Developments in these and other relevant indicators are now set out in the Monthly Monetary Report, which has been published by the Treasury since December. For both narrow and broad money the government has set monitoring ranges which are judged to be consistent with the medium-term path for money GDP and hence inflation. There is no similar range for the exchange rate, but this remains an important indicator which directly influences domestic costs and prices and reflects market perceptions of the stance and future direction of policy. Movements in asset prices have in the past been valuable leading indicators of inflation. If narrow or broad money moves outside its monitoring range, or there is a sharp movement in the exchange rate or asset prices, this is likely to be a cause for concern; but the evidence from any one indicator has to be weighed against the message from the others in judging the outlook for inflation. NARROW MONEY Last year's MTFS set a target of 0 per cent to 4 per cent for M0 growth in 1992-93, and this target was reaffirmed in the autumn. M0's 12-month growth rate fell below the centre of the target range in June, but rose in the second half of 1992 and was above the top of the target range in February. Interpretation of M0 has been complicated by recent developments in the relationship between its growth and that of money GDP. Over the last two decades the average growth of M0 was about 4 per cent a year lower than that of money GDP and the velocity of M0 rose accordingly. But in the last few years there have been signs that M0's velocity trend has slowed down. For the time being the government considers it prudent to retain a range of 0 per cent to 4 per cent for M0. This will apply for the whole period covered by this year's MTFS. It will be treated as a monitoring range rather than a target, because the government now has a target for the inflation rate itself. Following the recent sharp fall in interest rates, M0 growth may be above this range in the short term; but with policy set to deliver the government's inflation objective it should fall back in the medium term. BROAD MONEY No ranges were set for broad money between 1986 and 1992; however, M4 was still taken into account in assessing monetary conditions. It was decided last autumn to publish a monitoring range for M4, to show what growth rates would or would not be regarded as a cause for concern. The monitoring range in the second half of 1992-93, announced in the Autumn Statement, is 4 per cent to 8 per cent. M4 growth has fallen since the monitoring range was set, reflecting in particular very low growth in lending to the personal sector in the fourth quarter, and has been below the range since the start of 1993. The government is setting a monitoring range for M4 of 3 per cent to 9 per cent for the whole period covered by the MTFS. The mid point of the monitoring range is unchanged at 6 per cent; but the width has been increased to 6 percentage points because it now applies to a longer period. FISCAL POLICY Fiscal policy will be set to maintain sound public finances, which are essential for a sustainable economic recovery. The government's objective is to bring the PSBR back towards balance over the medium term. A large part of the present PSBR is attributable to the effects of the economic cycle. But it is impossible to determine with any precision how much of it will be reversed as the economy recovers. Whatever the underlying position, the actual level of the PSBR is important in itself because it adds to the amount of public sector debt outstanding and thereby raises debt servicing costs. A run of large budget deficits, even if largely cyclical in origin, would lead to a weakening in the underlying fiscal position. Tight public expenditure ceilings were announced in the Autumn Statement. The discretionary increases in tax revenues announced in the Budget will build up over time, and together with the public expenditure plans will thus ensure a steady improvement in the underlying fiscal position. The direct effects of the Budget measures on revenues are summarised in an accompanying table. The speed with which the PSBR declines will depend on the rate of growth of the economy over the medium term. At the trough of a recession it is very difficult to assess future growth prospects. The illustrative projections shown in an accompanying table assume that the recovery continues to gather pace in 1994, and that output then grows somewhat faster than its trend rate for a number of years. These growth assumptions are very similar to the average of the projections made by the Panel of Independent Forecasters (nearly 3 per cent a year); and slightly lower than in last year's MTFS. With a degree of spare capacity likely to remain for some years yet, inflation is assumed to fall further in the medium term. But there may be little progress over the next two years if the current level of the exchange rate continues. These assumptions for output and inflation imply a path of money GDP growth which averages about 6 per cent a year over the next three years, before declining in subsequent years. Because of timing effects associated with the fall in the exchange rate, both the GDP deflator and money GDP will understate underlying movements in 1993-94, and overstate them in 1994-95. PROJECTIONS The assumptions in the money GDP growth table underlie the projections for the public finances shown in the table of fiscal projections. After rising in 1993-94, the PSBR falls significantly as a proportion of GDP, so that by 1997-98 it is down to 3 3/4 per cent. The revenue projections are based on the conventional assumption of constant tax and national insurance rates from 1993-94, except where future changes have already been announced. All proposed Budget changes are taken into account. Allowances, thresholds and specific duties are assumed to be indexed in subsequent Budgets from the levels proposed in the March 1993 Budget. The ratio of general government receipts to GDP falls in 1993-94; the delayed effects of broadly unchanged levels of economic activity in 1992-93, outweigh the effects of the Budget measures. Thereafter the ratio rises as the economy recovers and the wedge of tax increases announced in the Budget builds up. Projections for the non-North Sea tax burden and the components of general government receipts consistent with the table of fiscal projections are given in accompanying tables. The objective of the government's public expenditure plans continues to be that public spending should take a declining share of national income over time, while value for money is constantly improved. The ratio of general government expenditure excluding privatisation proceeds to GDP was on a downward trend for much of the 1980s, though in recent years the impact of the recession has caused the ratio to rise. It should resume its downward trend as the economy recovers, and as the PSBR and thus the growth of debt interest begin to fall. UNEMPLOYMENT The projections of general government expenditure in an accompanying table incorporate the control totals published in the 1992 Autumn Statement for the period to 1995-96. Detailed plans for the new control total will be settled in future Surveys. The projections for cyclical social security take account of higher levels of unemployment since the Autumn Statement. Those for gross debt interest payments reflect the PSBR projections in the table of fiscal projections. The effect of the recession on the PSBR has led to a rise in the net public sector debt ratio, and this ratio will continue to rise in the next few years. As the PSBR comes down, the rate of increase will slow. How quickly it does so, and the level at which the ratio peaks, will depend on the medium-term economic growth rate. There is inevitably some uncertainty about medium term prospects. The economy is operating well below capacity at the moment, and output is likely to return towards trend over the medium term. But trend output - the level consistent with stable inflation - is not directly observable, and has to be inferred from other economic data. How quickly output will return to trend is also uncertain. Economic growth is most unlikely to follow the precise path set out in the main projection. On the one hand, growth could be stronger, given the present degree of spare capacity: for example, if businesses control their costs tightly and respond strongly to the recent gain in cost competitiveness, UK trade performance could be further improved. But equally, the pick-up in growth could be more sluggish: high levels of private sector indebtedness could continue to hold back the recovery in domestic demand, in both the UK and other countries, and the growth in world trade could be weaker than currently expected. An accompanying table shows two variants which are used to illustrate the sensitivity of the fiscal prospect to the rate of growth. The growth rates differ from the main case by  1/2 per cent in either direction from 1994-95. SIGNIFICANT In the absence of discretionary action, the path of the PSBR is significantly affected by the growth rate. An accompanying table illustrates this using the assumptions in the table of variant growth assumptions. In the stronger growth case the PSBR falls to 2 1/4 per cent of GDP by 1997-98. And even if economic developments are less favourable, the wedge of tax increases announced in the Budget should ensure a substantial reduction in the PSBR over the medium term. Whatever the out-turn for growth, the government will take whatever action is necessary to ensure a sound and sustainable fiscal position.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- VARIANT GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     1994-95     1995-96      1996-97     1997-98  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Non-oil GDP: high     2 3/4       3 1/4       3 1/2       3 1/2 Non-oil GDP: low      1 3/4       2 1/4       2 1/2       2 1/2 Memorandum item: Average of the projections of Panel of Independent Forecasters*            3.0         3.0         2.8         na  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *Whole economy, calendar year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  NON-NORTH SEA TAXES, SOCIAL SECURITY                 CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE COMMUNITY CHARGE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- As a percentage of non-North Sea money GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         1963-64  29 1/2       1975-76  36 3/4       1987-88  38         1964-65  30           1976-77  36 1/2       1988-89  37 1/4         1965-66  31 3/4       1977-78  35 1/2       1989-90  37 1/4         1966-67  32 1/2       1978-79  34 3/4       1990-91  36 3/4         1967-68  34           1979-80  35 1/2       1991-92  36 1/2         1968-69  35 3/4       1980-81  36 3/4       1992-93  34 3/4         1969-70  37 1/2       1981-82  39 1/4       1993-94  34 1/2         1970-71  37           1982-83  38 3/4       1994-95  35 1/4         1971-72  35 1/4       1983-84  38 1/4       1995-96  36 1/4         1972-73  33           1984-85  38 1/4       1996-97  36 3/4         1973-74  33 3/4       1985-86  37 1/2       1997-98  37         1974-75  36 1/4       1986-87  37 3/4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *1990-91: latest estimate;

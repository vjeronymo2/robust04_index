This  observation attracted attention when one of the shaykhs of  Hizballah took it upon himself to change the significance that  is associated with the life of [Imam] Husayn by presenting that  life without mentioning the name of Imam Husayn or any member of  his family. Not even Karbala' was mentioned. Instead, the person  who was conducting the aforementioned memorial service proceeded  to relate the story of al-Ghubayri incident in a mournful  stammer, replacing the term, nonbelievers, with the term,  Lebanese regime. Instead of speaking about Karbala', he spoke  about al-Ghubayri and about the casualties of that  demonstration. He spoke about the demonstration, which occurred  early this month in 1993 instead of speaking about Imam Husayn  and the martyrs who supported him and who lost their lives  approximately more than 1,000 years ago.    This is actually the first time in the history of political,  Shiite Islamic movements that an infringement is made upon what  Shiites consider a sacred ritual, one that is always performed  on all their religious occasions. That ritual is performed every  year on the occasion of `Ashura.' In this sense the life of  Husayn is read in a mournful tone to offer oneself consolation,  to seek a blessing and a reward, and, at the same time, to stir  the emotions by arousing feelings of affection for al-Husayn and  for members of his family. When presented in this manner Imam  Husayn's life and its significance constitute an important part  of the Shiites' heritage, that heritage in which the political  and the social are to a certain extent mixed with the religious.  Accordingly, changing the significance of Husayn's life in the  manner that occurred during the memorial service for the victims  of the al-Ghubayri incident is considered reprehensible  according to the standard Shiite Islamic practice in this  regard. After all, a large segment of Shiite Muslims still  refuse to make any change, even in the manner in which a  memorial service is conducted. It is known that the aim of those  who have been calling for change in the manner in which memorial  services are conducted is to highlight the significance of these  occasions by adopting an up-to-date manner. But the irony here  lies in the fact that Hizballah has always taken a hard-line  position, opposing all those calling for change, even those  advocating that the gory ritual be changed so that the essence  of the occasion can be presented in a new way. Now, however,  Hizballah is boldly infringing on the essence of these occasions  with one of its shaykhs [religious elders] presenting the life  of Husayn during the aforementioned memorial service without  making any mention whatsoever of either Imam Husayn or Karbala'.    Hizballah's action appears to be bold. Not only does it  suggest that Hizballah has the legal and moral right to put its  casualties on an equal par with the martyrs of Karbala', but it  also has the legal and moral right to regard the al-Ghubayri  incident an occasion in its own right equivalent to the Karbala'  incident. Accordingly, Hizballah's actions suggest that the  party would have no objection to adding the al-Ghubayri incident  to those traditions, which are considered sacred by Shiite  Muslims.    And yet, does Hizballah have the right to take such actions,  which suggest that it has not only "the right" to impose a  political point of view, but also "the right" to attach to it  the religious justifications for making it sacred? Is it right  for Hizballah to require not only the party's followers but also  all Shiite Muslims to comply with that point of view?    In the past Hizballah introduced some political slogans into  the Husayniyahs [buildings where Shiites gather for the recital  of the sufferings of the Imams], which are recited by Shiite  Muslims in Lebanon in an Iranian, not an Arabic accent. And yet,  none of the incidents that the party had encountered in the past  were placed on an equal footing with the battle of Karbala'. The  al-Ghubayri incident was, however, when the life of Husayn was  unabashedly incorporated into that incident. The party's  leaders, who know quite well the standing that Husayn's life has  in the hearts and minds of the Shiite public, found no  difficulty in doing that. There is no doubt that the party  deliberately wanted to show that Shiites in Lebanon were  confused about the difference between the implication of  infringing upon the party's standing and that of infringing upon  the standing of Karbala'. Hizballah wants to use this  "confusion" to create the illusion or to suggest that  contradicting the party will be tantamount to contradicting the  Shiite Islamic sect in its entirety and not only Hizballah. The  party also wants to suggest that it is not possible to  contemplate the military elimination of Hizballah because  Hizballah, the underdog, will be around and will be coming  around every year and assuming crisis proportions, just as the  death of Imam al-Husayn in Karbala' comes up every year and is  also mentioned on every Shiite occasion.  <H5>  An Incurable Disease </H5>   It seems clear that Hizballah's aim in pursuing such conduct  is ultimately to cover itself in a Shiite Islamic cloak in an  attempt to make itself appear larger than it really is. The  question of Hizballah in Lebanon would then become a Shiite  question and not a fundamentalist one or a partisan one. The  notion of what lies behind this approach seems to be the crisis,  which Hizballah is going through at this stage during which  circumstances around the party are changing and threatening to  make the party useless from the point of view of all which had  hitherto justified its existence. Such a crisis would have  severe psychological effects on Hizballah similar to those that  would be endured by a patient who senses that his disease is  incurable and that his days are numbered. Hizballah is actually  experiencing such psychological sentiments, and these sentiments  are growing every day and after each new incident. They are  pointing out that the region is moving closer to the point of  putting yesterday's Arab-Israeli conflict behind it in a manner  that falls short of what is required on the possibilities of a  rapprochement between Iran and Washington and also on the matter  of extending the reach and range of the state in Lebanon.    The problem with Hizballah is that it is the product of  these  equations. Its significance and its role are also in part  products of interactions among these equations. That is why  Hizballah and the part it has been playing will undoubtedly drop  out of the picture when these equations become history. In this  regard the most dangerous matter facing this party is the fact  that its internal makeup and its ideological concepts prevent it  from renewing itself intellectually and organizationally in a  manner that would make it a viable party in the new stage that  is coming. The party would then have a new role to play and a  new approach to take, both of which would be compatible with the  spirit and the prospects of the new stage. For Hizballah renewal  would mean abandoning its origins, and that means becoming a  party without an identity. In the best of cases Hizballah would  become another version of the Amal Movement, and it is known  here that a second Amal Movement is not needed here on the  Shiite Islamic scene. But even if Hizballah were to succeed in  renewing its performance and its ideology--and that is an  optimistic assumption--it would be exposing itself to violent  internal upheaval that would lead to its dissolution and  breakup, as its original component parts move away from each  other within the party. Hizballah would once again revert to  groups made up of small independent tendencies. Among these  groups, for example, would be the al-Da'wah Party, Fadlallah's  group, the group, which has security ties with Iran, and so on.  Generally speaking then, the party would face dissolution and  disintegration, and that means it would cease to exist.    Faced with all these probabilities, the best of which  signifies the dissolution and demise of Hizballah, leaders of  the party are trying during this 11th hour to do something  extraordinary to avoid that destiny. Their actions in this  regard, however, have been so tense and nervous that they  believe that everything that is taking place around them can be  regarded as a conspiratorial political plan against Hizballah.  On the basis of such suspicions, which are like the hypochondria  that often afflicts elderly patients and those who are on their  death beds, the party cannot become convinced that after being  fattened for the past 11 years--the time during which it was  exploited politically--it will be prepared for slaughter and  sacrificed soon like a sheep on the altar of the settlement, on  the altar of a new stage of relations in the region, or on the  altar of relations between the region and international powers.  It is this sentiment that explains why the party sees any  dispute between it and the state as an attempt by the latter to  liquidate it. It is known that the threat of Hizballah's  liquidation comes neither from the state nor from any other  internal party, but rather from the nature of its organizational  and political makeup. And that was one of the tools that  Hizballah used during the foregoing stage. But when the sun does  set on the last act of that stage in the region, it will also  set on all its effects and its entire rationale.    There are observers who believe that there is a tendency  within Hizballah's leadership, which realizes that the party's  crisis stems from the nature of the challenges of the coming  stage, a stage that rejects Hizballah's role and makeup. And yet  that tendency is trying to conceal that fact so that it can  prolong the party's life. It is trying to create within the  party's ranks a passive unity that is not based on "harmony  within the party." Instead, that passive unity draws its  lifeblood from the assumption that "what is outside the party is  to be feared." That is why this tendency is magnifying the sense  that exists primarily within the party at this stage, and that  sense is that there is an enemy lying in wait for the party.  This tendency is magnifying the sense that the party is also  being targeted by a conspiracy.    This tendency is counting on getting the party's ranks and  all its groups preoccupied with the subject of security and that  of getting ready to confront "the other." That would keep them  from devoting their attention to the new conditions around them  and subjecting those conditions to scrutiny and analysis. After  all, such scrutiny and analysis, should they take place, would  create within the party a debate, which the party's current  leadership would not be able to contain. Such scrutiny and  analysis would also expedite the internal dissolution of the  party because in facing the question about the party's destiny  rather than any other tactical or supplemental question, each  one of the centers of power within the party will be trying to  apply pressure to the others so that its own view might prevail,  become the view that the other centers of power must adhere to,  and provide it and the party with a way out. In pressing its  point of view, each center of power will indicate that it will  drop out of the party if its point of view is not adhered to.  These centers of power say that they will walk away from the  party since they do not have to stay in it simply because the  other powers in the party have a different point of view. They  say they will not wait voluntarily for what is thought will be  the party's liquidation.    Postponing such a discussion under the pretext of having the  party devote itself to getting ready to confront outside  conspiracies is actually tantamount to pursuing a policy, which  cannot be pursued indefinitely. Having conceded that, postponing  this discussion is nevertheless considered an ideal policy for  the party in its current position, given the nature of the  party's principal character and leader, namely, Sayyid Husayn  Nasrallah. Although the vast majority of Hizballah's members and  cadres who had been Nasrallah's partners in intense field work  have confidence in his approach to security and organization,  the party's elders do not have that much confidence in him. Even  those who like to use theological standards in dealing with him  do not have much confidence in him. It is this quality that is  associated with the secretary general of Hizballah that makes  the matter of starting an intellectual, political discussion  related to jurisprudence within the party a precarious step,  given the absence of a leader who can make an intellectually  decisive statement. And yet, having the party confront security  deadlines at this stage requires that its organizational  readiness be upgraded, and that is consistent with Sayyid  Nasrallah's capabilities because the party has confidence in the  skills he has in this regard.  <H5>  Running Away to the Imam </H5>   And yet, running away from the problem to the imam within  the  party is countered in some segments by a clear inclination to  think calmly and deliberately about what the party has to do to  get out of its crisis safely. These segments that are affiliated  with Hizballah, especially those that have funds, are of the  opinion that the party has to be diligent in [its efforts] to  acquire Shiite characteristics so that fundamentalism in Lebanon  and the new, rising political Shiism would become synonymous.  Thus, it would become impossible for any internal or external  power to think of doing away with fundamentalism in Lebanon as  it is represented by Hizballah, because to think along those  lines would be like thinking about doing away with a sect, not a  [political] party. To think along those lines would endanger the  fundamental balance of the country, not just one number in a  political game.    There are several reasons why making this equation workable  in the material world does not appear to be easy. Most  important, there is the Amal Movement whose presence represents  a dominant Shiite tendency, on the one hand, and a substantial  national tendency, on the other. There is, therefore, a bold  line of distinction between rising political Shiism, as  represented by Amal, and partisan fundamentalism, which can be  found among Shiites, as represented by Hizballah. Although these  facts are keeping Shiites from becoming a rising fundamentalist  [movement] in Lebanon, providing Hizballah with a cover or a  religious front, their importance is not diminished by the fact  that Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan, the distinguished Ja'fari  mufti, linked what Hizballah might face to what is being planned  for Shiite Muslims as a sect in Lebanon. He made that link in  the speech he delivered at the memorial service for the victims  of the al-Ghubayri incident. In the eyes of the vast majority of  Shiites this link will appear to be emotional and unjustified.  In fact, what Shaykh Qabalan said is being thoughtlessly cited  in a manner that would move Shiites in Lebanon to become a  sect-like entity whose existence will be contingent upon new and  developing political factors. And yet, what must be believed is  that the presence of Shiites in Lebanon is not the subject of a  wager about whether a new political incident will or will not  occur. It is instead something that has to do with the survival  of Lebanon as an entity. The presence of Shiites in Lebanon is  something that draws its lifeblood from matters that go beyond  changing and alternating political equations, no matter how  far-reaching these equations might be.    At any rate, Hizballah, for a variety of reasons that have  to  do with its interests, will be compelled to apply pressure so  that it can protect itself behind a Shiite front. Furthermore,  there is a tendency within Hizballah that is trying to open its  doors to other Islamic and Christian Lebanese sects. Proponents  of that tendency are of the opinion that at this stage the party  has to abandon the shrill positions it has been taking in  Lebanon so that it can become a Lebanese party rather than a  fundamentalist party, which can be attacked easily. And yet that  approach continues to be weak because of the party's makeup,  role, and hardline concepts, all of which have been reviewed  above.  <H5>  Two Possibilities </H5>   While proposals within Hizballah for the party's development  and renewal continue to be tantamount to cries in the  wilderness, those within the party who have more influence are  those who lay out the choices for the situation in the future,  using the same standards, which the party has been using to  weigh the positions that it must take. The standards that are  being referred to here are those which attempt to play the game  of regional considerations, particularly as they manifest  themselves in Iran. Accordingly, proponents of that way of  thinking who have the lion's share of influence on the party's  decisions argue about which one of two possible occurrences is  more likely.    The first possible occurrence involves Tehran and Ankara.  Recently, it became evident to both Iran and Turkey that Soviet  Asia will not become the new area where they can exercise their  regional influence because the republics in that section of Asia  continue to look at Russia as their big brother who can solve  their problems. Accordingly, Tehran and Ankara, particularly  Tehran, will find themselves compelled to intensify the process  by means of which their regional policies would be steered  toward the Arab East and concentrated there. That will breathe  new life once again into Hizballah as a factor in Iran's foreign  policy that is to be weighed in. Consequently, the party will  have new regional reasons to help it surmount the dividing line  of having its role terminated in the coming stage.    The second possible occurrence is one that can be noted with  pleasure, but it is one that calls for reservation and caution.  This is because Iran could be persuaded with regional gains or  with desperately needed economic gains, provided its foreign  policies in the region are held in check. If Iran is persuaded  by these temptations, Tehran might either tell Hizballah to take  a step backwards, or it might cut it off and let it face its  destiny all by itself.    But why would Tehran respond now to temptations such as  those  that have already been mentioned?    In answering that question proponents of the second possible  occurrence in Hizballah say that there are several reasons why  Tehran would respond to these temptations. Most important,  economic conditions in Iran are deteriorating, and there is a  desperate need for foreign assistance. Actually, Japan has been  playing an active role for quite some time to persuade Iran to  accept the following proposition: Tokyo will try to help Iran  internationally by persuading the West to ease the blockade  placed around Iran. [Toyko said] "You, Iranians, however, will  have to help us prove that you have abandoned those foreign  policies that provoke the United States of America."    It seems that Tehran has been trying, even as we speak, to  deal with this Japanese proposition with much attention. It is  going along with it little by little. However, the prime  minister of Japan recently approached Iranian leaders and spoke  to them courteously. He told them, "If you want the assistance  we give you to be more effective in ending the undeclared  international blockade against you, you will have to refrain  from actions that oppose the Gaza-Jericho First Agreement."    And now the Japanese are waiting for Iran's answer, and the  answer that Iran will give Tokyo will be one that we, of course,  will not hear. If Iran's answer is "yes," that will undoubtedly  mean that Hizballah has lost the basic dimension it has had in  the region for a decade. During that time that dimension has  been the secret of Hizballah's survival. When that time comes,  Hizballah may find that the only thing it can do to serve its  own purpose is to proclaim the slogan, "Death to Japan."</p>

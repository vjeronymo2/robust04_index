			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Joining the extended family - The varying fortunes of the German Mittelstand Falken Registraturen is a typical example of the Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized companies that formed the backbone of western Germany's postwar economic success. It employs 240 people and sells paper products, ranging from files and envelopes to notepads and office material. But Falken, managed by 30-year-old Gunther Becker, is located in the state of Brandenburg, in the tough business community of what was East Germany. And against all the odds, the company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Wilhelm Becker Papiergrosshandlung, a trading house in the Rheinland, is surviving. Equally surprising is that Becker had no experience in running a paper factory, let alone operating in an eastern German environment. 'Everybody warned me about the effect 40 years of state planning had had on the labour force. But here, my staff is committed and motivated. They work hard. They want the plant to be a success. Indeed, it is they who have taught me everything I now know about making paper products,' Becker says. Since taking over the plant two years ago, the parent company has invested about DM50m (Pounds 20m), mostly on new equipment - which has raised productivity to 80 per cent of western German levels - and on infrastructure. As a result, Falken has already captured about 20 per cent of the eastern German market, and about 15 per cent of the western German market, largely through direct sales contracts to companies. 'We can even talk about small profits, of between 1 and 3 per cent on our current turnover of DM42m,' Becker says. Like many of the Mittelstand in eastern Germany, Falken's future is dependent on several factors: support from the mother company in western Germany, investment grants and tax breaks, and confidence that the Mittelstand will eventually flourish, not next year, nor even in five years, but in 10 years. 'These grants are reduced and phased out over time,' Becker says. 'So anyone coming to eastern Germany must remember that this is a long haul. You have to think in the very long term. There are no quick fixes.' Yet there were no quick solutions to rebuilding the Mittelstand in western Germany after 1945, except that, unlike eastern Germany of today, western Germany had one big advantage: the tradition of small, family-run enterprises was still intact. 'In the eastern states, because of several decades of central planning, you do not have the memory, the habit, or the continuity of an entrepreneurial/enterprise culture. You do not have the families which make up the Mittelstand in western Germany,' explains Wolf-Dietrich von Bothmer from Deutsche Bank's branch in Dresden. Hence the importance of investment from the west. Another difficulty for the Mittelstand in eastern Germany is the loss of markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, caused by Bonn's decision to introduce monetary union in 1991. Before unification, more than 50 per cent of eastern Germany's output was exported eastwards. Today, such exports hardly exist. 'When the Mittelstand in western Germany re-emerged after 1945, these companies could anchor themselves to an expanding industrial base,' says Richard Reid, an economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in Frankfurt. 'Eastern Germany does not have that advantage.' That said, green-field plants - such as Opel's car manufacturing operation at Eisenach or the large recycling plant that Enso Gutzeil, the Finnish paper manufacturer, will build near Leipzig - should eventually fill the gap. The importance of local customers is underlined by Heiner Holzemann, manager of a chemical and gas containers plant in Furstenwalde, Brandenburg, owned by the west German Kramer group. 'When we bought the plant from the Treuhand (the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry), we made a decision to concentrate on the local region first, otherwise transport costs would swallow up our turnover.' The plant employs 421 people and had a turnover of DM59m in 1992. But Holzemann knows he has to look further afield 'otherwise we would reach a saturation point at a very early stage. Being so close to the Polish border, we are in an ideal location. This firm had contacts with the region before 1989. We are now beginning to re-establish them. Don't forget that Russians will be building gas pipelines. There will be a need for our liquid and gas containers. We have to look to the long term'. Despite the energy and commitment of managers like Holzemann, eastern Germany's Mittelstand continues to be inhibited by poor infrastructure, the high level of risk and uncompetitive practices. 'The infrastructure is improving,' Holzemann says. 'When we first came here, there were no phones, no decent meeting rooms, no accounts. You have to start from scratch.' A bigger worry perhaps is the east's competitiveness. Reid points out that partnership between industry, the banks, the states, and the unions has been slow to emerge. Had such a partnership existed immediately after unification in 1990, eastern Germany's labour costs might have provided one of the engines for recovery. But the decision by IG Metall, the country's powerful engineering union, and the employers to equalise eastern and western wages by 1995 has meant that in the short term at least the five new states are no sanctuary for low labour costs. Deutsche Bank, which, through two of its holdings, Deutsche Industrie-Holding and Deutsche Beteiligungsgesellschaft, has invested DM146m in the Mittelstand in eastern Germany, has added its critical voice to industrial policy in the region. It deplores the degree of subsidies given to those enterprises still managed by the Treuhand. 'It will slow up the competitiveness of eastern German industry and the Mittelstand,' says George Krupp, a Deutsche Bank board member. He argues that plans to establish a Treuhand-managed industrial core of companies that cannot yet be privatised will act as a brake on the development of the Mittelstand. Some Mittelstand managers even complain of dumping. 'Sometimes I feel that if we do not win an order it is because Treuhand-owned firms can offer far cheaper prices,' says Peter Streckmann, technical director of the Kramer plant. Yet managers like Becker and Holzemann are still prepared to buckle down and compete in eastern Germany. 'I suppose we are here because we believe in unification and want it to succeed,' Becker says. 'It has to, hasn't it?'</p>

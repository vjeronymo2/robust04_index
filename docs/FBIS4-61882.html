			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksandr Mineyev] </F>   [Excerpt] Brussels, 10 May -- "Turkmenistan is not seeking  NATO's help, but is striving to develop partnership with the  alliance on a mutually advantageous basis," Boris Shikhmuradov,  deputy prime minister of this Central Asian republic, told an  ITAR-TASS correspondent. At NATO headquarters in Brussels  today, he signed the outline document of the "Partnership for  Peace" program. So, 18 countries have joined the program,  including eight former Soviet republics.    Turkmenistan, the deputy prime minister said, has  possibilities of broad cooperation with NATO member-countries in  all spheres, including the military one. He said talks were  underway on joint programs for training officers of the Turkmen  Armed Forces and on cooperation in other areas of military  construction.    At the signing ceremony, B. Shikhmuradov said Turkmenistan  sees the main purpose of its participation in the program set  out by NATO member-countries in objectively promoting a solution  to the principal task which is strengthening Turkmenistan's  sovereignty and turning it into a fully independent member of  the international community.    Along with developing partnership relations with new  democratic Russia, the deputy prime minister noted, his republic  is developing cooperation with West European countries and the  USA, Asian states, and CIS neighbors. He specifically noted  Turkmenistan's potential role as a bridge between Europe and  south and southeast Asia. [passage omitted]</p>

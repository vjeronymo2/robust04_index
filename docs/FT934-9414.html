			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / EC system threatens trade figures' accuracy THE UK is facing three years of unreliable and incomplete trade figures because of difficulties with the European Community's new system of measuring intra-community trade. The Central Statistical Office said yesterday it was delaying publication of complete visible-trade figures for the first eight months of this year because lack of data had made it difficult seasonally to adjust the figures. The delay marks a further setback for Intrastat, the EC's system based on value added tax for measuring trade, which was introduced at the beginning of the year to coincide with the single market. Teething troubles with the system were expected to last until the middle of this year. Statisticians now say that the latest difficulties may mean it is three years before Britain has a reliable and complete series of statistics on its trade with the rest of the world. The CSO said that it needed another two days to 'reassess seasonal and constant price adjustments made under the new system now in use throughout the EC'. It wants to make the next set of figures - the last before the Budget - as accurate as possible to avoid large revisions after the chancellor has made his statement. The switch from a customs-based system of measuring intra-EC trade to one based on VAT returns has been beset by problems since its introduction in January. Last month, Eurostat, the EC's statistical office, said publication of up-to-date figures was being hampered by a slow rate of reply by companies, in particularly small companies. The UK has been quicker to produce monthly figures than other member states, although its plan to produce monthly figures by the end of July proved too optimistic. The latest setback comes as government officials from France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands meet in The Hague today to discuss difficulties with Intrastat.</p>

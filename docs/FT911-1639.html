			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / T &amp; N to shed 2,500 jobs and plans a Pounds 119m rights issue THE PRESSURE that falling car sales has inflicted on components suppliers was reflected yesterday when T &amp; N announced 2,500 job losses and a Pounds 119m rights issue to fund its modernisation programme. The move follows the shedding of 1,800 jobs last year and will cut the group's worldwide workforce to less than 40,000. Most of the losses will fall in the UK where the group has 16,000 workers. The announcement came on the same day as Vauxhall announced record pre-tax profits of Pounds 239.1m. However, company chairman Mr Paul Tosch said operating profits fell by 13 per cent. As one of the car company heads who last week accused Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer,of delivering an anti-car budget, he warned that the 1991 outlook for Vauxhall was not very encouraging. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, said: 'T &amp; N's news nails the lie that the recession is bottoming out.' T &amp; N is one of the UK's 'big six' vehicle component suppliers, which together have shed about 5,000 jobs in the past 12 months, and warned that several thousand more will go this year. They have been hit by the downturn in car, truck and replacement parts sales in most markets except Germany. In the UK, car sales fell from a record 2.3m in 1989 to 2m last year. A further fall, to between 1.6m and 1.7m, is forecast for 1991, reflecting in part the changes in VAT and company car taxation in the Budget. Mr Colin Hope, T &amp; N chairman, said the group wanted to keep up its investment programme to make it more competitive internationally, particularly against the Japanese and Germans. Capital spending had totalled Pounds 327m over the last five years. However, the group did not want to increase its borrowings. By December, net debt had risen to Pounds 248m, giving debt-equity gearing of 49 per cent. The one-for-four rights issue, priced at 140p a share, would reduce that ratio to less than 30 per cent. Some market disappointment at the move was reflected in an 11p fall in the share price to 163p. It is little more than a year since the group's last rights issue, a one-for-three at 150p a share, related to a US acquisition. Mr Hope warned that the group's first-half results this year would be well below the Pounds 46.1m recorded pre-tax last time. They would be more like 1990's second half, when the taxable amount slid to Pounds 24.4m. The board said it would maintain the total dividend at 10.85p. The group allowed Pounds 14m for redundancies in its 1990 accounts. The latest cuts will incur additional costs of Pounds 7m. Lex, Page 18 Vauxhall results, Page 13</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BERLIN WALL WILL BE PULLED DOWN, EAST GERMAN TELLS HAVEL  </P> <P> The Berlin Wall, which symbolized the schism between Eastern and Western Europe  for 28 years, will be pulled down, an East German official said today in a  dramatic demonstration of the liberalization of the East Bloc.  </P> <P> East German head of state Manfred Gerlach told visiting Czechoslovak President  Vaclav Havel that the wall will be torn down.  </P> <P> "We are pulling down the wall. It has become superfluous. It will be replaced  by normal border markings," Gerlach said in the interview with the West German  daily, Bild.  </P> <P> Gerlach said that no date has been set for the wall's removal but that the East  German government would discuss it soon.  </P> <P> Bild said it interviewed him after he had taken Havel to see the wall and the  historic Brandenburg Gate today.  </P> <P> Havel told reporters that he was amazed that the wall, built in 1961 and a  symbol of Germany's and Europe's division until East Germany opened its borders  in November, is still standing.  </P> <P> "Gerlach told me work would soon start to tear it down. I told him if he had  any problems we could send some independent Czechoslovak workers to help free  of charge," he said to loud applause.  </P> <P> Havel also told journalists he would like to say "Ich bin ein Berliner" -- "I  am a Berliner" -- as did President John F. Kennedy during his visit to Berlin  in June, 1963, two years after the wall was built.  </P> <P> "I would like to take the liberty to repeat this sentence at a new time and in  a new context," Havel said.  </P> <P> He said all walls and barriers in Europe must fall.  </P> <P> Built by Soviet-backed East German troops Aug. 13, 1961, the wall was first  breached last Nov. 9 as East German authorities were moving away from the  Stalinist policies that had been their trademark for 40 years.  </P> <P> Havel visited the East German capital briefly before seeing West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Munich, his first official visits since he was  elected president Friday as part of an agreement among the Czechoslovak  government, opposition groups and the Communist Party.  </P> <P> His trips to the Germanys ahead of one to the Soviet Union reflected a shift in  Czechoslovakia's foreign policy.  </P> <P> Havel said his visits originally were to be symbolic but turned out to be  "working visits."  </P> <P> "We managed to discuss many concrete issues," he said.  </P> <P> In response to a question, Havel said he is opposed to the death penalty but he  said last week's execution of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife  may have saved many lives.  </P> <P> After talks with Gerlach and Prime Minister Hans Modrow, Havel praised recent  developments in East Germany, which has moved away from the Stalinist policies  it had adhered to since its founding 40 years ago.  </P> <P> "All of us Europeans must thank the GDR (East Germany) for having started  pulling down one of the worst walls," said Havel, a playwright and essayist,  who gained prominence during the spring 1968 uprising in Prague that was  crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks.  </P> <P> "This decade must become the decade of Europeans," said Kohl after meeting with  Havel in Munich.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovakian leader also met with West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, President Richard von Weizsaecker and opposition leader  Hans-Jochen Vogel.  </P> <P> Havel, who was jailed for five years for his opposition to the Communist  authorities, was awarded the annual Peace Prize of the Frankfurt Book Fair last  year. The Czechoslovakian government had prevented his traveling to West  Germany to collect the award.  </P> <P> Earlier, Havel declared a New Year's amnesty for common criminals and said his  biggest task is to lead Czechoslovakia toward free elections without violence.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak Justice Minister Dagmar Buresova said in a radio address that the  amnesty will be extensive because many prisoners are serving excessively harsh  sentences. But she said corrupt public officials will be excluded from the  amnesty.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear how many prisoners will be affected by the  amnesty.  </P></p>

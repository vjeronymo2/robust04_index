For those seeking to leave agriculture, programs annually funded under section 402 of the JTPA offer classroom and skill training leading to employment opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Farmworkers opting to remain in agriculture are dependent on an agricultural employment system that is at times affected by weather conditions and changing local labor market needs and economic factors, but is always constant in its unforgiving working conditions and long term negative effect on the farmworker's health and economic well being. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is interested in aiding farmworkers seeking employment opportunities and a future outside of agriculture, while at the same time stabilizing the farm labor force by providing labor market information and enhancing the skills and well being of farmworkers (and their dependents) wishing to remain in agriculture. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Labor is focusing this solicitation on demonstration efforts that will address issues that directly impact the daily lives of farmworkers_both seasonal and migrant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

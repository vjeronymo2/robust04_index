			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO MAINTENANCE WORKERS KILLED IN TUNNEL BLAST AT FORD COMPLEX  </P> <P> Divers located the bodies of two maintenance workers killed Monday when an  early morning explosion rumbled through the underpinnings of Ford Motor Co.'s  Rouge complex.  </P> <P> The victims were identified as Billy Stiener, 27, of Redford and John L. Hatch,  in his early 50s, of Detroit, Ford spokesman John Spelich said.  </P> <P> The bodies were located at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a half-mile-long portion of a  utility tunnel that carries electric, water, steam and compressed air services  to several buildings at the 1,100-acre facility. The tunnel, seven to eight  feet in diameter, was flooded with four to six feet of water after the blast  apparently ruptured a water pipe, Spelich said.  </P> <P> "For the moment, our No. 1 priority is to find out what caused the accident,"  said Alexander J. Trotman, who will become executive vice president for Ford's  North American operations on May 1.  </P> <P> The blast tore holes in parking lots, flipped cars, blew windows from a  three-story power substation and forced the company to shut down a number of  operations, including the Mustang automobile assembly line.  </P> <P> John Schultz, a driver for a bus company Ford contracts to carry people around  the huge complex, said he saw "flames shooting 300 to 500 feet into the air for  a short period of time" shortly after the 6:20 a.m. blast.  </P> <P> Spelich said the two victims were employed by Doetsch Industrial Services Inc.  of Detroit. A woman answering the Doetsch telephone, who refused to give her  name, said the company has done maintenance work at the Rouge complex for  years.  </P></p>

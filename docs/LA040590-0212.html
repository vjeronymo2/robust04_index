			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXECUTIVES ARE RELUCTANT TO RELOCATE TO SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> As major corporations pay more to relocate executives, they are finding  executives less willing to move to Southern California, a new survey said.  </P> <P> Seventy-three percent of the human resources directors surveyed at more than  100 Southern California corporations in Russell Reynolds Associates' annual  executive recruiting study said it is "somewhat" or "very" difficult to  relocate executives here.  </P> <P> In 1989, 71% said it was somewhat or very difficult.  </P> <P> John S. Peterson, an executive recruiter for Russell Reynolds, said the area is  full of business opportunities, but housing is just too expensive. So  corporations find themselves spending more to bring and house executives here.  </P> <P> The survey found that 45% of local corporations spend $40,001 or more to  relocate executives -- those earning $75,000 or more annually -- to Southern  California. That is up from 34% a year ago.  </P> <P> When executives come here, they often have to settle for smaller homes because  of the high prices, Peterson said, adding that he has a client in Pittsburgh  who lives on an acre of land but realizes that "won't be an option" when he  comes out here.  </P> <P> Ninety-two percent of the respondents said housing costs are a major deterrent  in relocating here. Additional factors that make executives think twice before  moving here are earthquakes, commute time, traffic, smog, drugs, gangs and  crime.  </P> <P> "Fifteen years ago, people would have moved to Southern California in a New  York-minute," Peterson said.  </P> <P> In general, to make relocating sweeter, companies are offering sign-on bonuses  and interest-free home loans and guaranteeing job security, he said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the survey found that 55% of executives from here are  reluctant to relocate to other parts of the country.  </P></p>

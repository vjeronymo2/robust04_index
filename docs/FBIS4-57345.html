			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>   [Text] Two important investment banks--one Brazilian and  one American--have decided to immediately withdraw their  investments from the Brazilian financial market.    One of these banks has a $1 billion portfolio of  investments,  of which $700 million comes from abroad.    The decision follows a combination of two factors: The lead  in the polls by PT [Workers Party] candidate Luis Inacio Lula da  Silva and his statements during his meetings with bankers and  investors in the United States.    The comments by Deputy Aloizio Mercadante (PT-SP) [Sao  Paulo], who is considered to be one of the mentors of the PT  economic policy, confirm investors' perception that Lula will  head for a closed, government-controlled, economy with  restrictions on foreign capital.    The decision to begin withdrawing money now from the country  is strategic. Investors believed they would not have to worry  about the subject until September, just before the first voting  round of the presidential elections (3 October). They initially  planned to withdraw the money between the first and second  voting round.    The banks decided to move now given Lula's lead among voter  preference. A good portion of foreign investments is applied in  the stock exchange.    If investors decide to sell en masse there will be big  losses  because prices will drop considerably.    Those who believe Lula will win the elections decided to  start pulling out now, without panic and taking advantage of the  good market quotations.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (17): Colour is starting to catch up - Printers EVER SINCE papyrus was invented, most written and printed communication has been monochromatic. Huge increases in computer power and storage capacities have led to the introduction of colour at the display screen, but colour printing technology has taken a long while to catch up. This is now changing. Soon, colour printers will be available at desktop prices. Users look for different characteristics in their machines. Some need to print sprocket-fed, multipart, continuous stationery. Others want to print on separate sheets of paper and only need one copy at a time. Others may have special requirements such printing envelopes, or labels. Some users don't mind noise, others will insist on near silence. When personal computers first appeared, printers worked by hitting a carbon ribbon on to paper with needles (dot-matrix) or with pre-formed characters (daisy-wheel). The daisy wheel mechanism has almost died out and the impact dot-matrix technology, in spite of many improvements is now giving way to the new inkjet and laser technologies - even though the 24-pin dot-matrix printer can produce print resolutions as good as a laser machine. All dot-matrix printers are noisy. However, they can work with a variety of paper options, including continuous, cut sheet and multi-part paper. The laser and inkjet machines are almost silent in operation. The loudest noise is that of the fan on the laser printer and the paper feed mechanism on the inkjet. The laser machine works rather like a photocopier while the inkjet squirts ink droplets at the paper. Both can print at least 300 dots per inch in each direction, giving a crisp and professional image. The problem of inkjets being smudgy are a thing of the past. They can now match a laser printer for quality, although they run much more slowly. Where a laser printer prints an entire page at once, the inkjet works by sliding an ink cartridge back and forth across the page, edging the paper forward between scans. Should anyone invent an inkjet with a wide, refillable, cartridge, the days of the laser printer could be numbered - the inkjet does its job silently with fewer of the environmental problems of the laser printer. Some inkjet printers take cartridges with multiple ink chambers, each holding a different colour ink. This type of colour printing is available at a low cost. The problem with this approach is that many office documents still need to be printed in black ink. To achieve black on such machines, all three colours need to be used - an expensive way of doing such work. Printers with separate cartridges for each ink colour would be better. An inkjet machine with four cartridges containing the process colours cyan, magenta, yellow and black (CMYK), would satisfy the needs of both colour and monochrome printing. The black cartridge could be replaced separately when exhausted. Colour printing can also be done using dye sublimation, thermal wax transfer or phase-change inkjet technologies. Each of these strives to achieve photographic quality and is therefore more at home in the studio than in the office. According to Dataquest, colour laser printers will be available in 1993. Each of these technologies presents the user with a trade-off between price, quality and speed. In terms of affordable colour, inkjet is certain to take the lead. One other important method is the use of a page description language called PostScript. Instead of sending printing information to the printer character by character, or dot by dot, PostScript sends a description of the page. PostScript printers each contain a computer processor, software and memory, which are used to interpret the PostScript instructions to provide the best quality result. The same PostScript page description can be used by printers of varying resolutions and colours. PostScript makes the printers more expensive, but it reduces the workload on the computer and produces the best results across the widest range of printers. As more printers are connected to computer networks, users are finding themselves physically remote from the machines. This makes it difficult to check things such as the paper status, or which fonts are installed on the machine. It is inevitable that printers will begin to return more detailed status information to users. Ian Mitchell, associate director of Dataquest's document management group, said: 'It's time for printers to speak up for themselves.' He believes that 'inkjet is probably the new ground for commercial printing of the future. 'I believe it will replace the 24-pin dot-matrix market within five years, and will most certainly curtail the downward migration of current page printer technology. I believe that colour will almost certainly be cheaper on inkjet than laser.'</p>

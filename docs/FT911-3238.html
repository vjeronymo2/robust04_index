			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Major proposes UN arms register PLANS for establishing a United Nations arms register to provide an early warning system of countries building up excessive arms stockpiles, were spelt out by Mr John Major, the prime minister, yesterday, Alison Smith writes. In an interview on Sky news, Mr Major said the register would rely the registration of arms sales by the suppliers. 85 per cent of arms predominately come from the five permanent members of the UN security council. The idea should be considered at the UN and at the Group of Seven economic summit in the summer, he said. He acknowledged that the ability to purchase arms through third parties meant that it would not be a perfect solution. Even so, it would 'focus minds on the difficulties that arise when there are too many armaments in too confined a space and in unsafe hands.' Asked about the future of the Kurds, he said that there must be certainty that the safe havens were not used as a jumping off point for incursions into Iraq, but that the immediate question was getting them to come down from the mountains. Questioned about the allies' attitude to co-operation from the Iraqi government, he confirmed he still believed that while Saddam Hussein remained in power, Iraq would be 'a pariah.' The Ministry of Defence admitted yesterday that Britain will have no frontline ground-to-air missile defences against enemy aircraft attacks for four years, after the current medium-range Bloodhound missiles are phased out this year. A replacement would not be ready until the middle of the decade, officials said.</p>

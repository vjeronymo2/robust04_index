			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Afghan leaders ready to hand power to mujahideen THE remnants of Afghanistan's government promised yesterday to hand over control to mujahideen guerrillas but the rebel groups remain divided about how to share power. Acting president Abdul Rahim Hatif told a news conference the government was ready to step down but 'the problem is that the mujahideen must unite together' to allow a peaceful transfer of power. At the same time a United Nations special envoy failed to persuade a military chieftain to give deposed president Najibullah safe passage out of the country. Najibullah was reported still to be sheltering in UN offices in Kabul after being turned back in an attempt to leave Kabul airport last week. In spite of old rivalries, there are many signs of heavily armed mujahideen groups and former government forces working together near Kabul. One army colonel, grinning at several guerrillas, said he had been told two days ago to co-operate with the mujahideen, though a year ago 'I would have killed them'. On a road littered with burnt-out army vehicles, a bus passed with mujahideen riding on the roof, aiming to help the army reinforce security against another rival mujahideen group. The government has lost control of all big provincial cities except Jalalabad in the east, where the mujahideen are negotiating with local commanders. A northern-based coalition of mujahideen forces under Ahmad Shah Masood, the Jamiat-i-Islami leader who is a minority Tajik, has continued to extend its sway over much of Afghanistan. His forces are based some 50 miles north of Kabul. But Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who heads the rival Hezb-i-Islami group and is a member of the Pathan majority, has threatened to attack the capital if the government does not capitulate by April 26. His forces are to the south of Kabul. Masood has said he will not attack Kabul while peace talks continue with the government. Guerrillas loyal to him are alongside government troops south of Kabul to block the advance of Hekmatyar, his bitter enemy. Masood's coalition seemed in an increasingly strong position to impose the type of radical mujahideen government that the UN and western governments have resisted. The UN special envoy, Mr Benon Sevan, who is striving for a peaceful transfer of power, was reported to have flown to the northern town of Mazar-i-Sharif yesterday to try to secure safe passage for ex-president Najibullah. He had a meeting there with General Rashid Dostum, whose forces control Kabul airport. But the general, who abandoned Najibullah last month, was reported to have complained to the UN envoy for sheltering the deposed president and demanded that Najibullah be put on trial. A diplomat said Mr Sevan's long search for peace in Afghanistan had finally centred on persuading Najibullah to quit office and he felt personally responsible for Najibullah's fate. Diplomats expect Mr Sevan to pursue efforts to get Najibullah out of the country. Peace beckons as opponents forge links, Page 4</p>

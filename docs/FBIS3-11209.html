			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Javier Ignacio Mayorca] </F>   [Text] This week, the Congress will begin to take up the  challenge of revising the Constitution of the nation. In this  connection, a group of jurists made up of Jose Guillermo  Andueza, Ricardo Combellas, and Tulio Alvarez have completed the  drafting of the document containing the proposals pertinent to  this effort that will be set forth by the National Convergence  spokesmen.    It appears that this effort will be plagued by obstacles.  There are sectors in Congress that belong to various political  movements and that favor beginning the discussions on  constitutional reform again, from the zero mark. This would  involve setting aside four years of work carried out by the  Bicameral Commission, over which Rafael Caldera, the  president-elect, presided.    The Convergence, for its part, wants a new Constitution  approved this year. To this end, Jose Guillermo Andueza will  meet at 1100 this morning with the board of the Supreme Court of  Justice to analyze possible changes in the judicial branch.    The strategy involves launching a discussion with all  sectors  in the country as soon as possible and maintaining the idea that  the work of many years should not be jettisoned simply because  sectors interested in blocking the "initiatives for change"  might exist.    The document in question is entitled "Proposed  Constitutional  Reform (comments on the proposal approved by the Senate on first  discussion)." It is 44 pages long and, as was to be expected, it  deals with many aspects. The most novel were chosen for the  purposes of this article.    The editorial commission agreed that the four types of  referendum, or direct vote by the citizens on specific  proposals, should be maintained. They are the approbatory,  abrogative, consultative, and revocatory forms.    According to the document, the initiative for the  convocation  of an approbatory referendum should come from the majority of  the members of one of the legislative chambers, "and not while  they are meeting in joint session."    Also, reconsideration of the Senate proposal according to  which this form could also be used when 5 percent of the  electors in each body so desire was recommended. This was not,  however, set forth as an alternate proposal.    Where the revocatory referendum on members of the executive  branch designated prior to election is concerned, the document  deems it desirable that the requirement for convocation be  reduced. That requirement is currently estimated at 15 percent  of the registered electors, "and its effects on revocation of  the mandate when more than 50 percent have cast negative votes."    The document also proposes that the authority of such a  referendum be extended to include the dissolution of the  Congress as a whole, rather than just its members considered  individually."    Concerning the abrogative referendum for revoking laws, the  document urges "reconsideration of the Senate proposal to limit  the time allowed for convocation to the six months following  approval of the law." There were no comments made on the  proposal regarding the advisory referendum.    With the Convergence version of a new constitution, not only  would it be possible to dissolve the parliament through an  electoral method, but the president of the Republic could also  dissolve it, as suggested by Francisco Eguiogunen, the Peruvian  treatise writer.    On this basis, if the chief of state had to deal with an  adverse parliament, he could order it dissolved and could  immediately convoke new elections.    If the balance of forces should fail to change, the  executive  branch would then find itself under interdiction and would have  to be replaced. If, on the contrary, votes favorable to the  government party were obtained, this would be interpreted as  popular support of the executive administration.    On the state level, the norm would be modified, since  according to the document, the legislative assemblies could only  be dissolved if the people were to approve the governor's  administration, after the legislature itself had rejected the  reports and statements. This represents an effort to establish a  mechanism for exerting control over possible "political  excesses."    The document of the Andueza-Combellas-Alvarez commission  expresses the belief that "the complexity of government  functions has made it necessary to rethink the possibility of  establishing the position of prime minister" in order to assist  the president in the task of coordinating the work of the  executive branch.    The duties of this official would include the following,  among others: to propose the appointment and removal of cabinet  members; to coordinate the national plans with those of the  states and municipalities; to receive the accounting reports of  the ministers; and to take responsibility for the relations  between the executive and legislative branches.    According to recommendations of this document, the prime  minister could be removed by presidential decision, or after  approval of a censure motion by at least three-fifths of the  members of the Chamber of Deputies. This would entail, in  addition, the resignation of the entire cabinet.    Because of space limitations, other aspects dealt with in  the  document (elimination of the Judicature Council, reestablishment  of the contracts of national interest, creation of frontier  zones, etc.) could not be included in this article. The debate  is just beginning, however, and the plan that emerges from it  will have to be submitted to the people for approval, on a basis  similar to the Guatemalan experience last Sunday.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Individual permits are required for the discharge of fill material that would fill or adversely modify greater than 10 acres of wetlands or any size wetland if proposed or listed species are present and could be adversely affected by the proposed activity. The review process for the issuance of individual permits is more rigorous than for nationwide permits. Unlike nationwide permits, an analysis of cumulative wetland impacts is required for individual permit applications. Resulting permits may include special conditions that require avoidance or mitigation of environmental impacts. On nationwide permits, the Corps has discretionary authority to require an applicant to seek an individual permit if the Corps believes that the resources are sufficiently important, regardless of the wetland's size. In practice, the Corps rarely requires an individual permit when a project would qualify for a nationwide permit, except when a threatened or endangered species or other significant resource would be adversely affected by the proposed activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the populations of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> occur in wetlands that are less than 10 acres in size. Many are only a few square yards, and many are in wetlands with no surface drainage to streams (i.e., ``isolated''). Therefore, filling them could fall under Nationwide Permit No. 26. If  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is listed as endangered, formal consultation with the Service would be required before the Corps could issue an individual section 404 permit that may adversely affect the lily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The primary long-term natural threat to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> s competitive exclusion by shrubs and trees as a result of succession in bogs and coastal prairie/scrub. Human activities such as draining of wetlands, clearing of land, elimination of beaver, and stabilization of moving sand areas have interrupted the natural processes of bog and wetland creation. As late-stage bogs and coastal scrub go through succession to forest, lily habitat is eliminated with little new habitat being created. There is some indication that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> populations have been maintained in the past by periodic fires, perhaps set by native Americans (Schultz 1989). Charcoal is abundant in the soil at several of the major populations, indicating past fires. Fires are now rare events in these areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Young plants of this species are almost always recruited under shrub cover, but the lily is shaded out if the canopy cover is greater than 50 percent or shrubs are over 2 meters (6 ft) high. Several populations and portions of populations have already been extirpated by forest succession. Eleven populations (ranging from 2 to about 1,000 plants) currently are seriously stressed from competition, as indicated by low reproductive rates (Schultz 1989). Individual plants do not flower every year, apparently as an energy-saving mechanism when stressed. Health of a population can be evaluated by the number of flowering versus non-flowering plants, and the number of blooms per plant. It has been suggested that the 11 stressed populations would probably survive less than a decade without habitat manipulation (Schultz 1989). Invasion by the exotic shrub gorse ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ulex europaeus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) into the bog habitat of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> has eliminated suitable habitat in Oregon near Blacklock Point (Ballantyne 1980).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At four California ranch populations, livestock exclosure fences have solved the immediate problem of overgrazing (Dave Imper, pers. comm., 1992). A limited amount of grazing may actually benefit the species by preventing succession. Over time, without habitat management, forest succession within the exclosures would limit the lilies to the well-lighted edges of the exclosures and reproduction would deteriorate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some populations are so small (2 to 100 flowering plants) that loss of genetic variability is a threat. Plants with genetic abnormalities such as 4-merous flowers, tepals replacing stamens, stamens replacing tepals, and double flowers have been observed over two or more seasons at sites in both California and Oregon. The effects of inbreeding may already be adversely affecting the viability of these small populations and remains a future threat to the plant (Schultz 1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> L. occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> as endangered. This species occupies an extremely restricted geographic range and is comprised of a total of 2,000 to 3,000 flowering individuals. Residential development, conversion of habitat to cranberry farms, shrub and tree succession, overcollection, vandalism, overgrazing, and loss of genetic diversity threaten this plant with extinction. Because the plant is in danger of extinction throughout its range, it fits the definition of endangered under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat is not being designated for this species for reasons discussed in the ``Critical Habitat'' section of this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time the species is listed. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for this species. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lilium occidentale  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> is threatened by taking. The publication of precise maps and descriptions of critical habitat in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , as required for the designation of critical habitat, would increase the degree of threat to this species from take or vandalism and, therefore, could contribute to its decline and increase enforcement problems. The listing of this species under the Act publicizes the rarity of the species and, thus, could make this plant attractive to researchers, curiosity seekers, or collectors of wildflowers or rare plants. All involved parties and landowners have been notified of the importance of protecting this species' habitat. Protection of the species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery process and the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, the Service finds that designation of critical habitat for this species is not prudent at this time because such designation would increase the degree of threat from collecting or other human activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain activities. Recognition through listing results in public awareness and conservation actions by Federal, State, and local agencies, private organizations, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

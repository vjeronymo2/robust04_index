			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Sargin under the rubric "Scandal": "A </F> Soft Landing to You, Mr. President!"]    [Text] It is interesting whether the president of  Russia will be able to endure aerobatic maneuvers, such as  "loops" or "rolls," and still retain his ability to work. It  appears that we will not have to wait long for the outcome of a  bold experiment. However, let us have everything in proper  order.    Few people know that the plane carrying B.N. Yeltsin has  already repeatedly been on the brink of crashing, and that this  has not been arranged for him by his foreign partners but rather  by his own pilots.    The first case. Returning from Yakutsk on 18 June  1993, chief pilot A. Larin, the commander of a separate aviation  detachment of civil aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry  of Transportation, landed the plane in Vnukovo flying 1,350  meters further than prescribed. B. Yeltsin was on board the  plane at the time. The second case. Without  restricting himself to what had already been achieved, A. Larin  flew an excessive 1,400 meters at the already mentioned Vnukovo  when returning from Warsaw on 24 August 1993 (the president was  on board the plane on this occasion, too). Incidentally, if  excess flight by an Il-62 comes to no more than 800 meters, the  pilot receives a grade of "three" for such a blunder in the  flight critique. There is no need to say what the aforementioned  numbers "merit." The length of the runway at Vnukovo is 3,050  meters; the flight operations manual for the Il-62 says that the  runway for its landing should be no shorter than 2,700 meters.  Therefore, had it not been for good meteorological conditions,  the presidential liner would have plowed into the fields of  Vnukovo. To be sure, B. Yeltsin is already accustomed to this;  he experienced hard landings as early as 1990, and in Spain,  when he was "disgraced." Apparently this is what the culprits in  these emergencies counted on, as they concealed the emergencies  from the leadership of the country. Prior to these cases there  had been no flight accidents in "detachment No. 1."    The crews of the Separate Aviation Detachment of Civil  Aviation of the Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation  have carried everyone on their liners! After all, this  enterprise, known as detachment No. 235, is intended to carry  specifically "the powers that be." Naturally, the professional  standard of the flight personnel in the detachment is  exceptionally high. Pilots are prepared to fly to any point in  the world with the highest degree of flight safety. Cadres for  the "Tsar's stable" were selected from the entire USSR, and  subsequently Russia. Pilots considered it an honor to work here.  Unfortunately, they do not consider it so at present.    When the new commander A. Larin came in on 6 November 1992,  the detachment changed course in the direction of commerce. Of  course, the times are now such that one has got to "hustle."  Here are some examples of the new approach.    Recently, the Gazprom Joint-Stock Company acquired the  French  plane Falkon-900-B (the total amount of the contract was $32  million; operating the plane costs $300,000-400,000 per month).  Gazprom leased the Falkon-900-B to "detachment No. 1" so that  this 14-passenger superliner, which Saudi sheikhs like in  particular, would also work for Gazprom. Of course, it is  pleasant to fly a farewell circle on such a plane over the  undernourished, strike-bound Nadym and fly away, say, to Vienna,  which is where representatives of the aforementioned joint-stock  company indeed went aboard the plane. However, the same amount  of money could have bought eight or 10 domestic planes of the  Il-62 or Tu-154 types.    A. Larin liked the Falkon so much that he went to France  together with his wife in order to learn to fly planes of this  type, too. The president's personal pilot got carried away by  the miracle vehicle to such a degree that he remained in that  hospitable country through the dramatic days of 1-5 October 1993.    In the recent past one civil aviation directorate mastered  one type of plane per year. Under the new management the  "government aviation detachment" intends to master four types in  half a year. So, highly rated specialists have been quitting the  detachments in the belief that this is adventurism (during the  past year more than 30 people have left, and there have been  cases of entire crews quitting. These are the flying elite!).  They used to think that "high turnover" and this detachment were  two incompatible things.    The management of the Rossiya airline is seeking truly royal  funding from the state. For example, 18 billion rubles have  already been paid for two An-124's. The justification for their  acquisition was to "develop new equipment," although at present  the detachment operates planes of six or seven types, and it is  not necessary to spend this kind of money on new aircraft. Seven  billion rubles have been requested to purchase a Tu-204 plane.  The management of the Rossiya airline intends to carry out  service tests on the plane, although this is a function of  service enterprises and by no means of the special aviation  detachment. Funds have also been requested for a few Il-96's for  scheduled rather than special flights.    As is known, on 3 December 1993 B. Yeltsin signed an edict  on  reorganizing the detachment into the Rossiya state  transportation company, having agreed "with the proposal of the  management and the council of the labor collective" of the  detachment. Thereafter A. Larin announced that Rossiya does not  report to either the Air Transportation Department or the  Russian Federation Ministry of Transportation, but solely to the  president. Of course, one may not be subordinated to the  department but one cannot fail to be guided by its documents  concerning control and, finally, safety. This is fraught with  consequences! We will not get away with just a "plowed field" in  this case.    Where does A. Larin's "clout" come from? From his crying  from  the rooftops that he is a man appointed personally by the  president. This appears to be so. As we have learned, he was  appointed detachment commander for personal devotion to the  president. It is interesting to know what is more important to  B. Yeltsin: his life, which depends on a lack of  professionalism, or servility, on which, it seems, nothing  depends?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Chu Baoping (2806 0202 1627)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Apr (XINHUA) -- While it will soon be  "1 May" International Labor Day, the Ministry of Power Industry  and Ministry of Chemical Industry separately held meetings on  commending model workers and advanced collectives of their  respective industries in Beijing today. Vice Premier Li Lanqing  attended both meetings and had group photos taken with those  representatives present.    Li Lanqing said: Since the start of reform and opening up, a  great deal of good technology and management expertise has been  introduced into our country. However, it is unavoidable that a  few flies will get into the house when the windows are open.  For this reason, it is even more necessary to step up the  building of spiritual civilization, and strengthen ideological  and political work. Some people think we can attract more  foreign investment with some unhealthy practices; I think that  it is an extremely big mistake. Tolerating such unhealthy  things will only worsen China's investment environment. We must  not permit anyone to undermine our investment environment and  spiritual civilization with such unhealthy practices as the  "three companions [to provide clients with female companions at  dinner, drinking, and dance parties]."    He said: Reform, opening up, and the development of a  socialist market economy have created favorable conditions for  China's economic development. However, national prosperity is  the result of hard work, not a windfall. We must emphasize over  and over that our cause requires the display of unselfish  dedication and hard work, and it also requires thousands upon  thousands of model workers to play a backbone and leading role.  Both the power and chemical industry are China's basic  industries, playing an important role in our economic life. At  present, our country should accelerate the development of basic  industries.    The Ministry of Power Industry today conferred the honorific  title "national special model worker of the power industry" on  Zheng Changfei and 10 other workers and staff members, with a  bonus of 10,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations;  the honorific title "national model worker of the power  industry" on Tang Zhihong and 305 other comrades, with a bonus  of 8,000 yuan apiece to be issued by their organizations; and  the honorific title "national advanced collective of the power  industry" on 100 organizations, including the No. 1 boiler plant  of the Qinling Power Plant.    The Ministry of Chemical Industry has decided to confer the  honorific title "national model worker of the chemical industry"  on Wang Yongan and 379 other comrades; the honorific title  "national distinguished ideological and political worker of the  chemical industry for 1991-1993" on Cai Dejun and 99 other  comrades; and the honorific title "enterprise of excellent  ideological and political work for 1991-1993" on Beijing No. 2  Chemical Plant and 47 other chemical industry enterprises and  institutions.    State councillor Luo Gan attended the commendation meeting  of  the Ministry of Power Industry. Yu Qiuli, Qian Zhengying, Zhang  Dinghua, and other leading comrades concerned also attended  today's meeting.</p>

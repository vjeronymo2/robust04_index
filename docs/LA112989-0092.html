			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA REAL ESTATE SHAKEN UP;  </P> <P> HOUSING: SALES OF SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES WERE DOWN 26.7% IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER.  BUT THE POPULAR VIEW IS THAT THE MARKET WILL BOUNCE BACK ONCE THE QUAKE DAMAGE  IS REPAIRED.  </P> <P> For the seller of one house in San Francisco's posh Marina district, it was a  nightmare.  </P> <P> The Oct. 17 earthquake gave a buyer cold feet, and a $950,000 deal fell out of  escrow. But another buyer from Hong Kong immediately stepped in, and the house  sold a few days ago for $900,000.  </P> <P> In hard-hit Santa Cruz, one broker is selling a corner lot for $175,000. The  five-unit, yellow clapboard apartment building that had stood on the site --  and might have commanded a price of $300,000 if it had not rattled apart in the  quake -- lies in a heap.  </P> <P> Throughout the Bay Area, real estate brokers and would-be home sellers and  buyers are feeling economic aftershocks from the devastating 7.1-magnitude  temblor. Sellers have lowered prices. Buyers have backed out of deals. Escrow  closings have been delayed and brokers are suffering reduced sales commissions.  </P> <P> Numbers released Tuesday by the California Assn. of Realtors gave the first  firm indication that the quake, indeed, had a negative effect on property  values. Bay Area single-family home sales fell a sharp 26.7% in October from  the year-ago levels. But perhaps more telling, the median home price dropped  1.4% from the previous month.  </P> <P> But brokers -- facing lost or reduced commissions -- attempted Tuesday to cast  the figures in as favorable a light as possible.  </P> <P> After all, they say, one can blame some of the decline on the normally slow  holiday season. Moreover, after a long period of torrid sales and price  increases, housing activity in the San Francisco area and elsewhere in the  state had tapered off, putting buyers in the driver's seat and keeping a lid on  prices.  </P> <P> And, brokers point out, some housing transactions that were disrupted by the  quake to allow buyers time to inspect properties anew are simply taking longer  to work their way through escrow.  </P> <P> In the 15 business days after the quake, escrow closings on single-family  dwellings in the Bay Area declined an average of 12% to 15% from the 15  business days before the temblor, according to John Karevoll of Dataquick  Information Services, a data company in La Jolla. San Francisco County showed  the sharpest drop, 26%. Last year, he said, there was no significant difference  between the first half and the second half of the month.  </P> <P> Ann Scherbert, resident sales manager in the San Francisco office of Coldwell  Banker, a real estate brokerage firm, blames much of the October decline on the  season. "And we're in a buyer's market," she said. "People have been denying it  for quite some time, but we're clearly in it."  </P> <P> Figuring the temblor would scare off some buyers, Coldwell Banker advised many  would-be sellers to hold off a bit before putting their houses on the market  immediately after the quake.  </P> <P> "It takes some time to recover," said real estate broker Pius Lee, a Marina  resident. "When you repair (all the damage), the market will come back. I still  have a lot of confidence that the houses will continue to go up in the  neighborhood."  </P> <P> Lee's California Realty &amp; Land Inc. represented the Hong Kong buyer of the  $900,000 home in the Marina, in a prime location across from the Palace of Fine  Arts. The buyer had actually made a stand-by offer of more than $900,000 when  the home was in escrow with the original $950,000 bid. After the earthquake,  the original buyer halted the deal, and the Hong Kong bidder stepped up, asked  to view the property, then negotiated the lower price because of some quake  damage.  </P> <P> The seller, Lee said, was "very happy" because it would have been difficult to  capture a $900,000 price otherwise.  </P> <P> Lee expects housing prices to remain soft for at least another month or so,  with 5% to 10% declines typical in the Marina and other heavily damaged areas.  </P> <P> He figures that his agency's business is off by 15% to 20%. At least one  $800,000 apartment sale on Post Street near the Tenderloin was lost because of  the quake. "My saleslady felt bad," he said. No wonder. She lost out on a  $40,000 commission.  </P> <P> Marina sales activity undoubtedly suffered from the presence of barricades  erected after the quake to keep out gawkers as utility workers and contractors  went about the business of shoring up damaged buildings and restoring power.  </P> <P> Until last Thursday, only residents who showed identification with their home  addresses were allowed past guards. Power and water service were only recently  restored to some residences; many Marina residents have had to shower in  trailers set up in the middle of streets by the Department of Water and Power.  </P> <P> Broker optimism aside, clearly it will take some time for the memory of crushed  neighbors, falling-down buildings and flattened cars to fade. On several  corners in the Marina district, apartment buildings that came crashing down had  to be demolished. In all, 60 homes and apartment buildings were lost in the  district. One apartment building hung a triangular green sign reading "Safe."  </P> <P> Scherbert of Coldwell Banker, also a Marina resident, said most buildings that  tilted off their foundations have been pushed back into place "so they don't  look so cockeyed." Sidewalks are being repaired, and things are largely getting  back to normal. Now that non-residents are once again strolling the  neighborhood, Scherbert expects business to pick up.  </P> <P> In Santa Cruz County, 63 residences were destroyed by the quake. Throughout the  picturesque college town of Santa Cruz, the streets echo with the sounds of  hammering and buzz-sawing as repair workers fix up damaged homes.  </P> <P> At the corner of Center and Elm streets, a sign for Susan Liebl Properties has  been hung on a window of a collapsed 50-year-old apartment building. It stood  on poorly compacted soil in the so-called liquefaction zone, where shaking was  magnified and many buildings suffered extensive damage.  </P> <P> The San Francisco owner put the property on the market immediately after the  quake. Liebl, whose firm is based in nearby Aptos, said she hopes the deal will  close about year-end, 2 1/2 months after the temblor. Meanwhile, the owner is  losing rental income.  </P> <P> "He is recouping close to his investment (in the property)," Liebl said.  However, "he just has to eat" the loss of appreciation.  </P> <P> Liebl noted that she got about 30 calls on the listing.  </P> <P> "Buyers are thinking they can pick up properties for a song," she said. "But I  don't see a lot of people jumping to put houses on the market. You don't see a  lot of panic selling.  </P> <P> "I don't think the earthquake truly scared anybody away except my relatives in  Kansas."  </P> <P> HOUSING MARKET DECLINES  </P> <P> The housing market in California declined in October, as prices fell and home  resales dropped.

			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMANY'S ROLE UP TO NATO, BAKER SAYS;  </P> <P> REUNIFICATION: HE RULES OUT ANY VOICE FOR THE SOVIETS IN DECIDING IF THE UNITED  COUNTRY WILL STAY IN THE WESTERN ALLIANCE.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday that the Soviet Union,  despite its rights as a victorious power in World War II, has no authority to  block a reunited Germany from membership in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization.  </P> <P> Baker said a meeting beginning Saturday among the foreign ministers of West and  East Germany and the four victorious wartime Allies -- the United States, the  Soviet Union, Britain and France -- has no power to decide matters that go  beyond the status of Berlin and other issues left over from the postwar  occupation of Germany.  </P> <P> It was the first time that Baker has sought to draw such a fine distinction on  the scope of the upcoming negotiations, known as the "two-plus-four" talks. In  the past, the U.S. government sought, without success, to persuade Moscow to  agree to a reunited Germany being a NATO member.  </P> <P> The secretary of state spoke to reporters aboard his Air Force jet while en  route to Europe, where he will attend a NATO foreign ministers meeting here  today before the two-plus-four session in Bonn.  </P> <P> He said it is up to a unified Germany and the other 15 members of NATO to  decide matters affecting German membership in the alliance. At the same time,  he said NATO has already begun to change from a primarily military alliance to  a forum for political consultation, a step that may win the support of East  German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.  </P> <P> During a recent visit to Moscow, De Maiziere said he would support German  membership in NATO provided there were changes in the alliance's "structure and  strategy."  </P> <P> "I'm not sure I know the degree to which -- and how -- he thinks it should be  transformed," Baker commented, but he added that a transformation is taking  place.  </P> <P> Baker said the agenda for today's meeting reflects NATO's "new political  mission and greater political focus." He said the session will cover German  reunification, European security matters, Lithuania and U.S.-Soviet relations.  </P> <P> "I don't think you can get much more political than that," he said.  </P> <P> The two-plus-four forum for German unification was launched last February. At  that time, the six foreign ministers said in a joint communique that the  meetings were intended to "discuss external aspects of the establishment of  German unity, including the issues of security of the neighboring states."  </P> <P> In his comments Wednesday, Baker said that the key word in the earlier  statement was "discuss." He said the two-plus-four meeting can discuss  everything but that it has very limited power to make binding decisions.  </P> <P> "The question of whether the unified Germany should be a member of NATO is a  question that is properly decided in NATO, with the participation of the united  Germany," Baker said. "The question of the extent and degree of future  involvement of German forces is a matter that is not appropriately decided  within the context of two-plus-four, but rather within the context of the  (conventional forces in Europe) discussions in Vienna."  </P> <P> U.S. officials earlier had expressed concern that Moscow's opposition to German  membership in NATO could slow the reunification process. However, Baker said  Wednesday that the Soviet role is limited to its rights as a postwar occupying  power. Except for the continuing four-power role in Berlin, most of those  rights were relinquished long ago by Moscow and its three Western wartime  allies.  </P></p>

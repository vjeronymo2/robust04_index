			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Sony to invest in India Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics group, is planning a Dollars 10m investment in India to market and make colour TVs, broadcasting equipment, software and other high-tech products, Stefan Wagstyl reports from New Delhi. The company, which secured approval for its proposals this week from the Indian government, intends to start local production of television tubes and other components over the next three years. Sony has yet to announce details of its investment programme, which is modest in an industry in which a single large factory can cost Dollars 100m and more. But Sony's decision will be a boost for India's economic liberalisation policies. The relevant government committee has approved 65 projects which together envisage foreign investment totalling Rs5bn (Pounds 102m). Other proposed ventures include a co-operation between the state-owned Indian Telephone Industries and NKT Electronic of Denmark to make fibre optic transmission systems.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Investment gains boost Royale Belge ROYALE Belge, the Belgian insurer, pushed up pre-tax profits in the first half of 1993 by 32 per cent, from BFr3.6bn to BFr4.75bn (Dollars 135m) on the back of a strong increase in net investment gains. Royale Belge, which is controlled by UAP, the French insurer, cautioned against expecting a similar rise in the second half. This year investment gains were concentrated in the first half, whereas in 1992 they were spread across the whole year, the company explained. Profits for the full year would probably rise by 10 per cent after tax, said Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, the company's chief executive. In 1992, the group recorded a net consolidated profit of BFr4.4bn, up 3.6 per cent on 1991. The group's operating results rose by only 1.4 per cent from BFr2.7bn in the first half of 1992, to BFr2.74bn in the first half of this year. But investment gains nearly doubled to BFr2.39bn, mainly through the sale of property and shares. Turnover in the first half of this year increased by 8.2 per cent to BFr53.7bn (BFr49.6bn), with premium income rising from BFr33.8bn to nearly BFr36bn. The company said that its workplace accidents and reinsurance business had recovered well.</p>

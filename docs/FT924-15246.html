			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Book publishers shrug off the recession BOOK publishers may have suffered some bad months this year but over the past 10 years they have enjoyed real growth of 35 per cent. Even during the recession, publishers appear to have maintained turnover in real terms, according to statistics from the Publishers Association, the industry trade body. The PA Book Trade Year Book 1992, compiled by Mr Francis Fishwick, a publishing specialist at the Cranfield School of Management, shows a Pounds 2.5bn UK book market with exports well in excess of Pounds 500m. There are also additional earnings from rights sales and publishing activities overseas. 'In spite of the current difficult economic circumstances, the 1992 Year Book shows good growth by the UK book industry during the past 10 years, particularly in the consumer market,' the association says. The main exception is the school textbook market, which has suffered through cuts in public spending and declining school population. In 1991, consumer books accounted for Pounds 1.56bn in the UK, schools Pounds 165m, academic/professional Pounds 505m, with imports totalling Pounds 290m. The most recent figures show Britons bought more books per head of population than the French or the Dutch but fewer than either Germans or Americans. Overall, book prices from 1985-91 rose generally level with the cost of living, but the report concedes that the figures may hide a tendency for the price of new hardback fiction and mass market paperbacks to rise faster than the cost of living. The number of titles published has risen from 46,215 in 1981 to 68,348 in 1991. Over the past five years, the financial performance of the industry appears to have deteriorated, with the return on capital employed declining from 21 per cent in 1985 to 11.4 per cent in 1990-91. Precise comparisons are difficult, however, because industry restructurings led to revaluations of capital employed. The PA Book Trade Year Book 1992.

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Observer: Deep thinkers Focusing attention on the fact that three out of the five new members of the prime minister's policy unit are women misses the point. The ideas of the new team are far more important than its sex. Unlike its predecessor, the new team does not have to concentrate on the short-term objective of winning an election. Two of the new faces - David Poole and Damian Green - are well known in the City. Poole, son of a former Tory party chairman, used to be with Capel Cure Myers and more recently ran James Capel's corporate finance side. If the government is to take a look at the pensions business, Poole is the man to watch. Green, presenter of Channel 4 Business and a 'Heathite' Tory, has some interesting ideas on the future of the TV licence fee - which could make the BBC twitchy. Meanwhile, civil servant Jill Rutter's career does not seem to have been blighted by her work on the poll tax and Lucy Neville-Rolfe comes from a well-connected family. Of the existing team, Sarah Hogg's deputy remains Nick True, the man largely credited with having turned the Citizen's Charter from a bright idea in the prime minister's mind to the centrepiece of his strategy for improving the public services. Alan Rosling, son of Hanson vice-chairman Derek Rosling, also remains on board.</p>

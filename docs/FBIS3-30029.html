He said this was expected since no one would in his right  mind admit being involved in espionage. He disclosed this to  reporters after the breaking of fast at the Police Training  Center in Kuala Lumpur last night. However, Tan Sri Rahim said  police would continue with investigation into the allegations.  Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed was also present  at the function attended by some 1,000 police personnel of all  ranks.</p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Lord Young voices doubts on sell-offs LORD YOUNG of Graffham, chairman of Cable and Wireless and new president of the Institute of Directors, believes that the establishment of a true single market in Europe may take 20 years, that privatisation in the UK might be going too far and that politics, the Civil Service and business would benefit from easier career interchange. He presents his views in an interview in the January issue of Director magazine. The single market will work in time even if the situation in telecommunications, for example, is 'appalling', he says. 'There are monopolies all over Europe, except in the UK, where we have . . . liberalised.' He says: 'In France and Germany there is no competition. The European Commission has been trying hard to get competition going, and surprise, surprise, it's been the French that have been stopping it. 'At the moment it can cost three times as much to telephone across Europe than it would to telephone across a similar distance in the US.' Lord Young approves of the privatisation of Cable and Wireless, British Aerospace, British Airways, British Leyland and British Telecom, 'solid commercial companies which for some bizarre reason were owned by the government'. But he has doubts about more recent candidates such as coal or the railways. 'We may be reaching a bit too far and it may just be there are some things which are quasi-commercial and should be left in the public sector,' he says. He is sad that few people have followed his varied career path and would encourage short-term commissions in the Civil Service for graduates.</p>

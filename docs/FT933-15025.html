			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Fashion: Perfect shirts - Lucia van der Post visits Hilditch &amp; Key ANYBODY who has ever read The Great Gatsby will remember the description of Gatsby's shirts 'piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high'. So beautiful were these 'shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel' they made Daisy cry. They came, it hardly needs saying, from England which is still the home of the finest of the fine, still the place to which international designers turn when in search of that illusive thing: the perfect shirt. Take Karl Lagerfeld. All his personal shirts, which run to somewhere between 100 and 200 a year, are made for him by the old-established Jermyn Street shirtmaker, Hilditch &amp; Key. More than that, H &amp; K also makes all the catwalk shirts for his shows - for Chanel, Chloe, Lagerfeld and Fendi. Pompidou and Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich and M Balladur have all been fans of the Hilditch &amp; Key way with two-fold cotton poplin. Making truly high-quality shirts in these mass- manufacturing days is a niche business, never likely, because of the costs and the handwork involved, to make its owners rich. Michael Booth, who bought H &amp; K 17 years ago when it had a turnover of Pounds 200,000 a year and sold between 1,000 and 1,500 shirts, has taken it to the point where today it has a turnover of about Pounds 4m and sells between 60,000 and 70,000 shirts a year. He sees it as a small, specialised business which is almost a last bastion of traditional shirt-making skills. Given that there are, as Booth puts it, 'lots of reasonable shirts around' selling at about Pounds 25 a time, why is it that shirtmakers such as H &amp; K need to charge anything between Pounds 55 (H &amp; K's lowest price in normal times) and Pounds 115 (Turnbull &amp; Asser's top price) for their wares? With good quality shirts what counts is, as the late Lord Marks is alleged to have said in another context, 'detail, detail, detail.' They should be made of fine two-fold cotton poplin. If made of striped material the stripes should be matched on the placket, on a split yoke, between the shoulders and sleeve, as well as on the pocket and on the gauntlet attached to the sleeves. The stitching also tells a lot. Single-needle stitching is much stronger and therefore finer than double-stitching (which is faster and cheaper). The collar should be made of two pieces with removable bones for a better fit and longer wear. Buttons should be mother of pearl and the back of the shirt should be 2 cm longer than the front - so that it will not come out. And if all that attention to detail seems wasted on a mere man H &amp; K now has a range for women - mostly made from the same two-fold cotton poplin but there are some in linen and a few in silk, some classic, some highly fashionable.</p>

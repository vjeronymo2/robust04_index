			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Odetics Inc., an Anaheim technology company, is having a difficult time  persuading a small New York firm to accept its unsolicited buyout offer.  </P> <P> Last month, Odetics offered to purchase Ithaco Inc., a maker of attitude  control devices for spacecraft, for $6 per share, or $1.8 million. But Ithaco's  board of directors has snubbed the offer.  </P> <P> On Monday, Odetics said it has extended until May 31 the offer to purchase all  or part of Ithaco's stock, which is held by a relatively small group of  investors. The offer was originally set to expire Monday.  </P> <P> "We've talked to the company about getting together, and they said they didn't  want to do that," said Jim Pipp, Odetics' controller. "We have had some  communication with them. I wouldn't say we're in any kind of dispute or fight  with them."  </P> <P> For the time being, at least, call it a standoff.  </P></p>

In a statement to MENA, he said the paper, which contains  many details, is an indirect attempt to give new interpretations  to UN Security Council Resolution 242 on which the Arab-Israeli  peace talks are based.    Abu-Ziyad explained that in the morning session, the  Palestinian delegation proposed forming a minicommittee to draft  a new paper or amend the Russian-U.S. paper. The proposal was  accepted.    Abu-Ziyad said the Palestinians object to the Russian-U.S.  paper because it tries to interpret the clauses of UN Resolution  242. The paper thus discusses the inadmissibility of the  seizure of land by force without discussing Palestinian  territory. It speaks about the region's states but ignores the  region's peoples. This means that the paper ignores the  Palestinian people and their rights. He said this approach is  rejected because the Palestinian people are now passing through  a stage of liberation and the establishment of a Palestinian  state. This must be considered. He explained that any attempt  to rearrange relations among the region's states must consider  that another state, namely the Palestinian state, is about to be  established. So, the Palestinian people's rights and interests  must be taken into account. [passage omitted]</p>

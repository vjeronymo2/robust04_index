			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 22 Apr (AFP) -- Fighting between two of the  main Malian Tuareg movements resumed about 10 days ago in the  northern Malian region of Gao, it was learned today from  authorized Malian sources in Bamako, two days after the failure  of a meeting on the integration of former Tuareg fighters into  the regular Army. No casualty figures for these clashes, which  were confirmed by the progovernment newspaper L'ESSOR, were  available.    The fighting is between elements of the Popular Movement of  the Azaouad [MPA] and the Revolutionary Army for the Liberation  of Azaouad, both signatories to the 11 April 1992 national peace  pact between the Mali Government and the Tuareg movements, the  same sources added. An initial clash between these two factions  on 25 February cost the life of Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the  artisans of Tuareg integration into the Army and an MPA leader.  A meeting between the Malian Government and Tuareg  representatives held in Tamanrasset, Algeria, from 16 to 20  April, failed over the issue of integrating former fighters into  the Army.</p>

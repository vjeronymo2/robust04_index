			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [China Daily commentary: "Sino-Japanese Ties"] </F>   [Text] Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  three-day visit to China has given further impetus to the  all-round development of relations between the two countries.    China and Japan are next-door neighbours only separated, as  people often note, by a narrow strip of water. And all sorts of  ties have been forged between the two countries in the last 22  years since diplomatic relations were restored in 1972.    Economic cooperation has been high on the agenda of  Sino-Japanese relations.    Over the last decade, trade between the two countries  registered an average per annum increase of 10 percent. And  last year, total trade reached a record $39 billion, making  Japan the country's number one trade partner.    However, as China's Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out  during his recent trip to Japan, the present figure is far from  impressive considering the vast potential for economic  cooperation between the two nations.    And Chinese Premier Li Peng pointed out to his Japanese  counterpart on Sunday that China's economic plans lay particular  emphasis on energy supply, transport, and  telecommunications--all sectors in which Japan is strong.    This means that the two countries complement each other  economically and that increased cooperation could only benefit  them both.    We were pleased to hear Hosokawa's sincere apologies for the  intolerable suffering inflicted on Asian countries by Japan's  invasion and colonial domination in history.    And we envisage fuller and broader cooperation between our  two countries following Hosokawa's commitment to bear the past  in mind when looking to the future.    We also share his view that increased bilateral cooperation  holds out the hope of a brighter future.    Hosokawa delivered a strong message from the Japanese  Government that his country will continue to support China's  policies of reform, opening-up, and modernization.    He said that the rapid development of the Chinese economy  has  helped the Japanese economy.    Sino-Japanese relations have become particularly crucial  since Asia's relative global position has grown in importance  with the demise of the Cold War.    And the economies in east Asia are now the most vigorous  ones  in the world.    Despite their different political systems, China and Japan  are the two most influential countries in the region. And  bilateral relations between them, particularly in the economic  sphere, will affect not only the west rim of the Pacific, but  the whole world.    And both countries will make a great contribution to a  peaceful and prosperous new world order, now that their leading  statesmen have reached consensus on the importance of long-term,  good bilateral relations.</p>

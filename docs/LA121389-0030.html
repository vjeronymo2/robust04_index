			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOYOLA'S GATHERS FACING MORE TESTS;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: DOCTORS CANNOT FIND A CAUSE FOR PLAYER'S FAINTING.  </P> <P> Basketball star Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount has registered normal on all  medical tests that have been administered early this week, but did not practice  Tuesday, pending further tests today.  </P> <P> Doctors still have not determined a reason for Gathers' fainting during  Saturday's game against UC Santa Barbara. With about 14 minutes left, Gathers,  who had played 23 minutes, stepped up to shoot a free throw, then slumped to  the floor. He was unconscious for a second or two but then sat up and was  responsive. He was taken to nearby Centinela Hospital Medical Center.  </P> <P> After a series of tests, including an electrocardiogram and treadmill, Gathers  was released from the hospital on Monday and watched practice, where he was in  good spirits and appeared to be in good shape.  </P> <P> He joked Monday that he was going so strongly on the treadmill that he nearly  broke it, adding, "I'm still the strongest man in America."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, Gathers again didn't feel well and stayed home.  </P> <P> "All the tests so far are normal but (doctors) are trying to be extra sure, to  cover every base," Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gathers has no history of blackouts.  </P></p>

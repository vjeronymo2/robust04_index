			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / DTI under fire for revealing Archer probe Tory backbenchers were astonished yesterday that the Department of Trade and Industry had broken long-standing guidelines and revealed that it was investigating allegations of insider dealing against Lord Archer. Many wanted an explanation from Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, as to why he had decided to reveal that the peer was under investigation. Mrs Teresa Gorman, Tory MP for Billericay, said the timing seemed 'extraordinary' with a cabinet reshuffle near. Another incensed rightwing Tory MP described the DTI's decision as 'a breach of natural justice'. He said: 'I think it's outrageous. If Jeffrey Archer's comments are to be believed, there is simply no case against him.' But asked whether Mr Heseltine could be subjected to intense questioning over the issue, he said: 'I can't see there is a mood for that. It will just be seen as poor old Jeffrey in more trouble rather than a problem for the DTI.' Lord Clinton-Davies, a former Labour industry minister, said it was 'an extraordinary departure from practice' and 'murky' to release Lord Archer's name when other people under investigation remained anonymous. Mr John Watts, Tory chairman of the Treasury committee, said: 'I think it would be right for the DTI to explain how and why it came to name an individual who it is investigating. That is out of the ordinary.' Meanwhile, Mr John Major, arriving in Naples for the G7 summit of leading industrial nations, said he sympathised with his close friend Lord Archer, but refused to comment on the DTI investigation. 'One always feels for an old friend. But I am not going to comment. There is an investigation going on,' he said. 'The investigation should proceed. It would be wrong for me to say anything beyond that.' Sir Norman Fowler, the departing Tory party chairman, was among those insisting that Lord Archer should not be criticised before a judgment had been delivered. He said: 'The only point that has been confirmed is that an investigation is taking place. That does not imply guilt.' Lord Parkinson, the former Tory party chairman, said the timing of the announcement 'could not have been worse from Jeffrey Archer's point of view' with the cabinet reshuffle looming. 'He must feel very aggrieved,' he said. 'It would be very difficult to promote him into a job with this hanging over him.' Others believed that Lord Archer's hopes of getting a government post had been modest all along. 'If the DTI's statement was an attempt to scupper Jeffrey's chances of the Tory chairmanship it was a waste of time,' said a senior Tory official. 'He really had no chance at all.'</p>

			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: Tate &amp; Lyle mills bid turns sour Efforts by Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian sugar company owned by Tate &amp; Lyle, to acquire two Queensland crushing mills for ADollars 121m (Pounds 58m) were dealt a severe blow yesterday when shareholders in one of the mills voted against the lift-ng of a restriction which limits the number of shares which any single investor can hold. In the wake of the decision, one of Bundaberg's Sydney-based advisers said that he understood that the bid for that mill, and possibly for both mills, would now be allowed to lapse. There was no immediate comment or confirmation of this from Mr Geoff Mitchell, Bundaberg's managing director. The vote centred on the South Johnstone mill, the smaller of the two and in which Bundaberg holds a 2.7 per cent interest. At a shareholders' meeting approximately 82.45 per cent of the votes were cast in favour of retaining the limit - which is set at 3.2 per cent of the mill's equity - while only 17.55 per cent were in favour of lifting it. In voting down the proposal, the mill's current owners - who, for the most part, comprise the local Queensland cane growers - effectively blocked the bid from proceeding further. Bundaberg had already indicated that its ADollars 14 a share offer was final. By contrast, Bundaberg has not said that its offer for the Tully mill is final, but the board of the larger mill has been as vehemently opposed to the takeover as the directors at South Johnstone, and Bundaberg lacks even a small shareholding in the Tully mill. Opposition to the bids came largely from local cane growers who were concerned that the running of the mill and its associated facilities would be changed under Bundaberg's ownership, with more emphasis put on its short-term profit performance, rather than on the service provided to growers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Serge Abou, the European Union [EU] observer on the  Cyprus issue, said that the signing of an agreement between the  two communities on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]  would be a significant achievement. Mr. Abou also noted that  such an agreement would create the correct impetus, as he put  it, toward achieving an overall Cyprus solution.    In a statement after his meeting with Foreign Minister  Alekos  Mikhailidhis this morning, Mr. Abou described the contacts he  had with President Glavkos Kliridhis and Gustave Feissel, the UN  secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus,  as very important in view of the report on the Cyprus issue he  will prepare for the EU's Council of Ministers.    Responding to a question on the CBM's compatibility with EU  norms, Mr. Abou said that the United Nations has assured him  that there is no problem. Nevertheless, he added there is no  easy answer to this issue. Answering another question on  Turkey's stance, he noted that during his recent visit to that  country he received assurances that Turkey desires a Cyprus  solution.</p>

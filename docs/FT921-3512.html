			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Observer: Type cast Hanson doth protest too much, methinks. Last month Lords Hanson and White were banging their corporate drum at a lavish presentation to institutional investors in London. This week, they hosted a similar image-building exercise in New York (at the Pierre Hotel, where else?). It must have been important since Britain's eighth biggest company felt moved to issue a self-serving statement on the London Stock Exchange's Topic news service. Hanson's post-seminar survey found that 63 per cent of the 125 analysts attending rated its management as 'superior'. Not content with finding a couple of analysts from Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs prepared to say a few nice words about the company, Hanson also repeats the congratulatory words of the chairman of the American Stock Exchange who gave the keynote address at the presentation. But isn't Hanson's main share listing on the rival New York Stock Exchange? Hanson vice-chairman Martin Taylor admits this is true but notes that at least the warrants issued at the time of its Beazer bid are quoted on Amex. It will need more than this sort of PR-hype to remove Wall Street's memories of Hanson's flotation of its Smith Corona typewriter subsidiary. Two and a half years after the float Smith Corona's shares are still languishing nearly 60 per cent below the flotation price.</p>

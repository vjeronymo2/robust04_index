			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Asil Nadir in Cyprus: Deadlock on extradition BRITISH ATTEMPTS to extradite Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive Turkish Cypriot businessman, appeared to be in deadlock yesterday after the Turkish embassy in London indicated that it was unwilling to intervene in the issue. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, Foreign Office minister, met the Turkish ambassador, Mr Candemir Onhon, and delivered a 'strong message' asking for Turkish help in retrieving Mr Nadir. But although Mr Onhon promised to convey the request, he refused to promise any help with extradition. The embassy said: 'The Turkish Cypriot republic is an independent republic which is recognised by Turkey but we cannot intervene in their internal affairs.' He noted that Turkey and the UK had no extradition treaty. The Home Office, meanwhile, gave a cool response to a handwritten facsimile message which it had received on Thursday from Mr Nadir offering to return to Britain in exchange for unconditional travel rights. It said: 'We will be replying to the fax in a couple of days as a matter of courtesy - that is all'. Representatives of six government departments later met at the Serious Fraud Office discuss co-ordination. The SFO said yesterday the central criminal court had received a request on behalf of Mr Ramadan Guney, the Turkish businessman who provided Pounds 1m surety for Mr Nadir, in the week before his departure. Although the application on April 29 would appear to indicate that Mr Guney had been concerned about Mr Nadir's possible departure, the SFO was not informed and the request was later withdrawn. Mr Rick Shearman, Mr Guney's lawyer, refused to comment on reports that Mr Guney's associates had warned the SFO of Mr Nadir's imminent departure several times last week - and suggested that the SFO was trying to shift the blame for the affair. 'The SFO seem to have got themselves into quite enough trouble and are already trying to put some of the blame his way. We do not want to get involved with any slanging match with the SFO unless they start it, but I do not like the tone of the press release yesterday - the SFO are suggesting that the tip-off was a decoy.' He refused to confirm or deny whether Mr Guney himself had contacted the police. However, he said: 'The SFO have spoken to the person who made the tip-off and identified him. But at the moment we do not want to get into a slanging match - we are concerned that if my client embarrasses the authorities, who are already embarrassed anyway, he will lose some credit when he comes before the judge.'</p>

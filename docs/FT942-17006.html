			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statutory interest is not a solution Sir, Your leader, 'Late payment of bills' (March 28), draws attention to the problems facing many small businesses and the difficulties of using legislation as an effective remedy. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) is well aware of the problems as many of our members are active in the small business sector, being either in business themselves or providers of financial support services to small businesses. In our submission to the government's consultative paper, we reject the notion of a statutory right to interest on overdue payments. We believe that the introduction of statutory interest would legitimise the practice of late payment, to the extent that unscrupulous businesses might choose to pay interest to suppliers on overdue debts rather than to borrow at higher rates from other sources. Thus, there might evolve a form of incentive, courtesy of statutory interest, to maintain a practice of late payment, and the existing problem might accordingly be exacerbated. In any case, were companies to be entitled by law to an interest payment on overdue debts, we seriously question whether the interest element would, for the most part, constitute such a material amount as to motivate them to go to the trouble and expense of retrieving it through the courts. A more practical solution to the problem may be to use the VAT system as a form of control mechanism, whereby businesses which paid bills after an unacceptable delay would be forced to wait or be unable to recover VAT paid. However, it is a fact that effective remedies to the problems of late payment require a fundamental change in business attitudes and culture; late payment must cease to be regarded as a fact of business life or as a tool of astute financial management.

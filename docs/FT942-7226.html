			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Argyll 13% down after depreciation charges  -Wide-ranging review of Safeway in progress Depreciation charges, tough competition and a poor performance at its Lo-Cost discount chain combined to produce a 13 per cent fall in pre-tax profits at Argyll Group, the UK's third-largest grocery retailer, in the year to April 2. The fall, to Pounds 361.8m, compared with Pounds 417.3m for the previous 53 weeks, or Pounds 407m on a 52-week basis. This year's figure was depressed by Pounds 37.1m of new depreciation charges after Argyll began writing down superstores, and a Pounds 3m property loss. Adding those back, profits were still lower than last year - in contrast with Argyll's competitors, Tesco and Sainsbury, which were also hit by depreciation and property charges, but improved profits before the accounting changes. In spite of a fall in earnings from 27.1p to 22.6p per share, the total dividend goes up to 11.5p (10.9p), with a proposed final of 7.75p. However, directors said future rises would be in line with earnings growth. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman, said competition would remain tough, but there were signs the market was stabilising after a downward adjustment in margins. The gross margin at Safeway had fallen 0.3 percentage points in the second half, but was now running only 0.1 to 0.2 points below last year. Current trading showed some encouragement with like-for-like sales up 0.5 per cent, before price deflation of 0.7 per cent. Sales at Safeway increased by 12 per cent on a 52-week basis to Pounds 4.87bn, with operating profits up 7.4 per cent to Pounds 361.2m. New stores contributed 11.6 points, with 0.4 points from existing stores. Inflation averaged 1.2 per cent, but prices had fallen in the last four months of the year. Presto and Lo-Cost fared less well, with sales up 2 per cent on a 52-week basis to Pounds 1.11bn, but operating profits were down by 20 per cent to Pounds 40.7m. The company said cutting prices at Lo-Cost to strengthen its position in the discount market had improved sales but not profitability, and a fundamental review of the business was under way. Analysts believe it will be sold. Safeway has also appointed consultants to review all its operations and the results will be announced with the interim profits in November. COMMENT As it admitted yesterday, Argyll is a follower rather than a leader. It has lagged behind its main rivals in instituting a strategic review - and in revealing the expected cost savings - as well as in diversifying or expanding overseas. The business is sound and well-run, and the business review and other initiatives should certainly cut costs. But while the threats of a price war have receded, the outlook remains tough, and without a dose of inflation, earnings and dividend growth prospects look unexciting. However, with current-year forecasts averaging about Pounds 375m the shares are on a prospective multiple of only 10.25, which may suggest they are a little oversold - especially given the 6 per cent yield.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Letter: Casting doubt on Home Office 'surprise' over poll tax issue Sir, With regard to the 'apparent loophole' in the law over the admissibility of computerised records as evidence in civil proceedings in magistrates' courts ('Poll tax dilemma that is a matter of records', January 18), I doubt that the Home Office has been 'taken by surprise'. During 1987 and 1988 I carried out reviews of the position in English (and to some extent, Scottish) law of admissibility of computer evidence in both civil and criminal proceedings. These studies were commissioned by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency. Copies of the final reports were, I believe, submitted by the CCTA to the Treasury, the Home Office, the Lord Chancellor's department and the Scottish Office. Incidentally, I am not sure it is true that 'the government knows it could easily close the loophole by parliamentary order'. Even if it were true, however, it would not alter the inherent problem in the central issue here: the need for computer systems and operational practices properly capable of forensic scrutiny, delivering undoubted evidential reliability. It is thus not just computerised poll tax records which are affected. The report signposted similar potential difficulties arising in, for example, the authentication of 'dematerialised' Taurus share certificates, and the 'phantom withdrawal' syndrome of ATM cash-dispensers.

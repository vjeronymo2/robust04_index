			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Ivantsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 12 April, TASS -- Ukraine will pay off its  debt to Russia for gas supplies within the second quarter of the  year. The Ukrainian delegation headed by Vice-Premier Valentin  Liandik reaffirmed the intention here on Tuesday during its  meeting with officials from Russian gas giant Gazprom.    At present the debt amounts to more than 600 million  dollars.  The bulk of it is for supplies in 1993. Liandik said it will be  paid off in accordance with a scheme worked out in March 1994.  50 per cent of it will be paid off with financies and 50 per  cent with equipment, mainly pipes and compressors.    During the negotiations, the parties signed an accord on  storage of 10 billion cubic metres of Russian gas in two  underground depots in Ukraine. It will allow to have enough gas  reserves for export in winter. Another accord specified that  Russian natural gas will be dried on the Ukrainian territory to  meet export qualifications.    The parties agreed to set up working groups within next  months. The groups will work out terms of privatising Ukraine's  undeground depots, sections of pipilines and seaport facilities.    The next meeting of the delegations is scheduled for 10 May  in Kiev.</p>

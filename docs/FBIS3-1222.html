Striking Ciskei police  force members said the defence force, which now controlled Brig  Gqozo's movements, was refusing to bring him to the stadium  unless his safety was guaranteed. The army was unhappy with the  large number of African National Congress [ANC] supporters who  had occupied much of the stadium's grandstand and had been  singing and dancing there since early morning.    In nearby King William's Town, a Transitional Executive  Council Task force was having discussion on Wednesday afternoon  with South Africa's ambassador to Ciskei, Mr Piet Goosen, on a  strategy for dealing with the territory now that Brig Gqozo was  no longer in control. It is understood ANC Secretary General  Cyril Ramaphosa is also attending the meeting.    The meeting at the Bisho stadium was originally scheduled to  start at 7.30 AM. By midday, a steady stream of people was  leaving the stadium as members of the police, prisons and  defence force argued about what should happen next. At one  point, the entire prisons contingent went behind the grandstand  to caucus. Attempts by police spokesmen to address the crowd  were shouted down by ANC supporters.</p>

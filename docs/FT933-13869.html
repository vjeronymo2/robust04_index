			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Antofagasta takes the slow train to success - How one of Chile's leading copper producers bought a railway MR Andronico Luksic was so angry about the standard of service provided by his local railway that he decided to buy the company and put things right. That is how one of Chile's leading copper producers came to be quoted on the London Stock Exchange. For the company was the Antofagasta (Chile) and Bolivia Railway, established in 1888 with British capital to haul freight and people from Antofagasta on the coast of Chile up through the mountains to La Paz in Bolivia and back. Mr Luksic's first contact with the railway came when he wanted it to transport some very large tonnages of copper concentrate. He was referred to a book of tariffs containing more than 2,000 entries, one for almost every conceivable type of copper ore or concentrate. The railway's bureaucrats insisted on charging 'by the book' - there was no such thing as a quantity discount. 'That made me look more closely at the railway and I decided it must be the most badly managed business in the world,' Mr Luksic recalls. During long, boring drives to copper operations in Chile's Atacama desert, the road often ran parallel to the railway, and this set Mr Luksic thinking about what changes he would make if he was managing the railway company. Eventually he decided it would make great sense to buy it and to put his ideas into action. He was rebuffed two or three times by the main UK shareholders, but in 1980 he bought control from the Rothschild merchant bank and some of its partners. Within six months, he had put most of his ideas into action and moved the railway from losses into profits. Today his family still owns about 67 per cent of what is now called Antofagasta Holdings, or 'Fags'. The railway still has 30 locomotives and 2,000 wagons to move freight in Chile and to Bolivia. Once a week some passenger coaches are attached to the train to La Paz. Fags has spread its interests into forestry, telecommunications and banking, but Mr Luksic, now the chairman, says his first love remains mining - he bought his first copper mine in 1953 when he was 24 years old. 'We are in many different business and it will stay that way. But mining will grow faster than the rest because that is where we are making the big investments.' Fags has spent about Dollars 200m in the past two years on its copper operations and could easily justify spending another Dollars 1bn. But it will not spend that much because Mr Luksic prefers not to borrow. Fags claims to be the lowest-geared public limited company in the UK and has only a Pounds 3m overdraft that will be paid off by the end of 1993. Mr Luksic's aversion to debt will have a fundamental impact on the way Fags' copper business will develop. For example, the group is joint owner and operator of the Los Pelambres copper mine, 300km north of Santiago, which started production last year and stands on what Mr Luksic suggests could be the world's third-largest copper deposit. Fags' partners are Midland Bank of the UK and Lucky-Goldstar, the Korean group. Already there are plans to double or triple annual production at Los Pelambres. Mr Luksic would prefer to take the slow route, spending Dollars 50m to take output to about 40,000 tonnes and then employing the mine's cash flow to step up to 60,000 in 10 years time. He believes that Midland would prefer to speed expansion by spending between Dollars 500m and Dollars 800m to go to an annual 60,000 tonnes in only three years. 'But then we would be working for the banks for the next 10 years,' says Mr Luksic who is more than likely to get his way on this issue. Los Pelambres is on a deposit estimated to contain 3bn tonnes of ore containing 0.7 per cent copper. Fags is earning its way from its present 20 per cent stake to one of 65 per cent. 'The way costs are coming down, this won't take long,' says Mr Luksic. Anaconda, the US group, spent Dollars 55m to drill Los Pelambres and to build roads and a camp. Fags paid Dollars 13m for its stake. Mr Luksic can think seriously about expanding Los Pelambres now the finishing touches are being put to a scheme to merge two neighbouring mines, Michilla and Lince, which share the same copper deposit. Michilla produced 25,200 tonnes of copper last year while Lince, where Dollars 60m was spent, came into production last January. Fags is to close an old plant 30kms from the mines, which produces an unusual intermediate material, copper precipitate, from Michilla's ore. Instead, copper cathodes will be produced by the inexpensive solvent extraction-electro winning process at Lince. 'Not only will this cut our costs, it will also give us a more saleable product,' Mr Luksic points out. Fags bought out its partner in Lince, Outokumpu of Finland, last year for Dollars 36m cash to smooth the way for the changes. Mr Luksic admits he is under pressure from colleagues to develop quickly a copper mine at the Sorpressa deposit in the El Tesoro area, 150 kms from Antofagasta. The deposit lies on the same geographical fault line as Chile's two biggest copper mines, Chuquicamata and Escondida. Fags has already found 100m tonnes of very high grade - 2 per cent - copper, enough for a big mine, and is spending only Dollars 1m a year drilling to find more. Every mining company operating in Chile has staked some land in the area because Sorpressa's copper is 'exotic', washed there from what must be a huge, high-grade deposit elsewhere, probably close by. Mr Luksic says one drawback at Sorpressa is that the exotic copper is very difficult to release from the ore. Also: 'Before we get to Sorpressa we must do the Lince and Los Pelambres expansions. And also the Qui Punita (a gold deposit in Argentina) is looking good. So it may be four years before we get to Sorpressa.' Gencor of South Africa is one of the partners with Fags in La Coipita, which owns the gold project in Argentina. Argentina has no mining tradition but Mr Luksic believes the country has a great deal of copper potential and Fags will go looking for the metal now that the law has been changed to permit Chilean companies to own mines in Argentina. He says: 'Only 10 per cent of the Andes belongs to Chile, the rest is in Argentina. Why should all the copper be the Chile side of the line?' Fags is also taking an interest in the sale by Codelco, Chile's state-owned group, of the El Abra deposit, which has 500m tonnes of ore containing 1 per cent copper. But 18 other international mining companies have expressed interest. Given Mr Luksic's dislike of bank debt, any large acquisition would require a rights issue by Fags. He says: 'If we had a chance to buy something cheaply we might have a rights issue.' That would provide an opportunity to reduce his family's holding. 'It might be beneficial to have the shares more widely held,' he admits. Meanwhile, 'as we are not sellers of the shares, the price does not concern us, although some of the family buy shares from time to time. Neither do I worry about the copper price - I only worry about my costs. I've been 40 years in this business and there are no copper market gurus who can tell you with certainty what the price will be'.</p>

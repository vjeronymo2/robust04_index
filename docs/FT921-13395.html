			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Amoco Dollars 300m for new wells AMOCO Trinidad Oil Co, a subsidiary of Amoco of the US, is to spend Dollars 300m (Pounds 167.5m) to exploit new gas wells and increase supplies to its clients in the Caribbean state, Canute James reports from Kingston. Amoco Trinidad will boost delivery to Trinidad and Tobago's National Gas Company from the current level of 200m cu ft of natural gas per day to 350m cu ft per day by 1996. The new supply contract replaces an earlier agreement signed by Amoco and NGC, and will expire in the year 2000. It is one of two contracts for gas sale which Amoco has in Trinidad and Tobago. The other is to supply 80m cu ft of natural gas daily to the Trinidad and Tobago Electric Commission until 1994. Amoco Trinidad is the main producer of natural gas in that country, accounting for 80 per cent of national production. It is also a major player in Trinidad and Tobago's oil industry, producing an average of 72,000 barrels of crude a day. Trinidad and Tobago has proven gas reserves of 10.3 trillion (million million) cu ft. According to the government, extractable reserves amount to about 7.6 trillion cu ft. Gas production in 1990, the latest year for which figures are available, was 1.97bn cu ft, 7.7 per cent less than 1989.</p>

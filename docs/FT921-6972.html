			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Second rejection for ITV proposals THE Independent Television Commission has rejected ITV's proposals for a new national network for the second time. The members of the commission, who were expected to approve the new networking arrangements, decided to seek more detailed information from the ITV companies. The decision means further delay to a network system, led by a central scheduler or director, which is supposed to be in place by January when the new 10-year franchises start. The 1990 Broadcasting Act required the creation of a fairer ITV network with proper access for independent production companies and the smaller ITV companies. In the past the large ITV companies have been accused of dividing up the network for their own programmes. The arrangements have to be approved by the ITC and then examined by the Office of Fair Trading to ensure that they are open and fair. The ITC rejection of the revised proposals does not seem to involve central points of principle. All the signs are that the ITV companies have conceded that independent producers should have a direct right of access to the central scheduler. The programmes would, however, be made through a sponsoring ITV company as the legal broadcaster. The ITC members want to see the details of the terms of trade and contracts that would govern relations between ITV companies and independent producers. It is not clear whether ITV has worked out its networking proposals in that detail yet. Mr Charles Denton, president of Pact, the independent producers group, has been demanding a fair, competitive and open market in programme production. Thames TV plans, Page 22</p>

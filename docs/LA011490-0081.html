			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOP CHASING AL DAVIS PLEADINGLY;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO: NOW THAT L.A. HAS JUMPED IN WITH A GOLD-PLATED OFFER, THE CAPITAL  CITY NEEDS TO TELL THE RAIDERS THAT IT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THEIR INTENTIONS --  SOONEST.  </P> <P> The time has come now, I think, for the city of Sacramento, and perhaps its  highest-profile developer, to quit following Al Davis around the pasture like  some bawling calf chasing the wrong mother.  </P> <P> And yes, Al Davis is a wrong mother.  </P> <P> This is not to say that he doesn't have a working teat. Al Davis has a great,  full teat with a rich and storied history, but it isn't the only teat in this  pasture, and the spectacle of an entire city hanging breathless each time the  Davis tail slaps a fly off its behind, of analyzing each twitch, each roll of  those slow brown eyes as to how it affects the city's chances of latching onto  that teat, is at this point a humiliation that is hard to watch.  </P> <P> Gregg Lukenbill, the developer who heads the group that wants to bring the  Raiders to Sacramento, says that bringing a football team to Sacramento is  important. And there is some truth in that. It's fun to have an NFL franchise,  and fun is at least as important to a city as, say, a transportation system  that works, because if it weren't, nobody would live in New York.  </P> <P> Beyond fun, however, there is no promised land.  </P> <P> Lukenbill's vision of Sacramento coming to greatness -- I was going to mention  "world class" again, but I'm too tired of hearing that to make fun of it  anymore -- through its sports franchises is simply a reflection of Lukenbill.  It all sounds good and is empty of meaning.  </P> <P> What was it Davis called him -- the kid off the turnip wagon?  </P> <P> Anyway, there's no need to spend a lot of time here recounting the changes this  vision of greatness-through-sports has gone through in Sacramento in the last  half a year. The economic promise that helped push Sacramento into a  $50-million bond sale was simply wrong, and the idea that a major league  franchise would in some way validate this place or elevate it to a new status  is also wrong.  </P> <P> What getting the Raiders would do, simply, is give us a professional football  team. And as much as I'd like to see that, it's time to ask how far we're  willing to go to get it.  </P> <P> At least to get this professional team.  </P> <P> It was Lukenbill, as I remember, who came out publicly before the bond sale,  saying it had to be done in a hurry because Davis needed to see that the city  was sincere.  </P> <P> Or words to that effect.  </P> <P> And it was Lukenbill who said it had to be done in a hurry so that he and his  partners could see that the city was in earnest. "Performance is an issue. Can  the public sector perform?" was the way he put it.  </P> <P> So the city issued the bonds, and presumably showed it was sincere and earnest  and could perform.  </P> <P> And Davis' entire reaction to this show of sincerity and earnestness was  rolling his slow brown eyes back over the pasture again, just as he'd been  rolling his eyes over the pasture ever since he put the old milk bag up for  sale.  </P> <P> And as the estimates of when such a deal might actually materialize came and  went -- the last one from Davis' office was "sometime in the next several  weeks" -- an old, familiar feeling began to permeate the deal, that feeling you  might have gotten the first time a girlfriend told you she loved you to death  but didn't want to tie herself to one relationship.  </P> <P> Or maybe the second time, when you knew what that meant.  </P> <P> At any rate, first Davis was going to decide in weeks, then in months, then  after the regular season, now after the Super Bowl. And all the time, he keeps  taking offers. The last one Sacramento made was $50 million for the bus ride  up, a $120-million stadium and more than $100 million in ticket guarantees.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Los Angeles offered him $76 million -- most of it tax-free -- to  stay where he is. They also offered to tear down the Coliseum, which is as  close to historic as anything you're going to find in L.A., and build a new  $140-million stadium, probably with gold bidets in the super boxes.  </P> <P> And Davis rolled his brown eyes and looked back over the pasture to see what  Oakland and Sacramento would do.  </P> <P> Looking at Los Angeles' new offer, it occurs to me that now would be a good  time for the city of Sacramento to take a new tack. To negotiate back. To say  to Al Davis, "You've got a week, and Sacramento withdraws its offer."  </P> <P> The advantage to this is that this city is no longer following Davis all over  the pasture, bawling.  </P> <P> Davis knows he's got something we want, everybody knows that.  </P> <P> It's time now to find out if we've got something he wants, too.  </P> <P> Not just because Davis is better at negotiating than we are -- and he is better  -- but because it's the only way we get to come out on the other end of this  thing with our dignity.  </P> <P> And without that, football isn't any fun anyway.  </P></p>

			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Private managers of public services 'surprised at scrutiny' Private-sector managers brought in to run public services often have an inadequate grasp of the importance of accountability to parliament, Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor-General, told a committee of MPs yesterday. Sir John, who heads the National Audit Office, the public expenditure watchdog, said chief executives from the private sector running government agencies and quangos were often surprised to learn that they were subject to scrutiny for their handling of public money. One chief executive had questioned why his organisation's finances were being investigated by the watchdog and why a report was being sent to parliament. Outsiders could bring new management skills into the public services, Sir John said. But they needed to be briefed on traditional procedures for handling public money in order to avoid the sort of waste and corruption revealed in last week's report from the Commons Public Accounts Committee. Sir John was giving evidence to the cross-party Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee along with Mr Robert Sheldon, the PAC chairman. Mr Sheldon challenged the prime minister's claim that the PAC report had contained no evidence of a decline in standards in the public services. 'We would not have published the report if we had not been concerned about the number of failings we have discovered in recent years,' he said. There was nothing wrong with the rules on probity and handling public money which had served Britain well for some 130 years, the PAC chairman said, adding: 'We need to make sure that they are observed and obeyed.' Sir John also highlighted failures in setting up agencies and quangos, which had increased opportunities for fraud and corruption. 'In a period of very considerable change in public administration, new people, new responsibilities and new systems expose risks of muddle and confusion,' Sir John said. In some cases financial control had been concentrated in the hands of inexperienced junior staff, he said. It was prudent to separate responsibilities more than was often done. Responsibility for handling money and letting contracts had been given to staff without the necessary training or experience. 'You don't have to choose between proper procedures and getting value for money,' Sir John said. 'But if you don't attend to the procedures for public business, you won't get value for money.'</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADA ADMITS IT FINANCED A STRING OF STRIPTEASE CLUBS  </P> <P> The Canadian government admitted Thursday that it financed not one but several  striptease clubs in a scandal that has enraged the opposition and titillated  the press.  </P> <P> Canada's Conservative government said Tuesday that a state-run development bank  provided more than $1 million to a now-flourishing striptease club popular with  Ottawa civil servants, politicians and foreign dignitaries.  </P> <P> Both the government and the development bank have publicly denied knowing the  funds, which amounted to $850,000 in U.S. currency, were slated for strip  joints.  </P> <P> It was all a big mistake, an embarrassed Industry Minister Harvie Andre told  the House of Commons on Thursday, pledging new procedures to prevent it from  happening again. The admission came after newspaper reports that the Federal  Business Development Bank had provided hundreds of thousands of dollars to  strip clubs across the country.  </P> <P> Bank spokesmen were not immediately available for comment on the latest  developments. The bank, charged with promoting small business in Canada, said  it has tightened its rules to prevent lending to businesses that might be  considered offensive.  </P></p>

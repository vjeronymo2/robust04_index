			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 23 (AFP) -- Bosnian Serb commanders  failed to pull 150 armed policemen out of the eastern town of  Gorazde this weekend, as agreed, the UN Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) reported Monday [23 May]. The Serbs' failure to  abide by the Gorazde accord could torpedo the resumption of  peace talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina, obervers warned.    "There is no change in the deployment inside the  three-kilometre (two-mile) total exclusion zone," UNPROFOR  spokesman Rob Annink said Monday, referring to a UN-declared  exclusion zone around the valley town, which is populated mostly  by Moslems, including thousands of refugees from Serb "ethnic  cleansing" of nearby villages.    "It is a disappointment that the Bosnian Serb army did not  react to the agreement," Major Annink said.    Under the agreement signed Saturday between Lieutenant  General Sir Michael Rose, the commander of UN troops in Bosnia,  and Bosnian Serb military leader Manojlo Milovanovic, the Serbs  were to redeploy the 150 men outside the exclusion zone by 6:00  p.m. (1600 GMT) Sunday. The Serbs also pledged to guarantee the  UNPROFOR freedom of movement within a 20-kilometre (12-mile)  heavy weapons exclusion zone around Gorazde.    Annink said the Serbs told UN military observers that they  would not be granted freedom of movement within the exclusion  zone until 570 Serbs were allowed to leave the town and the  mainly Moslem Bosnian army withdrew from a hill overlooking  Gorazde. He said the overall situation in Gorazde was stable  Sunday with Bosnian Serb and Bosnian army troop movements  reported northwest of the town.</p>

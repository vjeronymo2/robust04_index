			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Cookies offer food for thought: RJR Nabisco has cut its debts, but can it compete as a single group in the world of snacks and cigarettes To lose a chairman may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose a finance director as well looks like carelessness. For RJR Nabisco, the US-based food and tobacco group - best known for its Camel cigarettes and Oreo 'cookies' - this year's calamities do not stop there. Over the same period it has seen its most profitable business, US cigarettes, wracked by a price war, and has been forced to abandon an ambitious Dollars 1.5bn special shares offering. It has watched its share price dip to Dollars 5 1/4 , less than half the level at which it was sold to investors two years ago. The long list of problems have raised the question again of whether the company should be split between food and tobacco groups. In the wake of the aborted Dollars 1.5bn 'food share' issue this summer, which would have been tied to the performance of the Nabisco food division, a typical stockbroker's report commented: 'This represents one more thing gone wrong and one more reason to avoid the stock.' The only person who seems publicly relaxed is the new chairman, Charles 'Mike' Harper. 'I don't know that we're in a bind,' he remarked cheerfully. 'It's a whole wide wonderful world out there.' But even Mr Harper would not deny that today's grim reality is far removed from the promises made in 1989 when RJR Nabisco was the subject of a record-breaking Dollars 25bn bid masterminded by the financier Mr Henry Kravis, co-founder of Kohlberg Kravis, Roberts, the New York-based leveraged buy-out specialist. Then, the bidders talked about streamlining; about the disciplines which a heavy debt burden would impose on management; about the merit of shedding corporate 'fat', such as private jets, and investing long-term to build brands. When the bid battle ended in victory for Kohlberg Kravis, Roberts, the financial world held its breath. It was the biggest buy-out in corporate history and marked the zenith of the feverish period of leveraged deals in the 1980s, when takeovers were funded by innovative debt instruments such as junk bonds. Today, the widespread view on Wall Street is that RJR Nabisco has avoided many of the financial problems which have beset smaller leveraged deals. Companies ranging from Federated Department Stores to Trans World Airlines found that once recession struck, operating profits were insufficient to meet debt payments and had to file for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. Operating cash flow at RJR Nabisco has been sufficient to meet debt repayment demands, and about half the total acquisition debt of close to Dollars 30bn has been paid off. The large US credit-rating agencies, such as Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, moved the company up from junk bond to investment grade status last year, thus confirming its financial health. The reduction in borrowings was helped by a programme of disposals which, although not trouble-free, was completed largely as planned. The main elements were the sale of RJR Nabisco's European snack and biscuit companies to BSN, the French food group, and the disposal of Del Monte, the fresh and canned fruits business. More than Dollars 6bn has flowed in from these sales. But while the balance sheet has steadily improved, progress in terms of industrial strategy has been less satisfactory. On the tobacco side, RJR was struggling to demonstrate any sustained sales or profits advance in its single most important domestic business, long before rival cigarette marker, Philip Morris, slashed the price of its Marlboro' brand and brought a simmering price war to boiling point. Domestic tobacco is critical to RJR Nabisco's fortunes in the short term, accounting for about 60 per cent of group operating profit. RJR's two main full-priced brands - Winston and Salem - lost market share in the early 1990s as discount brands grew in popularity. Only Camel, a smaller brand, made progress on the back of a successful, if controversial, Old Joe Camel advertising campaign which critics claimed enticed children to smoke. Recently, RJR redirected its attention to the discount end of the US cigarette market, and its total market share improved. But the gain was largely at the lower-margin end of the sector, so while sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 6.16bn last year, operating profits for the domestic tobacco division declined by 8 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn in the 1992 calendar year. The food side has struggled for different reasons. Shorn of its main international interests, Nabisco became heavily dependent on the US domestic market. But recession and the squeeze by retailers' own-label products on branded goods suppliers have meant that profits improvements had to be clawed out of cost-savings and productivity gains. In 1992, food sales were flat in North America, and the division's 'business unit contribution' - core operating profits ahead of asset sale proceeds - rose only 3 per cent. Such was the state of the company when Mr Lou Gerstner, RJR Nabisco's chairman since the 1989 bid, departed to run International Business Machines in April. His departure proved tough for the company to handle. Seeking to minimise disruption - and knowing that the sensitive 'food share' issue was in the pipeline - RJR Nabisco announced that two other members of Mr Gerstner's small head office team would become co-chairmen and chief executive officers. At the company's annual meeting just days after Mr Gerstner left, Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, general counsel, and Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director, performed a polished double-act. But the carefully-engineered harmony was disrupted two months later when Mr Harper arrived. Although many observers had suspected that the two-man chairmanship would prove temporary, the impression of a well-organised handover had been marred by Mr Ricciardi's earlier insistence that the dual arrangement was not short term, and Mr von der Heyden's resignation when the appointment of Mr Harper was announced. He is no stranger to the rough-and-tumble of the US food industry. In the early 1970s, he quit Pillsbury (now owned by the UK's Grand Metropolitan) when it sold the poultry business which he headed. He moved on to run ConAgra, then a commodity-based business which had just lost large sums on the futures markets and was close to collapse. Slowly, Mr Harper started to buy up packaged food operations which other companies had rejected - including several from RJR Nabisco. Today, ConAgra brands include Wesson cooking oil, Hunt's ketchup, Armour meats and La Choy chinese foods. But it was Mr Harper's move, in 1985, into 'healthy packaged foods' that really made his name in the industry. He apparently conceived the idea while in hospital recovering from a heart attack. After his release he set about developing ConAgra's Healthy Choice line of frozen entrees. The products were a big success, ConAgra's fortunes blossomed, and Mr Harper became one of the food sector's most respected executives, despite the entry of rivals into the business. Today, as boss of RJR Nabisco, he is quick to draw parallels between the company and the ConAgra of the 1970s. 'There are lots of ways to make money,' he says, 'and there is no magic in increasing earnings per share. 'With ConAgra, we started with a debt-to-equity ratio of six to one. Over a period of time, and by doing a few little things very well, we focused on increasing value from a shareholders' point-of-view. And that came down to getting good returns from any new capital that we put into the company.' What, in the context of RJR, might these 'little things' be? Mr Harper is loathe to discuss specifics, but outlines a few possibilities. First, acquisitions will be a priority. 'We intend to pursue opportunities - food and tobacco. Or it could be something else. I'm not going to commit myself to saying that it would be only food and tobacco.' This presupposes that both divisions remain under the same corporate roof. It was widely assumed that RJR Nabisco only attempted the complex 'food share' issue because of the immense legal obstacles of a full demerger. Bond holders and litigants in tobacco liability lawsuits would have been unhappy in any case, while complicated debt covenants might have to be bought off. In the wake of the aborted stock offer, speculation that RJR Nabisco is reconsidering this possibility has mounted, however. Mr Harper is non-commital: 'Anything that's moral, ethical and legal will be done, but it would be inappropriate to speculate on any particular possibility.' On the food side, Nabisco has been trying to rebuild its international operations via a handful of fairly modest deals, centred largely on Latin America. This, says Mr Harper, will continue. 'I think the food division will continue to build on that base, and that's very logical. We don't want to get into a no-growth business in a slow-growth economy. That might suggest that in certain parts of Europe it could be difficult to find businesses. But I don't care where we find them, so long as they are growth vehicles and can be purchased at a price which will give us a darned good return.' Second, product innovation will be important. Mr Harper is quick to attack the widespread notion that RJR Nabisco has been tardy in introducing new brands. 'I think the food managers have done a pretty good job of product development. They've brought out a great line of snacks, and now they're coming out with potato chips that have half the fat. These have never been near a deep-fat fryer, and they taste tremendously good.' Mr Harper points out that 10 per cent of sales come from products brought to market in the past two years. Third, fresh management objectives are being set. 'The company has focused for a long time on the balance sheet - and thank goodness for that. Now the focus is changing. Sure, there are going to be some more financings. But the focus of management is to make more money. It's a natural shift at this point in time. 'So there will be goals, there will be standards, there will be financial objectives. We will establish those; we will expect results.' But if a steady rebuilding of RJR Nabisco - with emphasis on the food side - is Mr Harper's aim, does the company have enough resources to pursue it effectively? One drawback is that while many food industry competitors can concentrate on that sector alone, RJR Nabisco has the uncertain cost of a cigarette price-war to contend with, plus a still-substantial debt burden. Moreover, its lowly share price and the withdrawal of the 'food stock' issue suggest that new equity financing may be out of the question for a while. The answer, say some observers, lies in basic mathematics. The company is reckoned to generate 'free cash-flow' - profits flowing into the company with depreciation costs added back - of just over Dollars 4bn a year. About Dollars 2.9bn is needed annually to pay interest on the debt, taxes and for planned capital expenditures. This leaves about Dollars 1.2bn annually to pay off debt and to fund acquisitions. How much of this balance will be consumed by the cigarette price-war is unknown; 'several hundred million' is the vague consensus on Wall Street. Future debt maturities, meanwhile, are reckoned to be 'fairly modest at an average of Dollars 200m annually over the next few years', according to Fitch, the debt-rating agency. So are the company's resources enough to juggle acquisition spending with product development demands and marketing requirements? 'Live with it?' Mr Harper says. 'We can be aggressive with it. 'Even with this price-war in cigarettes, we have substantial cash-flow. Relative to interest, it is very good, and even after the great reduction in the operating income from tobacco, it is still very good. Some food people would think they'd died and gone to heaven.' RJR Nabisco's shareholders, however, may feel that heaven is a little way off. Partly as a result of the cigarette price war, many industry watchers predict a fall in after-tax profits this year; some suggest that it may even be uphill work to show any recovery in 1994. Not least of those concerned is Kohlber Kravis, Roberts, which still holds a controlling interest in the company. Three years after the takeover, RJR Nabisco's management is increasingly being measured by its ability to deliver in the real world of biscuits, nuts, crackers and cigarettes, not by its skill in handling a balance sheet, slashing costs or shuffling assets. On that score, Mr Harper would seem to have his plate full. Mr Kravis can only join other investors in hoping Mr Harper's optimism is well-founded.</p>

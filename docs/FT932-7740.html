			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's assigns B2 rating to Kloster Cruise secured notes MOODY'S Investors Service, the US-based rating agency, has assigned a B2 speculative grade rating to the Dollars 300m senior, 10-year, secured notes issued earlier this month by Kloster Cruise, a unit of Vard, the Norwegian ferry and cruise group. The coupon was set at 13 per cent and the notes were placed with a group of 'qualified' institutional investors, and secured against mortgages on two of the company's 12-strong cruise ship fleet. 'The appraised value of the ships - Dollars 360m in aggregate - provides only a slim cushion of asset coverage,' according to the rating agency. Moody's said a decline in earnings combined with a heavy debt-service burden had created a liquidity crisis within Kloster, the third-largest cruise ship operator in the world. 'The company was in violation of covenants under its key bank agreement and auditors expressed doubt about its ability to continue as an on-going concern,' but doubt was removed, Moody's said, by the financial restructuring. Kloster earlier warned it will post a net loss in 1993. First quarter losses rose to NKr88.2m (Dollars 12.8m) from losses of NKr17.4m in the same period in 1992. Besides the issue, Kloster doubled its debt maturity profile to six years from three years. Moody's warned that Kloster faces new capital expenditures to strengthen its competitive position and this may necessitate additional borrowings. This year, Kloster will have to meet debt-servicing requirements of Dollars 230m while total interest bearing debt is estimated at Dollars 1bn. The financial restructuring increased Kloster's annual interest payments by Dollars 10m to Dollars 80m. Moody's said Kloster may be forced to divest some of its cruise lines or shift resources between lines to achieve economies of scale and pursue market share as a result of aggressive expansion of larger and better-capitalised competitors. 'Lacklustre economic growth could prolong cautious consumer spending and dampen a recovery in Kloster Cruise's earnings and cash flow despite historically stable and growing demand for cruise vacations,' Moody's believes.</p>

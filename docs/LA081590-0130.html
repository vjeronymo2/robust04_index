			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARRIDO IS BACK IN FULLERTON'S CAMP;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASEBALL: COACH, WHO LEFT FOR ILLINOIS IN 1987, RETURNS TO LEAD THE  TITANS AGAIN AND ASSUME POSITION OF ASSISTANT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY  RELATIONS. HE ALSO SIGNS A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH A BASE SALARY OF $66,984.  </P> <P> Augie Garrido, the baseball coach who wasn't the happiest of campers when he  left Cal State Fullerton for Illinois in 1987, will pitch his tent with the  Titans once again.  </P> <P> Garrido, who guided Fullerton to national championships in 1979 and 1984, was  named the Titans' new coach Tuesday, replacing Larry Cochell, who resigned July  3 to accept the Oklahoma job.  </P> <P> Garrido, 51, signed a three-year contract that, according to Fullerton  assistant athletic director Steve DiTolla, will pay a base salary of $66,984 a  year. He will also receive an annual $10,000 salary supplement, which will come  from the athletic department's fund-raising pool.  </P> <P> Football Coach Gene Murphy is the only other Titan coach who receives such a  supplement.  </P> <P> In addition, Garrido will receive revenue from summer baseball camps, an amount  the coach predicted to be in the $10,000 to $15,000 range, bringing the total  compensation package to about $90,000 a year.  </P> <P> Garrido will also assume the newly created position of assistant athletic  director for community relations, a role that will involve public relations and  fund-raising for the entire athletic department and the Titan Sports Complex,  Fullerton's on-campus stadium that is scheduled for construction beginning this  fall.  </P> <P> "I'm a very happy man," said Garrido, who flew from Edmonton, Canada, where he  was serving as a coach with Team USA, to Orange County Tuesday to hammer out  the final details of the contract. "This is my home, and I'm happy to be  relocating to the area where my family is. I have deep feelings about the whole  thing."  </P> <P> Garrido, who had a 667-292-6 record in 15 seasons as Titan coach (1973-87), had  some bitter feelings when he left three years ago. He complained of the  school's lack of commitment to the baseball program. Little progress was being  made on plans for a new stadium, and Garrido was tired of focusing so much  attention and energy on fund-raising.  </P> <P> He rarely had the resources to act on new ideas and said he felt like he was  "treading water" at Fullerton. Illinois lured him with a six-figure contract  that included revenue from baseball camps, a shoe contract and radio show. The  school had also just built a 1,500-seat baseball stadium.  </P> <P> But Garrido, sounding like a born-again Titan, is convinced he won't be  plunging into the same old job and the same old problems at Fullerton.  </P> <P> The sports complex is on the verge of construction and much of the fund-raising  burden has been eased. In the past, coaches have been directly responsible for  raising 40%, or about $100,000, of the baseball budget.  </P> <P> "Their commitment to roll up their sleeves and get in there and help with the  fund-raising makes a big difference," Garrido said. "Doing it all by yourself  gets old."  </P> <P> There will be plenty to do in the next few years. The base plans for the  1,500-seat baseball portion of the sports complex don't include a baseball  pavilion, which is supposed to have a press box, concession stands and  restrooms. The school will have to raise an additional $800,000 to build the  pavilion, but Garrido doesn't see this as a burden.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about the challenges and opportunities at Fullerton," he said. "A  lot of problems need to be solved, and if they are, we can make significant  contributions to North Orange County through the stadium. That's a real buzz  for me, thinking we can put up a stadium that people will use for the next 50  years."  </P> <P> While the sports complex, scheduled for completion in the fall of 1992, is  being constructed, Fullerton will play its next two seasons at Amerige Park in  downtown Fullerton. Garrido hopes to turn this potential drawback into an  advantage.  </P> <P> "If it's handled right, it could be interesting," he said. "That park has a lot  of history. Walter Johnson played there, the Wrigley family built it, and the  Chicago Cubs trained there. We could rejuvenate it. I've always looked at  things a little weird, but it could be dynamite."  </P> <P> Ironically, the thrust of Garrido's new role as assistant athletic director  will be fund raising. But his efforts will be on behalf of the entire athletic  department, and he says he won't feel pressured to raise money for bats and  balls and uniforms and scholarships -- the things he focused on before.  </P> <P> "The administration will take care of the nuts and the bolts of the baseball  program," Garrido said. "I don't see it as a burden when it's part of a team  effort to make things better. I want to have input into the direction of the  baseball program, and I want to make a contribution to more than just  baseball."  </P> <P> Garrido's contribution to the baseball program should be significant, according  to local coaches.  </P> <P> "He brings instant recognition and a reputation for success," said Rancho  Santiago Coach Don Sneddon, who played for Garrido in the 1970s. "His name  alone will generate a lot of interest in the program. That's a good selling  point."  </P> <P> Sneddon said that despite Fullerton's success under Cochell, who guided the  Titans to two College World Series appearances in three seasons, many of Orange  County's top players weren't sold on the program and decided to go elsewhere.  </P> <P> But with Garrido returning, Sneddon believes Fullerton will return to  prominence in the minds of top recruits.  </P> <P> "Augie has established himself as a premier coach, and he has always been able  to attract premier players in Orange County," Sneddon said. "I think that will  happen again, whereas I don't think it happened in the last few years.  </P> <P> "Even though he did some fine things, Cochell wasn't here long enough to  establish himself in Orange County. Maybe after this year, he might have  established himself, but he chose to leave."  </P> <P> Before Garrido chose to leave Fullerton, he had built the program almost from  scratch into a national power. A Visalia native who came to Fullerton from Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo in 1973, Garrido's first project was to build Titan Field.  </P> <P> Fullerton won the Division II California Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship  in 1974 and, after moving to Division I in 1975, the Titans won the Pacific  Coast Athletic Assn. title and the NCAA Western Regional championship.  </P> <P> In 13 years at the Division I level, Garrido guided the Titans to 11 NCAA  regional appearances and four College World Series appearances.  </P> <P> He has sent numerous players into professional baseball, including Montreal  Expos third baseman Tim Wallach, Chicago Cubs pitcher Mike Harkey, St. Louis  Cardinals pitcher Greg Mathews and Seattle Mariners reliever Mike Schooler.  </P> <P> "He's the best guy they could possibly get," said Titan third baseman Phil  Nevin, who is entering his sophomore year and spent six weeks with Garrido on  Team USA this summer.  </P> <P> "I like his style of coaching. He's aggressive, hard-nosed, and he'll do  anything to win. He has that hatred for losing that I have."  </P> <P> Garrido, who had a 111-57 record and won two Big Ten championships at Illinois,  has not decided who his assistants will be, but former major league shortstop  Rick Burleson has been mentioned.  </P> <P> So has Tom Thomas, a former Titan outfielder who worked under Garrido at  Illinois. Garrido said Thomas is considering an offer to join Loyola Marymount  Coach Chris Smith's staff. Garrido's top Illinois assistant, former Titan  player Jody Robinson, will apply for the head job at Illinois.  </P> <P> Garrido beat out three other finalists for the Fullerton job: UC Santa Barbara  Coach Al Ferrer, Riverside City Coach Dennis Rogers and Cerritos Coach George  Horton.  </P> <P> "Our intention was to hire the best baseball coach available, and I think we  did that," DiTolla said. "We look forward to great things from Augie Garrido.  His record speaks for itself. He's just what we needed to vault the program  into the 1990s."  </P> <P> </P> <P> GARRIDO'S RECORD  </P> <P> The collegiate baseball coaching record of Augie Garrido, who was hired Tuesday  for a second stint at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <TABLE CWL="1.56IN:3.76IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / The Property Market: Brighter outlook for the bargain-hunters - Lower values and reduced interest rates have created opportunities for investors Is this the time for investors to move into the property market in the UK? Counter-cyclical strategists - people who invest against prevailing trends - can take heart from opinion polls that suggest that confidence in the property industry has never been so low. At the same time, property yields have rarely been so attractive compared to those of equities and bonds. More encouragement can be taken from the impact of interest rate cuts and the devaluation of sterling since mid-September following its exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. Since then, property shares, which anticipate movements in the underlying property market, have risen by 31 per cent, nearly twice the rise of the rest of the stock market. The cut in UK interest rates by three percentage points since Black Wednesday has made many property acquisitions self-financing. Entrepreneurs have found they could borrow money for five years fixed at, say, 8 3/4 per cent to buy a good quality property with a yield of 10 per cent. The cut in interest rates has stimulated a flurry of investment deals, particularly in the City of London. German investors have been particularly prominent following the devaluation of sterling. The latest such deal was this week's Pounds 73m sale of MEPC's office building in Finsbury Circus in the City to DIFA, a German property fund, on a yield of 8.6 per cent. 'It is the first time for many years that quality property of this calibre could be acquired at a level which is presently self-financing,' said Mr John Rigg, investment director of Debenham Tewson Chinnocks, which arranged the deal. The case for buying property largely rests on the unprecedented shift in values in recent years. UK office values have now fallen to half their value at the peak of property values three years ago. The gap between property and equity yields, which was negligible in the early 1980s, has now widened: property yields are now double the yields on equities. At the same time, yields on property now stand at an unprecedented 1.3 points above gilts, according to the Investment Property Databank, a research company. Property yields are also well above short-term interest rates. This has happened only twice before in the past 25 years. Both occasions - the Barber boom of 1971 and the recovery from the 1974-75 property crash - were auspicious for the property market. A historical view can also provide a case for property as a means of diversifying pension fund portfolios, which some actuaries believe are now overexposed to equities. 'Over the past 25 years, property has produced a far better return than gilts and has not lagged far behind equities. Of the three major media (property, gilts and equities), returns from property have also been the least volatile,' said Mr John Hetherington, an associate at Chesterton, property adviser. 'The underlying reason for avoiding property is that recent history remains more in the mind than that of the further past.' But these arguments are not conclusive. First, property yields are hardly inexplicably high. Property will have no growth potential so long as supply exceeds demand. Indeed, rents are still falling. Although investors expect retail rents to bottom out in 1993, they expect industrial rental values to fall by a further 4 per cent over the next 12 months and office rental values by another 8 per cent, says IPD. Second, lower interest rates do not guarantee improved performance. This point, which is already evident from the market's lack of response to a fall in interest rates from 15 per cent to 7 per cent since 1990, is underlined by the absence of a correlation between base rates and the performance of the property sector over the past 20 years. Even the striking coincidence between the property upturns of 1971 and 1977 and the decline of short-term interest rates below property yields may be misleading. Kleinwort Benson, the investment bank, points out that with high inflation, real interest rates were negative in 1971 and 1977. Real interest rates are unlikely to fall below 2 per cent in the short term even with a much looser monetary policy, it says. Moreover, the decline in short-term interest rates has not impressed institutions, which unlike more entrepreneurial investors, tend to compare property yields with gilts. Gilt yields have fallen only modestly in recent months, thanks to concern about inflation, the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) and a drying-up of interest in UK gilts by overseas investors. When IPD conducted a survey of institution investors, it found that hopes of a widespread and rapid fall in yields had evaporated. 'The average estimate now is that only retail yields will fall significantly in the next 12 months, by about half a percentage point,' says IPD. But perhaps the most sobering argument against assuming that falling interest rates will help the property market is that asset values respond less to the cost of money than its availability. There is little reason to believe that the supply of credit to the property industry will expand while the banks are nursing so many bad property loans. Moreover, institutions are unlikely to increase their allocation to property. Property has lost its reputation for stability, it has shrunk to a minimal share of most pension funds' portfolios and the institutions' cashflow is likely to be directed to gilts to finance the PSBR. For all that, there are pockets of demand in the property industry. The oversupply in the industry coupled with the conservatism of lenders and investors is funneling demand into the relatively few buildings with good tenants and long leases. At the other end of the scale, many buildings - perhaps as much as half the market - are virtually unsellable. With such a fragmented market, the case for buying property is neither universal or overwhelming. Nonetheless, the fall in property values and financing costs has created better opportunities than the market has seen in years.</p>

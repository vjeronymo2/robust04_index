			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bohdan Horyn, deputy chairman of the Supreme </F> Council commission for foreign relations, by Myroslav Levytskyy;  place and date not given: "Ukraine Takes Historic Steps, But  Russia Plans Drastic Measures in Turn"]    [Text] Among the deputies who worked on a committee  for ratification of the START I agreement was Bohdan Horyn,  deputy chairman of the commission for foreign relations, who  agreed to comment on the Supreme Council's resolution of START I  and other related questions.    [Horyn] The Supreme Council resolution ratifying the START I  treaty and Lisbon Protocol was an historic moment in helping  address the issue of nuclear weapons deployed in Ukraine.  Ukraine has earnestly been preparing for the adoption of this  important document. However, following the withdrawal of  tactical nuclear weapons from Ukraine, this step has not been  properly understood by other countries.    I want to stress that the Supreme Council resolution of 18  November has several important points. Ukraine, being one of  the inheritors to the USSR, ratified the treaty with provisos  made for the USSR, which obliged the latter to reduce 36 percent  of warhead carriers and 42 percent of all warheads. Ukraine  became a party to the treaty after the disintegration of the  USSR; it signed the Lisbon Protocol with one particular item:  Article 5 has put Ukraine within a framework that would have  been very tight if the protocol had been ratified in its  original version. Therefore, the resolution states that the  Lisbon Protocol has been ratified with the exclusion of Article  5.    Article 5 provides for Ukraine joining the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty with the status of a nonnuclear state.  Taking into account that Ukraine keeps nuclear weapons on its  territory and that they are Ukrainian property, Ukraine's  joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a nonnuclear  state, while at the same time retaining its nuclear weapons,  would be an illogical step and cause a misunderstanding in the  world community. Reassuring the world that Ukraine joined the  treaty as a nonnuclear state, while keeping nuclear weapons on  its territory, we would not quite be in line with logic.  Therefore, according to the Constitution, the final say had to  come from the Supreme Council. The Lisbon Protocol cannot be a  binding document unless ratified.    I believe the assertions of individual officials that  Ukraine  will destroy all its nuclear weapons without condition are a  little premature. Such assertions are unfounded. There were  two opinions during the preparations for ratifying START I. The  deputies who prepared the resolution pressed for determining the  percentage ratio of nuclear reduction as a next step toward  nonnuclear status. The executive structures expressed the  opinion that the percentages should not be fixed because this  may complicate the understanding of Ukraine's position by other  states. The stance of individual representatives of executive  power has been dictated by promises and assertions that they  made during numerous interviews and meetings with high-ranking  foreign officials. This obliged them to defend their position  during the preparation of the Supreme Council draft resolution.    [Levytskyy] The last word was left for the Supreme  Council, so why were diplomats in such a hurry to make  promises?    [Horyn] Diplomacy is often put in a complicated position of  choice. Since Ukraine has unceasingly been pressed by certain  countries, particularly by Russia, executive branch  representatives were forced to make promises under pressure.    [Levytskyy] Still, at one news conference, Deputy  Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk stated that, within the START I  framework, all nuclear weapons are subject to destruction.    [Horyn] I think that the deputy minister misspoke. The  START I agreement was signed by the United States and USSR.  Ukraine has joined it after the downfall of the Soviet Union.  Consequently, the norms of reduction were in the competence of  the Supreme Council. Taking into account that there were some  mistakes made in the initial stage of Ukraine's path to  nonnuclear status, this act has not been legalized by  appropriate documents. In the second stage, as I believe,  previous mistakes were noted and the possibility of  implementation was examined. We have a grounded document with  all the complexities taken into account. These documents give  witness to the maturity of political thinking and the new level  of caution exercised by the deputy body when adopting important  political resolutions.    [Levytskyy] What was the position of the manager  body [dyrektorskyy korpus] with regard to this question?    [Horyn] The so-called deputy majority has undergone many  changes in its attitude toward nuclear weapons. While adopting  the Declaration of State Sovereignty, the managers said that  Ukraine should not give away its nuclear weapons to Russia  because these weapons are of great material value and constitute  a reliable guarantee of our security.    [Levytskyy] However, along with this assessment of the  problem, the Supreme Council has put forth declarations on our  status as a nonnuclear state?    [Horyn] The declarations on Ukraine's nonnuclear status have  exerted great influence on quickening the international  recognition of Ukraine. It seems to me that if we had chosen a  different path, the making of our statehood would have met with  many more difficulties.    However, the Declaration of State Sovereignty and the  Supreme  Soviet resolutions were the very documents which expressed  Ukraine's willingness to become a nonnuclear state in the  future. These documents cannot be interpreted as obligations.  Ukraine's first international obligation to reduce nuclear  weapons was a Supreme Council resolution of 18 November 1993.    [Levytskyy] This question is assessed by the world in  its own way. Nuclear states have a negative view of the Supreme  Council resolution.    [Horyn] The first reaction was voiced by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev. He argued that Ukraine had declared  itself a nuclear state. I will try to explain his position.  Russia, during the first stage of Ukraine's path to nonnuclear  status, behaved like a state that has full control over foreign  territory. Tactical nuclear weapons were stolen from Ukraine by  strategic units, which at that time were under the control of  the CIS Supreme Headquarters. Ukraine had no chance to  counteract Russia's unceremonious behavior on Ukrainian  territory.    Taking this into account, Ukraine put strategic nuclear  weapons under administrative control. Russia has lost an  opportunity to withdraw strategic nuclear weapons from Ukraine  without Ukraine's consent. Moreover, despite the fact that the  possessions of the former USSR on Ukrainian territory were  declared to be Ukrainian property, Russia did not recognize that  the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukraine were  Ukrainian property. It was done without regard to the fact that  Russia has also adopted a zero option. Nonrecognition of  property implies a denial of compensation for material goods,  for enriched uranium and plutonium.    There is also a third reason for the harsh Russian reaction.  Politicians in Moscow understand pretty well that strategic  nuclear weapons are a stimulating factor. Even despite the fact  that Ukraine does not exercise operational control over  strategic nuclear weapons, their presence plays an important and  stimulating role. Therefore, Ukraine cannot be approached  unceremoniously, as was done with Moldova, Georgia, and  Tajikistan.    [Levytskyy] How will the ratification of START I and,  subsequently, the destruction of nuclear missiles affect the  economic situation in Ukraine?    [Horyn] The reservations in the ratification document state  that Ukraine will be able to implement the adopted obligations  providing it receive appropriate financial and material  assistance from Western countries, as well as security  guarantees. I would like to stress that the international  community should be interested in Ukraine's movement toward  nonnuclear status. The reduction of nuclear weapons is a matter  of great interest for Ukraine as well, which has suffered from  Chernobyl. This is a matter of interest for the United States,  at which those rockets are aimed. The United States should take  the most active part in liquidating nuclear weapons, because  this question directly affects U.S. national security.    [Levytskyy] Thank you for the interview.</p>

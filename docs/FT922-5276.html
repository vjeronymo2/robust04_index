			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Milosevic in a fight to save his political life - Serbian militia forces would see any appeal by the president to bring an end to the fighting as a betrayal of their cause SERBIAN president Slobodan Milosevic has been cornered by the international community, led by the US. The United Nations sanctions imposed on Saturday night against Serbia and its ally Montenegro mean that Serbia is now being held responsible for the fighting, destruction, mutilation and killings which have swept Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia over the past year. In the first real sign of desperation, Mr Milosevic appealed at the weekend to US President George Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to stop the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although he said he would co-operate in their efforts, he attacked sanctions, which unfairly singled out Serbia, he said. For the first time since he came to power in 1987, Mr Milosevic is battling for his political life. The question now is whether he can survive. Not only does he face, for the first time, the ire of the international community, but Serbs, who for five years have staunchly defended his expansionist policies, are not expected to come to his defence. Serbia's many warlords - including Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as Arkan and head of a ruthless Serb paramilitary unit, and Mr Radovan Karadzic, nationalist head of Bosnia's Serbs - are accusing Mr Milosevic of being 'too soft' and 'too moderate'. Serb militia forces, who already control large swathes of Bosnian territory, would regard any appeal by Mr Milosevic to end the fighting as treasonable, a betrayal of the Serbian cause. 'We will fight for Serbia. We will not give up the struggle,' a defiant Arkan said in Belgrade. On the other side, the anti-war demonstration in Belgrade yesterday may have come too late to atone for the deaths of at least 10,000 people, and the displacement of more than 1.5m. Those who marched represented thousands of the liberal, powerless middle-class which has been jolted at last out of its passive attitude to Mr Milosevic by the horror of the war in Sarajevo. The demonstration was confined to the Serbian capital. By contrast, in parts of the Serbian and Montenegran countryside, millions of people - but not the opposition parties or the ethnic Albanians of Serbian-controlled Kosovo - turned out to vote in parliamentary elections aimed at legitimising the new, rump Yugoslavia. The capital and other large cities do not represent a nation-wide consensus. The gap between the cities and the conservative countryside is wide. Mr Milosevic, and particularly the nationalists, are likely to exploit it in their quest for a greater Serbia. This sharp polarisation within Serbia means that sanctions are unlikely to stop the war in neighbouring Bosnia - nor will sanctions necessarily prevent Serbia being engulfed in a civil war engineered by fanatical nationalist Serb groups which have not only been radicalised by the war, but are more fervent than Mr Milosevic. Against this background, his conciliatory appeal for co-operation from the international community at the weekend has come too late. This is because he has consistently failed to identify Serbia and the Yugoslav army as the aggressor in the war in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Yet, when it suited him, particularly under international pressure, Mr Milosevic reined in some radical Serbs, such as Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of Croatia. Because of Mr Milosevic's unpredictable nature, a senior western diplomat warned: 'You cannot yet write off Milosevic - nor can you be sure that sanctions will put an end to the fighting in Bosnia'. The war in Bosnia-Hercegovina is also likely to continue because the fighting there has traumatised and radicalised the Croat, Serb and Moslem communities, all of which are seeking revenge. In Hercegovina, where there is a heavy concentration of Croats, ultra-nationalist Croatian units, partly supported by Croatia (while others are acting independently), are still fighting to attach Hercegovina to Croatia. In other parts of Bosnia, Moslem militiamen, incensed by the killings, are determined to continue fighting. They are no longer convinced that any peace conference or sanctions will stop Serbian paramilitary units - led by Mr Karadzic, Mr Raznatovic, or General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army in Bosnia - creating ethnically-pure regions in Bosnia. US and UN officials in Belgrade are suggesting that, if the sanctions fail, the use of force will be actively considered. This could involve securing Sarajevo airport, held by Serb militia and the federal army, so as to allow food, medicine and humanitarian supplies into the city. This speculation has been fuelled by the response from some Serb quarters to the threat of sanctions. Arkan said last week: 'I don't give a damn about sanctions. We do not need democracy in Serbia. We only need to be united. We will fight for united Serbian lands. This is war. . .'</p>

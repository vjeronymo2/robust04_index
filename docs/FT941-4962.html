			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Malaysia still cool after Prior visit Senior Malaysian officials have warned that it may take some time for Britain to improve relations. This is in spite of attempts by leading British business figures to persuade Kuala Lumpur to lift an order banning UK companies from participating in new government contracts. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, yesterday had a lengthy meeting with Lord Prior, chairman of GEC and a former British cabinet minister. Although British diplomats in Kuala Lumpur stressed that Lord Prior's secretive two-day visit to Malaysia was private, a senior official in London said the mission 'had the blessing of Downing Street'. Lord Prior was believed to be on his way back to London last night and is expected to report to Mr John Major today on his meeting with Dr Mahathir. Sir Charles Powell, a director of Trafalgar House and former foreign affairs adviser to Mr Major and Baroness Thatcher, has also been in Malaysia. GEC is among the British companies hardest hit by the Malaysian ban. Together with Trafalgar House and Balfour Beatty, it is part of an Anglo-Japanese consortium which had been hoping to carry out a large part of the work on a new Pounds 3bn international airport outside Kuala Lumpur. GEC has also sold defence equipment to Malaysia under the controversial 1988 memorandum of understanding between the two countries. Malaysian officials privately admit that Dr Mahathir is unlikely to take any quick decision to rescind his government's order against British companies. It is felt that Dr Mahathir wants a more outspoken condemnation from Downing Street of reports in the British media - in particular a report in The Sunday Times - alleging that he and other members of the Malaysian government had been involved in seeking under-the-table payments from a British company.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Travel: Lecce's wild baroque - Ian Thomson visits the Florence of southern Italy WATER is in short supply in Lecce, a province situated in the heel of the Italian boot. Rainfall is so light that Horace honoured the region with the epithet siticulosae - thirsty. To combat the dryness you might sample a glass of Malvasia di Lecce, a sparkling (and apparently explosive) white wine. Mooching around Apulia, the author Osbert Sitwell related how a bottle of this wine was uncorked with 'immense noise, as of a mine being exploded, while a torrent of sparkling liquid splashed like a golden fountain over a passing lorry. It was like the launching of a battleship; the hubbub was indescribable . . .' I suppose the best place in which to sample this wine is Lecce itself, the Apulian town after which it is named. Lecce is a city of baroque run wild under the influence of the Spanish court between 1660 and 1770. The city then had as many monks as laymen: for the breadth of its ecclesiastical scholarship, it was known as the Apulian Athens. Churches were built with lunatic ornamentation. Their portals are adorned with grinning caryatids and great festoons of foliage; cornices swirl round columns, windows are laden with great swags of flowers upheld by stone trophies or heraldic crests. Lecce is quite an embarrassment of baroque, a great monument to the stonemason's art. Sitwell himself adored the place. He compared it (perhaps after a bottle of Malvasia) to a giant fruit bowl. Yet Lecce is still fairly unknown. It must be the rare southern Italian city never to have put Garibaldi up for the night. An 1883 Baedeker to the Mezzogiorno has only this to say about Lecce: 'Situated in an unattractive district, not far from the sea.' Lecce was discovered by foreigners 20 years later when a British architect, Martin Briggs, published a book in praise of the churches. Briggs relates in Unknown City how the flourish of architecture in Lecce was more or less coincident with the designs of Sir Christopher Wren in London. The colour of the local stone from which churches were constructed is a warm golden brown, and so malleable that you can cut it with a knife. No building was too intricate or decorative that it could not be fashioned from pietra di Lecce. Marble itself was hostile to such florid carving - too hard on the chisel. The supreme expression of Lecce baroque is the Chiesa di Santa Croce. It took 150 years to build and the facade pullulates with detail: fantastic monsters adorn a rose window of wedding-cake fanciness, miniature angels flit to and fro along the conduits. The architect Antonio Zimbalo (nicknamed Il Zingarello - Little Gypsy) was responsible. Much of Lecce as it stands today is the product of his lunatic design. Zimbalo's efforts were rooted firmly in renaissance classicism, but they are more miracles of decoration than architecture. Piazza del Duomo, a theatrical showcase, was once the administrative heart of Lecce. It is a rare example in Italy of a completely closed square. There is nothing quite like it, I think, in Europe. The cathedral, rebuilt in 1659 by the ubiquitous Zimbalo, is an illustration of how even the decorations in Lecce have themselves been decorated: there are angels everywhere. To the right of the cathedral stands the magnificent seminary. This was designed by a student of Zimbalo's, Giuseppe Cino. Scrollworks of sandstone are patterned like icing on a cake; a communal well in the courtyard appears to sprout clumps of giant broccoli (actually stone pomegranates) that have been split to reveal the seeds inside. This is barocco leccese in all its fancy futility, insanely ornamental. The weird and wonderful Chiesa del Rosario, Zimbalo's last work, is larded with stone vases of fruit and flowers, giant acorns, chiselled peacocks which peck at melon, pear and fig. Its cloisters have been commandeered by the Italian government's Tobacco Administration. Lecce is not all bijouterie baroque. The curious Missionary Museum of Chinese Artifacts will delight any sinophile. Dusty rooms are cluttered with 12th-century Chinese coins, buddhist figurines, bronze statuettes of Kubla Khan, together with tools and weapons made by the 'aboriginal peoples of Formosa.' For some reason the museum also contains more than 200 specimens of crustaceans in a marine fauna section. Nearby in Piazza Sant'Oronzo, dominated by a bronze statue of the city's patron saint, stand the remains of a Roman amphitheatre. Sunk below ground, the archaeological site is littered with slabs of stone that show gladiators gored by bulls, or fending off lions with spears. In a province of stout Norman churches and restrained Romanesque cathedrals, Lecce will come as a glorious surprise. It is the Florence of the Italian south. Lunch in the Grand Hotel of Lecce (a magnificent Edwardian establishment whose interminable corridors nevertheless bring to mind a state penitentiary) should, of course, be accompanied by a bottle of Sitwell's Malvasia. The wine will not explode, only effervesce.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN IN CUSTODY AFTER PELLET RIFLE INCIDENT;  </P> <P> ARREST: AN OFFICER FIRED A SHOT IN THE SUSPECT'S DIRECTION AS HE WAS TAKEN INTO  CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGEDLY POINTING WEAPON AT I-5 DRIVERS. NO ONE WAS HURT.  </P> <P> An 18-year-old San Juan Capistrano man who allegedly pointed a pellet gun at  motorists on Interstate 5 at the La Paz Road exit was taken into custody  Thursday, authorities said.  </P> <P> No one was injured during the incident, which occurred on the dirt embankment  south of the La Paz Road off-ramp, and it was not certain whether the man  actually fired his weapon at any of the passing cars, California Highway Patrol  Officer Gary Alfonso said.  </P> <P> Alfonso said a highway patrolman fired his weapon toward the suspect when he  was taken into custody, but no one was hit.  </P> <P> Alfonso said CHP officers received a call about 11:50 a.m. from a motorist  reporting that a man was walking along the embankment pointing a rifle at  southbound traffic.  </P> <P> CHP officers and Orange County sheriff's deputies surrounded the suspect,  identified as Isauro Gonzalez Giles, after a short foot pursuit and ordered him  at gunpoint to drop his weapon.  </P> <P> Giles, 18, complied with the officers' order but then, for unknown reasons,  made a move to pick up his weapon again, officers at the scene said. Before  Giles could grab the rifle, a CHP officer identified as Toni Kodera fired one  round in the suspect's direction, officers said.  </P> <P> Giles later told investigators that he was walking along the embankment  "shooting at birds," Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> Olson said Giles, who had not been booked late Thursday, could face a charge of  suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. Giles' weapon was later determined  to be a pellet rifle, Olson said, adding that no motorists have reported being  hit by pellets.  </P></p>

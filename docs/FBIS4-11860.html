			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat </F> 'Abd-al-Majid by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo, date not given; from the  "Arabs' Home" program--recorded]    [Text] [Hijazi] Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid, the Libyan-Western  crisis was a topic at the Arab League's 101st session. News  agencies have quoted British officials as saying that the  International Court of Justice [ICJ] only looks into conflicts  between nations, not into criminal cases. They were commenting  on the Arab League's proposal that the two Libyan suspects  appear before a Scottish court affiliated with the ICJ. What is  your reaction?    ['Abd-al-Majid] I have heard these statements. I believe the  British Foreign Office officials know full well, as do I, the  jurisdiction of the ICJ. The Arab League has never thought that  this case is within the jurisdiction of the ICJ. This is the  alphabet of the international law. They say this is not the  business of the ICJ. I have never said it is. I am talking  about a Scottish court applying Scotland's law but having its  seat in the ICJ in The Hague; the ICJ will have nothing to do  with the case. I hope this clarification will serve as a  response to the statement of the official British Foreign Office  spokesman, who, I am sure, knows very well what I am talking  about.    The idea, as discussed by the seven-member committee and in  the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers, is that we apply  Scottish law, as the incident took place in Scotland. Judicial  rules say that when an incident takes place in a country, the  law of that country is applied. As concerns Libya, it is only  natural for any country not to hand over its subjects for trial  in foreign countries. The Libyan position in this regard is  fully in keeping with the international law. The suspects can  appear before a Scottish court in accordance with Scottish law,  and, at the same time, the trial can take place in a neutral  country, whether the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria, or any  other country. But the ICJ will have nothing to do with the  case.    Why Scottish law? I would like to explain an important point  here. In criminal cases, Scottish law is more flexible than  British law. A Scottish court examining a case has three  options concerning the defendant: guilty, not guilty, not  proven [previous five words in English]. In Britain, courts  apply what they call common law [previous two words in English],  and they have only two choices against the defendant: guilty or  not guilty. Scottish law, therefore, is more flexible. The  painful Lockerbie incident took place in Scotland. So, we say  let us apply Scottish law. Libya accepted that, and the Arab  League Council ratified it. We are talking about a Scottish  court, with Scottish judges, and perhaps other judges. The  Scottish law will be applied where the suspect -- who is  innocent until proven guilty -- is given a chance to be found  not-proven. That is the whole thing.    [Hijazi] We were optimistic that an Arab court of justice  would see the light, and that the Arab League Charter would be  amended during the Arab League Council session. Why were these  two projects postponed?    ['Abd-al-Majid] Concerning the Arab court of justice plan, I  would like to give the credit to its rightful owners; namely,  those who laid down the Arab League Charter in 1945. Article 19  of the Charter mentions this court. It was conceived in 1945,  but it never came to be. The idea was revived now so that the  court can serve as a mechanism to resolve Arab conflicts by  peaceful means. Going to the court is optional; no country can  be forced to go to the court. The OAU established a mechanism to  resolve African conflicts. As regards the amendment of the Arab  League Charter, this has been under consideration for many  years, but it did not happen either. There have lately been many  changes that have pushed us to think of some important  amendments, particularly adopting resolutions by a two-thirds  majority rather than unanimity. Current Arab circumstances, and  I understand this, prompted some countries to ask for a  postponement of this issue. But both subjects, an Arab court  and an amendment of the Charter, are still open; the door is not  closed.</p>

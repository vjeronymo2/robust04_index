			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY SKIPS DEBATE, FRUSTRATES ELECTION FOES  </P> <P> One mayoral candidate proposed a four-day week for city workers and another  pledged to veto proposals that increase crowding in residential neighborhoods  as underdog challengers debated Saturday, without Los Angeles Mayor Tom  Bradley.  </P> <P> The four-day week was advocated by Leonard Miropol, a former therapist who is  running as "The Conscience of Los Angeles." The veto pledge came from former  Los Angeles County Supervisor Baxter Ward, who said he would block any city  legislation that has the effect of increasing density.  </P> <P> But the candidate who spoke strongest of the issue most troubling to the  challengers was Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden, who attacked the mayor  for avoiding debates.  </P> <P> "Why should we be ignored by the mayor?" Holden asked during the debate in Van  Nuys. "Why should he be permitted to ignore us? TV cameras should be here  photographing that empty chair. . . ."  </P> <P> The three candidates spoke to an audience of about 35 at a forum was sponsored  by a group of San Fernando Valley homeowner and community organizations.  </P></p>

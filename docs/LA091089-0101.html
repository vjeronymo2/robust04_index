			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NASSCO SHOWS DAMAGED PART OF VALDEZ HULL  </P> <P> Wayne Butterfield, a National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding employee who helped  build the Exxon Valdez during the mid-1980s, summed up the feeling when he  first saw the hull of the ill-fated tanker.  </P> <P> "It makes you feel strange," said Butterfield, who is acting as ship's manager  for repair work that will begin next week in a Nassco graving dock on San Diego  Bay.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the company gave the public its first glimpse at the severely  damaged tanker when it opened the dock to news media.  </P> <P> The Valdez's left side was largely undamaged in March when the tanker ran  aground on a submerged reef in Alaska, causing the nation's worst oil spill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Eerie Scene  </P> <P> But the right side of the tanker, which sits on concrete and wooden blocks,  presents an eerie spectacle.  </P> <P> When the tanker ran aground, whole sheets of three-quarter-inch steel that form  the Exxon Valdez's hull were twisted and bent -- or completely torn away. Other  metal sheets were cut off by divers earlier this summer as the ship waited to  enter the repair yard.  </P> <P> Many of the steel "stiffeners" that formed the ill-fated tanker's skeleton are  missing or crumpled beyond recognition.  </P> <P> Two huge boulders -- one the size of a Volkswagen Bug -- that were scooped from  the ocean's bottom and carried from Alaska to San Diego remain wedged in the  hull. A  </P> <P> nearby sign alerts visitors to "rocks and falling debris."  </P> <P> Ballast tanks and oil tanks, all of which have been emptied and cleaned, are  visible where the hull has been peeled away. The hull has been marked up by a  National Transportation Safety Board crew that is surveying the ship as part of  the federal government's investigation.  </P> <P> The most damage occurred toward the middle of the right side, where there is a  gaping hole about 300 feet by 80 feet. An observer standing below the ship can  easily see the massive oil tanks -- as well as the deck that towers nearly 100  feet above.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Humbling Experience'  </P> <P> "We build ships, we don't sail them," Nassco President Richard Vortmann said  Saturday. "But it's a humbling experience to see what Mother Nature can do to  three-quarter-inch steel. The damage is extensive."  </P> <P> Vortmann knows of no other tanker to have been repaired after absorbing so much  damage.  </P> <P> Vortmann compared the repair job to a "child playing with blocks . . . you have  to remove the damaged blocks before you replace them with new blocks."  </P> <P> Crews will first cut away the bulbous bow section, which, although undamaged,  must be removed so crews can get at the 12 compartments that were damaged. Once  all the damaged sections have been removed, Nassco will rebuild the ship to its  original specifications.  </P> <P> The $25-million repair job is expected to take about nine months. It's  expensive, but the cost of repairing the ship falls far below the $130 million  to $150 million it would cost to build a new one, Vortmann said.  </P></p>

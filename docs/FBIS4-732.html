			<p>BFN     [Text] In Cuanza Norte the Luanda government is trying to  storm N'Dalatando. Our correspondent Morais Abel reports:    In a vain attempt to cross Lucala 2 River, a number of  clashes have taken place, particularly one in which the enemy  lost a number of senior officers, including Colonel Chico Cuma,  chief of the General Staff of the 45th Regiment, Lieutenant  Colonel Neto, commander of that regiment's 1st Battalion, and a  captain in charge of the tank company.    Two battalions of special forces, which the Popular Movement  for the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] regards as the most powerful  units involved in the ongoing offensive, have been put to  flight. The two battalions suffered (?17) killed, including a  lieutenant and three noncommissioned officers. Our forces  captured 14 AK47's, and assorted ammunition. Noncommissioned  officer Carlos Antonio Congumi, a member of the Luanda garrison  command and born in Cuanza Sul, was taken prisoner during a  clash. He revealed secret information which has helped Armed  Forces for the Liberation of Angola combatants in their  defensive operations [words indistinct] on the Luanda-Dondo and  Dondo-Dange-ia-Menha roads, which are used as supply lines for  the MPLA.    Enemy commanders and soldiers have become frustrated in view  of systematic desertions and embezzlement of supplies [words  indistinct]. On 10 April 87 members of the operational  commandos fled, one of whom was captured by our forces. The  others headed to their homes.</p>

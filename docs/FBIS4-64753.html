			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Survey: Communes Considered Bad </F> Entrepreneurs"]    [Text] Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic  Party) expects the privatization of communal enterprises and  services to create more jobs.    At a joint news conference with the Federal Association of  Young Entrepreneurs [BJU], Rexrodt said that although initially  there could be personnel reductions because of excessive  employment in former commune-controlled enterprises, such  increases in efficiency always mean a saving of funds, which in  turn means higher profits by privatized enterprises and reduced  costs to citizens. The leftover profits are then available to  the enterprises for investment purposes, or to the citizens for  consumer purposes. In this way, employment opportunities are  created elsewhere.    Apart from this, said Rexrodt, it cannot be assumed that  financial officials will keep the money earned through  privatization in a sock. Instead, it will be spent on other  undertakings that can create new jobs or preserve existing ones.  The 14,500 communes in Germany provide services that private  entrepreneurs could provide equally well, therefore the  potential for privatization is enormous.    Happily, privatization among the laender and communes has  increased, said Rexrodt. However, these must not remain  isolated cases that were only undertaken because of empty  coffers. On the other hand there has been an absence of  consistent privatization strategies.    Rexrodt greeted the deal reached between Lufthansa and the  Federation concerning the airline's privatization. The  Federation should now encourage the privatization of shares in  the Rhein-Main-Donau AG, Neckar AG, the State Freeway Subsidiary  Services Company, and the Deutsche Genossenchaftsbank.    BJU Chairman Thomas Suwelack reported the results of an  Emnid  survey whereby 70 percent of the respondents had said that the  communes are bad entrepreneurs, 66 percent had said that  privatization means not just greater efficiency but also a  reduction of the burden on communal coffers, and 55 percent had  said that privatization should cause an improvement to important  public services.</p>

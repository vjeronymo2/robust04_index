			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / German employers cancel engineering wage accords WEST GERMAN engineering industry employers threw down the gauntlet for a bitter wages battle with their 4m employees yesterday by abruptly announcing the cancellation of their existing contracts for pay and holidays. For the first time since post-war pay negotiations began, the employers  - rather than the mighty IG Metall trade union - served formal notice of termination of the agreements. While cancellation of the existing wages contract from the end of the year is a formality, cancellation of the holiday contract is seen on the union side as a clear move to cut the 10-year-old deal on holiday entitlements. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, the employers' organisation for the mechanical and electrical engineering industries, including most of the German motor industry, said the move was aimed at cutting costs across the sector. He called on the trade union 'to enter into negotiations without delay (to decide) precisely where we can introduce changes in wages and improvements in productivity' which would result in rapid cost cuts for employers. The leadership of IG Metall reacted angrily to what it saw as a declaration of hostilities only four days before the trade union is due to hold its annual conference and elect a new leader. Mr Klaus Zwickel, IG Metall's acting leader, called it 'a double assault on workers' wages . . . first they have to pay by losing jobs, and then they have to pay again by losing wages'. Union officials believe that the powerful small and medium-sized enterprises that dominate the Gesamtmetall membership have seized the initiative from the heavyweights of German industry such as Siemens, Robert Bosch and Daimler-Benz. The latter have dictated relatively generous pay settlements in recent years in order to ensure continuing industrial peace. IG Metall believes the real focus of the employers is on their 10-year-old holiday contract. At present, it allows a six-week period of paid holiday throughout the engineering industry, plus an extra 50 per cent holiday pay. At a press conference in Cologne, Mr Gottschol said: 'The economic situation of the German engineering and electrical industries is worse than it has ever been.' Mr Gottschol said the industry was making a post-tax profit on turnover of only 0.1 per cent, and expected an overall loss for 1993. He said unit wage costs had risen by 20 per cent over the past three years. Western German engineering industry production fell by 14 per cent in the first half. Bankruptcies were up by 14 per cent to 612 in the first half. Since the beginning of 1991 the sector has lost almost 500,000 jobs.</p>

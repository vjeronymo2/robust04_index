			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Referendum urged on death penalty MRS ANN Winterton, Tory MP for Congleton, yesterday tabled a Commons motion 'regretting the failure of successive governments to halt the inexorable rise in the number of murders in the United Kingdom'. The motion - which is unlikely to be debated - says a national advisory referendum should be held so that 'the will of the people can be expressed on the return to the courts of the option of the death penalty in a range of specified circumstances'.</p>

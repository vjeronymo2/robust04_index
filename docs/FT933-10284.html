			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Russia's eastern ports enjoy an embarrassment of riches - But traders suffer from the congestion RUSSIA'S newly privatised Far Eastern trade ports have found themselves in an enviable position: they have far more customers than they can handle. Three ports facing the Sea of Japan hold the key to Russia's trade with the Far East. However, each is able to handle a maximum of 11m tonnes of cargo a year, putting a ceiling on that trade. The privatisation of Vladivostok's trade port was completed in April. The nearby ports of Nakhodka and Vostochnyy went private last year. Privatisation has not, however, increased competition. 'If a customer says they can get a better deal at Nakhodka, we can say, 'Take your business and go to Nakhodka,' because we know that there are five more companies waiting to do business with us,' says Mr Sergei Movchan, commercial director of Teko, a cargo agent linked to the port of Vladivostok. Teko's main line of business is forwarding metals to Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and other countries. Its terms include payment in advance, usually in hard currency, even for Russian customers used to paying in roubles. Mr Movchan estimates that about 80 per cent of imports through Vladivostok are financed by private businessmen bringing in consumer goods. He is also seeing an increasing number of new businessmen buying up export quotas for raw materials, including metals, timber, and minerals. The role of the ministry of transport, which ruled the old Soviet transport system with an iron grip, has been diminished since privatisation, not always with entirely positive results. Some new businessmen, not yet used to the new system, load goods onto the Trans-Siberian Express without reaching prior agreement with the ports, says Mr Movchan. Last summer there were 7,000 train wagons waiting to be unloaded at Vladivostok. The ports put the blame for the bottlenecks firmly at the door of the businessmen and the railway. 'We did not pay one dollar or one rouble in fines for delays last year. All the hold-ups are on the railroad waiting to get into the port,' says Mr Mikhail Robkanov, president of Vladivostok Commercial Port Corporation. Some of the bitterest complaints come from Russia's largest trade fleet, The Far Eastern Shipping Company (Fesco). 'It is a matter of principle,' that the ports should not be privatised. Practically nowhere in the civilised or so-called capitalist world are ports in private hands,' claims Mr George Pikus, vice president of Fesco. 'When we negotiate with the ports, it is one monopoly talking to another, but they are bigger monopolists than we are,' says Mr Pikus. But Mr Gennady Zhebelev, general manager of the merchant port of Vostochnyy, claims that competition for high quality customers is starting. Vostochnyy has poached exporting clients from Nakhodka, including a logging complex from Irkutsk. Among other projects, Vostochnyy has a Dollars 100m credit from Deutsche Bank to build a fertiliser handling complex. But even at Vostochnyy, the region's largest and most modern trade port, bottlenecks are not unknown. In January, 1,500 wagons arrived carrying coal from Siberia. The coals had frozen and the port equipment could not unload them. Equipment was not available to move the wagons off the track, and trains queued up behind. Solutions to these problems may lie in western technology and management skills. For the past three years, Sea-Land, the giant US transportation company, has been operating a joint venture with the Russian ministry of railways to handle containers at Vostochnyy and transport them along the Trans-Siberian Railway. Sea-Land claims to have cut the overland route from Japan to Europe from 45 to 21 days.</p>

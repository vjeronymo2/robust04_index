			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyudmila Yermakova on interview with Federation </F> Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko; place and date not given:  "Vladimir Shumeyko: The Legislative Foundation of the Reforms  Must Be Strengthened"]    [Text] The third session of the Federation Council, which  lasted three days, demonstrated that the "questions raised in  the chamber are very serious, stemming from the state's main  preoccupations at the moment, showing what important times we  live in and how the upper chamber can strengthen the reforms  with laws," Federation Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko said  in an exclusive interview for your ITAR-TASS correspondent. The  speaker described the "absence of factionalism and party  divisions in the chamber" as one of the reasons for the  deputies' rapid and efficient work. "We don't care where the  proposal comes from, as long as it is practical," he explained.    Vladimir Shumeyko announced that the president's message to  the Federal Assembly will be examined at the next plenary  session, which opens on 15 March. But the deputies have already  discussed certain problems that directly relate to or develop  the appeal. Boris Yeltsin said that the time has come for the  government and legislators to determine the priorities in the  state, the chamber head pointed out. He regards the fight  against crime as one of these priorities. The deputies adopted  a decree on measures to strengthen the fight against crime in  the Russian Federation. Having said that the strengthening of  law and order is one of the main means of strengthening the  Russian state, that is precisely what the president's message is  called, Vladimir Shumeyko stressed.    The deputies agreed that the establishment of order in the  country is more important at the moment even than economic  reform. They based their thinking on the fact that this  "comprehensive and all-embracing problem starts with the  question of power." The parliamentarian believes that it is  necessary above all to create a strong vertical power system,  from top to bottom, so that adopted decisions can be monitored  and everyone can be compelled to implement them.    The state is obliged to ensure the implementation of the  imperative constitutional demand -- protection of human rights,  above all the right to life, Vladimir Shumeyko believes.  According to him, the fight against crime also involves  question of economic reform. In the transitional period, when  the old has been destroyed but the new has not yet been created,  one must be very careful to ensure that certain legal norms do  not become the object of expansion of criminal activity.    The problem of borders comes into this category, the speaker  said. It is the Federation Council's job to tackle it.  Undetermined borders enable every Tom, Dick, and Harry to enter  the territory of the Russian Federation, carrying all manner of  things -- weapons, drugs. The question of introducing a state  of emergency is also the upper chamber's prerogative, its head  pointed out. A great many weapons have accumulated in trouble  spots, which also leads to an increase in crime. Vladimir  Shumeyko does not rule out the possibility that as a result of  parliamentary hearings on measures to strengthen the fight  against crime the chamber will suggest to the president that he  introduce states of emergency in some areas of Russia in order  to be able to seize the weapons that have accumulated there.    Concerning the chamber's forms of work, Vladimir Shumeyko  noted that its work should be strengthened via the committees.  Following the repairs to the Federation Council building the  committees now have conditions for more vigorous and successful  activity, he believes. In the two weeks that remain before the  next session committees are instructed, in particular, to  examine and discuss the plan for drafting laws. The committees  will do this in accordance with the president's message, which  is on the agenda for discussion at the fourth plenary session of  the Federation Council. Vladimir Shumeyko stressed that  parliamentarians must not only express their views on the  message, but also weave its provisions into their work plans.  He stressed that Boris Yeltsin's message "can be regarded as  the first program we have had since 1991 for the development of  a great state." The laws designed to develop and strengthen  this program "must be of that standard," the Federation Council  chairman concluded.</p>

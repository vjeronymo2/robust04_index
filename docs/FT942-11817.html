			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Management: Unwieldy giant reborn in a glen - James Buxton explains how IBM's Greenock plant increased output while lowering manufacturing costs The problems facing IBM's personal computer business have been highlighted this week with news of another imminent shake-up in top management. Yet the operating challenge for IBM is better illustrated by recent changes at its manufacturing complex at Greenock in Scotland. The aim of this reorganisation - to focus more on the needs of the customer  -merely brings the company into line with its competitors. But the scale of the transformation has been formidable, for the Greenock site is Big Blue's biggest manufacturing site for personal computers. Whether the changes will be sufficient to restore this IBM business to healthy profitability remains to be seen - the personal computer market, after all, is notorious for its volatility, for tiny margins and for the tendency of competitors to rise from almost nowhere and gain market share. What cannot be denied is that in the past 18 months the seemingly unwieldy IBM facility at Greenock has greatly reduced its unit manufacturing costs, while increasing the volume of output by 50 per cent. The improvement followed the restructuring in September 1992 of IBM's Dollars 9bn (Pounds 6bn) PC business, with the setting up of a semi-autonomous company called IBM PC. It also involved a more radical approach than the sort of job cutting which marked IBM's productivity gains in the 1980s. Despite this, IBM's leading share of the European PC market, which had touched 15 per cent in 1990, had been eroded to about 12 per cent by 1992 as rival manufacturers undercut IBM on price for broadly similar products, and responded more speedily to orders. IBM PC was set up in response to these pressures. Greenock, which is almost entirely run by Scots, took over the distribution of PCs in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and 14 distribution operations in different countries were wound up. Previously the country subsidiaries, such as IBM France, had given Greenock a forecast of their needs and then stockpiled computers when they arrived from the plant. 'We used to ship to plan,' says Bob Beaty, director of manufacturing and operations at Greenock, 'regardless of actual demand or what the individual customer wanted. We then realised that we had to ship to order.' Companies such as Dell in the US and Vobis in Germany had already begun manufacturing to order. But IBM faced the particular challenge of achieving change in a large-scale manufacturing operation and over such a far-flung distribution network. Greenock began the process with its Valuepoint range of low-priced computers, then moved on during 1993 to the PS/1, PS/2 and Thinkpad notebook ranges. Beaty says the plant can now ship a product within 10 days of receiving an order. The orders come from dealers, country subsidiaries or even individuals. 'The printer churns them out 24 hours a day,' he says. 'We might get an order for 400 Valuepoints all of the same configuration, but they could all be in different permutations. The customer might want his applications software preloaded in the factory.' The plant, he says, can now respond to those demands. 'The complexity of the business is not the manufacturing, it is the logistics. This is more of a logistics machine than a manufacturing plant.' A smooth components flow is essential to the successful running of the Greenock plant, though many high-value items are common to many product lines, reducing the diversity of the stocks needed. Beaty attributes the cost savings to two factors: a higher degree of vertical integration in the plant than many of its rivals; and the fact that it draws many of its inputs from suppliers who are either a few dozen miles away or at least in the UK. About half the mother boards which power the computer are loaded with their tiny components inside the Greenock plant. The rest come from six outside suppliers, four of them in other parts of central Scotland. Some 50 per cent of all monitors are made in the plant, with the rest coming from two local suppliers. Keyboards are made on site. Some assembly and testing of computers is carried out by contract manufacturers nearby. While many European computer makers import about half their components from the Far East, Greenock depends for 40 to 50 per cent of its inputs on businesses based in the UK. It brings in just 15 per cent from the Far East, with the rest coming from Europe and a small amount from the US. 'We can compete against the Far East with UK costs,' says John McClelland, Beaty's superior who has overall responsibility for supplying not only Greenock's market area but also Australia and Japan. 'Having a local supplier base is a pretty valuable resource.' Beaty acknowledges that the change to manufacturing to order has been 'extremely difficult, but we feel much more in touch with what's happening at the customer end. That is vitally important.' Greenock executives say that since the plant switched to manufacturing to order it has cut its inventory by 25 per cent in absolute terms, while output has risen by between 15 and 20 per cent a year. The cost of what IBM calls 'fulfilment' - the processing of orders and the delivery of the product to the customer - has been reduced by two-thirds. McClelland will not give financial details of Greenock's performance, though Jerry York, chief financial officer of IBM, acknowledged recently that its margins on PCs were lower than those of competitors. McClelland says that thanks partly to reductions in production costs the company has been regaining market share in Europe in the past year and a half, and quotes an estimate by industry analysts Dataquest that its share of the worldwide PC market rose to 13.6 per cent in 1993.</p>

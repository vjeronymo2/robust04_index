			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / City buoyed by 20% fall in empty office space: Commercial property vacancy rate drops to 15.5% - Bishopsgate bomb prompts four large moves The amount of empty office space in the City of London fell by nearly a fifth last year, providing further evidence that the property market in the Square Mile is beginning to recover from one of its deepest recessions. Office vacancy rates in the City dropped over the year from a record 19 per cent to 15.5 per cent, says Jones Lang Wootton, the chartered surveyor. The revival in the property market has been underlined by a sudden and largely unexpected upturn in commercial property activity for leading City law firms. Lawyers report more confidence among building owners, with a definite swing in landlords' favour in the market for new buildings. The recovery has not yet produced a return to realistic rents but lawyers say deals on offer to tenants six months ago are no longer available. The recovery reflects a revival in demand from tenants, together with the impact of the IRA bomb in Bishopsgate last April and the withdrawal of poor-quality buildings from the letting market. Take-up of City offices rose by nearly 25 per cent over the year to about 4m sq ft, with banks and professional service firms accounting for more than half of this. Potential and active demand from tenants now stands at 5.2m sq ft, Jones Lang Wootton says. Confidence that the market is set for recovery is tempered by an awareness that some of the factors stimulating last year's reduction in vacancy rates may not be repeated. Four of the City's 10 largest property moves last year resulted from the Bishopsgate bombing. It prompted office moves by solicitors Norton Rose, insurance brokers Willis Caroon, and the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan. In addition National Westminster Bank is to lease the Billingsgate building by the river Thames as a back-up in case of disaster. Savills, the chartered surveyor, says that in total the bomb stimulated the take-up of 600,000 sq ft of space and the withdrawal from the market of 500,000 sq ft of damaged offices. The recovery of the City office market is also constrained by the difficulties that many tenants wanting to move offices encounter in disposing of their existing lease obligations. Many tenants are locked into paying rent at well above market levels and cannot pass their leases on to new tenants. Mr Jeffrey Bailey, a property partner of City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines, says lawyers are convinced that the increase in activity is not a false dawn. He said: 'With interest rates so low, even without rents moving you can get a better return from real estate than from other investments. That's why we are seeing a move into quoted property company shares.' In spite of the damage done over the past four years to confidence in property as a safe investment, institutions in particular are beginning to realise that their investment portfolios are out of balance. The decline in the City office vacancy rate has been most pronounced for modern office stock. Savills reports that supply dropped by 26 cent last year and with a vacancy rate of just 5 per cent agents believe this could result in a shortage of new City offices by 1996. A significant rise in rental values on prime space during the next 12 to 18 months could stimulate a return to speculative development, they believe. Tenants have shown a marked preference for buildings in the core of the City rather than the fringes, where vacancy rates are an estimated 27 per cent. The prospects of letting poor-quality office space in fringe locations is so poor that many buildings have been withdrawn from the market and made uninhabitable in an effort to avoid incurring rates.</p>

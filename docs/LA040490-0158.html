			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> INSIDE TRADER BOESKY FREED AFTER 2 YEARS  </P> <P> Wall Street's Ivan Boesky, who went to prison two years ago for his role in the  biggest insider-trading scandal in U.S. history, was set free today.  </P> <P> Boesky, once one of Wall Street's top speculators who specialized in takeover  stocks, shocked the financial world in 1986 when he agreed to pay $100 million  to settle charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission that he  illegally used confidential company information to make millions of dollars.  </P> <P> He was released at 5 a.m. from a Brooklyn halfway house where he had been  staying since December, a spokesman for the correctional center said.  </P> <P> Boesky was released into home custody from the halfway house eight weeks ago.  But he had been required to call officials there every day and stay two nights  a week at the facility. He also had been visited by the center's staff once a  week at his home and place of employment.  </P> <P> The spokesman declined to say where Boesky was working, but he is reported to  be living in the New York area. Boesky owns a 75-acre estate north of New York.  </P> <P> Boesky, who was sent to prison March 23, 1988, spent most of his term in the  minimum-security Lompoc Federal Prison Camp in California. Last December he was  transferred to the Brooklyn Community Corrections Center.  </P> <P> He is now required to report to a probation officer once a month for the next  six months.  </P> <P> Boesky also pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of filing false information  with the SEC.  </P></p>

Bookmakers will be allowed window displays featuring top bets and television sets showing racing and other sports action.

Present regulations require that windows must be obscured to prevent passers-by catching a glimpse of tele-vised horse-races and bet-ting shows. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, launching a consultative paper yesterday on the relaxation of the restrictions, said: 'The veil over betting shops could soon be lifted. The changes would make betting offices a more visible part of the high street scene and enable bookmakers to provide additional information about their business.' Mr Howard said the intention was to give con-sumers more freedom while ensuring fair and honest betting. He said: 'Care would be taken to ensure that these changes do not result in betting shops becoming general entertainment centres.' The moves, which follow the easing of restrictions on evening opening earlier this year, were welcomed by the industry. Mr Kelvin Stacey, marketing director of Coral, said: 'We have been up-grading our shops for some time and these changes will enable us to move further forward. They would put us on a normal retail footing.' Mr John Brown, managing director of William Hill, said: 'Now we can show betting shops are no longer smoky dens.'</p>

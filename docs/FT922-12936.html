			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / People: Structure demolished at Taylor Woodrow Colin Parsons, who took over the chairmanship of Taylor Woodrow less than a fortnight ago after a surprise boardroom coup, has moved quickly to cut back the proliferation of titles at the top of the loss-making construction giant and introduce some younger faces. He has dismantled the previous structure which included two deputy chairmen and three joint managing directors and replaced it with a three-man senior executive team led by himself. The other two are Tony Palmer, 55, the chief executive, and David Green, 48, finance director, who only joined the group in 1985. Under the reshuffle, Peter Hedges, the 49-year-old head of the Taylor Woodrow Property Company is stripped of his title of deputy chairman and joint managing director, but his powerbase will be increased since he has been given responsibility for the group's flagship St Katherine's Dock development in London, which had previously been the preserve of Peter Drew, the ousted chairman. Walter Hogbin, 54, also loses the title of joint managing director, but retains responsibility for the group's international construction business. Meanwhile, John Topping, 62, the deputy chairman who has played a key role in the development of the group's property interests, will retire from the board after the annual meeting on June 12. Lord Bellwin, 69, who has been a non-executive director for seven years, has resigned with immediate effect. Although Taylor Woodrow has recently recruited Sir Kit McMahon, the former chairman of Midland Bank, the group's team of non-executive directors looks in needs of strengthening. Charles Hambro, the other non-executive director, has sat on the board since 1962.</p>

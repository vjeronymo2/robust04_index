			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The risks of regulating: The governor's supervisory challenge Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank of England director in charge of banking supervision, once said that the Bank was never praised for the fact that most UK banks were run prudently and honestly. However, whenever a bank was in difficulties or found to be corrupt, the Bank was blamed. At the time, Mr Quinn was feeling bruised from the mauling the Bank received from press and politicians for its supervision of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, the corrupt bank that was closed in mid-1991. This mauling almost certainly ruled Mr Quinn out as the possible successor to Mr Eddie George as deputy governor, though as the Bank's senior executive director he would normally have been a leading contender for the post. Mr George has not worked in the supervisory department, and therefore escaped criticism in Lord Justice Bingham's report into the supervision of BCCI, published last October. But he will face pressure as governor to take a view on whether bank supervision should be separated into a new specialist institution outside the Bank. He seems ambivalent on whether such radical reform is necessary. He chose on Friday to stress that the priority is to rebuild morale, which was damaged by the BCCI criticism. Lord Bingham found the Bank had been somewhat unprofessional, haphazard and timid. A picture of an insufficiently rigorous approach was also drawn in the recent report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors into National Westminster Bank's involvement in the Blue Arrow affair. The DTI report was possibly the more revealing of the two, in that it gave a rare description of the Bank's relationship with a leading UK bank, rather than an unusually Byzantine foreign one like BCCI. The report makes no suggestion that the Bank behaved improperly in its relationship with NatWest. But it lends weight to a widely held criticism of the Bank's structure: that its semi-official role as the spokesman and champion of the City makes it reluctant to take stern action against leading institutions, such as NatWest. Whether or not it is appropriate for the Bank to play such a public relations role for the City, this function will be less prominent under Mr George. He is far less comfortable as a salesman than the current governor, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton. As for taking action, the supervisory department has become less timid. It is now more methodical in deciding whether it has the right in particular cases to take punitive action under the 1987 Banking Act against individuals and institutions. A new legal unit within the supervision department - established together with an investigations unit in response to the Bingham report - gives it more reliable guidance on its powers. There has been a second important change. Once the Bank is convinced it has the legal right to take punitive action, it has become less hesitant in doing so. Indeed, there are signs that it is no longer petrified by the prospect that one day the courts will overturn a decision it has made to declare an individual or institution unfit to continue in banking. It has belatedly come to the conclusion that its authority would not be undermined by such a court judgment. These developments probably mean that the case for demerging the supervisory department has become less urgent. On the other hand, the supervision of other financial institutions is being reviewed by Andrew Large, the chairman of the Securities and Investments Board, and it is arguable that for him to ignore the Bank's supervisory role, as he appears to be doing, maintains an artificial distinction between banks and other financial institutions. Nonetheless, the debate on whether to separate supervision from the Bank's main functions will probably be deferred until the evolution of its powers over monetary policy becomes clearer. If the Bank were given independent powers to set interest rates, there might be a conflict with its supervisory responsibilities. This is a view held by the next deputy governor, Mr Rupert Pennant-Rea. The argument, disputed by some Bank executives, is that a central bank's responsibility for ensuring banks' soundness might deter it from raising interest rates to combat inflationary pressures, if it feared that doing so would seriously damage the bank sector. On the other hand, no central bank can afford to be completely divorced from supervision. As the lender of last resort, it needs to be kept abreast of the health of commercial banks. Its monetary policy role also requires it to be confident that the payment system is sound. So if supervision were demerged, the Bank would need to maintain close links with any new supervisory institution. Probably the best argument for demerging was hinted at by Mr Quinn. Given that no supervisor receives public praise for doing the job properly, only blame when things go wrong, the central bank's reputation is always at risk of damage if it retains the supervisory function. If Mr George wants to increase the Bank's standing in monetary affairs both at home and abroad - and that appears to be his main ambition - he stands more chance of success if the Bank does not risk contagion from occasional and inevitable supervisory errors.</p>

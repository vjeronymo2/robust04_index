			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LAWSUITS FILED OVER CRASH OF NAVY F-14 IN EL CAJON  </P> <P> Three civilian helicopter mechanics who were injured in the 1988 crash of a  Navy jet at Gillespie Field in El Cajon have sued the military, alleging that  the crash was caused by negligence.  </P> <P> Although no specific damage amounts were listed in the lawsuits, filed  Wednesday in U.S. District Court, letters attached to the documents suggested  that their cases could be settled for a combined $55.1 million.  </P> <P> Two of the men -- William Grant and Edward Barnes -- were working as helicopter  repairmen at Skydance Helicopters at the time of the Sept. 12, 1988, crash.  Grant's wife, Laurie, is also a plaintiff.  </P> <P> The fourth plaintiff, Michael Taras, was working as a helicopter repairman for  Krauss Helicopters. Taras' suit is separate from the one filed by the Grants  and Barnes.  </P> <P> Both actions allege that the Navy failed to inspect the F-14 Tomcat before the  ill-fated flight and "carelessly" permitted the aircraft's hydraulic system to  be "in a state of disrepair."  </P> <P> The F-14 crashed at Gillespie Field after experiencing total hydraulic failure  while on a training mission. One of the jet's two crewman was killed after  ejecting from the disabled aircraft, the other parachuted to safety. They were  attempting to return the disabled aircraft, which at first had suffered partial  hydraulic failure, to Miramar Naval Air Station.  </P> <P> The Navy had faced several damage claims since the crash, which also destroyed  about 20 aircraft and a half-dozen vehicles on the ground at Gillespie Field.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WASHINGTON SUMMIT;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV IS FACING TOUGH SOVIET CRITICS OF ARMS AGREEMENT;  </P> <P> MISSILES: FOES ARE ASKING WHY MOSCOW WILL GIVE UP MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAN  WASHINGTON.  </P> <P> The negotiations with the United States on reducing the two superpowers'  strategic arsenals have been difficult, but Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev will face an equally tough task selling that agreement at home.  </P> <P> Already, his countrymen are asking why the Soviet Union will give up more  weapons than the United States, why the United States will have more nuclear  warheads than the Soviet Union, and why Moscow dropped its demand that  sea-launched cruise missiles be fully covered by the prospective treaty.  </P> <P> The questions are coming not only from Gorbachev's critics on the right, but  also from some of his supporters. And it appears likely that the agreement  signed Friday by Gorbachev and President Bush will provoke the Soviet Union's  first full-scale foreign policy debate.  </P> <P> "The gap in the numbers makes one stop and think," Alexander Bovin, a political  commentator for the government newspaper Izvestia, said before the two leaders  approved the agreement, which sets out basic principles for a treaty reducing  strategic arms. "Why are we agreeing to have considerably fewer warheads in our  strategic offensive arsenal than the Americans?"  </P> <P> Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister, complained in print last  month that the country's negotiating style seems tilted more toward making  concessions than toward winning compromises from the other side. The collapse  of the Warsaw Pact, he warned, made it too risky to yield much on strategic  arms without offsetting reductions by the United States.  </P> <P> And Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, Gorbachev's own military adviser, a  consultant on the strategic arms negotiations and a member of the Soviet  delegation to the summit talks here, argued publicly in advance of Gorbachev's  trip that the country needs a modernized, more powerful army and must be wary  about reducing its defense capabilities.  </P> <P> "The danger of war has not been eliminated for the Soviet Union -- I am  convinced of this and I speak of it frankly," Akhromeyev wrote in a lengthy  attack on another Gorbachev adviser, Georgy A. Arbatov, director of the U.S.A.  and Canada Institute in Moscow. "The United States continues to act largely as  before in the military sphere. . . ."  </P> <P> With such questions being raised by his own supporters, Gorbachev will find it  difficult to justify making any concessions that are not matched by U.S.  concessions.  </P> <P> "If the United States wants an agreement, and I know it does, then the American  negotiators will have to take into account our public opinion," Vitaly I.  Goldansky, a leading Soviet scientist and an adviser to Gorbachev on arms  control, said of the prospective treaty. "We are used to tailoring agreements  to meet American political needs, but now you must take our needs into  consideration.  </P> <P> "This is really new. In the past, the leader made a deal, and that was it. Now  we have a real diversity in opinion, we have open criticism of the leadership  and its policies and, yes, we have a political opposition that is emerging.  Neither foreign policy nor defense will be exempt from political debate," he  said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's conservative critics have recently focused on foreign policy as an  area of vulnerability.  </P> <P> One foreign policy specialist, writing in the weekly newspaper Literaturnaya  Rossiya in April, said that all of Gorbachev's international achievements had  come by yielding the gains made by the Soviet Union over the past 50 years.  </P> <P> Yegor K. Ligachev, the foremost conservative within the Communist Party  leadership, has publicly questioned Soviet policy in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> "People speak with great alarm about what is happening in Eastern Europe,"  Ligachev said in a television interview two weeks ago. "In particular, many  people say they are very disturbed that there is a dismantling of socialism in  some of those countries."  </P> <P> And the growing public feud between Akhromeyev and Arbatov has brought into the  open the deep cleavage among Gorbachev's own advisers over substituting  political agreements for military readiness and over his concept of "defense  sufficiency" -- that is, ensuring the country's defense against any conceivable  threat but without seeking to compete weapon for weapon with the United States  in a ruinous arms race.  </P> <P> "The debate that we will have over the START treaty will range over all our  foreign policy initiatives under Gorbachev," a member of the Soviet delegation  commented. "But it is impossible to predict the outcome. This is the first such  fundamental debate we will have had, and our legislators are distinguishing  themselves by their independence."  </P> <P> Under Soviet law, treaties must be ratified by the Supreme Soviet, the  country's legislature, but the process will no longer be the mere formality  that it was two years ago when the treaty eliminating intermediate-range  nuclear forces was reviewed and approved in an afternoon.  </P> <P> The three parliamentary committees that will review arms control agreements are  filled with foreign policy specialists, generals, managers of the country's  defense industries and others certain to probe for any weaknesses. Elected in  the nation's first contested parliamentary elections last year, they have  already shown their independence from the government and Communist Party and  openly questioned some of Gorbachev's policies.  </P> <P> Talking with U.S. congressional leaders here Friday, Gorbachev compared the new  role Soviet legislators were playing.  </P> <P> "It is a really a mirror image (of Washington) now," he said. "We have come  here, and before coming here, we had contacts with our Supreme Soviet members,  and we will have contacts with them when we return."  </P> <P> But the framework agreement for the strategic arms treaty, signed by Gorbachev  and President Bush on Friday, already has drawn criticism from both the right  and the left in Moscow.  </P> <P> "The progressives, the radicals are saying that the cuts are not large enough  and certainly do not reach the 50% levels we were promised," Andrei Kortunov,  an arms control specialist at the U.S.A. Institute now in Washington,  commented. "We are not going to get the savings we need from the defense budget  because we will have to rebuild our strategic triad to match that of the U.S.  Their criticism is that we have been trapped into playing the U.S. game once  again.  </P> <P> "From the right, we hear very strong criticism that we are giving up more than  the U.S. is, that we have not held fast on such critical points as the  inclusion of the sea-launched cruise missile where the U.S. enjoys an  advantage, but we have been all too ready to 'split the difference' with the  Americans in ways that weaken us."  </P> <P> The next six months of negotiations, as the final treaty is prepared and the  basis is laid for a second agreement, will be crucial for Gorbachev, according  to Kortunov and other Soviet foreign policy specialists.  </P> <P> "Even as we celebrate this framework agreement, we must remember that a lot of  work still needs to be done to produce a treaty that can be ratified by both  the U.S. Senate and our Supreme Soviet," a member of the Soviet delegation  said. "To produce a treaty that either body would refuse to ratify would be  disastrous for the whole process of arms control and for the overall  relationship."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE SUMMIT  </P> <P>  What kind of arms control agreements would help Gorbachev with his domestic  problems? Can they be sold to the Soviet military and other Soviet  conservatives?  </P> <P> There is a big limit to the help he can get from arms control agreements. What  the Soviet people are focusing on politically is the internal problems. And the  climate has become less favorable for selling arms control to the military.  </P> <P> For both the political and military leadership in the Soviet Union, the changes  in Eastern Europe have led to a desire to put things on hold. What would be  most important to Gorbachev would be for the United States and the West to cut  back their forces unilaterally. That would demonstrate to his rivals that  Gorbachev's policies are being reciprocated.  </P> <P> The strongest thing Gorbachev has going for him at home is that he is an  internationally recognized leader. He is seen as dealing on equal terms with  the President of the United States, and that was not true of his predecessors.  Beyond that, it's not clear that the average Soviet citizen -- the person  standing in line waiting to buy bread -- is likely to pay much attention to the  specifics of an arms control agreement.  </P> <P> But there are certain things it would be imprudent for him to do at this stage.  The military would not have supported the (U.S.-backed) proposal to exclude  medium-range cruise missiles from the agreement. And it would be hard for him  to sell the military on any deal preventing modernization of the remaining  SS-18s (ballistic missiles). If the United States persists in such a course,  that might be very imprudent.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin near to agreement TALKS AIMED at ending the 'dirty tricks' dispute between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic continued throughout yesterday as the final details of an agreement were put in place. Both sides hoped a final deal would be announced yesterday, but it is now expected that a package will be formally signed today. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director and Mr Trevor Abbott, managing director of Virgin Group, yesterday began negotiations at 7am and continued throughout the day. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's head, and Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman, were kept in touch with developments. Last night lawyers were completing the details of an agreement which is expected to include a cash payment of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m to Virgin to compensate the airline for the commercial damage inflicted on it by BA's activities. The delay in concluding a deal has centred on Virgin's demands for a competition code defining legitimate and illegitimate areas of competition between the two airlines. BA is pressing its case for freedom to try to persuade some Virgin passengers to switch to its flights. Virgin is demanding a deal which will set clear ground rules for future relationships.</p>

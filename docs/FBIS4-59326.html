			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, May 12 (AFP) -- Southern forces in  Yemen's civil war shot down three northern warplanes and sank a  warship west of the vital port city of Aden, a southern  commander announced Thursday.    Colonel 'Ali Qasim Talib, the sacked Yemeni navy chief, told  the Aden daily 14 UKTUBAR the northern targets were hit late  Wednesday in the Haraz region, near the strategic Bab el-Mandeb  Straits on the Red Sea.    Earlier the northern forces loyal to President 'Ali  'Abdallah  Salih claimed they had captured a southern mechanised brigade  based at Haraz.    A northern military communique quoted by the official news  agency SABA' said northern forces had captured all the tanks and  artillery of the southern 25th mechanised brigade, and many of  the brigade's 1,200 soldiers had surrendered.

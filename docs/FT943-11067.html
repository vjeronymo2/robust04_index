			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Hard to crack high-tech Tokyo government market Foreign companies trying to sell high technology equipment to the Japanese government can recount many trying experiences, such as the tale of GE Yokogawa Medical, a US-Japanese joint venture company specialising in high-tech medical equipment, Michiyo Nakamoto writes. GE Yokogawa Medical says its biggest problem has been the low prices at which Japanese government institutions must buy medical equipment. Since the budget for procurement is very low, considering the high technology that goes into the machines, it is impossible for a company like GE Yokogawa to make profits on a deal. The company, which spends high sums on research and development to develop its sophisticated medical equipment, complains that the government does not know on what basis the budget is actually determined. GE Yokogawa contends that once the procurement price is set, Japanese companies, which have not spent heavily on R&amp;D, are able to develop equipment that meets the price requirement regardless of the quality of the machines. The company says that deals are often made on the basis of relationships rather than on the merits of the equipment. 'We have been in this market for over 10 years and have finally begun to develop relationships in the sector,' a GE Yokogawa official said. The official said notes a further Another barrier to business was that a wide range of medical equipment, particularly new products that are commonly sold in the US, cannot be imported into Japan simply because the Ministry of Health and Welfare will not accept them as medical equipment: 'They must be keeping them out of the country until Japanese companies develop similar equipment.'</p>

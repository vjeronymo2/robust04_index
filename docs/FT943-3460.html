			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Business and the Environment: Rough waters predicted - Jane Martinson reports on regulations sailing towards the shipping industry Chaos, jumble and madness are words used in the world's shipping industry to describe the effect of environmental regulations. As national governments and maritime organisations decide how to clean up the oceans, much of the industry is unclear about new regulations heading its way. Moreover, it is still disputing the effectiveness of pollution regulations passed four years ago. The US Oil Pollution Act, passed in 1990, was a direct result of the grounding of the Exxon Valdez tanker the previous year. The law stipulates that oil tankers sailing in US waters and built after 1990 have double hulls. It imposes unlimited liability on shipowners showing gross negligence. Double hulls work on the principle that two layers of steel plating and a cushion of air between them will provide more protection against oil spills than one. But the effectiveness of the double-hull construction in preventing major oil spills, which are usually caused by serious collision, is questioned by many environmentalists as well as the industry itself. From next July all ships which are 25 years or older will have to comply with the double hull or similar requirements under regulations adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, a UN-backed body which regulates the world's shipping. New ship building orders have had to comply with the IMO regulations since last year. According to Michael Osborne, manager of the technical services department of Shell International Shipping, double hulls 'can help reduce the pollution from the many minor grounding and collision incidents which usually occur within port limits when the ship is under pilotage and which have contributed to the industry's poor image.' Gerard Peet, Friends of the Earth International's representative at the IMO, expresses qualified support for the design. He argues that while double hulls afford some protection in minor accidents they do not prevent accidents happening in the first place. He says it is unlikely that the design would have prevented any of the major incidents that have had a serious effect on the amount of oil pollution and caused much public alarm. 'I think double-hull designs will improve the situation - no one is arguing that they are worse than single hulls - but they are certainly not the complete answer. The real problem is not the design of tankers but the quality of crews and implementation of international rules.' This view is echoed by the IMO. Roger Kohn, the organisation's information officer, says: 'The emphasis now is not on trying to deal with the consequences of a major spill but in looking at the causes of the problem.' The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, an independent body funded by the industry, says that although spills from major collisions and groundings are responsible for a large percentage of the oil spilt in the world, most spills result from routine operations such as loading and discharging. A number of regulations recently agreed by the IMO aim to improve the management of ships, the training of staff and the checks on implementation. From next July all ships more than five years old will be subjected to a sort of shipping 'service'. Although the details are not yet clear, the checks are likely to look for wear and tear that makes the ship both unsafe and environmentally unsound. A ruling to impose a management code on companies agreed earlier this year will come into force in four years' time. The IMO is also looking at updating training codes. A special implementation group has been set up to encourage participating members to uphold the conventions they have signed. The threat of continuing legislation and poor market conditions appear to have sent the industry reeling. John Joyce, marine manager at the International Chamber of Shipping, the London-based association of ship owners, says: 'With all this regulatory focus on pollution not a word has been said about freight rates and what anybody's going to do about that.' Clarkson Research Studies, a leading broker, found in a survey last month that daily operating costs for a 1970s-built Very Large Crude Carrier are about Dollars 15,000. This compares with a new vessel costing Dollars 85m or more and requiring an average of Dollars 35,000 per day operating costs. In today's market, they do not earn enough to cover interest or depreciation. Orders have suffered: a total of 38 VLCCs were delivered last year. Clarkson estimates that at such low rates the existing fleet of tankers built before 1979 will not be replaced until 2003. Martin Stopford, managing director of Clarkson Research, says: 'The attitude is typically do nothing until doing nothing becomes too Much of a struggle and then order a new ship if you possibly can.' The situation could lead to the 'worst of all possible worlds' with ship owners unable to pay for new ships and uneasy about repairing old ones which, while perhaps solid, may be subject to punitive changes in environmental legislation. 'Ship owners are not making enough money to replace existing ships and aren't repairing them properly either. With punitive legislation hanging over them a lot of owners are also adopting a wait-and-see attitude as they don't know whether they are going to be legislated out of existence.'</p>

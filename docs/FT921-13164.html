			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / World Trade News: A P Moller withdraws Danish oil fields plan POLITICAL interference has caused A P Moller, the shipping, oil and gas group, to withdraw a DKr3bn (Pounds 270m) development plan for three small oil and gas fields in the Danish sector of the North Sea. In a statement yesterday the group said the Ministry for Industry had made conditions which were 'entirely unacceptable'. The group would not spell out why it was dissatisfied, but the dispute is understood to concern the conditions for ownership and access to an 84km pipeline, linking several fields. The pipe was an integral part of the development plan. In 1962, A P Moller received a 50-year exclusive concession to explore for oil and gas in both the Danish offshore and land areas. However, in the early 1980's a left-wing government forced the group to relinquish all but 1 per cent of the area to which the original concession applied. Left-wing parties have now forced the non-socialist minority government to present A P Moller with tough conditions for the new development plan. A P Moller is the operating company for the Danish Underground Consortium, the other members of which are Shell and Texaco. Production from the Danish fields last year reached 7m tonnes, plus production of 3.5bn cubic meters of gas. The development plan would have added about 15,000 barrels a day (about 800,000 tonnes a year) to oil output. The Finnish government yesterday agreed to supply Estonia with up to 100,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil to help ease the acute energy shortage which is threatening to disrupt the heating system in the recently independent country, writes Robert Taylor from Stockholm.</p>

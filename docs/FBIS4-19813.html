			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to Hermann Otto Solms,  chairman of the Free Democratic Party [FDP] Bundestag Group, the  reduction of the military service from 12 to 10 months, which  was proposed by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe (Christian  Democratic Union), is possible. However, before a decision on  the future troop strength is made, the liberals first want a  clear definition of the tasks and the organizational and  equipment structure of the armed forces, Solms said before  journalists in Bonn on Thursday [21 April]. Ruehe, who is  striving for a strength of 340,000 to 320,000 men, still has to  "perform this obligation."    Both the chairman of the FDP Bundestag Group and Michael  Glos, chairman of the Christian Social Union [CSU] Land Group,  criticized that Ruehe had made his planning proposals and  savings projects public, without previous coordination in the  responsible government and party committees. Solms said that  next Tuesday the plans should first be discussed in the  coalition round and then in the Cabinet. Ruehe is to develop a  "proper government bill."    The FDP politician stressed the need for savings in the  Bundeswehr, but he said that one has to stick to the budget  volume of 47.5 billion German marks for the Hardthoehe. General  compulsory military service is not at issue for the liberals.  Glos defended Finance Minister Theo Waigel against the  criticism that he determines the Bundeswehr's future by his  savings. In view of the general financial difficulties,  stricter standards should have been applied to the armed forces,  Glos said on Suedwestfunk. More striking power can also be  achieved with a smaller Bundeswehr that is more mobile and  better equipped.    Hans-Ulrich Klose, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  [SPD] Bundestag Group, supported Ruehe's proposals. The  Bundeswehr's operational capability is currently limited, this  has to be changed. On the ARD ``Morning Magazine,'' Klose  advocated a reduction and differentiation of the military  service. Moreover, the SPD wants a reduction of the armed  forces to 300,000 men, while it is, however, promised that this  figure will be maintained for at least 10 years. The Social  Democrats are also in favor of fixing the current volume of the  defense budget for four years. In addition, Klose said that he  is "passionately" against a professional army. This is also in  line with the SPD decisions.</p>

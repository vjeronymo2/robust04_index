			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Letter: A yearning for people to take responsibility for their mistakes Sir, I am curious as to what now constitutes a resigning matter for a cabinet minister or one of the government's hirelings such as the governor of the Bank of England? Obviously professional ineptitude no longer triggers such action. What are a few thousand bankrupts or a couple of billion pounds of the taxpayers' money squandered when you can brazen out your botching? Sexual fumbling can make our masters look foolish, but will not necessarily lead to their exit. A cynical citizenry now expects dishonesty and lying from the great and far-from-good. Perhaps the only thing which will remove such people, rarely gracefully, is if colleagues find that their continuing presence puts them at risk. I must be getting dangerously old as I long for a little more morality, like telling the truth and taking responsibility for your mistakes, in our national life. Michael D Stephens, 32 Thackeray's Lane, Woodthorpe, Nottingham NG5 4HQ</p>

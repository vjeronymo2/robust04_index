			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WHAT WAS THAT LAST SONG?';  </P> <P> RECORD INDUSTRY, RADIO DEEJAYS AT ODDS OVER SONG IDS  </P> <P> "When you play it, say it!"  </P> <P> That's the current rallying cry in the record industry. And if it's not exactly  "Hell no, we won't go," the cause it represents has drawn battle lines between  the record industry and the radio world.  </P> <P> The issue is "back announcing" -- the practice of telling radio listeners what  songs and performers they have just heard. With uninterrupted and unannounced  sets of music -- called sweeps -- becoming more common on radio, record  companies and retailers have launched an aggressive campaign, including putting  "play it/say it" stickers on records sent to stations and petition drives in  record stores.  </P> <P> "When you work in a record store and someone comes in and starts humming  something and you're supposed to guess what it is, that's frustrating," said  Carl Rosenbaum, president of Flip Side Records, which operates 17 retail  outlets in the Chicago area. In December and January more than 10,000  signatures were collected in Flip Side stores on petitions calling for more  back-announcing of songs. Rosenbaum presented the petitions to the program  director of Chicago station WYTZ-FM, which calls itself Z95.  </P> <P> "That's part of radio's responsibility," said Rosenbaum. "If they're playing  the music, they should be proud enough to say it."  </P> <P> Some radio programmers, though, object to the pressure tactics.  </P> <P> "I don't think that's fair, and I'm not sure it's entirely relevant," said  Steve Rivers, program director of Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM, often a  target of charges that its lengthy "uninterrupted" stretches of music leave the  listener uninformed about the songs.  </P> <P> "This campaign got started maybe because the record industry was having trouble  selling new music," Rivers said. "So they pointed the finger at radio: 'Those  gosh darn 10-in-a-row sweeps!' Well, usually within a sweep most of the songs  are hits, and we think it insults the audience if every time we played a  Madonna song we said it was Madonna. You have to give the audience more credit  than that."  </P> <P> Rivers also said that his listeners prefer the momentum of the sweeps, which he  said would be broken up by song announcements.  </P> <P> But "play it/say it" campaigners say the sweeps are often interrupted by spots  touting the uninterrupted music.  </P> <P> "Wouldn't it be better to say, 'This is Martika, part of 10 in a row on KXXX,'  than just drop in a music bite saying it's 10 in a row?" said Kid Leo, who last  year became vice president of artist development for Columbia Records after 15  years as a deejay and later program director at Cleveland station WMMS-FM.  </P> <P> Said Mike Schaefer, senior editor of Hitmakers magazine, a San Fernando  Valley-based radio trade magazine that has devoted much space recently to the  topic: "Some of the top stations, the key players are the ones not playing by  the rules. . . . In many instances when they talk it's about a station  promotion and they totally ignore the music."  </P> <P> The debate officially started a year ago with a Billboard magazine commentary  by Don Ienner, then executive vice president and general manager of Arista  Records and currently president of Columbia Records. In the piece, Ienner  called the lack of song announcing a music industry "virus."  </P> <P> Since then the issue has snowballed, with the record side claiming radio has  lost touch with its listeners and doesn't respect the music it relies on, while  radio counters that the record industry is looking for free advertising, and  that if it wants more mentions of its product, it should pay for it.  </P> <P> It's been the hot topic at recent industry conventions and in the trade  magazines, and the Recording Industry Assn. of America and the National Assn.  of Record Merchandisers have banded together to declare April "Back-Announcing  Month." During the month, petition drives will be held, and in some instances  record buyers will be asked to call stations to demand song announcements.  </P> <P> As fuel for the campaign, the record industry points to a survey conducted last  year by the Street Pulse Group, a New Milford, Conn.-based market research  firm. The study showed that a large majority of Top 40 radio listeners want  radio to provide more identification of songs and more information about new  artists.  </P> <P> But many radio programmers argue with the results. "We do that kind of research  and to be quite honest, song identification is not quite as high on the  priority list of  </P> <P> listeners as other items," KIIS's Steve Rivers said. "People want a lot of  music, so that's why we do the sweeps."  </P> <P> But Mike Shalett, who directed the Street Pulse survey, rejects Rivers' claims.  </P> <P> "I guess somebody's not telling the truth, and I know our research does," he  said, citing several radio programmers and consultants who have supported his  findings. "Radio is saying 'We do a good job,' but our study showed that  listeners said they don't. Radio's got a misconception that they're satisfying  needs. . . . I challenge any radio programmer who says that in their  quantitative research people do not say they want songs announced more."  </P> <P> Still, no radio programmer surveyed by The Times admitted to doing a  less-than-adequate job of announcing titles, though some said that other  stations fail in that area. But some programmers are looking for ways to  cooperate with the "play it/say it" effort. Brian Kelly, program director of  Chicago's Z95, actually greeted Rosenbaum's petitions with open arms.  </P> <P> "I'm glad they came to us first," he said, claiming that his station already  did better than most at identifying songs. "It was a painless exchange of some  good ideas."  </P> <P> The result of the meeting was that Kelly agreed to emphasize back-announcing of  all new songs for a trial six-month period.  </P> <P> And Garry Wall, program director of San Diego's KKLQ (Q106), has started an  effort to devise innovative ways for record companies, retailers and radio  stations to join in aggressively promoting new music.  </P> <P> "We're each others' golden goose," he said. "Without their product, we wouldn't  have a business. And without the exposure we give they wouldn't have a  business."  </P> <P> Still, Wall suggests that there is only so much radio can do.  </P> <P> "We say our call letters every doggone time we can, and still there are people  who don't even know what station they're listening to," he said.  </P> <P> Concurred KIIS's Rivers: "Radio by the nature of it is a passive pastime.  People listen to it and even if they really love the station they're not going  to pay attention to it the way (industry insiders) do. They probably hear the  name of songs announced and still can't remember."  </P> <P> Still, campaigners believe that public demands will be impossible for radio to  ignore.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you what I think is going to happen," said Shalett. "Radio stations  like to place themselves as being better than the competition. Someone's going  to position themselves as 'the station that tells you what it plays.' That will  be the hip thing for stations to say."  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / FT Satellite Monitor: Fall in sales of TV dishes SALES of satellite dishes were significantly down last month compared with October last year and there is little sign that the Christmas selling period has taken off. The FT satellite monitor survey for last month found that 71,000 dishes had been installed compared with 61,000 in September. In October last year more than 100,000 dishes were sold or rented followed by a similar number in November. There has been a shortage of dishes from both Amstrad and Pace over the last few weeks but this has now been eased. A Pounds 5m winter advertising campaign has been launched. November's sales figure should show whether the slowdown has been caused by dish shortages or by a dampening of demand. Over the past three years satellite television has grown at an average rate of 900,000 homes a year and the new satellite television channels are now available in 3.08m homes. There has been a modest increase in demand, according to the monitor, which is carried out for the Financial Times by Continental Research. Those saying they will definitely or probably install satellite television rose from 1.58m in September to 1.96m last month. Over the three months from July television viewing figures for satellite homes show satellite television increasing its share of the audience from 29 per cent to 31 per cent. Pearson, the publishers of the Financial Times, has a significant stake in British Sky Broadcasting, the largest satellite TV operator.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / European Elections: Bad turnout in Britain This has been an exciting and unexpected night, David Butler writes. Britain stays at the the bottom of the turnout league - though the 33 per cent participation, a repeat of 1989, was matched this time by the Netherlands. If the Liberal Democrats now appear a regional party confined to the south-west, the Conservatives are now a party of the non-London south. Eight recounts make a record - there have never been anything like so many in a Euro election. The Conservative wipe-out suggested by the Eastleigh by-election result has not materialised, but with 27 per cent of the vote the Tories have polled 8 per cent below their previous lowest national vote this century. They have lost to Labour every seat that they could have lost to them - and for Labour to take Suffolk and push the Conservatives to a recount in Sussex South and Crawley is beyond any expectation. The Tories' comfort lies in the failure of the Liberal Democrats to break through. Victories in the Cotswolds, in Oxfordshire and Wiltshire must delight them. The Conservatives have been lucky in several marginal seats but it is still startling that with 27 per cent of the vote they are expected to get only 18 of the 87 UK seats. The electoral system, which has been so kind at Westminster, has turned against them with a vengeance. Labour has eliminated every Conservative north of a line from Colchester to the Severn (except for North Yorkshire). The swing nationally was about 14 per cent, but in the London area it was 16 per cent. David Butler is a fellow of Nuffield College, Oxford.</p>

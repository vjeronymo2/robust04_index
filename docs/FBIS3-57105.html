It Will Not be Very Simple  for Yeltsin and Kozyrev To Continue Their Course"]    [Text] The Russian Federation foreign minister does not  tire of reiterating that Russia's foreign policy is that of the  president. This postulate, however, does not appear all that  self- evident now that Duma committees have been formed. At  least four of them -- on international affairs, CIS affairs, and  geopolitical questions -- may, and more probable than not, will,  insist on at least having their opinion be considered. The  latter committee will go the longest way of all. At least  because its head and one of his deputies -- Viktor Ustinov and  Mikhail Sidorov -- are representatives of the Liberal Democratic  Party of Russia, and this party, perhaps, did not indicate any  agreement on a single question with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev foreign  political course. It is maintained that the very creation of  the committee on geopolitical questions is a payback to the  Liberal Democratic Party for the foreign affairs committee  chaired by Vladimir Lukin, former Russian Federation ambassador  to the United States. But he too has a Liberal Democratic  "shadow foreign minister" for his deputy, Aleksey Mitrofanov.    Lukin, however, is known for his strained relations with  Kozyrev which may undoubtedly negatively rub off on the  committee's reactions to the actions of the minister who, as  Kozyrev himself maintains, is strictly following the president's  policy. But Russian parliaments traditionally do not do what  the president says and the Duma has no special grounds to alter  the ingrained habit.    The committee for security is led by Viktor Ilyukhin, a  Communist prosecutor, who was going to take Mikhail Gorbachev to  court, hence one should not expect any special cooperation. All  the more so because the committee chairman will, one would  think, find support from one of his deputies, Nina Krivelskaya,  representing this same Liberal Democratic Party of Russia.    There are no representatives of the Russian Federation  Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia among  the leaders of the fourth committee, for CIS affairs. But they  are undoubtedly to be found among its members. Indeed,  relations with the "near abroad" are of real interest for these  parties, and their view on these relations once again diverge  from those of Yeltsin and Kozyrev.    Thus, all the prerequisites are there for a more clearly  defined standoff between the Duma and the president, and his  foreign minister, in virtually all areas of foreign policy. The  parliamentary committee will surely approach geopolitical  questions from neo-imperial positions, something that its  chairman's deputies, Yuliy Gusman of Russia's Choice and Aleksey  Piskunov of New Regional Policy, would hardly countervail.    One does not have to explain the way the Communists see  Russia's security, and this approach means opposing all  disarmament processes and initiatives. One should also remember  that Ilyukhin was going to take Gorbachev to court for the  disintegration of the USSR; consequently he has a corresponding  attitude to the CIS and Russia's partners that augurs nothing  good. It may hamper all efforts by Zatulin's committee.    Kozyrev has always been accused of pro-Americanism. The same  can easily be ascribed to Lukin for his ambassadorial past.  Demagogues have never passed up such a chance, and I do not  have to remind you whose ranks are chock full of them.  Apparently, no foreign policy question is going to be perused  solely by one certain committee. Each committee will try to have  its say on a matter, which would spark differences between them.  It would be sensible for Yeltsin and Kozyrev to play on these  differences if only they pay attention to the voice of  parliament at all. There is a third option -- to adjust the  Russian foreign policy course taking into account  parliamentarians' opinions. But then it may radically alter the  course itself. That would have very serious consequences both  for Russia and the world.</p>

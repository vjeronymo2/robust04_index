			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal officials still do not know who injected cyanide into two grapes from  Chile, although the origin of the crop has been identified, the head of the  Food and Drug Administration said. Commissioner Frank E. Young told reporters  on NBC's "Meet the Press" that the FDA's public warning and decision to  withhold Chilean fruit from U.S. markets on March 13 was justified because the  agency had received two threats about cyanide-laced fruit.  </P></p>

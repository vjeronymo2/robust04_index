			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Universities want watchdog for standards University vice-chancellors are calling for a national body to ensure that standards of teaching and learning are maintained. A discussion document prepared for this week's annual conference of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals says that 'evidence that staff may be adjusting degree standards to what students can achieve in three years during which much of their time is in part-time paid work,' suggests that UK universities have 'already started on the downward slope'. It adds that the current system, which funds research and teaching separately, 'unless radically altered, will lead to a gross deterioration in the quality of the work of universities'. The report follows criticism of degree classification standards by the Higher Education Quality Council, the universities' self-regulating body. It found that standards varied between universities and between faculties. Its findings demonstrated little consistency and much variation in the methods used across universities for classifying degrees. They also showed that universities 'overwhelmingly relied upon individual departments to draw up assessment and classification schemes without developing or adopting common marking bands across faculties'. The quality council raised 'serious concerns' about the adequacy of library services due 'in the main to the great increases in student numbers'. Student numbers have doubled as a proportion of the 18-year-old population in the last five years. In spite of this expansion the proportion of students gaining first-class honours has increased by 50 per cent. In a report prepared by Professor Lewis Elton, of the University of Surrey, vice-chancellors say the creation of a national teaching and learning board is 'essential'. Professor Elton says: 'The alternative is that in 20 years our universities will resemble the worst of what we see, in say, Germany today - vastly overcrowded lecture halls, no individual attention until a student's third or fourth year, horrendous drop-out rates, a constant lengthening of course completion, and a discouraged and despondent staff.'

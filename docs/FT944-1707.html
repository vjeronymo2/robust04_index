			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Tougher rules for pensions How much more secure will members of the UK's occupational pension schemes be if the Pensions Bill, published last Friday, is enacted as proposed? That is the test, given the bill's origins in the report of the Goode Committee, which was set up in the immediate aftermath of the Maxwell pension scheme outrages. Many of the Goode recommendations have been adopted. For instance, active scheme members will be entitled to appoint a third of the trustees; an Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority, albeit of a rather passive kind, will be set up; and a new Pensions Compensation Board will be able to levy other schemes and compensate victims when a scheme fails to meet its liabilities due to misappropriation of assets and the bankruptcy of the employer. But the minimum solvency requirement that formed an important part of the Goode proposals has been significantly watered down. Under pressure from companies, the valuation basis has been altered to permit a greater emphasis on the assumed higher returns on equities rather than government bonds, and more time will be allowed for schemes to correct solvency crises. Moreover there is no sign yet that the government will issue the special indexed securities which the Goode Committee requested should be made available to schemes winding up, so that they could economically secure their future pensions liabilities. Highlighted The problems were highlighted by the receivership of shipbuilder Swan Hunter. Although this Pounds 60m scheme was regarded as solvent by its actuaries, and was sufficiently well-funded to have complied with the proposed minimum solvency requirement, the trustees announced in September that not all the pension benefits could be met, with some being reduced by as much as 40 per cent. Essentially this kind of problem arises because smaller schemes cannot be run economically as closed funds when the employer goes bankrupt, or for other reasons decides not to continue the scheme. The assumed high long-term investment returns are replaced by much lower interest rates when liabilities are transferred to life assurance companies. Some in the actuarial profession are worried that a so-called minimum solvency test will prove seriously misleading, and will imply a degree of security for future pension rights that in reality does not exist. It is also worth pointing out that Mirror Group pensioners would not have benefited from a compensation scheme of the type planned, because their employer continued to trade. Serious deficiency Other Maxwell companies did fail, of course, and their pensioners would have been able to claim. Fraud is not always as clear-cut as in the Maxwell example, however. Many cases of serious deficiency arise because of imprudent investment or a desire by the trustees to help the sponsoring company through a crisis by deferring contributions or even by buying assets such as property. The presence of member trustees with jobs at stake will not necessarily reduce these risks. The question is whether the other measures, such as the imposition of a duty on auditors and actuaries to inform the regulator about apparent irregularities, will make an important difference. Certainly there are powerful threats of fines or imprisonment when trustees breach rules. In many cases these provisions seem likely to be effective. No one can rule out the possibility of rogues misappropriating pension scheme assets in future, especially among smaller companies, but at least a safety net will exist for these serious abuses. The bigger problem may well be whether the reasonable expectations of scheme members will be met when the sponsoring companies get into trouble. To insist on complete security would be to impose much higher funding costs on all companies with final salary-linked schemes, for the sake of the small proportion of future problem cases. But should not scheme members be made aware that they are carrying a residual risk? The Pensions Bill represents a clear improvement over what has applied before. But there is a danger that it will generate an expectations gap that will haunt politicians in the future.</p>

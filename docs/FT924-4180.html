			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Flotation of Chinese property group subscribed 230 times HONG Kong's enthusiasm for Chinese flotations has not seemingly been effected by this week's share price plunge. The public offer of shares in Guangzhou Investments, a mainland-owned property company, was provisionally subscribed around 230 times when the offer closed yesterday. The colony's Hang Seng Index has shed 575 points, or 9.6 per cent, in just three days of trading, yet small investors showed sufficient confidence in corporate China to put forward in the region of HKDollars 100bn (USDollars 12.9bn) for a Dollars HK446m issue. Guangzhou Investment is wholly-owned by the Guangzhou (Canton) Municipal Government and is involved in sizeable property developments in both Hong Kong and China. Armed with immaculate connections across the border, investors are assuming the company will be able to cash in on booming property prices in southern China, while remaining sufficiently insulated from the current political uncertainty in Hong Kong. The most recent mainland new issue in Hong Kong, China Travel Service, was 411 times subscribed in early November. Despite the subsequent stock market performance, it closed yesterday at a 127.5 per cent premium to its issue price, providing some justification for the response to Guangzhou Investment. The property company is offering 425m shares at Dollars 1.05 and has the backing of Mr Li Ka-shing's Cheung Kong Holdings, which is taking a 7.5 per cent stake, thereby building up contacts with a potentially useful source of property projects. The offer period for another major Hong Kong flotation opens today but analysts are less confident over the outcome. National Mutual Asia is the largest public offer since June 1990, but despite the uncertain market climate the underwriters decided to go ahead with the issue. In May 1989, the colony's largest rights issue by Hopewell Holdings was withdrawn as stock market confidence shattered in the midst of the student demonstrations in Beijing. Merchant bankers had considered it possible the National Mutual flotation would receive a similar response.</p>

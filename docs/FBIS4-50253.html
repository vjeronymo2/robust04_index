			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Chen Dawei (7115 1129 4850): </F> "Clinton Faced With Decision on Problem of China's  Most-Favored-Nation Status"]    [Text] New York, 15 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)-- U.S.  President Clinton is facing an important economic and diplomatic  decision.    He must decide before 3 June whether or not to extend  China's  most-favored-nation [MFN] trading status, which, as the date  nears, is becoming a hot issue in the media here.    Calls for the revocation of China's MFN status this year are  more subdued than a few years ago. An increasing number of  people of perception are voicing their support for the  continuance of China's MFN status and favor delinking the MFN  issue from the so- called human rights issue in order to solve  this "thorny issue," which troubles the U.S. Government every  year, once and for all.    Businessmen and industrialists, the people who are most  realistic, are asking the Clinton administration to take  China--the world's biggest market--seriously and face up to the  fact that China's economy is developing rapidly. They believe  that, in the interests of the enormous U.S. commercial stake in  China, the Clinton administration should continue to grant China  MFN status.    It is understood that close to 1,000 U.S. companies have  written to President Clinton urging him to extend China's MFN  status. John (Hayden), vice president of the Boeing  Corporation, which sold 47 Boeing airplanes to China last year,  said that the effort to keep the rapidly developing Chinese  market open to the United States is most important to ensure the  U.S.' leading position in international commercial aviation and  other sectors.    Many American businessmen went further in pointing out that  if the U.S. Government made a wrong decision on the issue of  extending China's MFN status, Sino-U.S. relations would  seriously deteriorate [yan zhong dao tui 0917 6850 0227 6622],  and the United States would pay dearly for this. Many  well-known business executives have also raised doubts about the  whole entanglement of the so-called China human rights issue.  (Gerlinberger), chairman of the board of directors of the  American International Insurance Corporation, said that pinning  the entire foreign policy on one issue, the human rights issue,  was neither reasonable nor sensible.    Many in the U.S. Congress have sobered up to reality.  Hatfield, a Republican senator from Oregon, pointed out in an  earlier report that American consumers would pay $10 billion  more each year and some important U.S. firms would see their  interests damaged if China's MFN status was revoked. Lee  Hamilton, chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs,  also said a few days ago that China's MFN status should be  extended.    At present, there are indeed some people inside and outside  Congress who stubbornly persist in linking MFN status with the  so- called human rights issue. It has been suggested that  before China can satisfy the terms set in the presidential  executive order signed by Clinton last year, the United States  should, while extending China's MFN status, apply selective  trade sanctions on China, that is, restricting imports from  state-owned enterprises by withholding trade privileges from  them. However, the media generally think this simply will not  work.    Reports in the media here say that the White House is  working  furiously to get President Clinton out of this "self-inflicted  trap." People hope that this President, like the late former  President Nixon, can focus on overall U.S. interests and the  long- term strategic interests between the United States and  China and make a wise decision on the issue of China's MFN trade  status.</p>

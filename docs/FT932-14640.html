			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE release of worse than expected inflation figures led to a retreat in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. The tentative start in trading of the June contract on the FT-SE 100 at 2,853 was the first indication that a poor session lay ahead. Sporadic buying in the first hour however saw it climb to 2,860 but this soon ran out of steam leaving the contract to drift lower. The release of disappointing inflation figures at 11.30am led to active selling which sent June falling to 2,835. By 3pm it had fallen to the days low of 2,819. However this proved a spur for bargain hunters and it bounced to finish at 2,832, a fall of 57 on its previous close and at a four-point discount to its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 11. Volume improved to 7,434 lots. Expiry of the April stock options was the main feature in the traded options which saw total volume of 25,178 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was 10,223. United Biscuits was the busiest stock option.</p>

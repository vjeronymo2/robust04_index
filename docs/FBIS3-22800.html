			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christian Sturm and Thomas Scheuer: "Flying </F> Dealers"]    [Text] The mystery surrounding the obscure Cessna crash  into Lake Constance continues. The police intend to continue  the search for the dead bodies of the five missing passengers  presumed to be at the bottom of Lake Constance. The  investigators rule out that survivors might have been able to  save themselves from the ice-cold water. Radar recordings do  not give any information about a secret stopover between Prague  and Lake Constance.    The business deals of the passengers also continue to remain  mainly in the dark. According to research by FOCUS, one thing,  however, seems to be the clear: Berlin businessmen Josef  Rimmele, 54, and Klaus Eichler, 53, along with their two Czech  companions, intended to fly to Beijing two days later.    In their appointment book a note was found of a planned  meeting with three-star General Jin Kang Wang from the PRC  Foreign Ministry. The two men from Berlin had been planning a  dubious deal with him for months: The Chinese general wanted to  get rid of 6 kg of the extremely rare metal Osmium 187 and 365  kg of the controversial phantom substance Red Mercury -- at the  steep price of $493 million. The following route had been  requested for the trip to Beijing and already approved by the  Russian and Chinese authorities: Prague, Moscow, Novosibirsk,  Ulaanbaatar, Beijing.    Embarrassing for Bonn: Only five weeks before the disaster  at Lake Constance, the trade delegate of the FRG Embassy in  Beijing had sent a diplomatic note to the Chinese Foreign  Ministry requesting flight and landing rights for an earlier  flight of the dubious black marketeers.    Josef Rimmele, against whom Berlin judicial authorities  issued an arrest warrant on the grounds of fraud, played false.  He intended to carry out the adventurous million-dollar deal  via his letter-box firm "Housebuilders-Service-Establishment" in  Vaduz, Liechtenstein. Yet the company was deleted from the trade  registered there as early as November 1993. The two  Liechtenstein trustees withdrew from their mandate because  Rimmele wanted to establish "dubious business constructions," as  legal agent Hans Gassner confirmed for FOCUS.    The head of an officially recognized test laboratory in  Saxony had already been hired for the trip to Beijing. He would  have analyzed the exotic metals.    It remains unclear what Rimmele wanted to do with that  stuff.  In the view of expert Tomas Tamberg of the Federal Institute  for Material Research (BAM) in Berlin, such transactions do not  make any commercial sense. The demand for the valuable Osmium  187 for scientific and research projects was "in the area of  fractions of milligrams." As far as the legendary Red Mercury,  a harmless mercury compound, is concerned, Tamberg does not see  any use at all. The alleged demand in the armament industry is  regarded by the BAM scientist as "absolute and total nonsense."    A Berlin state prosecutor suspects completely different  motives behind such activities as those of Rimmele. Pure money  laundering may be behind such fictitious transactions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov April 4 TASS -- Russia delivers almost twice as  much natural gas to Ukraine than planned, according to the  concern Ukrgazprom's dispatcher service. The Russian deliveries  since March ten include a 80 per cent compensation for the  terminated supplies of the Turkmen natural gas. Turkmenistan  suspended deliveries of natural gas to Ukraine until the latter  repays its debt.    According to Ukrgazprom, Russia is keeping its word. On  April 10, negotiations between Russia and Ukraine will continue  to specify the schedule of mutual payments. The leadership of  the Russian giant gas supplier Gasprom had set specific terms  which have not been disclosed to the public. But ITAR-TASS has  learned that the Cabinet of Ministers in Kiev is now considering  the possibility of meeting the demands of the chief supplier of  natural gas.    Although Ukraine receives enough gas to meet its needs at  present, Ukrgasprom reports that the consumption of natural gas  in the republic has dwindled. This is due not only to the  coming of warm spring but also to the measures taken by the  government to save energy resources.    Nonetheless, the temporary stabilisation of gas deliveries  is  not durable. The main reason is the lack of money to pay for  the already consumed energy resources, and the huge internal  debt owed by Ukrainian consumers to the domestic suppliers.</p>

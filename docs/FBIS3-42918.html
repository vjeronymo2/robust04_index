Shcherbakov:  "What Caused the Changes in the Oblast Administration?: Some  Details"]    [Text] The changes in the oblast administration have not  passed unnoticed by the readers of this newspaper. They are  interested in what caused these changes and why the names of  A.D. Belishko and L.I. Ratnikova are not on the list of the  administration's deputy heads. We asked B.N. Mityurev, press  secretary of the oblast administrative head, for an explanation  of these matters.    [Mityurev] The preamble of the decree involved here  unambiguously emphasizes the motives for reforming the structure  of the executive branch. These comprise the new sociopolitical  circumstances which have now evolved in our oblast, as well as  an analysis of the two years of work done by the administration  under the conditions of emerging market-type relations. The need  to make further progress along the path of economic changes also  impelled Vadim Solovyev to adopt this decree.    We can hardly recognize it as a normal situation when the  apparatus of an oblast administration contains 11 deputies,  including three first deputies. At present seven deputies  remain, and their powers of office have been greatly expanded.    The following three names are no longer on the list of  deputies: A.D. Belishko, L.I. Ratnikova, and V.V. Gorodnichiy,  the administrator of affairs. Their positions have been  abolished. But that does not mean that these persons have been  dismissed from work. A.D. Belishko was offered the post of  heading up our delegation in the association of republics and  oblasts in the Ural Region with the retention of his salary and  transportation expenses.    L.I. Ratnikova was offered the post of heading up the  committee on science. This is the kind of work that she knows  very well. A no less important post within the new structures  was likewise offered to V.V. Gorodnichiy.    To be sure, Andrey Dmitriyevich Belishko refused to accept  the new appointment indicated above.    [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, was not his failure to be  appointed a deputy head caused by some kinds of personal  relations with the administrative head, or some kinds of  business-type qualities?    [Mityurev] Unfortunately, it must be stated that this was  noticeable recently; some kind of tension and alienation could  be observed in the relations between V.P. Solovyev and A.D.  Belishko. Frankly speaking, I do not know what lay behind this.  But it came to the surface in various obvious ways and details  of behavior.    [Shcherbakov] Was not the administrative head's decision  with  regard to L.I. Ratnikova influenced by the criminal events  within the Committee on Medicine under the Chelyabinsk City  Administration? The office of the city procurator uncovered  instances of large-scale misappropriations and even thefts in  this structural sibdivision. And, of course, Lyudmila Ivanovna  Ratnikova was--as we know--in charge of this oblast's medical  establishment. What is your opinion on this matter?    [Mityuyev] I think that this could have influenced V.P.  Solovyev's decision. But--in principle--he did not state any  lack of confidence in her, and he offered an important post to  her. In the final analysis, my opinion is as follows: An  administrative head has the right to improve the administrative  structure, as well as the right to decide with whom he is to  work.    [Shcherbakov] Boris Nikolayevich, as far as I understand it,  the new structure does not contain the position of first deputy  head at all. But what if the head goes on leave or on a business  trip--to whom would the reins of government be handed over?    [Mityurev] To be sure, the position of first deputy is not  provided for in the new structure. When and if Vadim Solovyev  goes on leave, he can leave any of his deputies "in charge."  That is the way it has been in practice. And I fail to see any  problem in that regard.    I want to emphasize the following point again as  specifically  as possible: There was nothing overly hasty in Vadim Solovyev's  decision to abolish the post of first deputy. This decision was  adopted based on an analysis of the entire system of mutual  relations which had evolved over the last two and a half plus  years.    [Shcherbakov] How will this reorganization affect  committees,  sections, and administrations?    [Mityurev] Reorganization of the apparatus has been going on  for a long time. The staff was recently cut by one-third. This  is a normal process, brought about by life itself. And we need  not see in this some sorts of problems. The reorganization and  efficiency improvement of the administrative apparatus will  continue.</p>

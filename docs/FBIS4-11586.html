			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Glenda Moreno; from the "This Very Day" newscast] </F>   [Text] The apparent confrontation between the civilian and  military sector, generated by the proposal to have a volunteer  educational, social, humanistic, and democratic military service  by President Reina, and the dissenting remarks by Defense  Minister Reinaldo Andino Flores, monopolized the news conference  the president held today.    [Begin Reina recording] Every person interprets the matter  based on this opinion. What does he mean? That he abides by  it. He has a different opinion because he does not think the  volunteer service can meet the needs. Some tried to say he was  defying this decision. I feel this is not a proper  interpretation. [end recording]    Throughout the news conference, Reina denied there was any  insubordination on the part of Gen. Andino Flores.    [Begin recording] [Reina] Absolutely. How can that be  insubordination, when he obeys the orders of his boss?    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Reina] The president is the chief of the Honduran Armed  Forces. [end recording]    What is important, the president said, is that the Executive  Branch's bill was submitted today to the National Congress. The  Legislative Branch will have to decide, he said, whether or not  we are wrong.    [Begin Reina recording] I am not afraid of being wrong,  because this goes to the National Congress, and it will debate  it. One supposes that all the people are there. If the  Congress rejects it, I will openly admit I was wrong. [end  recording]    Although the topic of the volunteer, education, social,  humanistic, and democratic military service monopolized the  attention of the media, President Reina commented on other  topics, such as the energy crisis.    [Begin Reina recording] Let me tell you that yesterday I  spoke with the Mexican president. He offered us all his help,  and if this works out we will overcome the crisis in a few days.  He is offering two plants that generate 30 megawatts each. We  will overcome the problem with those 60 megawatts. [end  recording]</p>

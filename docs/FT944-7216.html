			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: JM upbeat after jump to Pounds 45m - Strong performance expected to continue in second half Johnson Matthey, the precious metals technology group, yesterday reported a record first-half performance and said there was every chance that this would continue in the second half. Pre-tax profits increased 28 per cent from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 45.2m, well ahead of analysts' forecasts. However, the share price fell by 7p to 550p because of market concerns about JM's intentions following its recently aborted merger talks with Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group. Mr David Davies, JM chairman, described the negotiations as 'a worthwhile exercise', but 'we were two successful companies looking into the future, so it was not surprising we had differing views about what our values are.' JM was now seeking selective acquisitions and looking at eight or nine potential purchases in the electronics field, mainly in North America. The first should be completed before the end of 1994. Mr Davies said that JM's determination to reduce costs was bearing fruit. Net revenues from continuing operations in the six months to September 30 rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 201.5m. To underline its confidence JM is lifting the interim dividend by 24 per cent to 4.2p (3.4p) on earnings per share of 16p (14.6p). On a divisional basis, operating profit rose 36 per cent to Pounds 18.3m in materials technology; catalytic systems increased 20 per cent to Pounds 15.9m; precious metals' input was up by 7 per cent to 10.8m; and profit in colour and print (now merged into Cookson Matthey Ceramics) advanced by 25 per cent to Pounds 6.4m. COMMENT It must have been frustrating for Mr Davies to have reported record interim results, promised a similar performance in the second half and then seen Johnson Matthey's share price fall. But he must take some of the blame. First came his comments in his annual statement last year about wanting JM to become a FT-SE 100 stock and then there were the recent Cookson capers. So the market is understandably nervous about the possibility of a big acquisition that would require a substantial issue of new equity. Mr Davies was telling analysts yesterday that there would not be a hostile bid from either side while the present JM and Cookson management teams were in place. He indicated that JM would return to its old style - getting bigger via friendly acquisitions and organic growth. But it will take time for the market to regain confidence. That aside, there is no doubting JM's potential. The group will probably earn at least Pounds 90m before tax for the full year and last night's share price represented 16 times earnings.</p>

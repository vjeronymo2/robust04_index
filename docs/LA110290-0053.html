The Rebels held  Western to 32 yards rushing in nine carries and 71 yards passing in the first  half. Gilbert Brito was intercepted three times in the first half, twice by  Hien Nguyen.  </P> <P> Brito scored Western's only touchdown on a nine-yard run in the final 1:46 of  the second quarter.  </P> <P> At the start of the third quarter, Western returned the kick to the Savanna 46,  then Brito ran the ball to the Savanna 12 on first down. Shane Foss fumbled the  ball at the three on the next play and Savanna's Marty Garcia recovered the  ball at the 10 to stop the drive. BOB BORSUM  </P></p>

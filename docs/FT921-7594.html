			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Appointments: Switches at Telemetrix Arthur Walsh, the 65-year-old chairman of Telemetrix who took over last December, is reshuffling his board to create a 'young and enthusiastic team' to take the information systems and electronics group through the next decade and beyond. He has picked Tim Curtis, main board director of Unitech, old Etonian, Cambridge graduate and Harvard MBA as his new chief executive. Curtis is 49 and replaces Roy Cotterill, nearly 56, and credited with being the main architect of the company's recovery since 1989. Cotterill stays on as an executive member of the board. With the need for both acquisitions and disposals in the near future very much in his mind, Walsh is also bringing in on to the board a former colleague from STC, the telecommunications group. Kenneth Gardener, recently vice president, mergers and acquisitions at Northern Telecom Europe, previously worked for Walsh at STC, and impressed him with his negotiating skills, notably in the divestment of 80 per cent of ICL to Fujitsu. Cyril Newnham, who has been on the board of Telemetrix for nearly two years and is chairman of the US subsidiary GTI, is resigning to pursue his own business interests in the UK. ***** Charles Wilson, formerly chief solicitor at Abbey National, is appointed group secretary of NATIONWIDE Building Society. ***** MV Sreedhar Menon and Jill Considine have been appointed to the board of AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK. ***** Mark Mazzonelli is moving from Merrill Lynch, together with two colleagues - Ismail Dadhaboy and Simon Tims - to become director and head of the repo finance desk of SWISS BANK CORPORATION. ***** Ken Humphries, formerly a deputy md of UBS Phillips and Drew, has been appointed a director of KLEINWORT BENSON and will be responsible for the sales and trading of sterling corporate debt. ***** John Miller, currently director of operations with Hutchison Microtel, is appointed information systems director of LEEDS PERMANENT Building Society; he will succeed Peter Lumb who retires in July. ***** William Lucas, md if Waverley Asset Management, is appointed a director of WESTRALIAN RESOURCE PROJECTS. ***** Noreen Doyle, currently md European structured sales at Bankers Trust in London, has been appointed head of syndications in the merchant banking vice-presidency of the EUROPEAN BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT. ***** Douglas Gordon is head of SCHRODER SECURITIES' UK equity team.</p>

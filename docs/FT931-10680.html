			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Classic FM finds a niche - Radio I STARTED my week with Good Morning, Sunday on Radio 2, to hear Lord Soper on his 90th birthday. He sounded much as he did when I used to hear him in Hyde Park in his fifties. The questions there had changed, he said - sex more often than politics, working-class ideas moving up into the middle class. His choice of records veered from a Greek Orthodox chorus to 'Love divine, all loves excelling', by way of Fats Waller. Bless him. The first quarterly summary issued by Radio Joint Audience Research contains some healthy news for Classic FM that is rather depressing for Radio 3. Classic FM is credited with 2.8 per cent of total listening time; the figure for Radio 3 is 1.3 per cent (the same, incidentally, as Radio 5). Four-and-a-quarter million adult listeners (over 15 for this calculation) hear Classic FM for at least five minutes in an average week; only 2 1/2 m follow Radio 3. I said when Classic FM first began that it was a more likely rival to Radio 1 than Radio 3. Though the figures suggest otherwise, I suspect that it is not such a rival to Radio 3 at all. Hearing a concert or an opera on Radio 3 is like spending an evening at the Albert Hall or Covent Garden, planned in advance at the sacrifice of other things. Classic FM provides pleasant sounds for one's occasional leisure. The early accusation that it never gave more than single movements of long works is certainly false; the first complete work I heard on Classic FM was a Bruckner symphony, and they don't come much longer than that. Radio 3's rather lighter presentation under its new Controller would be a misjudgment if meant to answer the prospect of Classic FM. A usual slap at Classic FM has been its careless announcing, and the lounge-bar sounds beginning to replace Reithian perfection on Radio 3 are no disguise of any implicit superiority. However, Classic FM would never have broadcast The Man with Night Sweats, on Radio 3 last Monday to Thursday. This was a series of readings by Thom Gunn of his poems lamenting the deaths of friends dead from AIDS. He feels the loss of his companions but, rather than blaming for a moment the behaviour that led to their sickness, seems rather to admire their courage in staying with a pattern they know to be dangerous. 'I love their daring,' he says of two young men in a San Francisco bar tempting him with a needle. I found the poems, written mostly in iambic pentameters, unexpectedly moving. I hardly found Radio 3's weekly play moving at all. Peter Tegel's Return to Krnov told of Anton, an exile from Czechoslovakia who, after most of a lifetime in Britain, returns to visit his unknown family and see his father's grave. There was little in the way of plot; Anton (Hugh Dickson) might as well have been on a weekend visit for all he told us about Czechoslovakia in the 1980s. Richard Wortley was the director. On the other hand, Radio 4's Monday play, Gary Mitchell's oddly-titled A Tearful of Dreams, was extremely effective. Like so many stories from Northern Ireland, it concerned violence, murder, rape, lying, threats and politics, but it made no overt political point. Tracy (Eileen McCloskie) works in a bar; her brother Geordie (Tim Loane) is a policeman and her mother Evelyn (Marie Jones) the ex-girlfriend of the leader of a UVF outfit. The playing under Pam Brighton's direction was constantly exciting.</p>

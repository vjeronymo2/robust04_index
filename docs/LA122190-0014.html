			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> GREEN STARTS, BUT GARY WILL PLAY A LOT  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said Thursday that Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary will  split time at tailback Sunday at Atlanta, with Green getting the starting nod.  </P> <P> "It's just going to be an even thing," Robinson said, emphasizing that neither  Green nor Gary is ahead of the other in his mind.  </P> <P> Injury report: Recently signed Bruce Klostermann will replace injured Frank  Stams at one inside linebacker spot, Robinson said, with veteran Brett  Faryniarz going in on passing downs. The Rams will decide today whether  starting left guard Tom Newberry, who injured an ankle last week, can play  Sunday. Bern Brostek, this year's No. 1 pick, will play considerably at left  guard either way. Newberry and tight end Damone Johnson (hamstring) are both  listed as questionable.  </P> <P> For the Falcons, defensive end Mike Gann (foot) is listed as doubtful.  Quarterback Scott Campbell (shoulder), Pro Bowl receiver Andre Rison (knee) and  running back Steve Broussard (hamstring) are all questionable. TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

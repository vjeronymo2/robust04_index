			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Varlamov] </F>   [Text] Hiroshima, 14 Apr -- The Russian Ministry of Nuclear  Energy believes that within seven to 10 years all plutonium left  from dismantled nuclear weapons in Russia could in principle be  recycled on three-four breeder reactors of the new BN-800 type  (sodium cooled fast breeder reactor - ITAR-TASS). Nikolay  Yermakov, head of the Russian delegation at the conference of  the Japanese nuclear industry forum, currently being held here,  told this ITAR- TASS correspondent that a first reactor of this  type is already being built at one of the nuclear industry  centers in Chelyabinsk- 40, and that the local authorities have  approved its completion within the next several years.    Nikolay Yermakov, who heads the directorate of nuclear  reactors at the Russian Atomic Energy Ministry, said the  question of Japan's purchase of highly enriched fissile  substances from Russia's dismantled nuclear warheads is still  ``up in the air'' because Tokyo ``is not showing any activity in  response to Russia's proposals.''    The head of the Russian delegation believes that until about  2010 Russian nuclear power engineering will continue to develop  light- water reactors, which use thermal neutrons, because the  county's power engineering needs are at present satisfied by  cheap uranium.    However, he believes that from about the second decade of  the  21st century there will be a shift to a plutonium program, and a  closed power engineering system will be built on the basis of  breeder reactors, using both thermal and fast neutrons. ``This  will enable us to use breeder reactors not only to produce but  also to recycle -- that is to burn -- plutonium from light-water  installations with a minimal emission of radioactive waste,'' he  said.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Observer: Pound of flesh for IOC The International Olympic Committee, in Paris tonight for its centennial birthday party, will be attending closely to Dick Pound, IOC marketing boss and odds-on favourite to succeed Juan Samaranch as IOC president. Pound, a Canadian lawyer, has warned US attorneys to stay out of the 1996 Atlanta Games. 'Some means must be found to keep the Olympics in Atlanta free of litigation,' says Pound. His anxiety stems from a recent kerfuffle between the International Amateur Athletics Federation and its multi-million dollar sponsor, Coca-Cola. They were involved in a Dollars 27m damages claim - just overruled - against the IAAF by Butch Reynolds, an athlete banned after dope tests. If sponsors like Coca-Cola dispense huge wads to sporting associations, perhaps only to see them disappear into the wallets of lawyers, they might think twice in future. Such boat-rocking is bad news for the IOC, hoping for at least Dollars 2bn in sponsorship at Atlanta. There might even be fewer celebratory dinners.</p>

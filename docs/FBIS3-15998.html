			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Oleksandr Skipalskyy, chief of the </F> Intelligence Department of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, by  Viktor Verbych; place, date not given:  "State--Order--Prosperity"]    [Text] [Verbych] Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, there is no  need to introduce you to our readers. The residents of Volyn  Oblast respect you as their countryman and as a man who has  contributed, and still contributes, to the strengthening of our  state. Notwithstanding the fact that you are registered as a  nonparty candidate for a deputy seat, certain political  structures (let us recall, for example, a joint statement signed  by the leaders of the Socialist, Communist, and Peasant Parties)  have aimed their propaganda apparatus at General Skipalskyy.    [Skipalskyy] I am grateful to the leaders of the  above-mentioned parties and, first of all, to Oleksandr Moroz  [head of the Socialist Party], for evaluating me so highly.  However, I do not care so much about it. According to current  statistical data, 76 percent of Ukraine's population does not  pay any attention to party activities today. I am sure that I  will not go into any interparty quarrels by evaluating the  activities of these organizations during the electoral campaign.  I am running for a deputy's seat from my home constituency as  an independent candidate. I have not come here to instruct the  people -- everybody knows how we are living. I have come here  to show my gratitude to my countrymen. From them I inherited my  love for the Volyn region and for all of Ukraine. Here in the  Volyn region, I grew into manhood. I would like to repay this  debt by my dedicated efforts for the strengthening of our state.  For this purpose I have chosen the Vladimir Volynskiy  constituency. I know the Luboml region very well; the ancient  city of Vladimir is one of our spiritual capitals. One really  feels that the city was a center of the European state a  thousand years ago. This has been preserved in the genes of our  contemporary Volyn residents. We should make our Ukraine the  same strong state.    [Verbych] Therefore, we would like to hear about the  essentials of your election platform.    [Skipalskyy] They are extremely simple. The content of my  election platform can be summed up in three words:  state--order--prosperity. As of today, we do not live in an  independent state. We need hard work and, undoubtedly, an  appropriate political position. On the other hand, we will  never attain prosperity unless we introduce proper order.  Raging crime, theft, cynicism in the legal system, anarchy, and  predatory robbery of the people and state -- all these evils  must be urgently uprooted. In addition, it must be done  ruthlessly and with purpose. Prosperity means an indispensable  transition to market economy with social protection for the  citizens. Prosperity means the economic independence of every  individual.    [Verbych] Our citizens have already sunk into the sea of  smooth-tongued words. Streams of words, failing to transform  themselves into concrete actions, are pouring out of the mouths  of state officials and would-be people's deputies. However, it  seems that the people believe neither the former nor the latter.  Quite frequently one can hear opinions that deliverance lies in  rule by a "firm hand."    [Skipalskyy] It is my opinion, too. Our people have every  reason to speak like that. A state is impossible without order  in society. True, the notion of rule by a "firm hand" has been  deformed due to the cult of personality, everyday wrongdoings,  and bloody class slaughter. The notion of "firm-hand" rule  means an appropriate order and strong authority. Without these,  we will not be able to build a democratic society. Nothing  happens just on its own. One cannot just wake up in the morning  and find oneself in an independent state; one cannot become a  different man just like that. Why, after two years of honest and  persevering labor of many hard- working men, do we see that the  people are living in extremely difficult conditions, worse than  they have even been? Because our citizens are working for the  benefit of the state. which is being robbed more and more often.  But the state, I will repeat myself, does not actually exist.  We have lost our positions in the Crimea, in the Black Sea  Fleet. We have been working amorphously, unresolutely; we  thought that history would put everything in its proper place.  But history will only record all our inactivity. While fully  understanding our needs, we have not been able to speak of what  we must do. But just try to do it if there is no division among  the three branches of power -- executive, legislative, and  judicial. Not to mention the fourth power -- the media -- more  precisely, the press which is filled with reproaches, tug-of-war  games, and accusations...    [Verbych] And very often the press is in search of  sensational stories, complying, so to say, to the demands of  certain forces...    [Skipalskyy] We are still pursued by the inertia of class  struggle. We must be directed by the policy of state building.  Those who contribute to this goal should not be defamed all the  time, discredited, and raised against others...    [Verbych] We have to state today that among the electorate  there is apathy, disillusion, and disappointment. One can often  hear that the elections may not be held. That is to say, some  of our citizens actually refuse to influence the path our state  will take toward development. We forget that we are also to  blame for today's difficult situation, because we are the ones  who chose the people's deputies and the president. People say  in despair: It makes no difference to us.    [Skipalskyy] I do not believe that it makes no difference  to them. Their hearts are bleeding and flaming. Regarding  disillusion, it was also inherited from another historical  epoch. However, I would not like to attribute it to the  Ukrainian mentality. I am sure that the elections will be held.  There is no other way for us than free elections. True, given  the large number of candidates, people must select those who  will really care about the state and the nation. This is the  first version. The second one, extremely undesirable, is a  rigorous army dictatorship. There is also a third one -- enter  Ivan from the north and says: "Well, Little Russians [term used  by Russians to denote Ukrainians], residents of southern Russia,  if you are incapable of building the state, we will help you."  [passage in quotation marks in Russian] I am afraid of a  recurrence of history. There may be one more version: In  order to please Europe, Russia proposes to tear Ukraine to  pieces. A shadow of danger is constantly hovering over us. As  you know, certain politicians in Poland adopt statements making  territorial demands. Similar forces exist in Romania and  Hungary. I do not exclude the possibility that Ukraine may be  partitioned along the Sluch or Dnepr rivers. This is no joking  matter. One must assess today's real situation. We have to  think and act if we are to take care of our descendants.    [Verbych] The world treats us in a peculiar way. Let us  recall: The United States recognized the former Soviet Union  just when communists provoked in Ukraine a famine that has no  record in 20th century civilization. We also see the trends  that dominate in Poland: For the first time since 1945, they  put an officer from Eastern Europe on trial, and this is  Ukrainian Major Lysenko. In addition, according to many  political experts, the domestic situation in our state, in the  wake of Meshkov's election to the Crimean presidency, will  aggravate matters extremely: The trends toward autonomy will be  made a major issue by certain political forces. Ukraine may  face the prospect of being partitioned and divided by other  states. Do you think that Ukraine can avoid a situation as that  in Yugoslavia?    [Skipalskyy] There will be no such case as in Yugoslavia in  Ukraine; the situation is quite different. The issue of  federalization is a quite different topic. This issue is urgent  for Russia which still remains an empire. With regard to the  Crimea, this is a result of our miscalculations. As far back as  1991, I said: The Crimea has been bridled in order to  continually tug the Ukrainian horse by the head. The "elder  brother" will never accept Ukraine's significant advancement in  economic development. However, we must be soberminded  politicians: Russia is our neighbor, and we must cooperate in  order to keep interstate relations friendly. From a  geopolitical viewpoint, Russia is interested in Ukraine being a  friendly state. Russia has enough problems in its relations  with the Muslim world, as well as in domestic matters.    [Verbych] Your opponents long ago declared "war" on you.  They ardently persuade: We are the very people whom the  Ukrainian parliament needs. Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, in your  opinion, what people should be elected to the Supreme Council?    [Skipalskyy] Undoubtedly, those people who actively  contribute to the building of Ukraine, who carry the burden of  provocative accusations, compromises. This is being done by  ideological opponents and special services of those states that  are not interested in Ukraine gaining strength. Our  competitors, I will repeat myself, are capable of estimating  worthy opponents. Let us recall that wise Ukrainian proverb:  Lightning never strikes in the rotten oats. Regarding those  calumnies against me, I never yield to a dog's barking. As for  my opponents, I would suggest that they hold more fair  arguments. I want to become a worthy representative of the  Vladimir Volynskiy and Lukoml rayons in the Supreme Council to  protect the interests of Volyn residents in such a way as not to  make them ashamed of my speeches and actions. Working in the  legislative body, I will try to support bills intended to  protect citizens.    [Verbych] Oleksandr Oleksandrovych, you never were a  stranger here in the Volyn region. I recall the time when there  was a conflict ripening in Volodimir Volynskiy -- the Interfront  was just about to be launched -- and you were the man who  prevented a very dangerous clash.    [Skipalskyy] What is more, our former opponents constituted  90 percent of the electors who put me forward as a candidate.  My concept is to consolidate. We have to unite ourselves to  build the Ukrainian statehood regardless of nationality and  party alignment. Our citizens should not be forced into a class  struggle, as was done by Marxist-Leninist apologists. Only one  category of citizens must be isolated in our society --  criminals. Our recovery lies in the policy of statehood  building, in statehood philosophy.</p>

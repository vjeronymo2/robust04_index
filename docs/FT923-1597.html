			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / International Company News: Mandarin Oriental posts 10.3% increase in profits MANDARIN Oriental International, the hotels arm of Jardine Matheson, yesterday reported a 10.3 per cent rise in net profits to Dollars 19.2m for the half-year to June, from Dollars 17.4m a year earlier. The profits were struck on a 22.6 per cent rise in turnover to Dollars 72.5m from Dollars 59.1m. The directors declared an unchanged interim dividend of 1.41 cents a share. Higher net interest charges and tax ate into net margins, reducing them to 26.4 per cent from 29.4 per cent. Gross margins were broadly unchanged. The company said that the main factor behind the improved performance was the growth of travel both from within the Asia-Pacific region and from Europe. These gains were, however, partly offset by continued weakness in US demand and increased competition from new hotels in Macao and Jakarta. In Bangkok, the abortive military coup in the second quarter hit occupancy severely. The company said that its hotels in Hong Kong, Manila and Singapore improved their results year-on-year. Occupancy levels were higher but they were not able to increase prices. Mr Simon Keswick, chairman, said the better performance of these hotels should enable the company to achieve profit growth for the year as a whole. Jardine Strategic, an investment vehicle for the Jardine group, owns 50 per cent of Mandarin Oriental International.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Hong Kong travels down a familiar path: The sense of deja vu over Patten's plans for electoral reform IT IS possible, just possible, to interpret yesterday's announcement of Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political future as a victory for Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor. China backed down on its pre-condition that his package of proposals for the colony's 1994-95 elections be dropped before talks could begin. It also appears to have backed down on its objection to Hong Kong government officials being members of the British team. By standing firm on these 'principles', Mr Patten may have won concessions from a government which does not concede ground lightly. But then again, he may not. The prospect of talks is not one which fills many in the Hong Kong government with confidence. Hong Kong has been down this road before and, if the past is a guide, the future could be bleak. 'To quote Samuel Goldwyn, 'it feels like deja vu all over again',' one official noted yesterday. Another spoke of the 'crimp and mire' of talks. The Chinese government wants these talks, much more than Mr Patten does, for a number of reasons. The most important is that talks re-establish the precedent of China and Britain deciding Hong Kong's fate. The thought of Mr Patten's plans for a more democratic method of electing members to the Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's law making body, being decided by LegCo alone filled Beijing with dread. It would have established a precedent, just four years from the transfer of sovereignty, of Hong Kong deciding something without the blessing of its future sovereign. This fear, on China's part, is perhaps Mr Patten's strongest card in his otherwise rather weak hand. He can, if the negotiation appears fruitless, take his leave and present his package to LegCo. The Chinese, once bitten by Mr Patten's 'surprise' decision to gazette his legislation on March 12, are, however, likely to be twice shy. They will not easily provide him with reason to withdraw. The talks also put the issue into a forum in which China has displayed mastery in the past. One only has to look at the Hong Kong's long drawn-out attempt to build a new airport to see that China is the master of fudge and delay if it does not get what it wants. A memorandum of understanding, signed by the UK and Chinese prime ministers in September 1991, has been shown to be worthless in the face of a greater Chinese interest, namely, demonstrating its control over Hong Kong. The prize China can dangle in Britain's and Hong Kong's face is its final approval for the airport if London and Beijing can reach a binding agreement. China also knows that it is in the nature of a negotiation that the position stated at the beginning is rarely the one prevailing at the end. The British position is well known. The two central elements of Mr Patten's package are: an electoral college, which will return 10 members of LegCo in 1995, which consists of democratically elected local officials; and nine 'functional' constituencies which would be elected by Hong Kong's working population of 2.7m. What is much less well known is China's position. Aside from heaping derision on Mr Patten for his 'three violations' - China claims Mr Patten's blueprint runs counter to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, the 1991 Basic Law, and a series of exchanges between foreign ministers in early 1990  -Beijing has yet to deliver itself of its proposals for the 1995 polls. The talks will hinge, therefore, on two factors: what proposals for the 1995 elections Beijing brings to the table, and whether it is able to accept the deadline for enactment of enabling legislation by the summer, or autumn at the latest. Mr Patten's public remarks suggest that he believes China wants to rig the election. He has trumpeted in Brussels and London over the past week his determination to see elections that are 'clean' - a condition he has made synonymous with Britain's national honour. China has never much been concerned with British honour. But what Mr Patten has to hope is that Beijing has an interest in settling the issue on reasonable terms, and on that he would not be wanting to bet very much money. See Editorial Comment</p>

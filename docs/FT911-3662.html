			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / UK offer for Kuwaiti students BRITAIN has offered to take in hundreds of Kuwaiti university students next year as part of a package of technical and material help designed to get the emirate's education system back on its feet. A delegation of British educationalists, led by the British Council, made the offer this week after the Kuwait government indicated it is placing the highest priority on opening its schools and universities in August and September. Kuwait says it expects its 600 schools to be refurbished and ready by August, but that damage to vital teaching equipment in universities and other higher education institutions would hinder the return of some of the emirate's 15,000 university students. Mr Stuart Sutherland, the vice-chairman of London University, said he had accordingly offered places to hundreds of Kuwaiti students, whose fees would be payed by the Kuwait government, on a temporary basis. 'We could reopen a small campus in London next year which would take 400-500 students,' he said. 'And I"m sure other British polytechnics and universities could offer some space.' The delegation, led by Mr Timothy Raison, vice-chairman of the British Council, also included Ove Arup, the architects, and Laing Consultants, who discussed supplying Kuwait with everything from books to laboratory equipment. Mr Raison said no firm contracts had been offered, but added: 'The government seems very willing to commit themselves quickly to re-equipping.' Mr Raison also said the Kuwaiti authorities expressed interest in setting up creches, in order that Kuwaiti women could be encouraged to take up teaching posts. This is a further indication that the government is determined to replace Palestinians, who traditionally made up the core of Kuwait's teaching staff, in public service posts.</p>

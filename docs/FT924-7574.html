			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Tecs move 'undercuts chambers' TRAINING AND Enterprise Councils (Tecs) are developing membership schemes that compete directly with chambers of commerce and undercut the chambers' subscriptions. This is one of the main findings of a survey of the Tecs in England and Wales and Local Enterprise Companies (Lecs), their Scottish equivalents, published today by the London School of Economics. The study says that Tecs, which were envisaged as working with local organisations rather than having memberships of their own, are competing with chambers in small-business advice to members. It shows Tecs charge an average annual subscription of Pounds 32, compared with the chambers' average of Pounds 131. Mr Robert Bennett, author of the report, said the government encouraged the Tecs to set up membership schemes by means of performance bonuses but the purpose of this policy was not entirely clear. The survey noted that Tecs clearly planned to set themselves up in competition with the chambers. The G10 group of chief executives of 10 large Tecs claimed Tecs had a membership of 100,000 in a recent submission to the department of trade and industry. Tecs and Lecs: Survey of New Developments.

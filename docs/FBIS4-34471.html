			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Fidel Castano; place and date not given; </F> first paragraph is SEMANA introduction]    [Text] A few days ago, through the intercession of the  attorney who is representing Fidel Castano before the Prosecutor  General's Office, SEMANA was able to interview the paramilitary  commander, who is one of the country's most wanted men. Having  secured responses to the initial questionnaire and then to some  additional questions, SEMANA's editorial board decided to  publish them since Castano offers many revelations about some of  the biggest crimes in recent years.    [SEMANA] Your hatred for the guerrillas reportedly stems  from  the murder of your father, whom the subversives executed after  kidnapping him and after you paid a ransom. How did that story  go?    [Castano] My father was kidnapped in 1981 from an estate he  owned in the municipality of Segovia (Antioquia) by the Fourth  Front of the FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia],  which demanded 100 million pesos for his release. It was  impossible to raise that amount of money at the time, inasmuch  as our total wealth was not even half that much. Nevertheless,  with the help of several local ranchers and a loan that the  Amalfi Agricultural Credit Bank gave us under the Estate Law, we  got together 30 million pesos and paid them. They then told me  that 70 million was missing. I told them that I did not have  that kind of money and that if I ever did, I would use it for  nothing else but to combat them. My defiant reply was the reason  they killed him.    [SEMANA] Did you start forming the paramilitary groups in  Cordova after this episode?    [Castano] The group was actually created many years later.  What I did right after my father's murder was to offer myself as  a volunteer guide to the army, specifically to the Bombona  Battalion in Puerto Berrio and the military base of the same  battalion in Segovia. For two years, thanks to my help, as I  told them the location of guerrilla camps and pointed out  members of the FARC and the ELN [National Liberation Army], that  battalion achieved excellent results in its operations.  Concurrently, I received counterinsurgency training.    After that I began to realize that the methods that the army  was using could counter the actions of the guerrilla groups but  never exterminate them. So I decided to create my own group and  began operating in northeastern Antioquia, the Middle Magdalena,  as far as the department of Cordova.    [SEMANA] What was the purpose of these groups? Who financed  them and how?    [Castano] At first the groups were small, just a few  peasants  who were being harmed by the guerrillas and who saw self-defense  as a way of defending their lands from the abuses and atrocities  committed against them and their families. In other words, we  began our activities as self-defense and we later learned that  the guerrillas had neither the courage nor the military and  logistic capacity that was being attributed to them, inasmuch as  they always avoided a direct confrontation with our people. It  was really then that we started to deploy our forces and went on  the offensive to cover other areas and, at the same time, mold  our deployment to the guerrillas' area of influence.    [SEMANA] But who financed them?    [Castano] As for their financing, the self-defense groups  have always been financed by the people who have economic  interests in the zones in which these groups operate.    [SEMANA] These paramilitary groups reportedly sowed terror  in  Cordova, and the authorities point to you and these groups as  the perpetrators of the massacres in Las Tangas, La Negra, and  Punta Coquitos. The Supreme Court recently upheld a 20-year  sentence against you in connection with these incidents. What  actually happened?    [Castano] I must regrettably acknowledge that any armed  group  in an area of conflict of one sort or another terrifies the  civilian population. Now then, the Supreme Court upheld a  20-year sentence against me, but not for those massacres. On the  contrary, I was acquitted in connection with them. I was  convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime because I publicly  admitted having had a self-defense group at the time of the  demobilization, and we surrendered our weapons to the government.    What really happened was that back then there were various  independent, uncontrolled self-defense groups, but the public  seemed to think there was only one, mine, which they blamed for  everything that happened in that region of the country.    [SEMANA] What did you achieve with the paramilitary groups  in  Cordova?    [Castano] During the time that my self-defense groups were  in  the Upper Sinu, there were no kidnappings by the guerrillas;  land values rose; the ranchers were not paying protection money,  and all of the cattlemen could calmly visit their ranches. In  other words, the guerrillas were eradicated.    [SEMANA] You are said to be a man of the world who travels  constantly and is a major art connoisseur. Is this true?    [Castano] I lived for three years in Paris, where I was in  the artworks business. Before that, when circumstances allowed,  I traveled through several countries like any other person who  can afford to and has some taste. I do not have as much money as  my friends have always thought; I consider myself an average  person, a hard worker who struggles through life and is immersed  in countless problems. But I am content and I am still alive.    [SEMANA] Let's move on to another subject. Did you ever work  with Escobar? How did you meet him? How was your relationship  with him at the outset? Did you two ever do business?    [Castano] I met Pablo Escobar in the late 1970's in  Medellin;  at the time I bought and sold cars on commission. I met him when  I sold him several trucks, and we remained friends. We had  certain things in common, and although it may seem odd, we had  enormous sympathy for leftist ideology, so much so that on one  occasion we tried to contact one of the guerrilla groups that  existed at the time. But those leanings disappeared in him later  when he started making a lot of money and in me when that  guerrilla group kidnapped and later killed my father. It is  incomprehensible to me that my eternal enemies once had my  support. There are times when I think that if I had not had  reason to become a counterinsurgent, I would have been a  guerrilla.    I have to admit that I held Pablo in esteem back then, but  not as greatly as I came to despise him because I never imagined  that one day, in his obsession with money and power, he would  become the most despicable and bloodthirsty man ever born in  Colombia.    [SEMANA] The authorities have fingered you as one of the  chiefs of the military wing of the Medellin Cartel. Is this true?    [Castano] I have never worked for anyone, and much less have  I had bosses. I have not been a mercenary either. I have been  independent and I take responsibility for my actions.    [SEMANA] Because of that link to Escobar you have been cited  as one of the masterminds behind the blowing up of the Avianca  jet. The Prosecutor General's Office linked you and Escobar to  that case and recently ordered your arrest. Were you involved in  that bombing?    [Castano] My war has been only with everything that smacks  to  me of the guerrillas. I do not blow up planes. I do not need to  blow up a plane to kill someone famous. That reflects a lack of  military resources. When you go into battle convinced that you  are in the right and are acting with justice, you do not need to  kill 107 people to achieve a goal.    [SEMANA] What arguments do you have to counter the charges  that the Prosecutor General's Office has leveled at you? Do you  have information about the person or persons who ordered the  bombing, who carried it out, and what their reasons were to kill  107 passengers?    [Castano] It is a secret to no one that Pablo Escobar was  the  mastermind of that awful bombing. He was the only one who could  have thought of such an insane terrorist act. As for who carried  it out, his deputies who are now fortunately behind bars in La  Picota Prison in Bogota can answer that.    [SEMANA] Another of the crimes that the Prosecutor's Office  has linked you to is the assassination of the former candidate  of Patriotic Union, Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa. Last February an  arrest warrant was issued for you, and your two brothers,  Vicente and Carlos Castano, were also linked to the case.    [Castano] I had a role in that, but I was not the  mastermind,  much less the perpetrator. My brothers Carlos and Vicente had  absoluetly nothing to do with the incident or with any of my  activities outside the law. If I had been involved in any way in  any other activity, I would also say so, because my goal is to  have everyone pay for what he has done.    [SEMANA] You say that you did not kill Jaramillo. So who is  to blame for his murder?    [Castano] It was ordered by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, alias  "El Mexicano," and directed by Ariel Otero and men working for  Jaime Eduardo Rueda Rocha.    [SEMANA] But how were you involved?    [Castano] At a meeting that "El Mexicano" organized I was  asked for my opinion, and I agreed with the order that he had  given to execute the operation, the details of which I did not  know.    [SEMANA] The courts also link you to the assassinations of  Senator Alfonso Ospina Ospina and Father Sergio Restrepo.    [Castano] As for the murder of Father Sergio Restrepo, I can  tell you that I have never had confrontations with the Church or  with any of its members, and if there is anything that I am  going to fight for, it is to show that I was not aware of  anything that happened during the time that Dr. Alfonso Ospina  was being held prisoner. I lent armed personnel to retired Army  Captain Elkin Henao for some operations in the Middle Magdalena,  and he used them behind my back to look after Dr. Alfonso Ospina  during his captivity, all this in association with Pablo  Escobar. I am absolutely certain that the Prosecutor's Office  will acquit me of these charges. Why should I deny this, given  the police record I have?    [SEMANA] What were the causes of your breakup with Escobar  and more or less when did it happen?    [Castano] About 15 months before he was imprisoned in La  Catedral, Pablo gave the ELN a lot of weapons, and this upset me  greatly. We even had a bitter argument, and I never spoke to him  again. I felt like going after him, but the truth is that he  scared me. During the time that he was in La Catedral, in fact,  the Moncadas and Fernando Galeano were murdered, and those of us  who stayed alive felt obliged to fight against him because we  had no other choice.    [SEMANA] Were you the founder of "Los Pepes"?    [Castano] On 21 February 1994 I sent the prosecutor general  of the nation a memo saying: "I would like to clarify to you,  Mr. Prosecutor General of the Nation, that in order to combat  the despicable Pablo Escobar and his Medellin Cartel and to  prevent them from continuing to attack the Colombian people and  us, whom he persecuted tirelessly, I was the founder of the  group that called itself `Los Pepes' and, at the same time, its  military chief. In this and in my other activities outside the  law, my brothers were not at all involved, as my enemies would  have people believe."    [SEMANA] Why were "Los Pepes" established?    [Castano] It is my understanding that "Los Pepes" were not  established. One day, 30 million Colombians persecuted by Pablo  Escobar simply got fed up and banded together against him as  society's response to the absolute power acquired by Escobar and  his deputies, whom the State has now either killed or put behind  bars. The city of Medellin was in the hands of a bunch of  criminals, not common criminals but insane ones who killed and  kidnapped innocent people like never before. So, there had to be  a strong reaction, fighting fire with fire, or else we were  lost. I think that Medellin and the entire country are breathing  easier now that this thousand-headed monster and his famous  cartel are gone.    [SEMANA] How were they organized?    [Castano] Everybody soon realized that the prison called La  Catedral, where Pablo Escobar and his people were being held,  had become a bunker in which murders were being committed and  from which orders were given to kidnap, kill, and blackmail  industrialists, businessmen, ranchers, and affluent people.  Several distinguished persons sought me out and asked me to head  up a self-defense group against Pablo Escobar. I thought up the  name "Those persecuted by Pablo Escobar."    [SEMANA] How did "Los Pepes" operate?    [Castano] "Los Pepes" operated on two fronts. The first,  called intelligence, was in charge of gathering all sorts of  information on the structure of Pablo's organization. After the  information had been gathered, it was conveyed by telephone or  other channels to the appropriate authorities so that they could  take advantage of it. The other front was called the action  front; it was an armed group that I personally headed and that  acted on the information to neutralize and destroy the enemy.    [SEMANA] How was the group financed?    [Castano] There was no problem with that. Industrialists,  politicians, and cattlemen contributed money. We also raised  money and earmarked it for this cause.    [SEMANA] Who else was part of the top brass in "Los Pepes"?    [Castano] That is for the Prosecutor's Office to find out. I  cannot be disloyal on this point.    [SEMANA] "Los Pepes" claimed responsibility for a number of  attacks, including the murder of Omar Canas, who played for the  Atletico Nacional soccer team, and announced that other members  of the team would meet the same fate. Why?    [Castano] I am not going to be the one who tarnishes the  image of players on that team. We have all made mistakes in  life, and anyway they are all adults.    [SEMANA] Why did you set fire to Pablo Escobar's homes, blow  up his properties, and destroy his collection of automobiles?    [Castano] At some point someone had to battle Pablo by using  his own methods. Pablo planted bombs, kidnapped, and then  murdered his friends, but not before taking away all their money  and property. He tortured and killed hundreds of people. So we  were not going to combat someone as insane as him by dropping  hints. The people wanted us to destroy Pablo without resorting  to violence, but that was not possible. If things had been done  that way, today all of us and the government itself would once  again be on our knees at the feet of that monster.    [SEMANA] Why did you kill Guido Parra?    [Castano] The Guido Parra affair was indeed a regrettable  mistake. The operation was a hasty one. One sector of the  organization did not handle the matter with the proper  restraint. Unfortunately, I was away, though I am not trying to  dodge my responsibility by saying this. But, excesses are  committed in war too. You have to understand, though, that this  was not done gratuitously. The operational command of "Los  Pepes" received information that Guido Parra was in direct  contact with Pablo Escobar and that he served as his liaison for  intelligence work and as an adviser on hide-outs and other  operations. We know today that Pablo Escobar himself misinformed  us and also that Dr. Guido Parra was no longer even his lawyer  and that they had their differences because Escobar owed him a  lot of money in fees. So, we were victims of Escobar's ploy to  make us look like common murderers of innocent people. This was  another of his wartime strategies.    [SEMANA] Why did you kill other attorneys for Escobar and  his  organization, like Salomon Lozano and Raul Zapata?    [Castano] In the case of Salomon Lozano, the legal adviser  to  Carlos Mario Urquijo, alias "Arete," we found that he was no  longer his defense attorney. Instead, he served him as a  courier, carrying letters with false accusations and conveying  Pablo Escobar's instructions to attack "Los Pepes" in a bid to  wage what they called "the legal war," so that they could use  the military, in other words, government security forces,  against me and the organization.    The same was the case with Raul Zapata. In short, these  individuals strayed beyond the bounds of their profession and  became common criminals in service to the people who were behind  bars, not to solve their problems but to misinform.    [SEMANA] How did you collaborate with the Search Bloc in  harassing Pablo Escobar?    [Castano] We never had direct contact with the Search Bloc.  We gave it a lot of information through various channels that  did not identify us.    [SEMANA] Is it true that you were involved in the operation  in which Escobar died? In what other operations did you take  part?    [Castano] No. I repeat: we never had any joint operations  with the Search Bloc. The operation in which Escobar died was  conducted exclusively by the police, as is public knowledge.    [SEMANA] What happened to "Los Pepes" after Escobar's death?  Did they demobilize?    [Castano] After Escobar's death there was no reason for our  organization to continue. Since that glorious 2 December no more  people are being persecuted by Pablo Escobar in Colombia.    [SEMANA] Intelligence agencies report that after Escobar's  death you had contacts with his family. Did you sign some sort  of truce with his relatives? What are its terms?    [Castano] I spoke with Hermilda and told her that we had  absolutely nothing against them, and I said the same thing to  Maria Victoria in a letter. We never regarded Pablo's family or  the families of the other cartel members as enemies.    [SEMANA] You demanded that Escobar's deputies who are in  maximum-security prisons confess to all their crimes. Was there  some sort of pact?    [Castano] I do not consider it a pact. I simply thought that  the members of the cartel were making a mockery of the  Prosecutor's Office. They turned themselves in and confessed to  a minor crime, thus eluding us and hoping to go free in one  year. At that point we demanded that each and every one of them  confess to all their crimes, which would guarantee them at least  10 years in prison. That way we would not have to go after them  again, because the Prosecutor's Office would finally be  punishing them for their crimes.    [SEMANA] What happened to the Medellin Cartel after  Escobar's  death? Did you take over as its leader?    [Castano] Drug trafficking has never attracted me. My  businesses have always revolved around ranching and art. How am  I supposed to head up a cartel that no longer exists? How am I  supposed to spearhead a cause that was involved in drug  trafficking, with which I have never agreed? I must admit that I  was a friend of drug traffickers, but only because of my  financial dealings. The Medellin Cartel died with Pablo Escobar.  So, there is nothing to head up in Medellin. The only thing I  want in my future is to live in the countryside, thus assuring  the government that I, Fidel Castano, will never again break the  peace in Colombia.    [SEMANA] What is your relationship with the Cali Cartel?  Escobar always said that the Cali people and you were the heads  of "Los Pepes." How was Cali involved in that organization?    [Castano] I have no relationship with what you call the Cali  Cartel. I do not think that the cartel exists as such. I do have  good friends in the Cauca Valley and I am grateful to them  because they were the ones who provided the authorities with the  most information about Pablo Escobar's narcoterrorists.    [SEMANA] Have you thought about turning yourself in to the  authorities?    [Castano] I have thought about it repeatedly. But the  outlook  would be bleak for me because I know that it would take longer  to get me into prison than to get myself killed there. I have a  lot of enemies in jail, and they would not waste this unique  opportunity to murder me. I think that all things considered, I  will try to stay alive in the countryside. I would rather die  there than give my enemies a chance to achieve their goal. So, I  have promised myself that I will never allow myself to be taken  to jail. I swear it.    [SEMANA] Is your paramilitary group still active?    [Castano] No, I do not have a paramilitary group, but I do  have armed personnel to protect me, because I still live in a  mountainous area alongside the FARC, the ELN, and a hard core of  cattle rustlers from the Popular Liberation Army who dream of  seeing me dead. When all is said and done, as long as I am  living in a guerrilla zone, I will never be able to let down my  guard.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: FINALLY:  </P> <P> Elijah Blue, Cher's 13-year old son by Gregg Allman, will play guitar on mom's  upcoming tour, which is set to kick off on Aug. 16 in Atlantic City. Cher  receives more, uh, exposure in the video for her current Top 40 hit "If I Could  Turn Back Time," in which she parades around a battleship almost wearing a wisp  of fabric that does little to cover a tattoo on her bottom. The provocative  clip barely made it past the standards and practices people at NBC-TV's "Friday  Night Videos," who reportedly deliberated for days before deciding that seeing  another inch or two of Cher's body wouldn't unduly corrupt the nation's morals.  </P></p>

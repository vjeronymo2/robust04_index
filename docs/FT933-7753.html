			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway and Iceland in bitter fishing row NORWAY AND Iceland have become embroiled in a bitter dispute over fishing rights in a huge undeclared zone in the Barents Sea where Arctic cod spawn. There are no signs yet of an end to the row after two days of discussions between the two Nordic countries. A modern fleet of 21 Icelandic trawlers is expected to arrive in the disputed zone this week to join two vessels already there to fish Arctic cod in blatant defiance of their Norwegian counter-parts, who have threatened to destroy their nets unless they vacate the area. Mr Johan Joergan Holst, the Norwegian foreign minister, this week failed to win assurances from Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, Iceland's foreign minister, to prevent his fisherman from exploiting the 62,400 sq km zone. The two ministers had been engaged in serious discussions over the dispute on Monday and Tuesday and the Icelandic government was split over what could or should be done in response to Norway's strong objections to fishing in the area. The disputed area, which falls outside the jurisdiction of both Norway and Russia, is a major spawning ground for Arctic cod, which eventually make their way to both Norwegian and Russian waters and on which those countries' cod quotas are partly based. Norway not only fears that fishing by the Icelanders will set a precedent signifying the area is open to one and all but that it will also upset the spawning ground. This could restrict or inhibit the cod growth development and, in the end, force Norway to reduce quotas, which it has been able cautiously to increase in recent years following positive results of stringent resource management during the 1980s. NRK national radio reported from Iceland that a further 20 to 30 Icelandic trawlers also planned to head towards the disputed area if the cod catches proved sufficient to return a profit. One estimate put the value of a cod catch from the area by 15 vessels manned by less than 20 fisherman each at NKr100m (Pounds 9.1m). Meanwhile, the Norwegian coast guard was stepping up surveillence of the area and using Orion type aircraft to monitor the Icelandic trawlers. Norway claims that already this year some 470 tonnes of Arctic fish have been caught in the disputed area by six vessels registered under Caribbean flags. Last year two of the vessels, Norway claims, caught 2,178 tonnes of cod while in 1991 four vessels - two from Greenland and two from France - caught 1,570 tonnes.</p>

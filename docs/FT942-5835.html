			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Dash of drama in theme park saga  -Alice Rawsthorn profiles the Saudi billionaire rescuing Euro Disney There are lots of gallant heroes in Walt Disney's cartoons, but few are quite as dashing as Zorro, the masked horseman whose bravery won him a starring role in a EuroDisneyland commercial, where he gallops through the theme park to slip a crystal slipper on to Cinderella's foot. Yesterday a real-life Zorro rode to EuroDisneyland's rescue. Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal, the 37-year-old nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, stunned the international investment community by unveiling plans to buy between 13 per cent and 24.5 per cent of Euro Disney, the theme park's troubled owner. The prince's arrival, only a few days before an extraordinary general meeting at which Euro Disney is expected to announce the terms of a FFr6bn (Dollars 1.04bn) rights issue, adds yet another dash of drama to the saga of the ill-starred theme park. Yet drama has become a familiar phenomenon to Prince Al-Waleed in his short but action-packed business career. Prince Al-Waleed may have begun life with the pomp and privileges associated with being a member of the Saudi royal family. But he has since built on his hereditary advantages with the verve of a rags-to-riches entrepreneur by turning his original 'stake' of Dollars 15,000 into a personal fortune estimated at Dollars 4bn. His early life was typical of the cosmopolitan Arabs of his generation. He spent his childhood in Beirut and Riyadh before being educated in the United States. He returned to Saudi Arabia in 1985 where he began his first business - the Kingdom Establishment construction company - with his token Dollars 15,000. Kingdom Establishment expanded rapidly and has since been involved with construction projects worth more than Dollars 20bn. Within three years the prince had started to diversify, turning his attention to banking with the acquisition of a significant stake in United Saudi Commercial Bank, the Riyadh-based banking group of which he is now chairman. But it was not until 1991 that Prince Al-Waleed made his name on the international scene when, after weeks of secret negotiations, he paid Dollars 800m for a 14.8 per cent stake in Citicorp, the US banking group, where he is still the biggest single investor. Two years later he expanded further in the US by buying 11 per cent of Saks Fifth Avenue, the famous department store. Earlier this year he surfaced in the French investment arena, when he teamed up with Mr Paul Dubrule and Mr Gerard Pelisson, joint chairmen of the Accor hotel group, in their bid for the Meridien luxury hotel chain from Air France, the state-controlled airline. The Meridien deal, which brought Prince Al-Waleed and Accor into conflict with Forte, the UK leisure group, is still on the negotiating table as the Air France board mulls the merits of their competing bids. The French press at the time made much of the size of the prince's personal fortune, given that he has promised to finance the entire FFr1.6bn bid. But that deal pales in comparison with Euro Disney. The prince is not only committed to spending around FFr1.5bn on his stake of up to 24.5 per cent, but has also offered to invest an additional Dollars 100m to build a second conference centre at the theme park. Moreover, the intricate terms of the deal may mean that Prince Al-Waleed ends up buying a significant holding of Euro Disney stock from Walt Disney, its powerful US parent (although the prince's total holding is not allowed to be worth more than half that of Walt Disney). Whatever the outcome, Prince Al-Waleed appears committed to a long-term investment in Euro Disney. If Walt Disney ever decides to reduce its holding further, or if Euro Disney starts to cast around for capital to finance its desired second theme park, Prince Al-Waleed might be asked to play Zorro for a second time by riding yet again to the rescue.</p>

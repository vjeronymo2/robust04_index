			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> BACKTRACKING ON ADDITIONS  </P> <P> A month after liberalizing a temporary limit on the size of additions to  single-family homes, the City Council went back to the old, stricter  guidelines.  </P> <P> On Monday, the council voted 5 to 0 to limit room additions to 50% of existing  floor area. The strict rules, originally adopted in October, were eased Nov. 12  to allow additions on a sliding scale ranging from 100% to 200% of the original  floor area, depending on lot size.  </P> <P> The new ordinance will be in effect until September. Permanent guidelines are  being prepared.  </P></p>

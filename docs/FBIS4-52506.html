			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 10 KYODO -- Cabinet ministers on Tuesday  [10 May] criticized Shigeto Nagano, who was forced to resign  Saturday as justice minister over his remarks that the 1937  Nanjing massacre committed by the Japanese Imperial Army was a  fabrication.    Moriyoshi Sato, chief of the Hokkaido and Okinawa  Development  Agencies, said at a press conference after a cabinet meeting  that the administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata "made the  worst start.

Nagano also told the MAINICHI that it was wrong to call  Japan  an aggressor in World War II.    His remarks brought sharp criticism from neighboring  countries, especially China and South and North Korea, which  were invaded by Japan before the war.

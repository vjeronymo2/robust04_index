			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EUROPEANS HAVE MUCH TO LOSE IN THE GULF PUZZLE;  </P> <P> FRANCE, WHICH HAS PINNED ITS MIDEAST POLICY ON BAGHDAD FOR TWO DECADES,  PROBABLY HAS THE MOST AT STAKE IN THE REGION.  </P> <P> On the ground in Saudi Arabia and on the waters of the Persian Gulf, the United  States carries the biggest stick in the showdown with the forces of Iraqi  leader Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> But in terms of economic and political risk, Western Europe probably has more  at stake in the gulf conflict, particularly if it erupts into a fighting war.  This is particularly true of France, which for 20 years has pinned its Middle  East foreign policy on Iraq. It is least true of Britain, which is the only net  exporter of oil in the European Community.  </P> <P> In general, however, the European countries are far more dependent on the  Persian Gulf for oil than is the United States, which receives only 7% of its  total supply from the region. In contrast, the 17 European members of the  International Energy Agency, the West's answer to the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries, receive more than 24% of their total oil supplies from the  gulf.  </P> <P> The geographic proximity of the volatile Middle East and Arab North Africa also  produce anxieties in Europe that do not exist as strongly in the United States  -- particularly, fears that a gulf conflict could spark another Arab-Israeli  war and unleash a new generation of weapons.  </P> <P> Christoph Bertram, diplomatic correspondent for Die Zeit newspaper in Hamburg,  commented: "People here have been drawing maps measuring the range of the new  Israeli and Egyptian missiles. They are horrified to see that it takes in a  sizable chunk of Europe. Although the gulf is far away, in our political  subconscious it is the proximity of a potential Arab-Israeli conflict that  worries us."  </P> <P> Concerns about security include fears that a gulf war would create a new wave  of terrorism on the Continent, like those that swept through France, Italy and  West Germany in the 1980s. Europeans are acutely aware that although terrorist  activity is directed against American foreign policy, the most serious attacks  usually occur outside the United States.  </P> <P> "If the war breaks out, the first risk is terrorism," warned Gilles Munier, a  French pro-Arab militant active in the Iraq lobby in Europe. "There will be  many repercussions. In any case, the bombs never explode in your country (the  United States), they are always planted in Europe."  </P> <P> Several of the European countries also have large Arab and Muslim minorities  that react sensitively to events in Muslim lands. In both France and Britain,  several leading Muslim clerics have condemned the presence of U.S. troops in  Saudi Arabia. Talk programs on Europe's Arabic language radio stations are  inundated with callers supporting Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> So far in the tense standoff that the French call the drole de guerre -- the  "phony war" -- the United States and European allies have shown impressive  solidarity in both military and political terms. Except for a few dissenters,  notably French Minister of Defense Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the Europeans and  the Americans have spoken with one consistent voice. (Chevenement, a founding  member of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Assn. in his country, embarrassed French  President Francois Mitterrand by publicly opposing French participation in the  naval blockade of Iraq.)  </P> <P> More important, the Europeans have been willing to back up the talk with  military hardware and personnel. Fourteen European warships are already in the  gulf area, compared to 23 for the United States. Another 26 European vessels  are on the way, representing military commitment from seven European countries.  </P> <P> "We are witnessing a very considerable buildup," said John Roper, director of  the research institute for the Western Europe Union. "It may be that before  long there will be as many European vessels in the gulf as there are American."  </P> <P> Still, critics like British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher contend that most  European countries have done only a minimum. "It is sad that at this critical  time Europe has not fully measured up to expectations," she told a gathering of  European conservative party leaders late last week.  </P> <P> "We cannot expect the United States to go on bearing major military and defense  burdens worldwide, acting, in effect, as the world's policeman if it does not  get a positive and swift response from its allies when the crunch comes --  particularly when fundamental principles as well as their direct interests are  just as much at stake," Thatcher said.  </P> <P> And European analysts interviewed by The Times warn that the allied front could  crack if Hussein continues to weather military and economic pressures from the  international community. If the drole de guerre stretches into months and  years, they said, the differences in American and European interests would be  exacerbated, undermining the consensus on economic sanctions.  </P> <P> Here are some of the main European interests that influence continental  policies on the gulf:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Energy:  </P> <P> Except for Britain and Norway, the only two net exporters of oil in the region,  most European countries depend much more heavily on gulf oil than does the  United States. The oil dependency is highest in Greece, which receives more  than 65% of its domestic supply from the gulf. But France (36%), Belgium (34%),  the Netherlands (31%), Spain (29%) and Italy (28%) are also highly dependent on  gulf crude.  </P> <P> In some ways, as Die Zeit commentator Bertram noted, the source of oil in world  markets is not as important as the price. Importers pay approximately the same  price for oil whether it comes from the Yucatan or the Yukon, Siberia or the  Sahara. Sudden fluctuations in supply such as those caused by the U.S.-led  embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, raise the prices for everyone. (In addition,  crude oil prices are fixed in dollars, currently at near-record lows on the  international exchanges -- a plus for Europeans, but one that could change.)  </P> <P> Regional disturbances in supply also greatly disrupt distribution systems in  the importing countries. In France, for example, several of the refineries at  the country's main oil port near Marseilles have already been forced to lay off  workers because they dealt exclusively with Iraqi oil.  </P> <P> In addition, France and Italy, among other European countries, had entered into  barter arrangements with the Iraqi government, drained of cash after its bloody  eight-year war with Iran. This allowed Iraq to pay for manufactured goods,  including sophisticated French weapons, with crude oil instead of currency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trade:  </P> <P> Although it has declined sharply in recent years because of Iraq's inability to  pay its debts, European trade with Hussein's regime has been extensive. Last  year, for example, West Germany sold $1.1 billion worth of machine goods,  automobiles and pharmaceuticals to the Iraqis. Until it exploded into an  international scandal, West German exports of chemicals helped Iraq build a  stockpile of chemical weapons.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the French military-industrial complex sold Iraq most of the  sophisticated weaponry that American, French and British troops face in the  gulf.  </P> <P> According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute that monitors  international arms transactions, France sold Iraq more than $5 billion worth of  major weapons systems between 1980 and 1989.  </P> <P> Commented Herbert Wulf, a senior researcher at the Stockholm Institute:  </P> <P> "France provides the most prominent example of how this kind of weapons supply  backfires and how shortsighted business interests (in earning) a quick franc  eventually led to a situation where you get shot at with your own guns."  </P> <P> According to a survey by The European newspaper, the 12 member states of the  European Community exported more than $4 billion in goods last year to Iraq,  despite the country's shortage of cash and continuing controversy over its use  of poison gas on the indigenous Kurdish population living on Iraq's border with  Turkey and Iran. The same survey showed $1.5 billion in European Community  exports to Kuwait in the same period.  </P> <P> In addition, the Hussein regime still owes billions of dollars to the  Europeans, including $4.6 billion to the French, $900 million to West Germany  and $900 million to Italy. According to SACE, the Italian export credit  insurance company, Italian businesses stand to lose as much as $11 billion in  business deals with Iraq because of the economic sanctions.  </P> <P> Of course, the economic damage is not limited to business with Iraq and Kuwait.  </P> <P> The crisis has already affected spending by the other oil-rich kingdoms and  emirates in the gulf region for products ranging from German luxury cars to  racehorses. In fact, events in the gulf cast a pall over the annual sale of  French yearlings held recently in Deauville, on the Normandy coast. Hordes of  buyers from the gulf normally show up at the thoroughbred auction, the European  version of the annual Kentucky yearling sale at Keeneland.  </P> <P> This year, however, reporters said only one Arab came to Deauville and he  bought only one modestly priced horse.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Geopolitics:  </P> <P> On the geopolitical front, the big loser in the Persian Gulf crisis is France.  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, since President Charles de Gaulle forged the  French-Arab policy in the wake of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, Iraq's best  friend in the West has been France.  </P> <P> In much the same way that Iran was once the pillar of U.S. interests in the  region, Iraq was the pivot for the French in the Arab world. "Americans learned  their lesson about putting all their eggs in one basket with the Shah of Iran  (Mohammed Reza Pahlavi),"commented Wulf of the Stockholm Institute. "The U.S.  banked on the shah as the guarantor of stability in the region and watched as  its Middle East policy was wiped out" when the shah was ousted from power in  the Iranian revolution. "All of a sudden, France finds herself in the same  boat."  </P> <P> The warm Franco-Iraqi relations began under De Gaulle but intensified after the  economically devastating 1973 oil shock. Terrorist actions in France by  pro-Iranian agents made the French feel even closer to the Iraqis. French  supplies of weapons and expertise during the Iran-Iraq War cemented the  relationship.  </P> <P> During the war, French writers, journalists and politicians donned battle  fatigues and toured the front, sending back glowing tributes to the  "progressive" Saddam Hussein regime. A spectrum of political leaders ranging  from Chevenement to former Gaullist Prime Minister Jacques Chirac had only fond  words for the Iraqi regime.  </P> <P> The Iraqi lobby in France was large and powerful. In addition to Chevenement,  the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Assn. included prominent leaders in the defense  industry. The impressive Iraqi cultural center in Paris was housed in a mansion  owned by the Dassault family, owners of the aerospace company that sold Iraq  more than 150 Mirage fighters. Stories circulated widely that the Iraqis had  contributed lavishly to political parties, from the right to the left.  </P> <P> Francois Heisbourg, French director of the International Institute for  Strategic Studies in London, noted that receptions at the Iraqi Embassy in  Paris were among the most popular on the political social scene. "The Iraqis  had a broad sweep of friends," Heisbourg said.  </P> <P> Cynics suggested that this explained why France moved relatively slowly to  respond to U.S. appeals for support in the gulf intervention. "Speedy  Diplomats, Slow Boats," the Times of London commented caustically. Even after  President Mitterrand ordered French ships, commandos and helicopters into the  gulf, Chevenement made a statement attacking his own government's policy.  </P> <P> Since then, France has become the second-largest military presence in the gulf  behind the United States. The result is a terrible sense of betrayal on the  part of the Iraqis -- who reportedly offered to release French citizens from  Iraq and Kuwait if the French would stay neutral in the conflict -- and a  French Middle Eastern foreign policy that is in ruins.  </P> <P> "What we cannot understand," Iraq's Hussein said in a bizarre, rambling  interview with a French journalist the other day, "is the position of France.  The only country we blame is France. We don't directly blame the United States  or Great Britain because they were never objective. They were never our  friends."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Muslims:  </P> <P> The mystery factor in the European response to the gulf crisis is the  Continent's large Arab and Muslim population.  </P> <P> France has 3 million Muslims, mostly ethnic Arabs from the Maghreb countries  (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia) of North Africa. Britain has 400,000 Arabs and 1.5  million Muslims, most from Pakistan and India. West Germany has fewer Arabs but  a huge Turkish population estimated at nearly 2 million. Turks are also Muslims  who tend to react similarly on Middle East issues.  </P> <P> In all, there are an estimated 7 million Muslims living in Europe. Together,  they form an increasingly volatile and sensitive element of European life that  has no equivalent in the United States.  </P> <P> Reaction to the allied intervention in the Persian Gulf has so far been mixed,  although leading Muslim clerics in Marseilles, France, and in London have  condemned the U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia. According to reports in  the French press, police have kept 30 suspected Iraqi agents under surveillance  to prevent them from inciting Muslims against the military action in the gulf.  Three small pro-Iraq demonstrations have been held in Paris since the Aug. 2  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, phone lines to Arabic radio stations in Europe, including Radio  Maghreb in France, have been jammed with callers.  </P> <P> "The first reaction of the callers after the attack was unanimous condemnation  of Iraq," said Dahmane Abderrahmane, manager of Radio Maghreb. "But from the  moment when the Americans became engaged militarily, there was a unanimous  condemnation of America."  </P> <P> A key factor is resentment of U.S. policy regarding Israel and Palestinians.  </P> <P> In general, as Bertram of Die Zeit commented, Europeans do not share the  special relationship the United States has with Israel. "European countries,"  Bertram said, "tend to distance themselves more from Israel."  </P> <P> The attitude is much stronger in the European and Muslim communities. European  Muslims have no strong affection for Kuwaitis. "The Maghrebians are not going  to weep for the rich Kuwaitis in the casinos on the Champs Elysees," said  Abderrahmane.  </P> <P> Nor are they particularly fond of Saddam Hussein. "There is not one of us who  would lift his little finger for Saddam Hussein, and he knows it," said Arezki  Dahmani, director of the predominantly Arab civil rights organization, France  Plus.  </P> <P> But according to Dahmani and other European Arab leaders, the European Muslim  community feels it is hypocritical for the United States to condemn the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait without moving more strongly to reverse the 23-year Israeli  occupation of the West Bank.  </P> <P> "If Bush doesn't integrate the Palestinian question into the discussion,"  predicted Dahmani, "irrationality will have the day."  </P></p>

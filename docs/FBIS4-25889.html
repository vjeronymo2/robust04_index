			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article: "State Pursues More Working Capital for Public </F> Firms"]    [Text] A shortage of working capital has recently become  acute at many State-owned enterprises.    At a recent seminar organized by China Financial Times on  the  issue, government officials, financial experts and businessmen  concluded that the solution depends on changing the way State  enterprises operate.    Bank loans have been the main support behind enterprises'  operations ever since the government stopped earmarking working  capital, according to China Financial Times.    Most enterprises accumulate little for working capital.  Nationwide, the average percentage of enterprises with  self-supplied funds for working capital fell from 25 percent in  1984 to only 7 percent last year.    For normal operations, an enterprise should generate at  least  30 percent of its working capital, according to Liu Zigang, an  official with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).    When bank loans are in short supply, such enterprises  experience hard times.    It is a heavy burden for the banks to provide large amounts  of working capital for enterprises.    According to Liu, ICBC provides 80 percent of the working  capital extended by financial organization.    In 1992, the bank's loans for working capital rose by 67.2  billion yuan ($7.7 billion) compared with the previous year.  Last year, it rose by 1O2.4 billion yuan ($11.8 billion). By  the end of this April, the increase totalled 20.3 billion yuan  ($2.3 billion), 10.3 billion ($1.2 billion) more than in the  same period last year.    But the demand for working capital rises even more rapidly.    Inflation has caused increases in the enterprises'  production  costs, so demand increased for working capital.    Chain debts also take a large part of the enterprises'  working capital. Large uncollected accounts at many firms force  them to delay payments to their own creditors.    During the first quarter of this year, the total owed by the  40,000 enterprises which have accounts at the Industrial and  Commercial Bank increased by more than 40 billion yuan ($4.6  billion), compared with the same period last year, according to  Liu.    Many enterprises have not invested enough for their  construction projects, so funds earmarked for working capital  usually are diverted to fixed assets to pay for the con  struction.    For construction completed between 1992 and 1993, diverted  funds totalled at least 67 billion yuan ($7.7 billion ).    According to Su Zongguo, an official with the State Economy  and Trade Commission (SETC), there will be a gap of at least 50  billion yuan ($5.75 billion) between demand and supply for  working capital required by industrial enteprises this year.    Because of this shortage, many enterprises may have strong  sales, but lack funds to purchase raw materials to produce more  goods.    The government has decided to adopt different measures to  solve the problem. Major enterprises with bright prospects that  have used their capital properly will be assured of government  support.    Enterprises in poor financial shape but striving to improve  their operations will receive loans. Enterprises considered  hopeless will be allowed to go bankrupt.    To do this, it is essential to categorize enterprises with  great care, says Hu Huanxin from the Agricultural Bank of China.    The total investment in fixed assets should be firmly  controlled, said Su. New projects should only be approved after  they have raised enough funds so that no working capital will be  diverted.    Chain debts will be monitored by the SETC to free working  capital. Analysis has already begun with major industrial  enterprises that work with raw materials, power, and machinery.    The enterprises' reliance on bank loans should be reduced  through an increase in self-supplied working capital, said Liu  Zigang. And the State should increase investments in major  industrial enterprises through lower tax rates, and tax rebates.    Banks should set aside loans to be used exclusively as  working capital. Sales income from enterprises should be placed  in banks' special accounts and earmarked for use as working  capital.    Supervision of bank loans to be used for working capital  should be strengthened through a regulatory system, so that  these funds could be used more efficiently. This can be one way  to ease the shortage of working capital, suggests Yao Jiqi from  the Bank of China.    Within the corporate system, government enterprises now can  raise money by issuing stocks and bonds.    To help transform their operations, the SETC has started to  experiment with more than 10,000 enterprises in 10 cities.    The results will be reviewed at the end of the Eighth  Five-Year period (1991-95).</p>

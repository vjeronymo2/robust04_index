			<p>BFN     [Text] Leipzig (DDP/ADN) -- The International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) has not yet been officially informed that North  Korea is to leave. Statements from the North Korean Foreign  Ministry have only come through the media, IAEA spokesman  Hans-Friedrich Meyer said today on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk  (MDR). The IAEA inspectors have also not yet been asked to  leave the country.    Meyer stressed that North Korea leaving the IAEA does not  automatically mean it has to leave the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. Separate control agreements exist here. These also  still allow for on-the-spot checks.    According to the IAEA spokesman, the nuclear danger posed by  North Korea is being "played up by the media." "The IAEA has  never said that North Korea has bombs."</p>

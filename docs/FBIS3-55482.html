According to his widow, the ex-president shot himself in  western Georgia on December 31.    Dzhordzhikia, senior assistant to Georgia's prosecutor  general, told INTERFAX no evidence had been found to prove the  reports that Gamsakhurdia had been wounded in Chechnya.    Dzhordzhikia said two witnesses of Gamsakhurdia's death had  been found. One of them is in Chechnya, but it has been  impossible to contact him, for Gamsakhurdia's family, living in  Groznyy, objects to this, Dzhordzhikia said.    He said President Dzhokhar Dudayev of Chechnya had given a  "good and friendly" reception to the Georgian investigators.  The latter, who include staff from the Prosecutor General's  Office and the Interior and Security Ministries, had an  hour-and-a-half-long meeting with Dudayev, who promised them  whatever help they might need, Dzhordzhikia said.    The investigators also met Merab Kiknadze, a member of the  former Georgian parliament, who said the Gamsakhurdia family  objected to a post mortem.    It is still unknown where the ex-president is buried, but  the  Tbilisi team has had a letter from his widow, Manana  Gamsakhurdia, who, "on behalf of the whole family of the  deceased president," asks for his body to be buried in Chechnya,  "where his family has lived in exile for the past two years."  She has made the same request to Dudayev.</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / International Company News: Guoco Group report boost in earnings Guoco Group, the Hong Kong-based company controlled by the Malaysian Quek family, reported a 287 per cent surge in earnings to HKDollars 812.8m for the six months to December 31, compared with HKDollars 210.1 last year, writes Louise Lucas. The dividend rises just 1 cent on last year, to 21 HK cents. Subsidiary Dao Heng Bank Group, spun off in a separate listing last December, made a net interim profit of HKDollars 400.5m - an increase of 135 per cent over the HKDollars 170.1m last time. The group said Overseas Trust Bank, bought from the colony's government last October for HKDollars 4.46bn, was making a strong contribution. There is no interim dividend at Dao Heng.</p>

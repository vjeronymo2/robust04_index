			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: DnB cuts losses to NKr601m in first quarter DEN NORSKE Bank, the troubled Norwegian bank, has reduced its first-quarter net losses to NKr601m (Dollars 93.6m) from NKr798m in the same period last year. It attributed the improvement to lower credit losses, growth in net interest income and a reduction in operating costs. Group operating profit, before credit losses and taxes, rose by NKr17m to NKr424m. The bank said a NKr45m charge was made against accounts to cover write-downs and losses arising from the sale of fixed assets. Credit losses were reduced by NKr172m to NKr1.02bn but non-performing loans rose by NKr105m from the end of last year to NKr10.27bn. Group net interest income increased NKr113m to NKr1.14bn but other operating income fell by NKr117m to NKr545m. A reduction of NKr28m to NKr13m in income from securities trading contributed to the decline, as trading in foreign exchange and other financial instruments fell NKr92m to NKr70m. DnB said that results of Realkreditt, a mortgage company acquired last year, were included for the first time in the group's accounts. Realkreditt contributed NKr58m to total net interest income. The bank said that, as a percentage of total assets, first-quarter net interest income rose to 2.28 per cent from 2.04 per cent a year earlier. DnB said that the previously announced preferential share issue to raise NKr2.38bn will be launched in late May or early June, and that shareholders would soon receive a subscription offer.</p>

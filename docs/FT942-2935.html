			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / New currency details start to take shape Brazil's financial authorities have started to finalise details for the July 1 introduction of the country's new currency, the real, which is designed to tackle chronic inflation. According to Finance Ministry officials, the real will be secured by two 'anchors', designed to keep inflation out of the new currency, which will be backed by the country's foreign exchange reserves of about Dollars 40bn. First, the real will be linked at parity to the US dollar for an 'indeterminate period'. Second, release of the currency will be partly tied to pre-set money supply targets. These anchors are designed to give the government slightly more policy flexibility than previous economic stabilisation plans in the region, such as Argentina's. Argentina's so-called convertibility plan tied the Argentine currency explicitly to parity with the dollar, and forbade the central bank to issue local currency unless backed by dollar reserves. Changing the exchange rate requires legislation. Brazil is more complicated, officials say, because it faces presidential elections later this year. The present administration is trying to build into the plan policy alternatives for whichever of the two main candidates wins the elections. Brazil's economy is also more reliant on industrial exports, which would soon become uncompetitive if the currency became overvalued. According to private sector analysts, the link with the US dollar is likely to be kept in place until the end of the year. If the current election front runner, the left-wing leader Mr Lus Inacio Lula da Silva, retains his lead in the opinion polls and worried investors start to take capital out of the country, central bank officials say there are sufficient reserves to spend Dollars 1bn a month defending the currency for at least two years. Many details, including the money supply targets themselves, will be decided over the coming weeks. According to some estimates, the monetary base of about Dollars 3bn will treble.</p>

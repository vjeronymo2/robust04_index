			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS SEEKING DEAL WITH COUNTY ON ALICIA PARKWAY  </P> <P> A residents group in Laguna Niguel, angry that a section of Alicia Parkway  still is not built, will drop its suit over the matter if the county guarantees  construction will begin within eight months, a group spokesman said Thursday.  </P> <P> But a county official said the group may be asking for more than the county can  promise.  </P> <P> At issue is a 1987 agreement between a housing developer in Laguna Niguel and  the county, in which the developer pledged to complete Alicia Parkway from  Pacific Park Drive to Aliso Creek Road.  </P> <P> The citizens group charges that the developer still is not doing anything to  finish the artery, which the group says would help relieve traffic congestion  in the area.  </P> <P> "Right now, the county's agreement is only giving us a road that's on paper,"  said Paul Christiansen, president of the Laguna Niguel Taxpayers Assn. "We  don't want just another paper road in south Orange County. We have too many of  those already."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8-Month Deadline Sought  </P> <P> Christiansen said the residents' group is demanding that the county set a  deadline of eight months from now for work to begin. If the county cannot get  that guarantee, it should rescind its contract with the developer, Shapell  Industries of Beverly Hills, he said.  </P> <P> The Laguna Niguel Taxpayers Assn., which has about 80 members, sued the county  in May, charging it with breach of contract in its agreement with Shapell. In  exchange for county approval for the 1,232-acre Country Village development in  Laguna Niguel, Shapell pledged to build the missing segment of Alicia Parkway.  </P> <P> The group won a default judgment on July 25 because the county failed to  respond to the suit. Deputy County Counsel Edward N. Duran said that the  failure to respond was an oversight and that he has petitioned Orange County  Superior Court to set aside the default judgment. The matter is scheduled to be  heard Aug. 18 before Judge William F. Rylaarsdam. In the meantime, Duran and  Christiansen are scheduled to meet next Thursday to discuss terms of a possible  settlement.  </P> <P> Christiansen said his group also would require that the county obtain consent  from the federal government within 90 days for Alicia Parkway to extend over  federal land at the Chet Holifield Federal Building at Avila Road.  </P> <P> Duran said Thursday that he had not yet seen the group's proposed settlement  terms. But, he said, "it does seem like a lot to ask. . . . I'm not sure that  it's possible for the county to promise some of those things."  </P> <P> Both Christiansen and county officials said the federal government is literally  a roadblock in the plans to complete Alicia Parkway. A key stretch of the  missing link would cross federal land at the federal building, known as the  Ziggurat.  </P> <P> And an official of the federal General Services Administration recently told  the county that the government is considering expanding the building and  therefore does not want to yield land for highway construction.  </P> <P> Christiansen said that the county knew all along that federal approval was  needed for use of the land and that, therefore, the county never should have  entered into the contract with Shapell.  </P> <P> "The contract has been a sham all along," Christiansen said. "They promised us  a highway that may never be built."  </P> <P> He charged that Shapell has been able to proceed with large-scale residential  development "while all the taxpayers of this area get is more traffic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> $7 Million for Expansion Work  </P> <P> A spokesman for Shapell Industries last week dismissed similar criticism from  Christiansen. The spokesman said Shapell had spent $7 million for expansion  work on Moulton Parkway and Alicia Parkway since 1987.  </P> <P> Christiansen, however, said he sees no evidence of construction on Alicia  Parkway. He reiterated his belief that the contract should be investigated by  the county grand jury.  </P> <P> "What we have in this contract is a real can of worms," he said.  </P></p>

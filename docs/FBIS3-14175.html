			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Iran's commerce minister, Mr. Yahya ol-Eshaq, met  with his Syrian counterpart, Mr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, in Damascus  yesterday and discussed bilateral trade relations with him. In  the meeting, the need for expansion of trade ties and exchange  of goods between the two countries was stressed. The two sides  also agreed that two separate committees--comprising commercial  experts of Iran and Syria--be formed to survey practical ways of  promoting commercial cooperation between Tehran and Damascus.    Another important point is that Iran and Syria--as two  powerful states of the Persian Gulf and the Middle East--play a  sensitive and strategic role in the trend of events in the two  regions. They also have relatively common viewpoints on the  events taking place in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East.  Based on this matter and also due to common stands of the two  sides on such vital political issues as the compromise deal on  Gaza and Jericho and occupation of south Lebanon by the Zionist  regime, it is essential that the scope of political ties be  expanded to also cover the domain of commercial relations.    During his December visit to Syria, Iran's first vice  president, Dr. Habibi, met and conferred with President Hafiz  al-Asad and also Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam. In the  meetings, Dr. Habibi pointed out that Iran has constantly backed  stands of Syria as a country in the front line of combat with  the Zionist regime. From the standpoint of the Islamic Republic  of Iran, this support or consensus between Tehran and Damascus  is viewed to be an unavoidable necessity under the sensitive  conditions currently prevailing in the Middle East region.  Significantly, since the start of the so called Arab-Israel  peace talks process, Syria has been under extreme pressure from  America and its allies so as to divert it from the principled  stand and to force it into accepting the compromise agreements  brokered by America and Israel.    Dr. Habibi, who had led high-ranking political and economic  delegation to Syria--besides conferring with the key Syrian  officials on political events in the region and the world--also  spoke of the need for establishing and developing trade  relations between the two states. Hence it is imagined that the  Monday visit of Iran's commerce minister to Damascus aims at  pursuing the earlier agreements on commercial exchanges and  including practical ways to implement them.    In general, regarding to Tehran and Damascus, it can be said  that politics and economy are in fact two sides of a coin.  Hence, enhancement of relations in one sphere makes the  expansion of trade exchanges unavoidable. Talks of Iran's  commerce minister with the Syrian officials too--in view of the  commercial side of these relations--have duly stressed the  bolstering of economic ties.</p>

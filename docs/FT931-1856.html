			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Setbacks to spending curb on legal aid THE GOVERNMENT'S proposals for curbing the rise in legal-aid spending suffered two setbacks yesterday. The Law Society won leave in the High Court to challenge the proposal of Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, to replace hourly-based fees with standard fees for criminal legal-aid work in magistrates' courts. The Commons home affairs committee said the Lord Chancellor's plans to cut legal aid eligibility would deprive people access to justice. The MPs called for a full day's debate in the Commons on Lord Mackay's proposals. The High Court was told that Lord Mackay's decision to introduce standard fees went against the principle in the 1988 Legal Aid Act that a solicitor would receive 'fair remuneration' for a case. Mr Michael Beloff, QC for the society, said Lord Mackay's 'desire for economy' had overridden the need to act both lawfully and rationally. The regulations relating to standard fees are due for implementation on June 1. Granting the society leave for an urgent hearing, Mr Justice Macpherson said: 'I firmly believe there is a case which should be argued. It is most unfortunate that there should be litigation between the largest of the two branches of the law and the head of the judiciary.' The Commons home affairs committee report said the proposed cuts in legal aid eligibility, designed to save Pounds 43m in the legal aid budget in 1993-94, Pounds 110m in 1994-95 and Pounds 175m in 1995-96, should have been preceded by a cost-benefit analysis of their effect across the range of public spending. MPs say it is important to determine why legal-aid costs are rising so rapidly. This must be complemented by an inquiry into the scope for savings and efficiency gains in the way legal services are delivered and courts run. They call for a government commitment to restore the eligibility cuts in real terms once other savings are found. They also recommend that the plan to abolish free legal advice under the green form scheme for those with a disposable income of more than Pounds 61 a week should be changed to allow those with disposable income just above that figure to continue to receive advice with a contribution. The government has already taken a decision to retain the contributory green form scheme in Scotland and MPs say they see no justification for treating people in England and Wales differently.</p>

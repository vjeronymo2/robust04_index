			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Colombian President Cesar Gaviria in Santa Fe de </F> Bogota -- live relay]    [Text] Fellow citizens, at noon today I addressed the  nation via a radio network to outline the national government's  position in connection with a declaration that the State Council  issued last night regarding the presence of foreign troops in  the national territory. I do not want to take up a lot of your  time, but I want to summarize the positions I outlined, with the  certainty that you will share your president's position on this  issue, which has awakened the whole country's interest.    Yesterday I learned, calmly but with some surprise, about  the  communique issued by the State Council, in which the Council  members state they are not satisfied with the arguments that I  outlined in connection with the legal basis which allows  military personnel from other countries to conduct joint  exercises with Colombian military forces, in compliance with old  practices and based on international agreements.    It is deplorable that the sound legal document I  respectuflly  forwarded to that judicial organization a few days ago resulted  in the issuance of a press communique which lacks legal grounds,  and about which I had to learn through the media instead of  through the proper channels -- as if it were more important to  create an atmosphere of public opinion than to stictly carry out  a legal procedure. This attitude contrasts with the one I  assumed toward the State Council, to which I submitted all  explanations in a detailed and reserved manner, aware of the  implications that this debate has for our country -- both at  national and international levels.    I received the news with the tranquility of knowing that  this  type of operation is necessary, useful, and timely for Colombia.  I also felt confident that the juridical arguments, which the  State Council rejected, are solid; that the decisions adopted do  not violate the Constitution that now includes, through this  government's leadership, the great changes that Colombian  society demanded for many years for its political organization.    I believed, and still believe, it was necessary to  strengthen  control mechanisms and give congress the tools to fulfill its  function of supervising the executive branch's actions. Hence,  we will be ready to provide the explanations that Congress, the  organization to which the State Council decided to forward this  issue, considers pertinent -- with the assurance they will not  be disregarded with the stroke of a pen. Instead, they will be  carefully and calmly analyzed.    Judging from the laconic statement issued by the judicial  organization, it seems the State Council has given this  constitutional disposition a significance it evidently does not  have. The idea is to claim that there is an obligation to  request that the Senate or State Council authorize the transit  of foreign troops in our country; this means that this  authorization must be obtained to allow the arrival of any  foreign military personnel in Colombia -- regardless of their  purpose.    An interpretation like this leads to the absurdity of  demanding permission for the arrival of military attaches that  dozens of other countries have in Colombia, just as we have  attaches in dozens of other countries. Similarly, a joint  intelligence operation for capturing a criminal would require a  prior Senate meeting and statement. Also, old and existing  international agreements, such as the Inter-American Reciprocal  Assistance Agreement and the 1952 Military Assistance Agreement,  would cease to exist as if by magic and Colombia would feel free  to violate them.    The State Council's statement is not judicial in nature. It  simply reports a fact to Congress. It is worth mentioning that  all documents have been provided by the government. The  judicial body has said only that it finds them unconvincing. As  a consequence of this decision, the State Council admits it  lacks authority to assess the alleged violation of the  Constitution and take the proper action, all of which is up to  the Congress.    The State Council's statement is not legal in nature. It is  rather political. The baseness of the Council's assertions and  the Council president's argument that a little school can be  built by Colombian artisans do not deserve an answer.    As long as an authoritative organization does not announce a  ruling, we will continue to endorse international cooperation  and the joint exercises that the government regards as essential  to improve our military forces. In addition, this cooperation  and exercises are based on international agreements that the  Congress has ratified. These exercises are but part of these  agreements.    The State Council's opinion also casts doubts on the  cooperation, intelligence, and advisors vital in the fight  against criminal drug trafficking organizations. For this  reason, the radical interpretation contained in the State  Council's press communique only benefits drug traffickers and  weakens our capability for confronting crime.    Colombians: I admit other people's right to disagree with  the  joint exercises on Colombia's Pacific coast. Nevertheless, I  cannot overlook a minor legal interpretation that would force us  to cancel other operations indispensable to defending the  country from crime and drug trafficking.    The government has admitted that there are gaps in reports  released to the public. This perhaps has led a number of people  to criticize the military cooperation under way with the United  States. In the specific instance of Juanchaco, I regard as  necessary the emphasis that the foreigners therein are military  engineers who, paid by the U.S. Government, are conducting a  military engineering exercise in conjunction with the Colombian  Armed Forces. It is just a matter of teaching and practicing,  sharing technical construction techniques in tropical areas, and  solving logistics and communications problems which our men  would eventually have to cope with in various situations.    But instead, if wasting that energy building things that  are useful, they devote it to civic and solidarity objectives.  The school, the health center, the road are only byproducts of  that joint military engineering training, which will by the way  benefit the region and community.    U.S. military engineers are in an area totally controlled by  the Colombian National Navy and are working under the  supervision of military forces. We have conducted diverse joint  actions with the U.S. Government to improve and make more  efficient the operations of our public forces. We have obtained  various technologies, embodied in the radar guided and operated  by Colombians, and for which U.S. personnel offer advice and  maintenance.    We have carried out joint engineering exercises for the  construction of different projects. Today in the United States  there are close to 100 Colombian soldiers participating in  operations similar to those now being questioned in Colombia,  and no one even thinks that the presence of those personnel  there endangers the sovereignty of that country.    In all this debate there are at least two contradictions.  The first is to think that the search for better training and  greater efficiency of the Colombian public force violates our  sovereignty, when in reality it is aimed at guaranteeing our  sovereignty. Sovereignty would be in greater danger in a country  in the hands of criminals and drug traffickers, in a state  without the capacity to respond to criminal activity, or in a  state confused by hundreds of clandestine flights of foreign and  national aircraft involved in drug trafficking, than in a state  that relies on international cooperation to guarantee law and  the legitimate exercise of its citizens' rights.    We have requested support from the international community  in  the courageous struggle that we Colombians have waged against  the large drug trafficking organizations, and it is surprising  that we now say that this jeopardizes our sovereignty. As  someone once said, international cooperation is not represented  by pats on the back but by training and logistical support,  among other things.    Sovereignty is not a rhetorical concept defended in speeches  in public squares at a campaign rally or by making a small fuss  over anti-U.S. chauvinism, opportunistic nationalism, or  populism. Our independence in international relations is open  to the scrutiny of all. It is measured by the way in which we  have acted in different international forums, the way in which  our representatives have voted at the UN, the OAS, and other  multilateral organizations. It is measured by our active  participation in groups such as the Nonaligned Movement or the  Group of 77. It is measured by the establishment of relations  with Cuba. In sum, it is measured by the real and permanent  dynamics that have placed Colombia in a position of leadership  in Latin America.    Citizens: Sovereignty is defended by facing with courage the  enemies of the fatherland, those who affect the security of  citizens, those who abuse and violate our territory, our rivers,  our sea, our airspace to further their criminal activities.  Sovereignty is not an hypothetical concept. It is not a simple  dead letter in our laws or the Constitution. We are more  sovereign when we are able to exercise more control. We are  more sovereign when we strengthen the capacity of the Armed  Forces of Colombia to fulfill their duty to defend the security  and safety of the country. We are more sovereign when we obtain  the support of allies who support us in our struggle against  those who do not have a fatherland, who kill our women and  children, our decent people. That is defending sovereignty.    Those who claim to be nationalistic and cry out loud about  the alleged violation of our sovereignty by permitting the  presence of technicians and military engineers from other  countries are dead wrong. Our enemies are powerful. In order  that we might defeat them, it is not enough to rely on our own  technology, abilities, and calls for sacrifices. We need  solidarity and support.    What would have come of Europe if its leaders had not formed  an alliance to fight the threat of Hitler? Also, what would  have come of Colombia if we had rejected international aid in  our struggle against the then-called Medellin Cartel?    Would we be more free, more sovereign, more independent,  living under the tyranny of Escobar's narcoterrorism? Would we  be more free, more sovereign, more independent, allowing our  airspace to be violated by criminals from all countries and all  ilks? Would we be more independent, more free, more sovereign,  allowing drug traffickers to have all the technological advances  at their disposal while we seek refuge under our modest  technical means and renounce international help?    The president does not think so. Therefore, until 7 August,  when my mandate ends, I will continue with my efforts to broaden  our democracy, modernize our country, suppress poverty and  injustice, and untiringly confront those who generate  destabilization and fear until they are brought to their knees.  I will not hesitate -- out of fear of a debate -- in making or  supporting decisions, such as the one being debated, within the  framework of the Constitution, which this government knows well,  as long as I believe that it serves said purposes which are  shared by the majority of Colombians who prefer to open up to  the future rather than hold on to the past.    Good night, and many thanks.</p>

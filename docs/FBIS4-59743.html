			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Muhammad Shuqayr: "Ruling Out of Syrian-Lebanese </F> Meeting Reactivates Local Mediations"]    [Excerpts] Beirut -- The ruling out of a Lebanese-Syrian  meeting to find a way out of the seclusion [staying away from  office] which Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri started last Sunday  [8 May] -- contrary to most ministers' expectation that Syrian  Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam would arrive any minute --  has caused brokers to resume their mediation between the state  leaders in a bid to secure a solution, turn the seclusion page,  and pave the way for a revival of cooperation between the  legislative and procedural authorities on the one hand and  President Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister al-Hariri on the  other. [passage omitted]    One minister told AL-HAYAH that "since the political crisis  erupted in Beirut Damascus has avoided taking part in the  campaigns or focusing light on the dispute, either through its  official media services or sources in Lebanon."    The minister adds: "We had thought that the Syrian vice  president would head directly for Beirut after his return from  Johannesburg, or that the three leaders [president, prime  minister, and Chamber of Deputies speaker] would go to Damascus  to search for a solution to the crisis. I was surprised by the  Syrian leadership's announcement the moment the crisis started  that it has nothing to do with the conflict and that it prefers  not to intervene in favor of any party. Damascus believes that  for the three leaders to reach an understanding is the guarantee  for bringing an end to the political conditions resulting from  the prime minister's seclusion. It will make no move as long as  the estrangement among the three leaders persists. It continues  to stress the need to reach an understanding and an agreement,  saying that it will support such an agreement." [passage  omitted]    A leading Lebanese figure who visited Damascus recently says  that "as the Syrian leadership is preparing to receive  Christopher -- if the date of the visit is not changed -- it  refuses to exploit what is happening among its most prominent  allies in Lebanon, as though it wants to send a message to  Washington to the effect that it is capable of getting hold of  the Lebanese card in both thick and thin."    The leading Lebanese figure adds: "For this reason, it has  decided not to intervene to exercise its mediation ability and  to bring an end to it, lest it is said it is behind the crisis.  Besides, the regional concern, with which it is preoccupied  fully, prompts it to control the situation, especially as the  dispute is among allies." [passage omitted]</p>

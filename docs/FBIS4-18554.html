			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Deric Henderson, PRESS ASSOCIATION News] </F>   [Excerpts] The Government today flatly rejected intensified  Sinn Fein demands for direct talks.    Amid efforts by republicans for direct dialogue, the IRA's  72-hour ceasefire was still holding tonight.    Sinn Fein chairman Tom Hartley delivered a letter to Downing  Street urging Mr Major to authorise talks in the wake of the  Downing Street declaration. The leader of the political wing of  the IRA said of the ceasefire: "This initiative should be built  upon. It is a step forward in the development of a real peace  process and deserves an imaginative response from the British  Government."    Mr Hartley said there had to be a desire to break new ground  on all sides of the political divide. There had to be no  preconditions in the arena of openness and imagination. He  added: "The IRA initiative and Sinn Fein's peace strategy is  evidence that this type of thinking exists in Republican ranks.  It would be a mistake to believe that it is only the grand  gesture which unlocks conflict. On the contrary, it is the small  moves which are the motor for change."    Although the letter will be studied at Downing Street, the  Government repeated its earlier insistence that direct dialogue  could not take place until there was a permanent end to violence.    A spokesman said: "The Government position is clear. We are  not negotiating with them and we are not going to clarify the  joint declaration. They know what needs to be done, a  renunciation of violence."    Unionist MPs rejected the so-called truce as a cynical ploy  by the terrorists to put pressure on London.    And the east Belfast Democratic Unionist MP Mr Peter  Robinson  claimed Sinn Fein and the Government were in secret contact  again, and said London would eventually cave in to the Sinn Fein  demands for clarification.    Ulster Unionist leder Mr James Molyneaux said the ceasefire  was "utterly contemptible" and accused the SDLP [Social  Democratic Labour Party] leader John Hume of being "the actor's  voice" of Gerry Adams. [passage omitted]    Although the level of security on the streets of Belfast  today appeared to drop, police and troops remained vigilant.  One soldier on duty in the city centre said: "The situation  hasn't changed. I don't feel any more relaxed. I just don't  trust them (the IRA)."    Republicans staged a series of protest pickets outside RUC  [Royal Ulster Constabulary] stations tonight and one was also  held at the gates of the British Embassy in Dublin, which Irish  Foreign Affairs Minister Dick Spring dismissed as a "cheap and  odious."</p>

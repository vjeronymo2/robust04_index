			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The scheme to  reinforce the Armed Forces in South Korea, on top of tens of  thousands of U.S. troops and up-to-date means of war deployed  there, shows that the United States has not abandoned its  intention to stifle the DPRK by military strength, taking issue  with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK, says NODONG  SINMUN in a commentary today. Noting that the United States is  reinforcing the aggression forces in South Korea, crying for  "the increase of the capability of the U.S. forces in South  Korea to counter a surprise attack by North Korea," the analyst  says:    The U.S. seeks to find an excuse to pursue the policy of  stifling the DPRK in kicking up a dust over the non-existent  "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    The U.S. Forces in South Korea and in Japan are the main  lever in executing its Asia-Pacific policy. U.S. arms buildup  in South Korea is motivated by the strategic aim to strengthen  its domination over Asia and the Pacific with force.    "North Korea's surprise attack" advertised by the United  States is nothing but a sophism to justify arms buildup in South  Korea.    The United States' reinforcement of armament in South Korea  poses a serious threat to the peace and security of the Korean  peninsula and the Asian-Pacific region.    The United States must stop arms buildup in South Korea, not  ignoring the desire of the people in this region for  independence and peace.</p>

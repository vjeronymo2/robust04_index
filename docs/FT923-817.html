			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Sculptor of scandal EPSTEIN: ARTIST AGAINST THE ESTABLISHMENT by Stephen Gardiner Michael Joseph Pounds 20, 532 pages STEPHEN Gardiner's new biography of Epstein (1880-1959) is a rich and monumental history, compressing into the life of this extraordinary, immensely energetic man a vivid slice of some of this century's most important social and artistic history. We begin in New York with Epstein's father, a Polish immigrant who changed the family name from Barntovsky to Epstein and made his fortune as a property developer. From sketching the multi-racial characters of the Lower East Side, Epstein moved to Paris, where he befriended Modigliani, Brancusi and Picasso, and learned to sculpt. It was the British Museum's Egyptian collection, which was to inflect Epstein's work with some of its most ethereal images, which finally made him settle in London. Here he made friends, with Augustus John, Matthew Smith and TE Hulme, as well as enemies. Scandal never left him. His first big commission, the Oscar Wilde tomb in the Pere Lachaise cemetery in Paris, was covered and put under arrest by the gendarmerie upon its unveiling in 1914. It was Epstein's first encounter with the philistinism which was to plague his career, leading to regular defacings of his sculpture, anti-Semitic attacks in the press, even to his works appearing among the shrunken heads and Siamese twins of a freak show on Blackpool pier. Professional jealousies were another discomfort, especially from London's artistic old guard. Epstein was good but, with typical chutzpah, knew it. While still in his early thirties he had finished the Wilde tomb; unveiled, to howls of abuse, his frieze of nude figures on the new BMA building in the Strand (now Zimbabwe House - the figures were destroyed by the Rhodesian High Commission in 1936); and was the most sought after avant-garde sculptor of the day. He was harried mercilessly, not least during the First World War when opposition in the highest circles to his being exempted from the Front as a war artist led to his conscription, his desertion, and a nervous breakdown on Dartmoor. Gardiner, who knew Epstein in later life, carries on the family feuds with Eric Gill, with Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury Group, who looked down on this working-class American Jew and never gave him a good review, and with Henry Moore who, encouraged by Epstein early on, never returned the compliment and obstructed many posthumous installations of his works. Epstein single-mindedly followed his artistic destiny while his personal life went mad around him. Margaret Dunlop divorced her husband to care for him. She took in and accepted the human menagerie of models, mistresses and artist friends which enveloped Epstein wherever he went and which scandalised polite society as much as his sculptures. His great passions were first for Meum Lindsell-Stewart, a delicious blonde by whom he had a daughter, and then Kathleen Garman, who remained his constant companion throughout his life. Unlike his other models, his love for Kathleen proved so threatening to his wife, who was slowly dying from heart disease, that she shot her with a pistol, only for them both to make up and continue with their menage a trois for the sake of Epstein's genius. He had four children by Kathleen and one by an unknown woman. But what of his work? It was a career which took in numerous portraits, religious works such as the Lazarus now in New College Chapel, Oxford, and the Saint Michael and the Devil at Coventry Cathedral, the pagan hymn to life of the Bowater Group in Knightsbridge, the abstract Rock-Drill which inspired the Vorticist movement of Pound and Wyndham Lewis, and many remarkable drawings. Why was it that Epstein's work evoked, and still evokes, such powerful reactions of admiration or disgust? Gardiner is brilliant at communicating the power and message of Epstein's best work, but he unhelpfully passes over the work which fails to succeed. There are also too few photographs to help the reader decide. In other words, this is not the true critical biography it should be, but it is a unputtable-down, absorbing tribute to one of the greatest artists of modern times.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Afghans still waiting to win the peace: Little progress a year after the country's civil war ended IN HERAT, visiting dignitaries fete local leader Mr Ismael Khan as chief of the 'north-west kingdom of Afghanistan.' In north central Mazar-i-Sharif, nothing gets done without permission from kingpin Mr Rashid Dostum. And in eastern Jalalabad, Governor Abdul Qadir serves at the good grace of kingmaker Pakistan. A year after an Islamic revolution ended its 14-year civil war, Afghanistan's disintegration has accelerated. Its strongest guerrilla forces continue to battle for control of Kabul, allowing the rest of the nation to spin off into mostly peaceful independent fiefdoms. These, like most people outside the region, long ago lost interest in the relentless killing in Kabul, which intensified yesterday as guerrilla groups launched a pre-dawn bombardment. Mr Sayed Jaffer Naderi, governor of the northern province of Baghlan, declares of leaders in the capital: 'They don't care about us, so we don't care about them.' Mr Naderi is part of a federation led by Mr Dostum, called the National Movement of Afghanistan. 'In a year, they couldn't even design a national flag,' Mr Naderi continues. 'What can we expect they will do for this country?' The end of the Afghan war in April last year was supposed to signal the return of more than 5m Afghan refugees from Iran and Pakistan. Instead most remain in exile, and the rebels' latest attempt to settle their problems - an accord signed in March - has all but fallen apart. The main antagonists in the continued fighting are the prime minister-designate, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the defence minister, Mr Ahmed Shah Masood. Their mutual emnity runs deep. Since Mr Masood is Kabul's most powerful single figure, Mr Hekmatyar won't risk entering it, and instead fires rockets to get Mr Masood out. His forces were thought responsible for most of the rockets and shells which rained on the capital yesterday. One Afghan surveying the damage in another recent attack said: 'The only way to solve Afghanistan's problem is to put all the leaders on a plane and shoot it down.' Indeed, little can be said for the leadership of President Berhannudding Rabanni. There is an almost incapacitation of public services. Roads do not get fixed, and travelling outside Kabul is like traversing a moonscape. Electricity is regularly severed to Kabul - opponents blame Mr Hekmatyar - and that shuts off the water supply as well. Violence and intimidation has increased against western relief workers as well. In February, four United Nations employees were executed at a roadside near Jalalabad. The UN and the French organisation Medecins sans Frontieres this spring shut its offices in northern Kunduz, complaining of threats by Arab relief agencies there and robberies. Some Afghans are so fed up that they are longing for the old days under the pro-Moscow government of President Najibullah. At a checkpoint along the road from Jalalabad to Kabul, an armed man boarded a bus and, seeing foreigners, shouted: 'Long live Najibullah. As long as we lack strong leadership, there will be war.' The northern fiefdom run by Mr Dostum and Mr Naderi, in comparison, is a model of peace which has kept more foreign missions open in Mazar-i-Sharif than in Kabul. The fact that Mr Dostum and Mr Naderi operate something of a secular enclave that is a haven for members of the former communist government rankles those fighting it out in Kabul. But this has not caused much despair in the north. 'Everyone says we are not Moslem,' says Mr Naderi. 'But we're watching while they keep fighting in Kabul and call each other kafir (heretic). We don't know who is a kafir any more.'</p>

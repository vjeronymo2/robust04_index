			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Cuba tipped as holiday hot spot TWO LARGE travel companies yesterday designated Cuba as the next mass-market holiday destination and announced programmes which will immediately quadruple the number of UK visitors to the island. Airtours, the second-largest tour operator, is offering two-week holidays at the beach resort of Varadero from next May, with prices from Pounds 299 to Pounds 1,399. Mr Richard Carrick, Airtours marketing director, said the resort had several foreign-managed hotels. Mr Carrick refused to say how many holidaymakers Airtours would take to Cuba. He said, however, that the company would offer weekly charter flights from Gatwick via Manchester to Varadero from early May to mid-October. This suggests that Airtours plans to fly about 8,000 travellers to Cuba during this period. Mr Carrick said the programme would be extended into the winter if it proved successful. Unijet, another tour operator, said it also intended to announce a programme to Cuba. Mr Chris Parker, Unijet chairman, said the company planned to take 1,000 holidaymakers to Cuba next year and hoped to increase its capacity to 3,000 a year. Mr Carrick said authoritative statistics were not available, but an estimated 3,000 UK residents were thought to have visited Cuba last year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 24 (AFP) -- The president of the Iraqi  National Assembly, Sa'di Mahdi Salih, on Thursday [24 March]  asked France to open an office in Baghdad, taking another step  forward in improving Franco-Iraqi relations.    Acknowledging a recent improvement in relations between  Paris  and Baghdad, Salih told AFP: "It is necessary that France takes  a step forward and responds to the initiative that Iraq has  taken."    Bagdad opened an office in Paris in September, the first  since the two countries broke off diplomatic relations in  February 1991 during the Gulf war.    Salih is leading a delegation of five Iraqi parliamentarians  attending the 91st UNESCO interparliamentary conference taking  place in Paris.    The recent developments in French policy towards Iraq have  been "very positive," Salih said, as much in the recent string  of visits between the two countries as in its recent  "moderation" of its stance on Iraq as a member of the UN  Security Council.    Salih said he was to meet French parliamentary speaker  Philippe Seguin Friday and that he had had "other contacts" in  Paris.    Iraq has been fighting hard to get the UN embargo on Iraqi  oil sales lifted -- only to see it reimposed by the UN Security  Council last week.    "There is no further justification for the embargo," Salih  said, stressing the hardship it was causing the Iraqi people who  "are starving to death."    During the course of the Iraqi's visit to Paris, which has  raised protests from the Iraqi opposition abroad, French oil  groups Total and Elf Aquitaine have held discussions with Iraqi  officials over plans to develop two oil fields in southern Iraq  once the UN embargo is lifted.    In New York Wednesday, the UN said it was planning a series  of missions to Iraq to develop controls on its long-term  military potential before there could be any question of lifting  the oil sales embargo.</p>

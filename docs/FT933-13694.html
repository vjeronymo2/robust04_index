			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rating recovery The contrast between this week's upbeat economic statistics and the sombre mood of the equity market is slightly unnerving. This is particularly so for those optimists who have been looking for the FT-SE 100 index to move decisively over 3,000. The real economy is clearly recovering, even when allowance is made for the fact that May's industrial production figures were badly distorted by bank holidays. The main impetus for economic growth is coming from manufacturing - especially in capital goods and exports. That cheering, if unlikely, news was followed by the lowest inflation rate for 30 years and best unit wage figures on record. Yet companies remain cautious and forecasts of this year's profits are not rising. Despite recovery, earnings may struggle to rise by 15 per cent and dividends may not increase by more than 3-4 per cent. Given Budget tax changes, institutions will see their dividend income fall this year. The equity market largely discounted recovery in the last quarter of 1992, and so far in 1993 the Pounds 8bn of rights issues, Pounds 1bn of enhanced scrip dividends, Pounds 3bn of new issues and BT3 have all been a drain on institutional and private investors' cash flow. Low inflation is also putting pressure on the margins of companies close to consumer markets. That squeeze will pass back down the chain to manufacturers. The stock market may be able to live with a higher rating if inflation is low, but companies have yet to prove they can deliver the earnings to justify the price.</p>

			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Arts: A Victorian lesson for 2000 - Architecture The contrast could hardly be greater than between the state of Britain at the end of the 19th century and its condition today. It is especially interesting, therefore, to look at what architecture of that period was trying to express. In 1900 Britain was coming to the end of a colossal wave of public and municipal building in the capital and the provinces. Law courts, public libraries, police stations, boarding schools, polytechnics, cathedrals and universities were being built throughout the land. In London the Imperial College of Science, the Victoria and Albert Museum, County Hall, the extension to the British Museum and the Old Bailey were all built between 1890 and the turn of the century. Architectural competitions were commonplace and the 10,700 architects on the census return of 1901 were all fully employed within Britain and its empire. Today there are around 25,000 architects and more than a third are unemployed. After two world wars and the end of a great empire, there is almost no significant public building programme. A great project, such as the Channel Tunnel, is likely to be left with no grand terminal and there are unlikely to be public funds for significant building projects to mark the millennium. These thoughts are prompted by a fascinating exhibition that has just opened in London of the work of Arthur Beresford Pite (1861-1934). The exhibition, at the Royal Institute of British Architects Heinz Gallery, has been sponsored by The Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture, Price Waterhouse and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Pite is a forgotten figure, his reputation overshadowed by great contemporaries such as Sir Edwin Lutyens and Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He was a teacher and practitioner and his words, when he spoke at Riba in 1900, could easily have been spoken today. 'When the lamp went out, there was no residuum of framework or principle, only the inchoate notion of the wild but real beauty of all old work and a new delight in an unaffected stylessness of difficult simplicity.' Pite was worried that the craftsmanship he admired in architects and designers such as William Morris and Philip Webb could never be adequate for the demands of 20th century building. Pite's own work  -and his built oeuvre is quite small - shows that he brought an intense and odd individuality to his designs while trying to link them to established traditions. He was not looking for history to copy. He wanted his work to be based upon what he called 'intelligent archaeology' to provide modern architecture with a 'vitalising background', which he rightly felt was missing. Pite was a brilliant draughtsman, so this exhibition is well worth seeing for the quality of his drawings alone. He leapt to fame on the strength of one remarkable drawing, 'A design for a West End Club House', which won him the Soane Medallion in 1882 and was exhibited at the Royal Academy that year. It is a wild gothic fantasy with overtones of Nuremburg and Albrecht Durer. It has a magical quality that was rarely to appear in his built works. His drawing skill led him naturally to become a good designer of patterns for materials and of furnishings. His surviving buildings are few and mainly in London. Christ Church, Brixton Road in south London, is an extraordinary Byzantine Romanesque structure, cruciform in plan, with a broad dome. The triumph of the interior is the inscription by the great lettering designer Edward Johnston. This lettering covers the pendentives of the dome and is so well spaced and organised that its appearance convinces you that what it says is true. Pite's architecture has that same kind of integrity. It convinces by the boldness of its experimentation. Look at his London, Edinburgh and Glasgow Assurance building in Euston Square, which is next door to the Greek neo-classical St Pancras church - Pite's building is designed to be a sympathetic neighbour. In his Marylebone houses, 37 and 48 Harley Street and 82 Mortimer Street, he brings sculpture and architecture together in a powerful combination. The great virtue of his building for the Institute of Chartered Accountants off Moorgate, which he designed with John Belcher, is that the whole facade is an exercise in sculptural architecture - much helped by the quality of the sculpture by Hamo Thorneycroft and Harry Bates. One of his most visible and enjoyable compositions is the Piccadilly end of the Burlington Arcade - notice the tiny sculptured figures nestling in the central volutes and the powerful, strange smiling giants that guard the entrance. Much of Pite's major work is abroad. He designed the Anglican cathedral at Kampala, a church at Entebbe in Uganda, and English churches in Safad, Bucharest, Warsaw and Jerusalem. He is a difficult architect but one that repays study. He is a classic example of turn of the century individualism and the lesson to be taken from his work and teaching is that it is possible to be experimental and contextually tactful at the same time. A good lesson for those architects who are still employed to remember in the year 2000. Riba Heinz Gallery, 21 Portman Square, London W1 (until October 23).</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Chiluba says he has received a letter of  resignation from Foreign Affairs Minister Mr. Vernon Mwaanga.  The president's special assistance for press and public  relations, Richard Sakala, said Mr. Chiluba appreciates the  circumstances under which Mr. Mwaanga has resigned. The  president says he will make a statement soon. Mr. Mwaanga  announced the resignation in Lusaka this morning, saying he  would like to give government time to investigate charges of  drug trafficking leveled against him from various quarters.    Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Socialist Party [RSP] has  described as courageous the move taken by former Foreign Affairs  Minister Mr. Mwaanga. RSP General Secretary (Baultis Sikakula)  also added that other leaders should follow Mr. Mwaanga's  suggestion that they resign to give [words indistinct] ample  evidence of their involvement in drug trafficking. Mr.  (Sikakula), however, cautioned the country against bowing to  pressure from (?foreign countries) in dealing with the matter.</p>

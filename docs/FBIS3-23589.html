However, people in uniform are in a special position  -- as if under the dual burden that is associated with the  rigors and deprivations of army service.    At the same time, each of us knows very well that, during  the  last year and a half, the state has adopted an entire series of  measures to ensure the protection of servicemen and individuals  who have been released from military service from the most  severe social consequences of the initial stage of economic and  military reform. Believe me, it was simply impossible for the  government to do more under these conditions. And therefore we  must seek real paths for a solution from the dead end and cease  acting from a dependent position.    Within the framework of the president's legislation, edicts  and statutes that are in force, we need to seek opportunities to  attract outside budget resources for the construction of housing  and retraining of officer cadres for work in the national  economy under conditions of the market relations that are coming  into being, and the solution of other problems for which the  state simply does not have any money at the present time.    Any delay in this matter lessens the state's prestige and  creates the opinion among the majority of servicemen that the  state is incapable of providing a fitting existence for its  defenders. And the least steadfast -- as a rule, junior  officers, not seeing a solution from the unsettled nature of  everyday life, are beginning to be released from the army. By  way of illustration, approximately 10,000 Armed Forces junior  officers submitted requests for release last year. Forty percent  of the Ukrainian Security Services agents who have been released  this year did not serve until they earned the right to receive a  pension.    Our Committee has data that today 93% of officers  are not  satisfied with their material position and 71% are not  satisfied with their living conditions. On the whole, 88%  of  the servicemen polled feel that they are socially unprotected  and consider the impending release into the reserve to be a real  catastrophe for themselves and for their families.    While proceeding from the actual state of affairs at the  local level, we must admit that the level of socio-legal work at  the present time is not satisfying either the country's  leadership or those who have a right to expect aid and  assistance from the state.    What problems associated with this are the most urgent?    Despite the measures taken by the state, we have not managed  to achieve substantial progress in the solution of the housing  problem which has already passed into the category of  socio-political problems. Based upon the situation on 1 November  1993, there were 72,000 homeless military personnel in the  Ministry of Defense, 8,000 in the Border Troops, 34,000 in the  Ministry of Internal Affairs, more than 3,000 in the National  Guard, 2,000 in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] internal  troops, and approximately 1,000 in Civil Defense.    The situation is exacerbated by the presence of 29,000  homeless servicemen who have been released into the reserve. As  a result, according to our predictions the number of those  persons needing housing among this category of the population  will total over 160,000 people in 1994.    What solution do we see to the situation that has developed?    First of all, the attraction of outside budget sources of  financing along with the allocation of budget appropriations  toward the resolution of the housing problem. Already today  quite a few commercial banks and enterprises are sending the  Committee proposals to finance construction of housing for the  military departments under terms of the transfer to the investor  of 35% of the housing built in accordance with Ukrainian  Presidential Edict No. 240/93 dated 1 July 1993. The power  structures are only required to provide lots for the  construction and to participate in the design of the buildings  as a customer.    Last month, the "Transimpeks" Ukrainian-Russian Joint  Production-Commercial Venture, "Dobrobut" Stock Company,  "Logika" Small Enterprise, "Likvis" Joint Venture and "Ukraine"  Bank proposed that to us. Proceeding from that, right now the  Committee is developing the terms for the construction of two  100-apartment buildings for the SBU [Ukrainian Security Service]  and MVD in Kiev. We are studying the possibility of building  housing for the border guards and cottages for reserve officers  in Kiev Oblast and other oblasts of Ukraine.    The Ukrainian Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund, which was  founded at the Committee's initiative at the end of last year,  is rendering serious assistance in the search for additional  sources of financing. In a short time, regional branches of the  fund were created in all oblasts through the efforts of  Committee representatives. Having established contact with  business circles and the state administration, the Odessa,  Kharkov, Kirovograd and Donetsk branches of the fund have  created small and joint ventures in which servicemen work who  have been released into the reserve. A significant portion of  the profits from their activities is being directed to financing  the centers that have been created for retraining officers and  warrant officers who have been released into the reserve and  courses to teach the Ukrainian language.    Of course, for now we are talking about only the first steps  in this direction. But even right now the first results have  already been noted. By way of illustration, the Fund's Odessa  Branch has already attained sufficient strength to finance  construction of an apartment building. Another two of these  buildings are in the plans for the near future. The  Ivano-Frankovo Branch has financed joiner's work in a building  for servicemen's families. The Kirovograd Branch is investing in  cottage construction. The Kherson Branch is allocating  significant resources to assist large and needy families of  officers and warrant officers and is partially paying for  training of servicemen's children at paid educational  institutions.    The social adaptation of servicemen who have been released  into the reserve is a no less important problem. More than  60,000 officers, warrant officers and members of their families  will enter the job market already this year. By 1995, impending  Armed Forces reductions will add another 100,000 people to this  number.    It is impossible to say that this problem has only just now  emerged. It has always existed. However, until the present time  no one has been concerned about the fate of those officers and  warrant officers who were released into the reserve. There are a  number of definite aspects here. On the one hand, many  enterprises and organizations and educational institutions would  like to hire military pensioners to work for them, taking into  account their high professional level, work efficiency and  organization. On the other hand, each of the former military  members is independently seeking work for himself since there  still aren't any state guarantees for their retraining and  subsequent job placement.    For example, only four percent of the servicemen released in  the current year turned to the population employment service in  1993, in the process, harboring slim hopes for independently  finding appropriate jobs based upon their abilities and desires.    For the time being, retraining of servicemen is only  sporadic  in nature and does not match up either labor market requirements  or housing infrastructure plans for those military personnel who  have been released into the reserve.    Therefore, while beginning the State Servicemen's Social  Adaptation Program, the development of which was assigned to our  Committee by a 21 August 1993 Presidential Edict, we first of  all took into account these circumstances and also the fact that  there are outstanding possibilities for its successful  resolution. These are: good training facilities that exist in  practically every oblast, outstanding specialists and teachers,  and the interest in this issue of business circles, not only of  Ukraine, but also of the near and far abroad.    Among those who are ready already today to invest their  resources in retraining military personnel is the European  Community Organization which plans to allocate three million ecu  [European currency units]; the Soros Fund that is known in the  business world, England's Coventry University, the International  Institute of Management (Dean Fedor Ivanovich Poddubnyy),  "Dobrobut" Stock Company and many others.    While investing their resources in the resolution of  servicemen's social problems, business circles know that this  will not provide an immediate advantage. At the same time, the  money invested will serve to a certain extent as a guarantor of  the stabilization of the situation in the country by resolving  servicemen's social problems which, in turn, will promote peace  and tranquility in Ukraine. And, therefore, this will also  ensure success in the work of the business circles. This is the  first fact.    Second, well-retrained officer cadres will be able to  rapidly  adapt to the new situation and, through their labor, pay back  the resources that have been spent for their retraining.    And third. You will see, whom will dubious organizations and  criminal formations joyfully grab and receive? Military  personnel, including former agents of law enforcement organs  whom we have simply overlooked. And in the future, we do not  have the right to permit this under any circumstances whatsoever.    Therefore, already today the Committee is setting forth a  proposal to immediately create, (jointly with interested  ministries and departments), servicemen's retraining centers in  each oblast of Ukraine. It is advisable to create, based upon  our Committee, a single coordination center to predict the  number of officers released into the reserve, their professional  consultation and mandatory job placement.    The center must facilitate matters so that each serviceman,  a  year or two prior to release, clearly sees what awaits him in  the civilian sector -- where he can work with maximum output. We  will give him the right to select his future profession and  confidence in the future.    Of course, all of the problems of military pensioners are  not  reduced to the issue of social adaptation. There are many more  of them because the rights and privileges that they had in the  period of service do not extend to this category. The Committee  is receiving literally an avalanche of complaints about late  payment of pensions, which actually makes pensioners destitute,  about the lack of required medicines, and about the callousness  and indifference of the bureaucrats of the military and state  departments. The Committee has received legitimate rebukes from  the oblasts that attest to the fact that all of the targeted  resources from the state budget for construction of housing for  servicemen who have been released into the reserve have not been  utilized for their primary purpose. Specifically, Vinnitsa State  Administration, which has received 622 million karbovonets for  this purpose, has not built a single apartment for military  pensioners during the last two years...    We must direct attention to the fact that a socially  oppressed person is inclined toward inadequate deeds. We can  cite the example of that same Lieutenant Vladimir Zhukov from  Kovel who chained himself to the Supreme Soviet building as a  sign of protest against the lack of housing and an extremely low  monetary salary. An unprecedented rally of homeless servicemen  was conducted in Kiev in June. We can also recall the  self-seizure of homes in "tsarskoye selo" that was organized by  Kiev "Afghantsy" [Afghan veterans] and the picketing of the  Poltava Ispolkom [executive committee] building by military  pensioners.    The cause of these phenomena is the lack of social  protection  of servicemen and the consequences are a spilt of the army and  the dangerous involvement of the force structures in the  political confrontation.    Today much depends on which position the state's force  ministers and business circles take. Will they permit officers  who have despaired to stand under the banner of the dubious  "fighters for a better fate" and to use the army for the actual  destabilization of society and to disrupt the process of  economic reform; or will they help to create a harmonious system  of social protection, utilizing to the maximum extent possible  the material capabilities of the state and departments and also  outside budget resources. The success of the construction of an  independent democratic state of Ukraine largely depends on the  answer to that question.    Considering that the problems of this category of servicemen  will significantly deteriorate as a result of planned Armed  Forces reductions, the Committee considered it necessary to  introduce additional guarantees and rights on job placement and  social protection of those servicemen released into the reserve  to the draft proposals and changes to the Law of Ukraine "On the  Social and Legal Protection of Servicemen and Their Family  Members". Specifically, it provides for offering them work while  considering the specialty no later than after a one month  period, free professional training, rendering assistance in  providing places in children's preschool institutions and in  summer health camps to children of servicemen who have been  released into the reserve, and other proposals.    In the future, we will strive for the award of deserved  privileges to military pensioners. However, Ukrainian business  circles can make their contribution to the social protection of  this category of servicemen. This is a question not only of  one-time charitable acts but also of the creation of jobs for  veterans of the Armed Forces and assistance in the construction  of housing. We have formed the Officers Bank, which will assume  responsibility for the entire block of social and financial  problems associated with the execution of the articles of  Ukraine's State Budget for the military departments, and it will  also do its part in the resolution of this problem. We assume  that the central administration of this bank will be in Kiev,  branches will be in Odessa and Lvov and a peripheral  representative network will be in other oblast centers of  Ukraine and at large military garrisons.    Seeing reputable partners in the Fund and Officers Bank and  a  reliable guarantor of state support in the Committee, Ukrainian  business circles will mandatorily make contact and will invest  money in the resolution of these issues, knowing that they will  not "go broke".    We can count on success in this work only under the  condition  of the availability of good contacts and a mutual understanding  with the leadership of the force ministries and departments. It  is these interrelationships that the Committee has formed with  the leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the  Ukrainian Security Service, the Committee on Issues for the  Protection of the State Border, and the National Guard, whose  representatives, who have been temporarily assigned to us,  continue to defend in practice the legal interests of the  servicemen of their departments.    The very practice of work has shown that the Committee is an  important coordinating structure in the system of servicemen's  social guarantees. This is reflected in the 21 August 1993  Ukrainian Presidential Edict "On Urgent Measures to Reinforce  the Social Protection of Servicemen and Their Family Members"  that assigned to the Committee a number of very responsible  tasks for the development of two state programs and two draft  laws. And we handled these tasks thanks to close cooperation  with the interested ministries and departments.    The resolution of the social problems of servicemen,  pensioners and their family members with the attraction of  outside budget resources -- this is one aspect of the matter  that we can only begin today.    The other aspect is the support of our Committee and of the  sponsors of social programs from the Ukrainian government. In  our view, today the time has come for the Cabinet of Ministers  to examine the issue of the reduction of taxes on the profits of  enterprises, organizations, commercial and management structures  and on the sum of the resources invested in the Ukrainian  National Servicemen's Social Guarantees Fund or its regional  funds for the accomplishment of targeted programs for the  construction of housing and the retraining of servicemen who  have been released into the reserve.    It is also legitimate to pose the question on the  possibility  of the issuance of low-interest credits by the state to  enterprises and organizations that will be involved in the  realization of state programs for the social protection of  servicemen and their family members.    I have highlighted only the primary problems of the social  protection of servicemen. There are no more important tasks  right now than the reduction of social tension in military  collectives. And we need to concentrate all efforts toward that.</p>

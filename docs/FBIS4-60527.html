			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 25 May (MENA) -- The 26 May issue of  AL-MUSAWWAR reveals the true causes of death of lawyer  'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Madani, a member of the banned Muslim  Brotherhood group.    Chief Editor Makram Muhammad Ahmad published a copy of the  medical report on Madani's death. The report said: An  examination of the body of 'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Madani has  revealed that he died of an acute collapse [hubut had] of the  respiratory system and a failure of his lung capacity resulting  from acute asthma. No traces of injuries or visible fractures  or bruises were found on the body.    Dr. Suhayr 'Abd-al-Fattah, who conducted the examination of  the deceased lawyer's body, stressed to Makram Muhammad Ahmad in  a telephone interview that her signature on the medical report  reflects the true reasons and accounts leading to Madani's  death. She expressed concern about seeing her statement  published for fear that she "may be a target of the terrorist  groups," as she told AL-MUSAWWAR's chief editor. She added: I  have a father whose medical condition cannot tolerate the state  of anxiety he is going through out of concern for my life.    In his editorial, Ahmad says that after being arrested in  his  office in al-Haram neighborhood, Madani was being taken to his  home in the Warraq al-'Arab district of al-Jizah to be searched  when he experienced acute difficulty in breathing with  convulsions and then fainted. The accompanying officer radioed  his superiors to inform them of the situation. Their answer  was: There is no need to go to Warraq al-'Arab. Take him  immediately to al-Manyal Hospital for treatment. If necessary,  put him in the detainees' ward for treatment.    Ahmad emphasized that the internists made tremendous efforts  to save Madani's life, but he took his last breath at 1400 on 27  April; that is, 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital.</p>

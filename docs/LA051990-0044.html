			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INS AGENT CHARGED WITH MORE ASSAULTS;  </P> <P> CRIME: THREE LATINAS SAY THE OFFICER, ALREADY ACCUSED IN ONE ATTACK, APPROACHED  THEM WHILE HE WAS OFF-DUTY BUT DRIVING AN OFFICIAL CAR.  </P> <P> Five charges involving three additional victims were filed Friday against an  Immigration and Naturalization Service agent who earlier this week was charged  with abducting and raping an illegal immigrant after threatening to deport her.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged James Edward Riley  with one count of rape, two counts of kidnaping and one count each of false  imprisonment and assault by a police officer.  </P> <P> The 32-year-old agent pleaded not guilty to the charges before Van Nuys  Municipal Court Commissioner Rebecca Omens-Rochman on Friday. At the request of  Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Walmark, the commissioner ordered Riley held  without bail pending a May 25 preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> Riley already faces one count each of kidnap, rape and rape under color of law,  meaning he used his position as a federal agent to commit the crime, for  allegedly attacking a 24-year-old Sepulveda woman on April 11. He pleaded not  guilty to those charges on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Riley was arrested at 4:30 a.m. May 12 at his Reseda apartment after a  monthlong investigation that began after the woman reported to police that he  had abducted and raped her in his Reseda apartment. The woman said she was then  released.  </P> <P> The new charges stem from assaults dating to September, police say. In each  case, Riley allegedly approached a Latina on the street while he was off-duty  but driving his federal car. Police said that Riley, who is bilingual, showed  his INS badge and placed the woman under arrest after determining that she had  no green card or legal status for being in the United States.  </P> <P> The first attack allegedly occurred on Sept. 15. Riley is accused of kidnaping  a 31-year-old woman from a Pacoima street and raping her in his car, Walmark  said. The link to Riley came to light as police went through reports looking  for similar crimes, said James A. Baker, chief filing deputy in the Van Nuys  branch of the district attorney's office.  </P> <P> The other two victims were traced from clues found in Riley's apartment, Baker  said. The women were contacted by police and implicated Riley in the attacks.  </P> <P> The charges of false imprisonment and assault by a police officer stem from a  Jan. 9 incident in which Riley allegedly grabbed a 19-year-old woman in  Pacoima. The woman reported that Riley told her: "I want a date or you'll be  deported," Baker said. The woman slapped the man's face and fled, Baker said.  </P> <P> Another victim, a 20-year-old woman, told authorities that Riley grabbed her on  a Van Nuys street corner in February, told her she was under arrest and  handcuffed her. He drove her around in his car for several hours before  releasing her without having assaulted her, Baker said. The incident resulted  in a kidnaping charge against Riley.  </P> <P> During the attacks, Riley variously identified himself as an INS agent, a  customs agent or an undercover police officer, Baker said.  </P> <P> Riley, an INS agent since November, 1987, was assigned to the INS Employee  Sanctions Unit, which primarily audits records of companies to make sure they  are not employing illegal aliens, police said.  </P> <P> It was "not within his job description to stop and question persons on the  street," Baker added.  </P> <P> Riley is on leave while federal authorities investigate him.  </P> <P> The investigation was prompted April 12 when the Sepulveda woman made a rape  report several hours after she said the suspect had freed her. She has been the  only victim to voluntarily come forward to authorities and at times during the  investigation was reluctant to fully cooperate because of fear she would be  deported.  </P> <P> Police on Friday described the latest charges as the result of only the "first  wave" of the investigation. Detectives were looking for other victims and  looking through property seized from Riley for clues to identifying possible  victims.  </P> <P> "We have a lot of names and phone numbers to try to follow up on," Lt. Dennis  Dunn said.  </P> <P> Police expressed frustration in attempting to locate and deal with victims  because it is believed that Riley preyed only on Latinas who were illegally in  the country.  </P> <P> Police said that women who come forward will not be turned over to immigration  authorities even if they are in this country illegally.  </P> <P> "Just because you are not a citizen doesn't mean you can't be a victim,"  Detective Mel Arnold said. "We are not concerned with anybody's resident  status. We are only concerned with whether somebody has been a victim of this  guy."  </P> <P> Despite that pledge, detectives suspect that fear of authorities, including  possible belief that the announcement is a trap, has kept some possible victims  from contacting police.  </P></p>

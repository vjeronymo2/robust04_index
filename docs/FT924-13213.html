			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kvaerner pre-tax profits slip to NKr694m KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group, reported a NKr56m fall in pre-tax profits to NKr694m (Dollars 116.44m), caused by a loss by its mechanical engineering division and weak shipping results. However, profits for the year will remain on the same level as last year's NKr1.1bn. Group operating profit, after depreciation of NKr438m, was slightly up to NKr560m from NKr556m last year, when depreciation was NKr414m. Operating revenue rose by NKr347m to NKr11.977bn as operating costs increased by NKr255m to NKr10.949bn. The mechanical engineering division plunged into a loss of NKr162m from a NKr7m profit last year, despite a NKr66m rise in sales to NKr2.646bn. Kvaerner warned of unsatisfactory results for the year as a whole. Shipping profits declined by NKr168m to NKr45m as revenue was reduced by NKr176m to NKr654m. Kvaerner said the remainder of the year would produce poor results, despite a seasonal upturn for gas carriers in the last four-month period. The offshore division improved profit by NKr18m to NKr124m as revenue rose by NKr768m to NKr3.433bn. Good results are expected for the year as a whole. Shipbuilding improved profit by NKr155m to NKr494m as revenue rose by NKr236m to NKr4.140bn. The Govan yard at Glasgow, Scotland, continues to operate at a loss, but its performance has improved considerably since extensive restructuring. Good results for the division are expected for 1992. The pulping division boosted profit by NKr63m to NKr144m despite a NKr687m fall to NKr1.227bn in revenue.</p>

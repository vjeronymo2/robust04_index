			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Good vibrations on the local network Local area networks (Lans) are an effective way of linking desktop PCs together. But managing and maintaining complex networks can be difficult for managers who have to use separate software packages for each task, such as systems maintenance. Microcom, the US-based data communications and connectivity specialist, has launched LANlord which it claims is the first integrated software package for the centralised management of PC workstations on networks. LANlord automatically collects, stores and updates network and workstation statistics and notifies managers if any pre-set 'alert-thresholds' are reached, thereby helping network managers to anticipate problems as well as responding to users' requests for help. Microcom: US, 617 551 1000; UK, 0483 740763.</p>

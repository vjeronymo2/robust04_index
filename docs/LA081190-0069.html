			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GARRISON HOPING TO SLOW GRAF MORE IN SEMIFINAL TODAY  </P> <P> All that's missing are the stopwatches. People not only watch Steffi Graf play  tennis, they time her.  </P> <P> Fans have become so accustomed to the world's No. 1 player eliminating  opponents quickly that it is no longer a game of inches. Instead, it is one of  minutes and seconds.  </P> <P> Graf's 6-3, 6-2 victory over France's Nathalie Tauziat Friday afternoon in a  quarterfinal match of the Great American Bank tennis tournament took just 54  minutes but seemed, by standards Graf has unintentionally set, to last a  lifetime.  </P> <P> In Graf's first two matches here, she defeated Stephanie Rehe in 54 minutes and  Kathy Rinaldi in 76. While no official records are kept, her 33-minute victory  over Kim Kessaris in Mahwah, N.J., in 1988, is thought to be a record.  </P> <P> But all week, players have been saying that Graf, whose three-year anniversary  as the world's No. 1 player is Aug. 16, isn't as dominant as she once was. They  say she's vulnerable, that since she has been beaten this year -- twice in  straight sets by Monica Seles -- other players are catching on.  </P> <P> Another who has discovered this is third-seeded Zina Garrison, No. 5 in the  world. Garrison, 26, beat Graf, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4, this year in the semifinals at  Wimbledon. She played picture-perfect tennis against New York's Terry Phelps in  the evening match, winning, 6-0, 6-3, in front of 3,814 and setting up a  semifinal showdown against Graf today on center court at 12:30.  </P> <P> Second-seeded Martina Navratilova injured her calf and withdrew from the  tournament earlier in the week, leaving the remaining top seeded players to  meet before the final. Fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere, who now lives  in Switzerland, will meet Barbara Paulus in the other semifinal tonight at  6:30.  </P> <P> West Germany's Graf holds a 5-2 edge over Houston's Garrison in head-to-head  competition, but Garrison won their last meeting at Wimbledon. Last year in the  final of this tournament, Garrison threatened Graf before losing, 6-4, 7-5.  </P> <P> Both players downplayed the importance of today's rematch.  </P> <P> "It's not going to be anything special because I lost the last time," Graf  said. "I'm going to try hard. It's not going to be easy, because she has the  type of game that doesn't let me get into a rhythm."  </P> <P> Said Garrison, when asked if Graf would be looking to avenge her loss in  England: "I don't know about revenge. It was really tough when I played her  last year. She knows I'm out there, she knows what I'm about, she know I'm  going to be tough."  </P> <P> Against Tauziat, Graf said she settled down more in the second set and played  better than in the first, when she let Tauziat break her serve and then hold to  close the score to 4-3.  </P> <P> "Overall it was a good match," Graf said, "especially in the second set. I  think I was playing sharp."  </P> <P> Graf used a new racket and tried out a new top-spin backhand she has been  practicing.  </P> <P> "It (the racket) was very tight," she said. "I tried not to go for every shot,  to be a little more patient. I told myself to be a little more cautious, a  little more relaxed."  </P> <P> Graf hit one topspin backhand, and it sailed far over the baseline.  </P> <P> "So I didn't try it for a while," she said. "I tried it again, but it's not yet  the backhand I want it to be."  </P> <P> Tauziat agreed. She said it would take more than a new backhand for Graf to  regain her stronghold on women's tennis.  </P> <P> "That will not do it," Tauziat said. "It takes two or more years to perfect a  shot like that."  </P> <P> Tauziat said her level of play wasn't so far behind Graf's, that she just made  too many mistakes.  </P> <P> "The difference between her and me is not so much talent," she said. "It's  close. The difference, it's more in my mistakes."  </P> <P> Garrison didn't make many against Phelps. She stormed through the first set and  never trailed in the second.  </P> <P> In fact, when Phelps broke Garrison to close to 2-1 in the second set, the  nighttime crowd of 3,418 almost gave her a standing ovation.  </P> <P> "I was so nervous," Phelps said. "I don't know why I was pushing everything. It  was terrible. I was not very good. I feel sorry for the people watching."  </P> <P> Phelps is ranked 97th in the world. Her highest was in 1986, when she was No.  20.  </P> <P> "She didn't play that well," Garrison said, "but I played real well. I didn't  miss much in the first sets, although I did make some mistakes in the second."  </P> <P> Phelps said she is picking Graf to win tonight.  </P> <P> "I think Steffi (will win)," she said. "She may want some revenge, and I didn't  really prepare Zina very well. I didn't give her much of a workout."  </P> <P> Tennis Notes  </P> <P> Two-time U.S. Open winner Tracy Austin, who has been an on-again, off-again  tour player since 1983 because of neck and back injuries, arrived in San Diego  Friday to do commentary for Prime Ticket today and Sunday. . . . No News is  Good News: Said one woman to a group of other women watching Friday's matches:  "I tape my matches and watch them at night instead of the news. The news these  days is so depressing."  </P></p>

It  is not tolerable, the communique stresses, that industrial or  public units should be attacked by gangs of so-called miners who  are led by Miron Cosma, while those units are left unprotected  by personnel belonging to the Ministry of the Interior.    In that sense we are addressing an appeal to the ministry in  question calling for it to carry out its duty with respect to  those who are violating the laws of the country. If no such  steps are taken within the next 10 hours, the miners belonging  to the Salvamin Union will take over the task of restore order  to Targu Jiu, regardless of the labor conflict currently taking  place there, concludes the communique signed by the chairman of  the Salvamin Union, Viorel Teleleteu.</p>

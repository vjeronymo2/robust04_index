			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL THEY NEED TO DO IS CATCH THE BUG;  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY: NO PLACE IS REALLY IMMUNE, AND IT DOESN'T TAKE YEARS OF GRADUAL  EXPOSURE TO TRANSFORM THE BODY POLITIC.  </P> <P> In 1975, the usually ebullient Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then America's envoy to  the United Nations, was downright pessimistic about the prospects for democracy  in the world. It "has simply no relevance to the future," he proclaimed. He  called it "a holdover form of government," one that manages to persist only in  "isolated or peculiar places here and there."  </P> <P> As if in conspiracy to embarrass Moynihan -- or to cheer him up -- the  countries of the world have been on something of a democratic binge ever since.  There have been setbacks in a few places. But for the most part, democracy has  become all the rage as its two chief rivals -- inflexible right-wing  authoritarianism and ideology-bound Communist dictatorship -- descend into  disrepute.  </P> <P> Particularly remarkable has been the ease with which many countries have  adopted a form of government that has often been considered to be complicated,  delicate and difficult. For centuries, political thinkers have been  philosophizing about the "prerequisites" or "preconditions" that are necessary  for democracy to flower. They often conclude that economic development and the  gradual emergence of a democratic tradition are required, and that people must  become comparatively responsible, selfless and informed.  </P> <P> Recent history suggests, however, that about all a country needs to become  democratic is the more or less general desire to do so. A democratic  revolution, it now appears, is often quite easy to manage -- it requires  neither special preparation nor notable improvement in human nature or  capacities.  </P> <P> This might have been evident in the immediate aftermath of World War II when  totalitarian Germany, Japan, Italy and Austria became democracies. Democracy  was forced upon them, of course, but they took to it very well despite little  democratic tradition, particularly in Japan.  </P> <P> The current rage for democracy, however, seems to have been born in 1975 (even  as Moynihan spoke) when Portugal and Spain, both economically backward  countries with virtually no democratic preparation or tradition, became  democracies almost overnight and almost entirely without bloodshed.  </P> <P> Since that time almost all new states (mainly in the Caribbean, but also in  such unlikely places as Papua New Guinea) have adopted democracy with  remarkably little apparent effort. In Latin America, it is the military  dictatorship that has proven to be the form of government in decline. In  country after country, military leaders have relinquished control in large part  because they felt embarrassed that their countries were so out of fashion. If  present trends continue, Paraguay -- once one of the most entrenched and  unyielding dictatorships in the world -- will soon become a democracy under the  guidance of a general who used to be a chief pillar of the authoritarian  regime.  </P> <P> The remarkably rapid recent progress toward democracy in the Soviet Bloc --  particularly in Poland and Hungary -- has often been attributed to the Western  orientation of those countries. The democracy movement in China was undoubtedly  similarly affected by increased knowledge of Western ways. But calls for  democracy have also burgeoned in Myanmar (formerly Burma) -- one of the poorest  and most isolated countries in the world.  </P> <P> All this suggests that there is no reason to anticipate that the next  democracies must necessarily emerge in countries that have been preparing for  it for decades, like Turkey. Rather, any place -- Albania, Iraq, Zaire, Iraq,  Romania, the Soviet Union -- can quite easily become a democracy. All they need  is to catch the bug.  </P> <P> Fans of democracy can take cheer from all this, but they are also entitled to  wonder whether these developments present a firm trend or merely a fad. Some of  those demanding democracy -- as in China, Burma, and South Korea -- may see it  merely as an expedient gimmick to remove current leaders from office.  </P> <P> And others find appeal in democracy because they simplistically associate it  with prosperity. But while prosperity and democracy seem to have gone  hand-in-hand in the developed Western world, prosperity has certainly not  accompanied democracy in India or the Philippines, and some may eventually be  led to notice that the present prosperity of South Korea and Taiwan was largely  achieved under authoritarian regimes.  </P> <P> There may well be setbacks for democracy, then, but the long-range prospects  look rather good. After all, in 1789 there were only two democracies in the  world -- Switzerland and the United States. By 1975, as Moynihan might have  noticed, democracy had firmly taken root not merely "in isolated or peculiar  places here and there," but in most of the major countries of the world. In  that sense, democracy has been on a tear not merely for 15 years, but for 200.  It's hard to dismiss that as a fad.  </P></p>

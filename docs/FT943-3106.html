			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: GE shows interest in Snecma General Electric would be keen to invest in Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer in the event of its privatisation, according to the head of the US group's aircraft engines division. 'We would like to participate in any operation which would support the future of our French partner,' Mr Eugene Murphy said. 'If there is an opening of Snecma's capital we would like to take part.' The US and French groups work closely in the development and marketing of aircraft engines and are associates in CFM International, a joint engine manufacturing company. Mr Murphy said that co-operation between the two companies was becoming ever closer but rejected a scenario in which they would divide the production of small and large aircraft engines between them. Snecma is one of the 21 companies on the French government's privatisation list. But the group is not expected to be sold in the near future since the government has already launched plans for the issues of shares in other companies including Renault, the vehicle group, and Assurances Generales de France, the insurer.</p>

			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> TEAM TURMOIL: COLTS NOW BOTHERED BY HOLDOUTS, HANGUPS AND LAWSUITS  </P> <P> One year ago, the Indianapolis Colts were talking about going to the Super  Bowl. Now, they're a team in turmoil.  </P> <P> Chris Chandler, the starting quarterback when the 1989 season began, is in  Seattle after suing the team for breach of contract.  </P> <P> Eric Dickerson, the team's leading rusher since he arrived on Halloween Night  in 1987, is in California demanding a trade, seeking a raise and criticizing  his offensive line.  </P> <P> The Colts have threatened to suspend both players for a year.  </P> <P> Center Ray Donaldson, a Pro Bowl selection the past three years, reported to  training camp Thursday and then left for "personal reasons."  </P> <P> Eight other veterans are unsigned and absent from camp, including three  possible defensive starters, offensive lineman Randy Dixon and placekicker Dean  Biacussi.  </P> <P> Defensive end Donnell Thompson is no stranger to the franchise's problems,  having gone through his own contract disputes and a four-game suspension in  1984.  </P> <P> "I've been here 10 years and I've never seen this much go on in the offseason,"  Thompson said. "You just have to deal with it. We have no control. We're just  hired help. We do what we're told to do. I'm just here passing through and  doing as I'm told to do."  </P> <P> Still, he finds the turmoil frustrating.  </P> <P> "It's real tough to play the game and more or less deal with everything that's  going on as well, and try to win and try to have your heart in it," Thompson  said.  </P> <P> Many Colts are upset by management's refusal to pay Chandler $50,000 for  offseason workouts. Chandler says the payment is part of his contract, but the  team claims he doesn't deserve the money because he didn't do the workouts.  </P> <P> "The way they're treating Chris right now is kind of upsetting to everyone I've  talked to," Thompson said. "It's just dischanting to everyone that's involved.  </P> <P> "It's just hard to believe that we have all the bad guys in the league. It  seems like we've got every bad guy that's ever played football. I find that  hard to believe."  </P> <P> Dickerson's criticism of the offensive line has the players choosing up sides.  </P> <P> "If you had to run behind our offensive line, would you be here?" Thompson  said. "He has to step back and think about some things. He wants to be able to  walk five, six years from now."  </P> <P> Offensive tackle Kevin Call thinks Dickerson has talked too much.  </P> <P> "From the things that he's said, my personal opinion is we don't need him,"  Call said.  </P> <P> The decision to trade offensive tackle Chris Hinton and wide receiver Andre  Rison to obtain quarterback Jeff George as the top pick in the draft has also  divided the Colts.  </P> <P> "You lose two great players like Chris Hinton and Andre Rison, that has upset  the team," Thompson said. "Have you ever seen one guy come in and make that  much of a difference? We just have to wait and see."  </P> <P> Thompson isn't unhappy that George signed the most lucrative contract in league  history for a rookie -- a six-year deal for $15 million.  </P> <P> "I'm glad Jeff George got as much money as he did. He deserves every dollar  that he got," Thompsons said.  </P> <P> "It's just now let's get Jon Hand in here, and some other guys who have made a  contribution to the club. Those are the guys that I think we should be trying  to get in camp. I guess everyone doesn't see it the way I see it."  </P> <P> The club announced the signing of second-round draft pick Anthony Johnson of  Notre Dame and veteran kicker Dean Biasucci.  </P> <P> Johnson, who rushed for 1,512 yards in four years, was the last of the club's  14 draftees to come to terms. The signing of Biasucci cut to seven the number  of unsigned veterans absent from camp.  </P> <P> The rookies, free agent signees and veterans who have been in camp for more  than a week were given the morning off Friday while the club's other veterans  took physicals and agility tests.  </P></p>

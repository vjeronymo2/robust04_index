They said the  blockade is considered a means to intervene in Iraqi internal  affairs and runs contrary to all international charters and  agreements, heavenly laws, and human rights.    In a joint communique, signed for the Ba'th Party by the  director of the Iraq Command's Foreign Relations Bureau and for  the Bulgarian Liberal Democratic Party by party leader Veslin  Koshev, the two parties call for the lifting of the unjust  blockade, which has been imposed on Iraq for more than three  years, for respecting Iraqi sovereignty and independence, and  for respecting its people's free will.    The communique noted the need to improve the ties of  cooperation between the two parties through the exchange of  delegations, visits, publications, and circulars to serve the  common interests of the two friendly peoples and strengthen ties  between them in all fields.    The communique further urges the need for coordination and  cooperation between the two parties in national, regional, and  international conferences to expose the allegations and claims  of the world media and the tendentious propaganda; to reject all  forms of aggression, hegemony, exploitation, and the double  standards policy in addressing world problems; to serve the  principles of progress, freedom, and social justice; to realize  security and peace among nations; and to ensure respect for  international law.</p>

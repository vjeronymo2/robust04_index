			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii by </F> unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter; place, date not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the ruling and  opposition parties can agree on tax reform?    [Fujii] I have read a newspapers' serial interviews with  party officials in charge of tax affairs, and realized most of  us stand on common ground. In the aging society, we cannot  excessively depend on certain social levels. Although each  party has its own opinion on methodology of tax reform, all  parties have the same goal.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The Ministry of Finance [MOF] is calling  for tax increase according to an estimate mechanically  calculated, and many people are criticizing such a businesslike  way.    [Fujii] Frankly speaking, I wanted to carefully deal with  the subject. However, it is hard to promote tax reform debates  without some quantitative guidelines. We have no specific  intention in the policy.    We have to constantly work on administrative reform. The MOF  plans to comprehensively review structure and manpower needs of  92 subsidiary organizations. Regarding unfair taxation, it is  about time to reconsider consumption tax exemption for smaller  businesses.    Taxes on interest should be imposed on all bank accounts  held  by individuals, and we think the taxpayer number system may be  introduced when the reformed pension system gives a number to  each individual.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion of proposals for  consumption tax reduction for certain commodities?    [Fujii] Some foreign countries indeed have lightened sales  taxes on foodstuff, but most of them do so because the regular  sales tax rates are over 10 percent. Also, I think it is  difficult to determine the realm of tax reduction items. I  think (the introduction of a lightened tax) is questionable.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think a tax increase for welfare  expenditures should be determined now in package with an income  tax cut?    [Fujii] While the combination of the income tax cut and the  consumption tax hike is called a net tax hike, I am not sure if  that is an appropriate expression. But, that is the  government's position.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your stance on local government  bodies' requests to share an increased consumption tax?    [Fujii] Many welfare policies are carried on at the local  level, and local government bodies need stable revenue resources  for that. But that can be widely covered by various existing  systems.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you give some examples?    [Fujii] Reinforcement of local allocation taxes and transfer  taxes may be a possible measure. Those systems probably do not  look fresh, but can be effective.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Does the government intend to indicate the  rate of the consumption tax increase in its tax reform plan to  be announced in the end of June?    [Fujii] As a minority government, we must carefully listen  to opinions of coalition members, the opposition, and the  public. But the MOF itself wants to incorporate the tax rate in  the plan.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some say all the tax reform plan should  have is a decision to continue income tax cut.    [Fujii] In that case, we would have to issue  deficit-covering bonds with no brake. We must have a permanent  revenue and fundamental tax system reform to secure the income  tax cut.</p>

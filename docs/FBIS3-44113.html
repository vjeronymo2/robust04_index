The Lesotho Information Ministry said that the  government had no contact with either faction and that it was  uncertain of their actions. It is reported that about 150  loyalist soldiers are fighting against eight rebel companies to  keep the ruling Basotholand Congress Party in power. Diplomatic  sources said the United Nations, the Organization of African  Unity, and the Commonwealth were trying to mediate a solution.  A peace initiative is also being launched by the Frontline  States. South African troops are keeping a close watch on the  border, but there are no immediate plans to cross into Lesotho.  The situation in Maseru remains tense.</p>

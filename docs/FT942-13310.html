			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Clarke rules out easing of spending curbs Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday promised 'no let-up' in the government's tough approach to public spending and said it would not cut taxes simply to court electoral popularity. The chancellor, who is attending the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington, said the Pounds 4bn undershoot of the public sector borrowing requirement for 1993-94, announced last week, should not encourage spending departments to expect an easier government line in the annual spending round. The deficit, at 7 per cent of gross domestic product, was still far too high. The sooner it balanced the better, he said. The chancellor admitted that it would take some time for the improvements in the economy to be appreciated, but - in remarks that distanced him from Tory advocates of rapid tax cuts - insisted that a steady recovery would win back political support. 'If you look back at the experience of the 1980s, people are not going to want a sudden dash for growth,' he said. 'They are not going to be impressed by tax cuts that are just designed to win popularity.' Meanwhile Mr Stephen Dorrell, the rising star of the Tory centre-left, yesterday delivered a speech on the politics of the marketplace which appeared to challenge the manifesto recently put forward by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. For the second time this year Mr Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, has made a political speech contrasting strongly with the rightwing moral views held by Mr Portillo. In a passage interpreted by his friends as a repudiation of 'the Portillo personal manifesto', Mr Dorrell urges politicians to 'stick to their knitting'. Mr Portillo recently dwelt on rightwing icons such as personal responsibility, self-improvement and law and order. In contrast, Mr Dorrell says politicians' responsibility is for the macro-economic framework. He urges the governments' critics to judge Mr John Major's administration on the outlook for monetary and fiscal policy. Chancellors traditionally take a tough line on spending and taxation at this time of the year because government departments are putting forward their bids for funds in the spending round. But Mr Clarke's robust approach to last financial year's lower-than-forecast deficit also reflects a Treasury belief that the undershoot compared with the Pounds 50bn target was partly the result of one-off factors. Nevertheless, Mr Clarke took a more optimistic view of Britain's budget prospects than the IMF. Fund forecasts that Britain would have the second-highest budget deficit of the Group of Seven countries in 1995 - with a general government deficit of 6.2 per cent of GDP - were wrong and had not taken enough account of the measures in last November's Budget, he said.</p>

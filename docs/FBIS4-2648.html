			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (XINHUA) -- One Chinese leading  official called in a national sports meeting here on Friday [8  April] that all sports officials should explore a new way for  further development of sports in the country.    Li Tieying, State Councillor and member of the Political  Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, said that the new way  should be adapted to the socialist marketing economy system.    "The new way should be in line with the law of the modern  sports development, be beneficial to the construction of the  socialist spiritual civilization and be helpful to meet the  increasing needs of the Chinese people to sports," he said.    He praised sports officials, coaches as well as athletes for  their success in the past years.    China gave the world a surprise in the year 1993 when  Chinese  athletes collected a total of 103 world titles and broke 57  world records including those set by star long distance women  runners.    The state councillor said the achievements that China had in  sports demonstrated great intelligence and sports talents of the  Chinese people. "So long as we have tried our best, we could  scale new peaks in sports one after another," he added.</p>

Even if human rights violations are painful, the dialogue  must be continued, Parliament President Heinz Fischer stated  after his meeting with Chinese Parliament President Qiao Shi.  After a four-day visit to Germany and Switzerland, which was  accompanied by protests, he arrived in Austria with a delegation  of parliament deputies. Asked about the human rights situation  and Tibet, Qiao Shi referred to China's history and the great  significance of the preservation of political stability.  Replying to Fischer's request to consider banning the death  penalty, Qiao Shi stated that China is not yet ready for a  renunciation of this type of punishment.    Marijana Grandits, foreign-policy spokeswoman for the  Greens,  described Qiao as "one of the most sinister figures of China's  political landscape." If Austria does not oppose vehemently the  systematic human rights violations, this means continuing the  tradition of ignorant and opportunist policies. Exiled Tibetans  demonstrated in front of the Chancellor's Office in  Ballhausplatz.</p>

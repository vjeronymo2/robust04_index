			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK;  </P> <P> PRESS TRIES TO MAKE IT RECORD FOUR IN A ROW AT HIS SAUGUS 'HOME'  </P> <P> Dan Press proved last year that he can run for a championship when he won eight  main events in his Chevrolet Camaro to take the NASCAR Southwest Tour series  for late-model stock cars.  </P> <P> This season, Press decided it was too expensive to defend his championship in  the 18-race schedule, so he is entering only selected races. The first ones on  his list were at Saugus Speedway, where he won last May and where he will be  favored Saturday night when the Southwest Tour returns to the one-third-mile  paved oval for the Miller Genuine Draft 100.  </P> <P> Press has won the past three tour events at Saugus, and if he can win Saturday  night, it will set a series record for consecutive victories on the same track.  Press won two last year and the opener this year. Mike Chase won three in a row  at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield before Loran Kelley snapped his string on  June 30.  </P> <P> That race was also the last outing for Press, who finished second.  </P> <P> "We're kind of rusty heading for Saugus, but like I've always said, we figure  that's our home track," Press said. "Saugus is a tough track to tame, and all  those years we've run there have really helped. Running there is like putting  on a good pair of shoes that fit you nicely. If everything hangs together,  we'll be in good shape."  </P> <P> In addition to his three Southwest Tour victories at Saugus, Press won track  championships there in 1978 and '82. He also set the track's one-lap qualifying  record of 77.017 m.p.h. last year.  </P> <P> Press won two of the season's first three races in defense of his Southwest  Tour title, but it wasn't enough to convince him to run the full series.  Saturday night will be his sixth race of 14.  </P> <P> "It (the championship) got too expensive to run, what with all the money we  spent and the money we lost by taking time away from the business to run 20  events," he said. "They cut a couple of races off the schedule this year, but  we still couldn't see how we could afford to do the whole thing again. Business  is more important than fun."  </P> <P> Press runs a machine shop, DPI (for Dan Press Industry), in Lebec, near his  Frazier Park home on the Ridge Route between Los Angeles and Bakersfield. DPI  fabricates aerospace and race car parts.  </P> <P> Two crashes at Mesa Marin, one in a race on April 7 and the other while  practicing for a May 19 race, also contributed to expenses and lost time.  </P> <P> "Both times it was a tire that came off the rim," Press said. "The second time  it happened, it really tore up the car and just about totaled it. It still  wasn't right when we came back for the June 30 race. We set a fast time, but  (the car) didn't run as good in the race."  </P> <P> The Chevy is the same one he drove last year, although the sheetmetal has been  changed to make it a Lumina instead of a Camaro.  </P> <P> Press will find a hot standings battle in progress Saturday night, with Doug  George of Atwater, Calif.; M. K. Kanke of Granada Hills, and Ron Hornaday Jr.  of Palmdale only 70 points apart after 13 races. George has won three races,  more than any other driver.  </P> <P> An added entry will be Stanley Smith of Chelsea, Ala., defending champion in  NASCAR's All-American Challenge Series.  </P> <P> The final race for the track street stock championship will also be held  Saturday night; Craig Rayburn has a 14-point lead over Dave Blankenship, with  Ed Horst two points further back.  </P> <P> SPEEDWAY BIKES -- The third and final qualifying round for the U.S. Nationals  will be held Friday night at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa. With  14 of 16 positions at stake, it is the closest final qualifier in the history  of American speedway racing. After earlier rounds in Sacramento and  Victorville, defending champion Bobby Schwartz leads with 39 points, followed  by Phil Collins with 38 and Steve Lucero and Mike Faria with 30 each. Shawn  Moran and Billy Hamill are seeded into the finals by virtue of their Nissan  American Final finishes. Moran, however, has indicated that he will not return  from England to ride, so his spot will be taken by Rick Miller. The U.S. Finals  are Oct. 6 in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Moran became the third American in six years to tie for first place in the  World Finals and then lose in a runoff when he was defeated Saturday in England  by Per Jonsson of Sweden. Lance King lost in 1984 to Erik Gundersen and Hans  Nielsen of Denmark, and Sam Ermolenko lost to the same pair in 1985. Jonsson is  the first rider other than a Dane to win the world championship since 1983.  </P> <P> SPRINT CARS -- Ron Shuman took a major step toward winning his third  consecutive California Racing Assn. championship with a 50-lap victory Saturday  night at Ascot Park and a fourth place Sunday in Phoenix. With 12 races  remaining -- eight at Ascot -- he moved within 34 points of leader Brad  Noffsinger and 24 of early-season leader John Redican. Shuman, who will be  going for his sixth season CRA victory Saturday night at Ascot, was 237 points  behind when the CRA came home from its midwestern tour in May.  </P> <P> DRAG RACING -- The National Hot Rod Assn.'s Pacific Division of the Winston  Racing Series, featuring more than 400 sportsman drivers, will return this  weekend to the L.A.

Kirby will be racing his Figure 8 machine Sunday night at  Ascot in the NASCAR Winston Racing Series competition. . . . Only two races  remain in the Cajon Speedway sportsman stock championship, and Jerry Gay, who  won his 101st career main event last week, leads Larry Lyon by only six points  going into Saturday night's race. . . .

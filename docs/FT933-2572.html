			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Irregular forex deals hit Nippon Steel unit NIPPON Steel Chemical, a chemicals subsidiary of Nippon Steel, the world's largest steel maker, yesterday forecast a pre-tax loss of Y12bn (Dollars 113.2m) for the year ending March, following foreign exchange losses on unauthorised trading by an accounting division chief. The company had previously forecast a loss of Y3.8bn, but the continued slowing of domestic industrial demand for resins and composite materials has added to damage caused by the foreign exchange losses, estimated at Y14.2bn. These losses arose from irregular deals by the head of the company's forex division, who died in a train accident in May. He had invested Y47.3bn in forward contracts, apparently breaching a company rule that currency investments of more than Y100m require board approval. Nippon Steel Chemical intends to cover the foreign exchange losses through the sale of securities and land holdings, but it also plans to transfer 200 head office staff to subsidiaries in an attempt to reduce costs. The company will not pay an interim dividend. Sales for the year are expected to be Y270bn, down from the previous estimate of Y290bn, and from last year's Y281.5bn, when the company had a pre-tax loss of Y7.2bn and a net loss of Y6.3bn. For the first half to September, Nippon Steel Chemical forecast sales of Y130bn, down from Y138bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y8bn, widening from Y3.5bn. In the same period last year, the company lost Y988m.</p>

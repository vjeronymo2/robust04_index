			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DO WE REALLY NEED THE B-2?'  </P> <P> The Times has always been considered a thoughtful news organization fully aware  of the influence it wields over a larger readership. But we find your editorial  on the B-2 very disappointing.  </P> <P> One concludes that your position was based on an "analysis" by the  International Institute for Strategic Studies.  </P> <P> Let me cite a few points to clear up some of the misunderstanding the Strategic  Studies report obviously created.  </P> <P> Cost per warhead studies are what you want to make of them. For example, the  Harvard analysis is used by The Times to conclude that using a B-2 would cost  more than using a Midgetman missile. It would seem a system that can carry a  wide variety of weapons, in an equally wide variety of sizes and strengths, and  be able to do it time and again across the spectrum of conflict (from  conventional to nuclear) is a very "cost-effective" weapon system. The small  ICBM does have its utility as a deterrent. But doing a warhead "return on  investment analysis" is in this instance, specious.  </P> <P> Let's turn to another issue -- whether or not the "stealthy" quality of the B-2  is of any value. Once again The Times focuses on only part of the picture. Even  in the most intense exchange (an unlikely scenario) the number of  surface-to-air missile sites -- at last count more than 10,000 -- would be  considerbly reduced but not all would be destroyed. The Soviets overbuilt their  system for just that reason.  </P> <P> Weapon systems must be developed based upon what can best provide the highest  deterrent value this country's technology can produce. At the same time it must  give us the most effective war-fighting capability should deterrence fail. The  B-2 bomber falls into the "highly qualified" category on both counts.  </P> <P> Together with land- and sea-based missiles, the other two legs of our strategic  triad, it will keep the peace and lend stability as we work our way through  this critical period in history.  </P> <P> One final point. What has been left out of the editorial is any discussion of  the pivotal role the B-2 plays in the START negotiations. The underlying  rationale of START seeks to shift a greater portion of the deterrent mission to  the more stable bomber element of the triad. The premium on the strategic  bombers in the START negotiations makes it imperative we have a bomber capable  of penetrating the sophisticated Soviet air defenses into the next century.  That system is the B-2.  </P> <P> RONALD O.

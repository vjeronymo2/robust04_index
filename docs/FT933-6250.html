			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Pain in Spain for holiday home-buyers - New tax could make life more complicated for those owning property through offshore companies the 5 per cent impuesto especial - has brought into question the advantages of owning a holiday home in Spain through an offshore company. In the good old days - probably before those of time-share - you would be encouraged to buy such a property through a non-Spanish (probably Gibraltarian) company, either by the vendor or by some friendly local expatriate or adviser. The reasons given for owning your holiday home through a non-Spanish company could be any one or more of the following: To avoid ISD, Spain's equivalent to inheritance tax. The rate varies but can be as high as 81.6 per cent, although only where the inheritance is more than Pta100m and passes between people with no family relationship. Recipients resident in Spain are charged ISD on all gifts and inheritances, but ISD is charged only on Spanish-sited assets for non-residents. If, therefore, you are a non-Spanish resident and you own your casa through a non-Spanish company, you will be owning shares in a company outside Spain and not the property directly. Therefore, you will be outside the scope of Spanish ISD. Another advantage of the offshore company relates to the lack of a double-tax treaty with Spain covering death duties. If you are UK-domiciled when you die, your estate will be charged UK inheritance tax and the beneficiary of your Spanish property will be charged ISD unless you have set up an offshore company. To avoid the Spanish equivalent of capital gains tax on a sale or gift. For non-Spanish residents, Spanish tax is charged on the disposal of Spanish property but not on the sale of shares in a non-Spanish company. To avoid the costs on a re-sale or gift - which can be as much as 11 per cent. The greater part of these costs is taken up by the Spanish equivalent of stamp duty, ITP. For residential property, this is generally 6 per cent of the sale price. To avoid plus valia, which is a local tax charged on the increase in the so-called catastral value since acquisition. Land in Spain has a value which can be ascertained from the local town hall. Historically, catastral values have lagged behind market value; but now that the market price for Spanish property has fallen, the catastral values are closer to market value. To avoid the rules of succession in Spain (in other words, who gets what when you die). Spanish succession rules apply only to Spanish nationals, and provided you can prove that your will complies with your local law, this usually is accepted. The reasons for buying a Spanish property through a non-Spanish company are quite convincing, but what are the drawbacks? First, if you are a non-Spanish resident and you are thinking of letting your property there, the Hacienda (Spain's Inland Revenue) can make non-resident companies pay corporation income tax, or ISS, at 25 per cent on the gross rent received from the property. Second, if you are resident in the UK for tax purposes, owning a property in Spain through a non-Spanish company could result in tax problems in the UK. The Inland Revenue can charge income tax on the benefit of accommodation provided by a company if you are an employee or director (including, arguably, a deemed director who, in fact, controls the company). One way to avoid this charge could be for your Spanish property-owning company to be controlled by a trust, so that accommodation is provided through being a beneficiary of this rather than an employee or director of the company. Where your trust should be resident depends on your domicile. If you are domiciled in the UK, there is little advantage in setting up a trust elsewhere. Third, and not least, is the new impuesto especial which applies to all non-Spanish companies holding Spanish property. The tax is charged on the catastral value and accrues on December 31 each year, starting in 1992. There are a number of exemptions, especially where the non-resident owner can satisfy the authorities of the origin of the funds used to acquire the casa, as well as the identity of its owners (together with an undertaking that the authorities will be notified of any change). At present, the Hacienda is interpreting this exemption very narrowly - in particular, when dealing with Gibraltar holding companies. The impuesto especial poses no real threat to an English resident buying his casa through a non-Spanish resident company and trust structure - assuming the original source of funds is ascertainable, clean, and causes no embarrassment to either the company or the beneficial owner. But where this is not the case, the problems may not be quite so simple to resolve. Caroline Garnham is a tax and trusts specialist with City firm Simmons &amp; Simmons.</p>

The chief of state said it is "merely a sort of warning  regarding our relationship."    "We are doing the same over (agricultural) subsidies: We are  telling the United States that they cannot continue to subsidize  the sale of wheat to Brazil because it causes huge damage to  Argentina."    Menem said this during an impromptu news conference granted  at the press room at Government House, shortly before receiving  U.S. Vice President Albert Gore.</p>

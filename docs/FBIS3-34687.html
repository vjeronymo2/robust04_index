			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by King Husayn at the Royal Hashemite Court in Amman </F> on 13 February--recorded]    [Text] In the name of God, the compassionate, the merciful.  You are welcome, brothers, in this house of yours. Many happy  returns. God bless you all. I take boundless pride in our  brotherhood. One always recalls the memories of the long, hard  march and the challenges we faced. We have great faith that God  will help us serve the country and the generations to come and  fulfill our duties in a manner that will satisfy God almighty  and our conscience.    I am certain the brothers have a great deal of information  on  what has happened, and is happening at this phase in our  nation's life and our life in this country. There may be,  however, an opportunity to enter into some details and listen to  your observations on what is happening. We are, here, one  family. I am happy to meet with this respectable group of  brothers on this day in particular, with the king's private  council and with the men, the builders who built this country.  You, members of the Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee, are  welcome in this house of yours.    This is a critical and hard phase in terms of the efforts it  requires from all of us. Thank God, this is the country of the  big, one family of all origins. We are determined to maintain  our national unity and our achievements as far as allowing the  individual to share in shouldering his responsibility,  chartering the road to the future through democracy, shura, and  respect and protection of the Constitution and the National  Charter. That charter was formulated by the children of this  homeland and sets a course we must follow in the present and  future.    The individual is very important, indeed. God willing,  Jordan will be the state of institutions. This means  participation by all people to shoulder their responsibility,  with awareness and loyalty, and to prepare the road to the  future. Additionally, we must continue our efforts to prevent  any party from striking us in the heart, in terms of what we  have succeeded in achieving, including democracy and  participation by all people in shouldering their responsibility.    Through our work, we want to set an example to our brothers  in this part of the world. Probably, this is not to the  satisfaction of many quarters, because they do not know the true  objective and goal we seek to achieve; that is to succeed in our  course and reach our objectives and goals.    Therefore, the phase requires a great deal of vigilance,  awareness, and cohesion by all in the face of all the attempts  that may seek to distort the image of this country and its  achievements, or march on a road that might lead -- in the view  of some people -- to a reaction. We are committed to the path  and the course we have chosen. We must preserve it. This is a  trust everyone must protect. Thank God, all Jordanians have  always demonstrated a degree of awareness -- which they gained  through the long hard march -- of all that may threaten that  march. But, in my view, and based on what we have seen  recently, there has to be an extra degree of vigilance and  awareness, a vigilance that will prevent any damage, God forbid.    We must look after the interests of the individual and his  rights, as well as paying attention to the environment and  whatever falls within the realm of our responsibility toward the  coming generations. In a larger context, we decided, following  a national convention here, to take the road of peace, beginning  in Madrid, along with our brothers in the Arab world,  particularly the Palestinians. In 1974, the Rabat summit  decided that our Palestinian brothers should take charge of  their own affairs in compliance with their own and the Arab  nation's wishes at that time. Some of you here now took part in  that meeting. Our position is clear. As of 1974, we promoted  an implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 242, which  we co-authored in tough circumstances, and which was the best  possible arrangement we could get at that time. Thereafter, our  Palestinian brothers took responsibility for themselves. They  have our full support.    Things then evolved in a way favoring a settlement  compatible  with a world trend. We began in Madrid. The Jordanian umbrella  was a vehicle for our Palestinian brothers to run their affairs,  insofar as their rights on their national soil are concerned.  We agreed to take part in various conferences, including the  multilateral talks, because we wanted the world to be involved  in drawing the outlines of peace. Things developed in rapid  succession until we came to the point where we could furl the  umbrella and relegate it to the closet of history, so our  Palestinian brothers might exercise their right to speak for  themselves. Then, there was last September's Washington session  and the agreement, followed by our signing of the agenda that  addressed issues bearing on us here in Jordan, without  prejudicing our brothers' rights on matters previously handled  by us. I am speaking about Resolution 242 and the Arab  territories conquered in 1967. The responsibility for these was  switched to our Palestinian brothers, who can count on our full  support as they pursue their rights.    There have been many proposals and attempts to get Jordan to  sign a peace treaty with Israel before details are worked out.  Our response was an outright rejection.    We stand with a just and comprehensive peace, although we  are now dealing with our issues in this country, as well as its  rights concerning occupied territories in the south and in the  north. Jordanian sovereignty over them should be regained.  Regarding water, which is also a topic on the agenda, a formula  should be worked out in which we can know our country's share  and the shares of other parties concerned. The question of  human beings as well as other topics should also be discussed.  We believe peace is a goal. It is our duty to seek to reach it.    However, there will never be peace unless all these issues  are resolved in a satisfactory and comfortable way. Peace comes  at the end and not at the beginning. Then, all the elements  that should be available to achieve peace should be discussed.  We believe anyone who thinks of signing a peace treaty and then  begins discussing details cannot reach peace, but will  surrender. People will then try to improve their conditions and  circumstances. We regret such a situation. We will never  accept such a view or concept.    Meetings and negotiations on the agenda are continuing in an  attempt to deal with all the aspects and issues pertaining to  us, through continued dialogue in Washington and other parts of  the world. We believe the other tracks will also move. They  are actually moving, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track and  the Lebanese-Israeli track, in addition to the Palestinian side  which is working continuously.    We tried, and we will continue to try, to reach the required  level to face the challenge and to face up to our  responsibilities toward the present and the future, particularly  toward our Palestinian brethren. There should be coordination,  not only in terms of titles, but also details, in every area in  order to extend our support and talk with one voice and in one  logic to serve the goals we seek.    The picture is improving, but I cannot say that we are 100  percent satisfied with all the aspects that should be dealt  with. There is a serious intention to achieve this. Therefore,  we will march on this path. We will insist on total  coordination on issues of mutual interest until a situation  arises in which everyone in this country can choose either  membership in this one family to which we belong, or  repatriation, or compensation. We are one family. We should  adhere to all that has united us in the past. This is a duty at  this critical stage, which expresses the fact that we are one  family regardless of any consideration.    We are coordinating with our brothers in fraternal Syria.  Regarding Lebanon, I also believe there is progress in the right  direction. I believe there will be progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track. Israel will have to recognize Syria's  sovereignty over its occupied territories and over all of Golan.    On the other hand, it has been said Israel has no claims on  any inch of Lebanese territory. Israel's only demand is to  guarantee its security which, I believe, can be provided.    We, here, have many issues and matters that should be  discussed and agreed upon before reaching the phase in which we  will be reassured that all matters have been tackled.    I believe that between now and the end of the year --  perhaps  by the beginning of next year -- we might find that progress has  been achieved on all tracks to reach the objective that is  sought.    What is this objective, as I, as well as my brothers, see  it?  The objective is to move from the current situation to a  completely different one. The objective is that the coming  generation will not live as we lived, that is, a life in which  they will not be reassured about what will come in the future.  We lived from one day to another. The objective is to see  people living in an atmosphere that provides them with  opportunities to advance in their life and to enjoy stability,  democracy, participation in decisionmaking, and peace, that we  hope will be just and honorable and accepted by the coming  generations. The objective is to see that all opportunities  will be available to all to achieve their aspirations and  objectives, to live a free and honorable life, to remain  steadfast on their land, and to exercise their rights in this  life.    We want to leave for the coming generations opportunities of  which we were deprived. We believe our people have enough  potential, if they are given opportunities to advance and to  exercise their rights in normal circumstances. What makes us  very satisfied is that our country and our people are not in  danger and that this position -- which we have safeguarded from  the beginning as a genuine Arab -- is not subject to any  possibilities like those we have been confronting throughout our  life.    Our homeland is the homeland of the free people and its  people's heads are high in the sky. Our people bow only to  almighty God. We do not bargain over principle. We are not  lenient vis-a-vis our rights. We seek to fully restore rights  to their owners on their national soil and to carry our duties  the best way we can for the sake of the coming generations.    As regards Jerusalem and our holy places, we cannot forget  them for one moment. We have no choice but to continue  shouldering our full responsibilities in terms of looking after  them on behalf of our Islamic nation.    As regards Gaza and Jericho, if the issue is the beginning  of  the implementation of 242, the time will come when Jerusalem  will be the Palestinian-Israeli meeting place. However, as  regards our holy places -- toward which we have shouldered our  responsibilities and which belong to all Muslims throughout the  world, in the past, in the present, and in the future -- we  found we had to propose and to endeavor to choose, from within  our Islamic group, a good group of people who would represent  all Islamic sects. This group of people, God willing, will not  be politicized. In other words, they will not be affiliated  with any school or be supportive of any one country's policy.  We will support them with all our potential, because these holy  places belong to all the Islamic world.    What we have accomplished is an honor, whether in terms of  rescuing these holy places in the first place or in seeking to  preserve them despite all that has happened and all that we  faced.    We encourage dialogue among religions and demand that in  terms of sovereignty the holy places be under the sovereignty of  God almighty and his worshipers under future circumstances. We  hope that this will happen, so the only recognized sovereignty  over these holy places will be that of God. We will seek to  gain God's satisfaction. We will continue to fear him. The  positive results of this will not be confined just to this part  of the world, but will have effects on mankind throughout the  world.    Thanks be to God, during this month we will celebrate the  completion of the project we have followed from the beginning,  namely, the restoration of the holy dome of the rock. We will  continue to support our brethren to the best of our abilities in  terms of their needs and desires.    In my opinion, Palestine can either lean on this solid wall  here [Jordan] or else lean in the other direction in the  upcoming critical stage. Palestine represents our kinsfolk, our  people, hopes, and aspirations. We are willing to carry out our  duty. We never hesitated to do so at any time. We hope God  will grant us success in cooperating with our brethren to  support them in any way that can lead to wellbeing and success,  God willing. With the help of almighty God, there will be  nothing but (?success).    Incidents took place over here in the recent past. These  include the loss of one of the homeland's sons in Lebanon in a  grotesque, mean action. However, I am pleased to inform you  that our brethren in Lebanon and Syria moved with us to the best  of their abilities. This incident was directed against Lebanon,  just as it was directed against us. This evil act encroached on  the sovereignty, security, and stability of Lebanon, just as it  grieved us in causing the loss of one of our good sons.    In a telephone conversation a few days ago, my brother his  excellency the Lebanese president said that all those  responsible for this incident had been arrested and that justice  will take its course. He made a point of contacting me  personally so that I would not hear this from any other source  before hearing it from the president himslef. Naturally, we  thanked him. We thank all our brothers for their contributions  to exposing this crime and its dimensions and those who are  responsible for it and who instigated it.    Regrettably this group, in particular, has in the past  committed against us and against our diplomatic missions such  crimes. On this occasion, it seems orders were issued from an  Arab capital where the head of this criminal organization is  hiding. Scores of questions have been raised in the past about  this organization. All the details must be made available to  the people.    As regards our domestic arena, the security agencies have,  praise be to God, acted at the required level to face and  confront some attempts to harm the image of this country, as  well as criminal schemes hatched to inflict further harm. The  question, with all its dimensions, is now being investigated.  But we have to warn that there are certain parties that can  reach our young men, who are not in a position to distinguish  between good and bad, and influence them through various means  and ways and drive them to commit crimes and carry out certain  acts. What is even more dangerous is the fact that these  parties try to address the point of weakness, which is also the  point of strength, in everyone of us, that is, religion and  faith. As far as the results are concerned, all these crimes  have nothing to do with religion or faith. We noted on several  occasions in the past what is being hatched against us, and  against our religion, faith, and Islam. We also drew attention  to the duty we all must fulfill, that is, not to allow things to  go beyond the limits of what is logical and acceptable. The  pulpits in mosques are the pulpits of God's messenger, God's  prayers and peace by upon him, and of the legal guardians. We  believe that, as of now, we should not allow anyone, any more,  to exploit them for purposes that have nothing to do with our  doctrine and our religion. Islam shall remain clear and pure,  since this is what the moderate nation the Muslim nation is all  about.    One cannot stand idly by over the attempts to drive people  to  crime and murder. We must warn against another fact. There is a  small group of infiltrators who try to damage the entire picture  and everything that has been achieved and won. I urge our  people in our country to be vigilant and cautious and to close  the door to these groups that have connections with foreign  parties. Many doubts are cast about these connections. Their  contacts may be within a framework broader than that of our  Muslim world. When we have enough information, it must be  presented to the people so they will know about what is going on.    All members of this one family -- Muslims and Christians --  are Jordanians who must band together and pull the rug from  under whoever seeks to discredit this country and its  achievements. Jordan must remain a strong and steadfast  fortress that serves Palestine and our brothers and  well-intentioned people throughout the great Arab homeland. We  pray that God may grant us success and guidance, and that these  are the results.    We are quite confident that life and death are in the lap of  the gods. Our life span is fated by God. What we are after is  God almighty's satisfaction and his help in allowing us to  succeed, as long as we live, to fulfill our duties so our heads  can remain held high.    I thank you for this visit and meeting. If you have any  questions or comments, I'd be grateful and happy.    I thank you so much, brothers. Thanks be to God, this  country is doing its bit and its duty. God willing, our  brothers from Yemen will get together. They sought our help in  their endeavor to maintain Yemen's unity and map out the outline  of a promising future for a cherished part of our great Arab  homeland, and we have been receptive. We will be glad to see  Amman once more play the role of the capital of accord and  reconciliation, when we play host to them quite soon. It will  count as a major achievement. For us, it will mean more than  just an effort we exerted or a duty we fulfilled. Hopefully, it  will usher in a resolution of intra-Arab differences within the  framework of an Arab family, as we have always wanted and worked  for. It will be an opportunity for each of us to do their duty  by our kinsfolk and brothers. We pray for success from God.    In regard to our Armed Forces, they will continue to have  our  maximum support within the limits of our resources. I recently  visited the Jordanian contingent within the international  peacekeeping forces in former Yugoslavia. I was impressed by  their high morale and the humane, but yet firm, way in which  they conducted themselves. I myself was surprised to learn that  next to France we have the second largest contingent there. We  have been asked to contribute an even larger force, but I said  we could not commit any more troops to that operation. We must  thank God that the Jordanian soldier's character and moral  standards and commitment to responsibility have earned him  universal respect.</p>

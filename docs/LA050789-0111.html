			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORNER POETRY  </P> <P> So the Book review has finally given up on poetry altogether. Congratulations.  Not only do you can the reviews. The next thing I know main man Eder  offhandedly informs us that an epigram like " 'To write poetry after Auschwitz  is barbaric' " is "a form of poetry, of course." (Book Review, April 16). And  who finally shows up in your Poetry Corner but that longtimeman of letters  Randy Newman.  </P> <P> Excuse me, but wasn't it Pound who said good poetry should be as well-written  as good prose? Newman is a talented songwriter, a talent of a higher order than  most of the "poets" you print. But he's better off in the Calendar section with  his blood relatives than lurking around in your "What's Cute This Week" Corner.  </P> <P> MICHAEL GUISTA  </P> <P> SANTA MARIA  </P></p>

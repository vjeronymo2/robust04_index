			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE MAKING OF A MINIMALIST  </P> <P> While most of the city was giddy at the J. Paul Getty Museum's acquisition of  Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the Museum of Contemporary Art was readying its  own idea of a capital event, the first retrospective of the work of John  Baldessari, one of the smartest ideas in MOCA's short history.  </P> <P> Just hours before preview and things weren't going very well. The catalogue had  not arrived from Japan, the show (to June 17) was undergoing a last-minute  rehanging. Sigh. It looked as if reality was going to act as a metaphor of the  supposed complexity of Baldessari's work.  </P> <P> Actually, it turned out fine. The catalogue by Coosje Van Bruggen came  galumphing in at the 11th hour. A few helpful insights are wedged into its  dogged prose. And the show does what it is supposed to do. It clarifies the  artist in a way no number of single gallery exhibitions can. One is tempted to  say it immediately promotes him from the most underrated of major California  artists to the most overrated, but that's a bit too facile.  </P> <P> For anyone not wired to contemporary art, John Baldessari is a 58-year-old  artist who grew up in the anonymous grubbiness of National City with  expectations of going no further in life than teaching high school and making a  bit of a local reputation as an artist. He pursued both dreams and wound up a  figure of international reputation. Teaching -- at CalArts instead of Chula  Vista High -- he evolved into a kind of guru. His influence, both direct and  oblique, is downright astonishing. You can see his fingerprints on virtually  every member of the younger generation who continues to dominate the high-risk  lane of today's art from Cindy Sherman to Robert Longo. Nobody knows how long  this will endure in the quick-extinct ambience of the times, but it is  nonetheless an accomplishment.  </P> <P> What did he do and how did he do it?  </P> <P> We think of artists as making their mark by adding something, something  original. Baldessari has functioned by subtraction. Subtraction is not original  in contemporary art; it comes from abstract Minimalism.  </P> <P> Prior to this revealing show, one had the impression that Baldessari's art had  at least the virtue of not looking like anyone else's. It still doesn't, but  now it's clear that its look comes from a synthesis of Pop, Minimalism and  Conceptualism combined and systematically wrung out like a sponge until  Baldessari got it where he wanted it.  </P> <P> The earliest works on view are late-'60s canvases bearing either lettered  mottoes, grimy photographs or both. Their debt to Ed Ruscha is clear in one  called "Pure Beauty," but Baldessari makes it his own by subtracting Ruscha's  visual charm and turning it into a set of ironic "art lessons," purposely dumb  like quotes from cheap, How-To art manuals. One begins significantly with the  title, "Tips for Artists Who Want to Sell." In another, the artist shows a  tatty snapshot of a man under a palm tree. The whole thing is labeled "Wrong."  It's amusing, but it's also in the business of amputating art of certain  components, its idealism and visual impact. The work is anonymous and  impersonal, like the efforts of a shy person in a faceless suburb, a  do-it-yourselfer trying to teach himself art despite utter ineptitude.  </P> <P> Baldessari was decades ahead of the pack when it came to practicing what is now  called Deconstruction. He beat the kids by a mile in using other people's art  for his own, you know, Appropriation. In 1968, he reproduced a Frank Stella and  called it "A 1968 Painting." In 1969, he commissioned paintings from 14  artists. The 13 on view each show a Photorealist image of a hand pointing to  something: a stove burner, an extinct light bulb. Each bears the caption "A  Painting by . . ." with the artist's name affixed. But they become Baldessari's  -- or nobody's -- subtracting individuality and inventiveness from the list.  The artist's job is to point things out.  </P> <P> At this point, Baldessari's quest is basically fulfilled. He has unhooked art  from the tethers that bound it for centuries to physical substance -- to paint,  wood, or marble -- and reduced it to a set of images that are only one step  from being as disembodied as a movie or television picture. He invented a  visual form that communicates through montage, juxtaposition and implied word  associations. It beams to a television generation rather than a museum crowd.  Try watching an old movie with the sound off and in a few minutes you will see  lots of Baldessaris flickering through it, powerful subliminal symbols like  those of advertising.  </P> <P> He has said, "I guess I'm using images from movies, from newspapers and so on  because there lies the arch-power of language. We can't sit down and talk in  Sanskrit, we have to talk in a language that we know." It is interesting, but  it isn't art.  </P> <P> Normally, intoning the phrase "It isn't art" is a masked way of saying "I don't  like it," but that's not what is meant here. Art is a language with a grammar  going back to the caves of Lascaux and the Venus of Willendorf. It communicates  in many of the same ways as Baldessari, but deprived of its sensual component  it loses corporeal authority and becomes a fiction of the mind. Looking at it  is like trying to make love to someone without a body. To say this is not art  is an objective description. This is not French but German.  </P> <P> If it all sounds both complex and theoretical; that's misleading. Baldessari's  art-language is as easily grasped as graphic design, which may account for his  success and that of his brood. You can read the work without going to the  trouble of learning the language of art, and it is often quite entertaining.  </P> <P> If Baldessari's tactics sound destructive of art, there lies a huge paradox  because he is forever quoting art as if it were holy writ. Early on, he blows  cigar smoke next to Polaroids of clouds, tipping his stogie to Joe Goode. He  combines text and little objects in the fashion of Alexis Smith. Always  somewhat professorially impersonal, he betrays a lyric side in a snake charmer  string of pretty postcards and a religious facet in an homage to Malevich where  a big white square descends into a suburban yard like some holy UFO.  </P> <P> Later works have grown bigger, angrier and more socially critical. Often  montages of separately framed stock photos, if they were rendered in paint  they'd look like work by Rosenquist or Rauschenberg. A work like "Horizontal  Men" borrows a bit back from Robert Longo.  </P> <P> They're a lot prettier these days, but they decipher so easily you can't  remember them after leaving the gallery, and if you come back they are like  movies you've already seen. Baldessari is not so often showing his old capacity  for the surprising association -- like the one of the silhouette of a giant  pelican in the desert that was somehow certainly a poem about Jimmy Carter's  failed hostage-rescue attempt in Iran.  </P> <P> There are still queasy, surreal images like "Inventory," which equates a  railroad car of corpses with supermarket shelves. But too often these days you  get a B-movie image of a man and woman smiling at each other, their gaze  bridged by a wolf stalking across a log. Got it. The animal conflict lurking  beneath romance. It takes about 30 seconds each to take in his ecological  protests, the feminist polemics and anthropological ruminations.  </P> <P> Well, it's been a big 10 days for art: more trouble for the NEA, ghastly  burglary at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Getty's Van Gogh and  a major traveling Baldessari show.  </P> <P> The museum is closed today, but have a look later, and then pick the event that  will still make us feel good in 10 years.  </P></p>

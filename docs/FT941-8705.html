			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Papaya's new role as a contraceptive Eating a papaya fruit can be a powerful method of contraception in women. Scientific researchers at the University of Sussex, in Brighton, have shown that papain, an enzyme found in papaya, attacks progesterone, a critical hormone for conception and pregnancy. When the papain interacts with a particular protein in the blood it becomes up to 24 times as powerful as when in its natural state. The findings, which could lead to new methods of contraception, will not be news to women in India and Sri Lanka, who have been eating papaya for generations to prevent conception.

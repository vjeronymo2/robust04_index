			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome bucks the market Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome was the only company within the FT-SE 100 Index to remain in positive territory yesterday as the market took on board research suggesting that it could be a takeover target. The shares were up 16 at best and ended the day 12 higher at 598p with 3.1m shares traded. A note by US investment house Wertheim Schroder's arguing that Wellcome Trust, which owns 40 per cent of Wellcome, would be happy to see moves from a rival company ensured that few dealers were prepared to sell the stock. When New York opened, US buying pushed the stock higher. However, Wellcome claimed last night that there had been 'no significant change' in the US holding over the past month. UBS yesterday said that it considered Wellcome a buy on fundamental grounds regardless of takeover activity.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Maastricht vote lifts continental bourses SIGNS that Ireland had voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty gave a boost to most continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. Stockholm was closed for a holiday. FRANKFURT, which had been closed on Thursday for a public holiday, saw out yesterday's quadruple witching hour comfortably, swelling turnover to DM13.9bn. The FAZ index shed 0.91 to 705.48 at midsession while the DAX was 1.11 ahead at 1,772.89. On the week the indices lost 0.6 and 0.5 per cent respectively. The four contracts which expired simultaneously were the June DAX futures, options on the DAX future, options on 15 leading stocks and an option on the index. Technical trading dominated the session while the lack of corporate news kept dealing fairly quiet. Fashion group Escada registered another steep fall, down DM30 to DM275. The stock has been declining since the death of the group's founder earlier this month. It has shed more than 50 per cent of its value since February when it attained a 1992 high. Lufthansa gained DM4 to DM133, having fallen earlier in the week on worries that it might be affected by the transatlantic price war between airlines. Schering lost DM7.90 to DM711.20 and Hoechst fell DM3.10 to DM256.00, while Asko was down another DM11 to DM749. BASF advanced 60 pfg to DM245 and later said that its east German subsidiary was expected to make another loss in 1992. PARIS closed higher but off the day's best levels as Thursday's drop in the CAC 40 index below its 200-day moving average around 1,885 prompted investors to pick up bargains among the blue chips. The CAC 40 index went as high as 1,925.89 before closing up 22.12 at 1,913.92, for a fall of 0.7 per cent on the week. Turnover was steady at FFr2.7bn. Among the most active stocks, Michelin added FFr5.70 or 2.9 per cent to FFr199 and Alcatel added FFr13 to FFr630. Saint-Gobain picked up FFr6 to FFr567 while Eurotunnel jumped FFr1.15 or 3.4 per cent to FFr35.30 on speculative buying. MILAN ended slightly lower, but preliminary results from the Irish referendum in favour of European union lifted the market above its session lows. The lira, which had fallen earlier in the week on devaluation fears, also recovered strongly in response to the Irish results. The Comit index closed 1.91 down at 469.88, 1.1 per cent lower on the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's L86.7bn. Fiat, which had eased L33 to L5,315 lire at its official fixing, rallied to L5,425 after hours while Montedison, which shed L30 to L1,413 lire, bounced back to L1,432. But Italcementi, weighed down by its capital increase, fell L17 to L10,383. The most heavily traded stock on the telematico was Pirelli, which closed down L5 at L1,335 with 4.05m shares traded. AMSTERDAM was firmer with Philips shares regaining some of their value lost earlier in the week. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.7 to 126.5, but was down 2.3 per cent on the week. A number of analysts remain positive on Philips, noting that while the consumer electronics division is suffering difficult trading conditions, other areas of the group, such as lighting, should contribute good profit growth in 1992. It ended up Fl 1.20 at Fl 31.10. ZURICH gained ground in line with other bourses. The SMI index closed 6.8 higher at 1,869.3 but was 0.5 per cent down on the week. Lower domestic interest rates helped financial stocks, with Union Bank bearers up SFr10 at SFr3,710 and Swiss Bank bearers SFr4 higher at SFr264. Ciba-Geigy's registered share ended SFr30 lower at SFr3,250. OSLO fell again on Friday, for the 14th consecutive session. Prices were up in early morning trade on news of a likely 'yes' in the Irish referendum, but fell back later amid general pessimism. The all-share index was down 2.20 to 415.08, down 5 per cent on the week, in trading worth NKr381.6m. Shipping stocks fell the most, with the index dropping 6.51 to 374.74. Bergesen A shares lost NKr3 to NKr95.5 while its B shares were down NKr2.5 to NKr96. The industry index, which includes oil stocks, dropped 2.43 to 715.01. BRUSSELS closed slightly higher on a technical rebound as the Bel-20 index inched up 5.75 to 1,181.97, down 2.4 per cent on the week, in turnover of BFr753m. VIENNA fell sharply at the opening but recovered some of the losses by the end of the session. The ATX index closed 4.62 lower at 972.18, down 2.1 per cent on the week. MADRID's general index gained 2.98 to 249.49 for a 0.4 per cent rise on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1152.85  1154.59  1155.69  1156.08  1156.51  1156.94  1154.02  1154.66  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1157.42    Day's Low  1152.85  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jun 18      Jun 17    Jun 16    Jun 15    Jun 12 1145.88**   1158.46   1165.38   1159.75   1167.48  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ** Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Money Markets: Worries not over THE BUNDESBANK'S lifting of its discount rate by  3/4 point to 8.75 per cent caused no immediate tension in the sterling cash market, and the Bank of England continued to deal at the established intervention rates after the German announcement. Traders, however, said that the pound's performance on the foreign exchanges over the next week will decide whether period rates, or even the Bank of England's intervention policy, need to be firmer. Nor have fears disappeared about a rise in the Bundesbank's emergency Lombard rate, the most important determinant of short term rates. 'The possibility of further tightening by the Bundesbank cannot be ruled out,' said one analyst yesterday. 'The difference between the Lombard rate and the discount rate is now down to the lows of the early 1980s and, in those days, a discount rate rise was always followed by one in the Lombard.' Dealers said the possibility that Germany would tighten monetary policy yesterday had already been priced into the market, leaving the 3-month cash rate at 10 3/16 per cent by Wednesday night. By yesterday evening, the rate had softened to 10 1/8 per cent, reflecting relief in the market that the Lombard was unchanged. The 1-month rate for sterling cash remained at 10 1/8 per cent and the 1-year rate at 10 1/16 per cent. Sterling futures traders had a more turbulent day. Shortly before the news from the Bundesbank came through, the September contract traded up 10 basis points to 89.90, on rumours that Germany was leaving policy unchanged. The contract then sank back to around 89.82 as the real news arrived, but ended at 89.93, propelled by sterling's strong performance in the afternoon. The Bank of England's operations followed a morning forecast of Pounds 800m, and the Bank dealt at the established rates of 9 7/8 per cent for Bands 1 and 2, and 9 15/16 per cent for the repurchase agreements (repos). In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 150m of Band 2 bank bills, and Pounds 166m in a repo repayable on August 5 and 6. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 132m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 50m of Band 2 bank bills. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 195m.</p>

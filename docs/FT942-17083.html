			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Mexican interest rates rise Mexican interest rates rose sharply yesterday, pushed up by the rise in US bond yields and instability in the domestic political arena. Short-term rates on 28-day paper rose to 14.31 per cent, an increase of 2.7 percentage points on the day, and up from 8.81 per cent in late February. One year rates also rose to 13.66 per cent, a level not seen since last August. The steep rise in interest rates threatens to cut economic growth when the government had been hoping for a rapid recovery from recession before this August's presidential elections. However with the peso about 8 per cent weaker against the dollar than at the start of the year, and close to the limit permitted by the central bank, there was little choice but to let interest rates rise. A peso devaluation outside the current exchange rate band would be a serious political blow to the government. Yesterday the local currency strengthened slightly after the rise in rates, but closed at 3.36 to the dollar.</p>

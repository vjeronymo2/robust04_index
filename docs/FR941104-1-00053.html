			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fletchcraft Mfg. and Stahl's Traditional Archery supported restriction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or stopping of export of the species. Both companies advocate an ecologically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sustainable supply of POC wood for arrow manufacturing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other letters of opposition to the potential CITES proposal were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received within the comment period from Arcata Redwood Company, Douglas Timber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators, Reservation Ranch, Weyerhaeuser Company, Woodland Management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Professional Foresters, and the Association of Consulting Foresters of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> America. Also, Mr. D. Brattain of Reservation Ranch coordinated and led a POC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alliance mostly comprised of about 20 timber, lumber, and/or exporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> companies and also the Oregon International Port of Coos Bay, Coos Chapter of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Society of American Foresters, and Coos County Forestry Department, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted an extensive document including a detailed response against the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential proposal to list the POC in Appendix II, with supplementary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials on POC and its situation, including additional usually detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters of opposition from the Coos County Forestry Department, the Coos-Curry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric Cooperative, the [Coos] Bay Area Chamber of Commerce, a private POC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> landowner who also is a State Director for the Oregon Small Woodlands  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association, The Agnew Company, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Moore Mill &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lumber Company, Rough &amp; Ready Lumber Company, South Coast Lumber Company,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Spalding &amp; Son Lumber Manufacturers and Wholesalers, Westbrook Land and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Timber, Stuntzner Engineering &amp; Forestry, a USFS silviculturist_acting in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> private capacity_with 15 years of responsibility for POC management to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize spread and impact of the root-rot disease in a major National Forest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ranger District, the Oregon Chapter of the Association of Consulting Foresters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the Oregon Society of American Foresters, and the Natural Resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Group (Birmingham, Alabama).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oregon Department of Forestry expressed opposition to inclusion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this species in Appendix II. They stated that virtually all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercially valuable timber of the species is on Federal lands, that there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ample protection due to the extensive acreage of land set aside for various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservation purposes, and that there is a program in place that will limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage caused by the root disease on Federal lands and it is adequate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect the species. They also found that the ecosystem-based direction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management taken by Federal land-management agencies under the President's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Option 9'' plan is sufficient to protect this species in its ecosystems, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they expect that the volume of the type of material demanded in the export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market will be reduced because of implementation of this plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection stated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they advise private landowners on precautions to be taken to prevent spread of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the root rot, and that they generally have as a mitigation requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timber harvesting that the landowner follow the USFS policies and procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> They asked that the decision for or against a proposal to list under CITES be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to protect or prolong the biological and ecological viability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species in its natural range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The USFS recommended that the species not be added to Appendix II. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USFS provided detailed information (with detailed maps) about the species, its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilization, the water mold that infects POC and causes a virulent root  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disease, and the interagency program for Port-Orford-cedar conservation and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management [through the Interregional POC Coordinating Committee], which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> USFS chairs. The USFS stated that over 40 percent of the tree species' range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is in reserves protected from harvesting, that harvests have substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declined and growth now exceeds harvest and mortality, and that they have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> active range-wide interagency effort underway [and the Interregional Port-Orford Cedar Action Plan] to manage the species and the infectious fungus.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service carefully evaluated whether  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Chamaecyparis lawsoniana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> qualified for CITES Appendix II, and could benefit from export regulation by means of an Appendix II listing, which included a discussion of its situation at the CITES Plants Committee meeting held in Mexico in May 1994. The Service recognized that a significant portion of POC is in reserves that for various reasons are protected from harvesting (in some cases except for thinning and salvage cutting), that most of the species is on public lands under Federal management, and that there are meaningful efforts to harvest sustainably and to curtail the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Phytophthora  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> disease. The Service concluded that Federal and State regulatory mechanisms, governmental and private conservation actions, and endeavors particularly through the U.S. Forest Service to understand and to control the introduced disease now affecting some populations, were able to cope with this endemic species' present circumstances without the need for additional regulatory authority through use of this international treaty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Species Proposals Submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Saiga antelope ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Saiga tatarica <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). The EIA sent the Service a proposal to list both subspecies of the saiga antelope in Appendix I. The horns of the saiga antelope have been used in Asian traditional medicines. Saiga have also been utilized as a food source at varying levels of intensity depending on location and availability. The Mongolian Ministry of Nature and Environment provided a rather detailed account of the status and biology of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> S. t. mongolica,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which now exists in two small disjunct populations in Mongolia, one estimated at about 1400 individuals in 1993 and the other estimated at 125 animals in 1983. They recommended that this subspecies be listed in Appendix I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

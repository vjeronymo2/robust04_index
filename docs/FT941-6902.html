			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Yeltsin weakened by rebels' amnesty President Boris Yeltsin has emerged weakened and humiliated by the release of the leaders of last October's bloody parliamentary uprising in a debacle which says more about his own administration's incompetence than about the skill of his foes. Eight men - including Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president who masterminded the uprising and is likely to run for president in 1996 - walked free from Lefortovo prison on Saturday after a bungled presidential attempt to block the amnesty. Others freed included General Albert Makashov, who launched a bloody assault on Moscow's television tower, and Mr Alexander Barkashov, leader of a blackshirted neo-Nazi militia which marched around the White House and kept secret hideaways around town. Their release has prompted popular fears of new bloody confrontations such as that which cost 140 lives in October and placed Russia on the verge of civil war. At the very least it sends a message that such violence can be condoned in future, even if the likes of Mr Victor Anpilov, a hardline Communist who has vowed to continue pressing for communism's return, may find the political climate has changed. Because the bulk of the conservatives in the state duma (lower house of parliament) have sought to project a respectable non-violent appearance, the real danger comes from the indirect consequences of new threats, perceived and real, which may come from Russia's extremists. The release could strengthen the hand of those who think Russia needs a return to strong repressive rule. These include members of the president's entourage and Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky. It will also heighten fears of future instability at a time when the economy needs stability above anything. Mr Rutskoi's freedom in particular will provide Mr Yeltsin with a constant critic who can say that, strictly speaking, he is the country's legal president because Mr Yeltsin violated the constitution last October. Only the rebellion helped balance the picture, by portraying his opponents as dangerous men ready to stoop to mob violence. The amnesty now rehabilitates them. Perhaps most damaging was the evidence the debacle provided of incompetence in the president's entourage. The organisers of the rebellion, who said they were only defending the constitution, were released at the very moment the president's new assistant, Mr Georgy Satarov, was negotiating with the parliamentary chairman, Mr Ivan Rybkin, on postponing their release. Legalistic grounds for a postponement were contained in a letter from the president to Mr Rybkin saying the parliament had in fact pardoned the men when it only had the constitutional right to amnesty them. The letter to Mr Rybkin proposed that parliament do some more work on the amnesty before it could be implemented. As one former liberal cabinet minister pointed out: 'There are always tricks which the administration can produce to deal with such situations, except here it failed to deliver.' The letter containing the relevant 'trick' was delivered to parliament well after Mr Yuri Baturin, a lawyer who is the president's national security adviser, first came up with the formula, and after Mr Yeltsin ignored the amnesty in a state of the nation address. By Saturday, a deputy to Mr Alexei Kazannik, the prosecutor-general who resigned because he could not comply with Mr Yeltsin's requests to stop the amnesty, had already set in motion the process for their release. Mr Baturin and Mr Sergei Karaganov, a member of the president's advisory council, said the incompetence was Mr Kazannik's. Mr Kazannik is to be replaced by Mr Alexei Illyushenko, a presidential aide involved last summer in launching unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Rutskoi. Part of the blame must be shared by the president himself. Mr Yeltsin's desire to play the statesman devoted to national reconciliation meant that he failed to focus sufficiently early on the possible consequences of the amnesty.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Marin Todorov, former secretary of the </F> Sanctions Commission, by Lyubomira Nikolaeva; place and date not  given: "Additional Strict Measures Could Guarantee Embargo  Observance"]    [Text] [Nikolaeva] Mr. Todorov, does your dismissal mean  that Bulgaria is circumventing the Yugoembargo?    [Todorov] By no means. In the eyes of the international  public, this will confirm that the Bulgarian Government is  adopting additional measures on preventing any attempts to  violate the sanctions. Changing the commission's chairman will  not hurt Bulgaria's international status.    [Nikolaeva] You claim that you resigned at your own  initiative. Why did you resign?    [Todorov] An opinion was voiced that... perhaps the control  applied by the commission was not very efficient in the sense  that if someone implements steps aimed at violating the embargo,  this means that he thinks that the trade economic sanctions  could be violated. In this context, I thought it would be  better if another person replaced me. Perhaps he would adopt  stricter measures....    [Nikolaeva] In the past, you were chief of the prime  minister's office. Was your appointment as an adviser on  foreign economic issues and secretary of the Sanctions  Commission the result of a blunder on your part or an award?    [Todorov] As chief of the prime minister's office, I had to  deal with a broad range of issues, and I felt incompetent to  deal with some of those issues. Therefore, I asked to be  transferred to a job that I was more qualified for. I received  my new appointment in May, and I think that it was a useful  transfer.    [Nikolaeva] However, there are rumors that as secretary of  the commission, you favored certain companies and persons -- for  example, [former Deputy Prime Minister] Neycho Neev....    [Todorov] My conscience is clear and I am completely calm.  If ever I wanted to favor someone, I could not do so because  there was no mechanism that could facilitate it. The efficiency  of the control measures is another issue. It was discovered  that new additional measures must be adopted if our country is  to really implement its commitments to the United Nations and  the international community.    [Nikolaeva] Do you mean special services that will control  the customs officials?    [Todorov] I do not know; I was not consulted.    [Nikolaeva] Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev said that your  dismissal was decided after [Interior Minister] Viktor  Mikhaylov's report on attempts to violate the embargo....    [Todorov] I tried to be useful, especially in the area of  measures aimed at eliminating the losses and compensating for  damages. I am an economist and my area of specialization is  economic relations in the Balkans. As far as control is  concerned.... the real control is being implemented by border  guards and customs officials.    [Nikolaeva] What commission members are responsible for the  control?    [Todorov] The working group on implementing the sanctions is  in charge of the control.    [Nikolaeva] Who is the chief of this group?    [Todorov] Mr. Kulishev, deputy minister of finance and chief  of the "Customs" State Administration.    [Nikolaeva] However, you are the one who was fired. Do you  have any job offers -- for example, as a consultant for private  companies?    [Todorov] Well.... for the time being, at least, I have no  offers.</p>

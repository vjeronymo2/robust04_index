			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Observer: Gargantuan gift John Major has his Trollope; now Edouard Balladur has his Rabelais. France's prime minister has been given a nine-volume edition of the works of the frequently indecent renaissance author Rabelais, a (late) Christmas present from his ministers. Social affairs minister Simone Veil thought up the idea and Balladur's 29 ministers each coughed up FFr1,000 for the gift just in time for the beginning of 1994 - the 500th anniversary of Rabelais' birth - now designated the Year of Rabelais in France. Whether the rather austere Balladur will get the jokes - or if indeed the joke is upon him - remains to be seen.</p>

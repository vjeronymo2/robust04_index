			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Japan's profit trends boost recovery hopes Further evidence of a gradual strengthening of Japan's economic recovery emerged yesterday with figures showing better corporate profitability and a slight improvement in monetary conditions. A Ministry of Finance survey revealed that aggregate pre-tax profits at Japanese companies fell by just 0.2 per cent in the three months to the end of June compared with the same period last year. Earnings fell for four straight years from 1990 but the survey confirmed recent anecdotal evidence from companies that profits have hit bottom. Manufacturers re-ported sales higher by 0.3 per cent, and profits up by 7.6 per cent, the first increase for 13 quarters. Non-manufacturers' sales were up by 0.9 per cent, but profits fell by 3.9 per cent. The senior bureaucrat at the Finance Ministry, Mr Jiro Saito, said the survey was in line with recent official reports that suggested the economy was recovering from the long recession. 'The upturn in manufacturers' earnings is an especially bright factor,' said Mr Saito. However, the report also pointed to continuing declines in corporate investment. Capital spending during the quarter shrank by 16.8 per cent, with both manufacturers and non-manufacturers reporting substantial drops. The Bank of Japan announced yesterday that the basic measure of money supply grew in August for the third month in succession. M2 plus certificates of deposits expanded by 2.0 per cent in August compared with a year ago. But officials cautioned against over-optimism; the figure is still consistent with weak growth in overall liquidity. Changing patterns of consumer demand were reflected in figures published by a retailers' group. The Japan Department Stores' Association reported that sales at stores in the Tokyo area declined by 5.3 per cent in August from a year earlier, the 30th consecutive monthly drop. During the recession, more price-conscious consumers turned increasingly towards discounters, away from their traditional penchant for department stores. That trend appears to be continuing despite a recovery in personal disposable income in the last year.</p>

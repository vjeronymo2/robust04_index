			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: READERS HAVE THEIR SAY ON ABORTION DOCUMENTARY  </P> <P> We get letters. . . .  </P> <P> Today's bundle concerns Thursday's column ("Ted Turner Has His Say With  'Abortion: For Survival' ") on a program advocating, without opposition, the  pro-choice position in the abortion debate.  </P> <P> The program ran on Turner's cable superstation TBS, followed by a chaotic panel  discussion featuring two representatives from each side of the abortion issue.  The panel discussion was punctuated by taped pro-choice promos and marked by  moderator Martin Agronsky's utter helplessness in controlling the participants.  </P> <P> The letters:  </P> <P> I am especially upset over your assertion that anti-choice people have an  obligation to impose their views on the rest of society "if they truly believe,  rightly or wrongly, that abortion is murder."  </P> <P> The belief that abortion is murder is held almost entirely by people who base  this on a religious ground. I'm not trying to dismiss these people because of  this, but if you look at the issue with logic and some scientific  understanding, it's apparent that we are dealing with something in the process  of becoming a person, not something that is yet an individual life.  </P> <P> It is also important to remember that church and state in this country are  supposedly separate. If you believe that abortion is morally wrong, that is  your perfect right. But if you don't believe in the right of each woman to  decide for themselves, you believe in compulsory pregnancy.  </P> <P> You ask me to be angry that the pro-choice voice is given such wide exposure. I  find that absurd when the anti-choice forces are the most powerful and heavily  funded organization around, and their side is being forced on me by the  governor, the President and the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> CLAIRE MARSH,  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P> <P> </P> <P> Does the pro-choice factor get an opportunity to present its side whenever the  Pope or the President or other so-called leaders give their views about  abortion? Of course not.  </P> <P> Thus, it is only a whisper and a short span of time in TV when Ted Turner runs  "Abortion: For Survival." Obviously you never can and never will understand the  horrors of unwanted births and unwanted children -- all over the world.  </P> <P> Hooray for Ted Turner. He is to be congratulated. You are not.  </P> <P> ANNABEL WILSON,  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P> <P> </P> <P> You are just another one of the many conservatives working for the Los Angeles  Times, spreading anti-choice propaganda, and likely you are one of the many  white males who feel threatened that women are taking back their own  reproductive rights and power.  </P> <P> Let me ask you this: Are you willing and able to house the homeless and abused  children of this world that are living right now? Is our society ready to hold  men responsible for the child rearing in this country? Should we have also the  right to legislate men's bodies? How about mandatory castration for all men who  rape?  </P> <P> I say hooey to you and The Times.  </P> <P> DEBRA L. DEWEESE,  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P> </P> <P> I love the question you started your article with: "Is it really true that  abortion opponents dislike children and sex?" It is nothing less than ludicrous  for anyone, especially from the pro-death people who make a very profitable  business of killing the unborn child, to even hint that the pro-life are  against children. That is as ridiculous as saying Jews are against kosher food.  </P> <P> HARRY H. WILSON,  </P> <P> Cerritos  </P> <P> </P> <P> I really don't see why the anti-abortionists are demanding equal time, or why  Ted Turner should even consider offering them any time on "his" network. After  all, I don't see Paul Crouch or Pat Robertson offering any equal time for  opposing viewpoints on their respective networks, the Trinity Broadcasting  Network and the Christian Broadcasting Network.  </P> <P> LESLIE TYNDALL,  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P> <P> </P> <P> The next time Operation Rescue is in town, sir, please go to their warm-up  rally, usually the night before their Saturday actions to close clinics. I did  this past June.  </P> <P> For three hours, I listened to speaker after speaker literally demonize any and  all of the citizens who disagree with their position. I also listened to their  calls for the imposition of a theocracy in this country.  </P> <P> Where are the moderates? And where will our Bill of Rights go if these people  are successful? They do not believe in our Constitution, nor in separation of  church and state.  </P> <P> So I question, sir, your tacit support for true believers, while engaging in  the rhetoric of neutrality and using the cover of the journalists' middle  ground. The sad fact is that the pro-choice people, Ted Turner et al., are the  middle ground.  </P> <P> JAMES LASPINA,  </P> <P> Reseda  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ted Turner calling anti-abortionists "bozos" just doesn't go far enough.  Ignorant bozos would have been much better.  </P> <P> ANTHONY DEROSE,  </P> <P> West Hollywood  </P> <P> Those of us who are unable to accept the extremes on either side of the issue  seem to be a very small minority. I would like to know, though, how you tell  the difference between "excellent propaganda ('Abortion: For Survival')" and  "outrageously slanted propaganda ('The Silent Scream')."  </P> <P> Does the difference depend on your viewpoint?  </P> <P> W. F. RYLAARSDAM,  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

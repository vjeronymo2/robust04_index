			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Jejui, San Pedro Department by special </F> correspondents Esteban Acevedo, Judith Maria Vera, Eduardo  Franco and Agustin Gaona]    [Text] On 15 February, approximately 1,500 peasants blocked  General Elizardo Aquino Highway No. 3 near the bridge over the  Jejui River demanding better prices for their cotton. Police  personnel moved to repress the demonstrators but in the end an  agreement was reached to negotiate and the blockade was lifted.    A group of congressmen arrived at the site and signed an  agreement that addressed seven items. As a result of this  agreement the blockade was suspended until 21 February when  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy will meet with peasant union  representatives at Government House.    The main items of the agreement are the peasant's request to  have Agriculture minister Raul Torres and Agrarian Reform  Institute President Cancio Urbieta removed, and the price of  cotton increased to 1,500 guaranies per kilogram. The  congressmen promised to investigate the monopoly of Cadelpa  [Paraguayan Cotton Chamber] over the distribution of cotton  seeds and agrochemicals, and to study the possibility of  controlling the prices of basic staples.    As of 0900, some 1,500 peasants from various districts of  San  Pedro Department gathered at the southern end of the bridge over  the Jejui River. The main purpose of the demonstration was to  ask that the price of cotton, the cash crop which is being  harvested now, be set at 1,500 per kilogram.    At first the demonstrators said that they would not leave  until they received a concrete answer to their demands. They  were unable, however, to continue their demonstration because  PEO [Special Operations Police] troops used force to keep the  highway open, hurting a few people in the process.    At one point San Pedro Governor Erico Ybanez showed up and  tried to calm things down. Instead he heard loud criticism for  his lack of action to resolve the problems of the peasants.  Ybanez had to leave in a hurry harassed by the peasants who  kept accusing him of helping them only when he needs political  support.    A group of congressmen including Senators Elba Recalde, Pura  Aguero de Decoud, and Juan Manuel Peralta, and Deputy Jose  Vazquez Vazquez later arrived.    The legislators came to seek a quick agreement that would  reopen Highway No. 3. It was very obvious from the very  beginning that the peasants were not well organized, which led  to unnecessarily long discussions about what should done.    Each peasant representative talked about their concerns and  they all complained about the shortcomings of the  administration's agricultural policy, the lack of a clear-cut  cotton policy, and their ongoing woes caused by the low price of  agricultural crops and the high cost of living.    After a discussion that lasted more than four hours,  legislators and peasants finally reached a temporary agreement  by which the road block was lifted. The legislators promised  that President Wasmosy will meet with the cotton farmers.</p>

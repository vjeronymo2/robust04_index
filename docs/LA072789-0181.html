			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> MAJOR CRIMES UP 16%  </P> <P> Major crimes in West Covina -- including robbery, assault and theft -- have  increased almost 16% over last year, according to Police Chief Craig Meacham's  midyear report.  </P> <P> As of June, however, there had been decreases in the number of rapes and  burglaries.  </P> <P> Meacham's report, given to the City Council at Monday's meeting, notes that a  "correlation between substance abuse and major crimes can be established in the  majority of cases." The second biggest factor causing the increase was a rise  in street gang activity, Meacham said.  </P> <P> The largest increase was in theft, which shot up 28% over the number of  incidents last year. There has also been a 20% increase in the number of  robberies, and a 6% increases in assaults and car thefts.  </P> <P> Because of the increased criminal activity, police have made 3,792 arrests, a  12% increase over the same period last year.  </P> <P> Police response time has remained at a 4.9-minute average, considered excellent  for a city the size of West Covina, according to other law enforcement  officials. Over the last six months, police received a call for assistance  every 16.9 minutes, every day of the week.  </P></p>

			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Gunmen fire on supporters of Gamsakhurdia GUNMEN loyal to Georgia's new military council yesterday opened fire on several thousand people staging a rally in support of ousted President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, agencies report from Tbilisi. Several people were believed to have been wounded. It was the second time gunmen had fired on peaceful pro-Gamsakhurdia demonstrators. Last Friday, at least two people were killed and 25 wounded when men opened fire with machine guns on a rally held in defiance of the ban on public demonstrations. The latest violence came as Georgian rebels seeking the extradition of Mr Gamsakhurdia were reported to be holding talks on his fate with Armenia, where he has taken refuge. A local journalist said the two sides began negotiations in the Armenian border town of Idzhevan, where Mr Gamsakhurdia fled with 120 of his supporters on Monday. Mr Georgy Chanturia, leader of the opposition National Democratic Party, accused Mr Gamsakhurdia's men of killing and torturing prisoners during the two-week siege in the basement of the parliament building in central Tbilisi. A rebel spokesman was quoted as saying: 'Gamsakhurdia is a state criminal and must be sent back to face charges.' However, the Georgian news agency Yrinda quoted Georgia's acting defence minister, Mr Levan Sharashenidze, as saying that the two sides had agreed that the fugitive former President could remain in Armenia for the time being, but that his supporters had to be disarmed and sent back. The independent Interfax news agency reported that Mr Gamsakhurdia had asked Armenia to allow him to fly to the West but gave no specific destination. Journalists who witnessed the violence in Tbilisi said that after the demonstrators had passed a hotel, a group of eight to ten armed men - some wearing masks - appeared and formed a line across the street. They fired into the air and then some fired at the crowd. A freelance reporter working for Cable News Network said a group of armed men cornered him and three other journalists, forcing them to surrender their videotapes at gunpoint. Local media put the death toll in two weeks of fighting in the republic at up to 200 - the worst violence to hit the Soviet Union since the country broke apart last month. A senior Soviet army officer said two soldiers had been killed in an attack on their army car in the mountains near Tbilisi overnight. Mr Tengiz Sigua, acting prime minister of Georgia, said yesterday the situation was very bad, and there was a severe shortage of money. Armed bandits were roaming Tbilisi, and there were several shooting incidents between bandits and National Guardsmen loyal to the opposition. Mr Sigua, named by the rebels as a prospective prime minister in a provisional government, called for unity. 'There should be no vendettas,' he said in an address to the nation. 'We should unite in the process of political reconstruction.' The rebels' military council is due to hand over power to Mr Sigua's provisional goverment.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Royal Opera seeks talks over site blow THE Royal Opera House management is seeking an urgent meeting with Westminster City Council following rejection of part of the Pounds 150m development plans for the Covent Garden site. The council's planning committee voted unanimously against allowing the second phase of the four-stage development - a seven-storey building to include shops and a home for the Royal Ballet - to proceed without an assurance that sufficient funds were available to complete the project. Without the assurance, the committee will insist that the second phase be redesigned. The committee ruled that the proposed design of the new building would be acceptable if it formed part of the complete redevelopment approved in 1990, but that as an isolated building it would not fit in well with its surroundings. The slump in the property market has left the opera house with a shortfall in development funds, and the planning decision is a further blow. Officials, however, were not too downcast. They believe Pounds 60m of the Pounds 150m total will come from commercial development of the site, with the remaining Pounds 90m from public and private sources.</p>

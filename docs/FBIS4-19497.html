			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to a spokesman, the Federal  Office for the Protection of the Constitution [BfV] does not yet  know any details about the circumstances that led to the death  of a BfV official and his wife in Libya. The BfV spokesman  affirmed on Tuesday [19 April] that the terrorism expert and his  wife were found with serious injuries in Libya on 10 March, two  days after he had entered the country by car. On 9 April, a few  days after his wife's death, the BfV official died of his  injuries in a hospital near Tripoli.    As the spokesman added, the official had told his office  that  he would go on a five-week vacation to Cairo. Since the  beginning of the 1970's he had taken various vacation trips to  Arab countries. He also knew that the BfV prohibits any trip to  Libya.    Bonn security circles called it unlikely that official  Libyan  bodies might have been involved in the death of the BfV  official. This would contradict the efforts of the Libyan state  leaders for good relations with the FRG. In addition, it is  assumed that in such a case it would have been theoretically  possible to make the German official "disappear." The fact that  the injured couple was not robbed of any valuables and that  their car was found undamaged speaks against a robbery.  Perhaps, the Germans were involved in a conflict for a so far  unknown reason.    Speculations that the official was doing research on his own  -- perhaps regarding the bomb attack on the Pan-Am plane in 1988  over Lockerbie -- have been called "absurd and pure  imagination." There are "other and more effective ways" to do  that, it was said.</p>

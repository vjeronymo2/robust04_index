			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: Investors back Hafnia DKr2bn rights issue HAFNIA Holding, the parent of Denmark's second largest insurance group, last night avoided going into receivership by securing the backing of its institutional investors and main bankers for a DKr2bn rights issue today. The institutional investors said they and the banks would guarantee the issue after auditors worked through the weekend to establish the true state of the group's finances. This follows the revelation late on Friday that irregular dealings by a senior manager have cost Hafnia an estimated DKr350m (Dollars 59.9m). This means the group has a negative equity capital of DKr450m, according to a statement on Friday to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. However the group asked the exchange to lift the suspension of its share quotation, which took effect on Wednesday, to enable trading in a new rights share issue to begin today. Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman of the supervisory board, had said on Friday that the issue would only go ahead if investigations into the company's affairs did not to turn up any new skeletons. Until the investigation was completed, Mr Lavesen said he could not rule out anything, saying it was possible the group would have to go into receivership. The guarantors of the rights issue said they continued to support it, and the company's leading bankers were also prepared to continue their support for the time being. The latest chapter in Hafnia's drama began on Wednesday, when it was revealed that a deputy general manager, who has been dismissed, had committed the company, through a put option, to acquire shares in Interbank, a small Copenhagen niche bank, at DKr288m. Hafnia will incur a loss of DKr35m to DKr45m on the deal, it said. But on Friday Mr Lavesen said that further contracts for the purchase of shares - for later delivery at a price fixed in advance - had been found. The irregularities found so far could cost the company DKr350m. The contracts, said Mr Lavesen, who was brought in as chairman on June 2, had not been properly recorded in Hafnia's books and had not been known to the board. Meanwhile strategic investments in shares in Baltica, its domestic rival, and Skandia, Sweden's biggest insurer, are at the centre of Hafnia's problems. As the value of these holdings has collapsed, Hafnia Holding's equity has shrunk from more than DKr6bn to its present negative DKr450m in little more than a year. Police are investigating illegal intra-group borrowings to finance the strategic share investments as well as the irregularities revealed over the past few days.</p>

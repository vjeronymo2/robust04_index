			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Shenzhen agrees on more share issues after riots ANGRY INVESTORS were yesterday promised by officials in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen that they would get another chance to enter a lottery for new share issues after China's worst civil unrest since Tiananmen Square. Trading on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange - China's first stock market which opened in December 1990 - was suspended for both local and foreign investors after rioting on Monday night over alleged corruption in allocating share application forms. Exchange officials said they hoped to re-open the market today - when the local bottler of Pepsi Cola, Shebao, is due to be listed. China's other exchange, Shanghai, suffered an 11 per cent fall in prices of shares reserved for Chinese yesterday. China's cabinet met in emergency session in Beijing to discuss the riots and extra police were drafted in to Shenzhen to keep order. Mr Lau Gan, the cabinet secretary, was reported to have been sent to Shenzhen to assess the causes of the riot. Late last night, thousands of frustrated, weary people still stood in queues outside two banks in the city centre. Riot police swinging wooden clubs charged the crowds several times while other police dragged suspected queue jumpers out of the crowd and beat them. The outbreak of civil unrest has come at a delicate time for those in the Chinese leadership who advocate further economic reforms. A congress of the Communist party, which is widely expected to endorse plans for fast implementation of reforms promoted by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, will be convened in the autumn. The riot may be used by those opposed to the reforms to show the destabilising effects of market-oriented policies. Deng praised the Shenzhen market during a visit in January, but said that if the experiment did not work it could be closed. The rioting, which continued into the early hours yesterday, was the worst civil strife since pro-democracy demonstrators occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in June 1989. Over the weekend, an estimated 1m people flocked to the city to apply to join a lottery for new shares. Unsuccessful investors rampaged through the city. Demonstrators carried placards alleging corruption in the distribution of 5m application forms for the lottery for new share issues. Impasse or impetus, Page 17</p>

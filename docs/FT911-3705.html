			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: ITT starts year with 9.4% fall to Dollars 229m ITT, the US conglomerate with interests ranging from defence to insurance, yesterday reported a 9.4 per cent fall in first-quarter profits, to Dollars 229m after tax. Earnings per share also fell away, from Dollars 1.77 to Dollars 1.7, but, in both cases, comparisons were distorted by one-off items. On the one hand, the first quarter of 1991 took in portfolio gains of Dollars 35m - or 26 cents a share - mainly at ITT Hartford, the insurance arm. This contrasted with portfolio gains of Dollars 4m, or three cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. On the other hand, the first quarter of 1990 was boosted by an after-tax gain of Dollars 47m from the sale of the stake in Alcatel Alsthom. ITT said that without this item net income in the first quarter would have improved by 18 per cent. ITT said that its electronic components business improved on higher volumes and better efficiencies at ITT semiconductors. ITT Defence also had a better quarter due to more favourable margins on certain contracts.</p>

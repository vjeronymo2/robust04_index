			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Children (WIC) is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assistance Programs under 10.557 and is subject to Executive Order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local officials (7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart V, and final rule-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice published June 24, 1983 (48 FR 29114)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect with respect to any state or local laws, regulations or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies which conflict with its provisions or which would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Effective Date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhausted. In the WIC Program, the administrative procedures are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as follows: (1) local agencies and vendors_State agency hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures issued pursuant to 7 CFR &sect;246.18; (2) applicants and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants_State agency hearing procedures issued pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR &sect;246.9; (3) sanctions against State agencies (but not claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for repayment assessed against a State agency) pursuant to 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;246.19_administrative appeal in accordance with 7 CFR &sect;246.22;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (4) procurement by State or local agencies_administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal to the extent required by 7 CFR &sect;3016.36.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The WIC Program has consistently demonstrated its effectiveness in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promoting the health and nutritional well-being of low-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> women, infants and children at nutritional or medical risk, and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experienced large increases in its appropriation for the last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several years. Due to its success, the WIC Program is likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soon achieve ``full funding'' whereby it is estimated that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible women, infants and children who apply could obtain program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits. In moving toward the full funding objective, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department finds that its current food funding formula presents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impediments to funding equity and is so complex it is difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> execute and predict its results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Historically, WIC has never had enough funds to serve all who are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in need of, and eligible for, its benefits. Certain State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive levels of funding that allow them to serve more of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible populations than others. The concept of full funding for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIC, as set forth by the Administration, does not guarantee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unlimited funds nor does it establish the WIC Program as a federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entitlement program. As before, WIC must manage within a finite  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriation level. However, a fully funded WIC Program implies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the appropriation level will more adequately provide for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible persons who apply for benefits, and that each State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have an equal chance to serve their eligible population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, many State agencies are serving lesser proportions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their WIC-eligible population than other State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the formula must support growth among State agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which are now funded to serve a lesser proportion of their eligible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population, as well as allocate funds fairly among all State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies under a stable, fully funded program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, to better prepare the WIC Program for full funding, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department published a proposed rule on June 8, 1994 to revise the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> food funding formula in order to meet three major objectives: 1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide a greater share of funds to State agencies receiving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparatively less than their fair share of funds based on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> WIC income eligible population; 2) to simplify the food funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula and delete obsolete components; and 3) to maintain current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services to eligible participants that State agencies are serving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the extent funds are available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule provided for a 60-day comment period, which ended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on August 8, 1994. Thirty-six comment letters were received from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variety of sources, including State and local agencies, advocacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups and other public interest groups. The Department has given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all comments careful consideration in the development of this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule and would like to thank all commenters who responded to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

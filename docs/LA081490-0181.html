			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TROTTING, PACING CHAMPIONS CROWNED AT FAIR  </P> <P> Federal Arsenal and Cody won trotting championships, and Styling and Lake Hills  Texas were crowned pacing champions Monday on the first day of the Illinois  State Fair's five-day harness-racing meet.  </P> <P> The start of Monday's 15-race card was delayed two hours by overnight rains.  </P> <P> The track officially was listed as good, yet 11 of the 15 heats went in under  2:00.  </P> <P> Federal Arsenal arrived in Springfield with just one victory in seven starts  but cruised to victory in the $53,700 event for 2-year-old trotters.  </P> <P> Cody's success came as no surprise in the $42,700 race for 3-year-old trotting  colts. Cody won two straight heats and pushed the horse's record to seven  victories in 12 starts.  </P> <P> Styling, likewise, was no surprise winner -- except that he almost didn't  qualify for the race. After going off stride in his elimination heat and  lagging far behind, Styling caught the leaders past the half-mile mark only to  finish sixth -- the farthest back he could finish and still qualify for the  race.  </P> <P> Styling won in 1:55.4.  </P> <P> Owned by Gary Williams and Michael Salter of Davenport and Bettendrorf, Iowa,  Styling owns nine victories in 11 starts.  </P> <P> The day's biggest upset came in the $48,000 event for 3-year-old pacers. Lake  Hills Texas won in 1:56 and returned $58.40, 9.20 and 6.40.  </P></p>

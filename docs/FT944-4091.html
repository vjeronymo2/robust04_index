			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sugar market 'could go higher' The sugar market could move higher in coming months after breaking through a four-year high of 15 cents a pound recently, according to the latest analysis of the market by ED&amp;F Man, the London commodities house. 'In this situation, even routine offtake is enough to reinforce the underlying support for prices,' the report says. But a market report from the International Sugar Organisation, which represents the world's leading producers, cautions against expectations of big price increases. The organisation believes that price growth above 15 cents a pound will 'dry up physical demand from the price-sensitive importers which account for the lion's share of the world sugar trade'. Purchases from China have fuelled much of the excitement in the sugar market in recent months. The country is facing shortages of sugar after its second successive domestic shortfall in supply of over 1m tonnes. Russia is also likely to import sugar this season following a 40 per cent drop in the beet harvest to 1.5m tonnes. ED &amp; F. Man estimates consumption at 4.5m-4.8m tonnes, indicating a need for substantial imports. The sugar organisation estimates that the 1994-95 world sugar balance will be in deficit by 1.9m tonnes with production at 112.5m tonnes and consumption at 114.4m tonnes. But it points to the fact that the current and previous deficits must be viewed in the context of surplus output in the preceding two cycles. 'Thus the present situation is tight but we believe still manageable in statistical terms,' the organisation says. Man agrees that global supply tightness may have been exaggerated to some extent. But in the medium term points to 'further upside potential' on the back of Chinese, Russian and Middle Eastern offtake.</p>

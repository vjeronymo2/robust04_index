			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE DERIVATIVES markets continued weak with dealers having little of significance to focus on, writes Christopher Price. The June FT-SE 100 contract opened fairly firmly at 2,800, lifted by positive overnight sentiment from Wall Street. Wellcome had been in demand, stimulating the other drugs stocks and a consequent fillip when London opened. The figures from oil group BP were also said to have struck a positive note. However, the surge proved to be short-lived and June soon ran into sellers. It then began a slow drift downwards, punctuated by the odd bout of good two-way business, but eventually succumbing to the mildly negative tone in the market. Dealers say that with little corporate activity to focus on, the short-term was being dictated by the feeling that the equity market was oversold and was now in a period of correction. A lacklustre Wall Street failed to inspire any hint of a rally in the early afternoon and June closed at 2,783, 13 down on the previous session and around 4 points below its approximate fair value level of 7. Volume was slightly down on the previous day at 7,595 contracts. In stock options, BTR topped the list with 2,297 contracts traded. TSB followed on 1,549, then Lonrho on 1,525 and Eastern Electricity on 1,032 contracts.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / UK Company News: Fyffes silent on its rejection of IPounds 420m Dole bid FYFFES, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable distributor, remained tight-lipped at the weekend over the reasons for its rejection of the IPounds 420m take over bid by Dole, the California-based fresh fruit distributor, after a week of talks between the two managements. Mr Carl McCann, finance director at Fyffe's, was emphatic that discussions with Dole have been terminated, but was not prepared to go into any further details. He did point out, though, that it was the first time Fyffes had been the subject of a bid. Significantly, he did not describe it as 'hostile'. Reports at the weekend suggested that Dole's senior executives believed that the bid was going to be accepted, but then it fell at the last hurdle when rejected by Fyffes on Friday afternoon. The most likely reason is the surge in the price of Fyffes shares for two days prior to its announcement that it had received an approach 'which may or may not' lead to an offer to buy the company at 115p per share. Its shares closed at 122p on Friday. It is thought the board considered the bid undervalued the company, although according to weekend reports Dole is not prepared to go any higher. Main shareholders in Fyffes are the McCann family, which holds 9.3 per cent of the 280m ordinary shares in issue, and DCC, an Irish holding company led by Dublin entrepreneur Mr Jim Flavin, which owns 11 per cent. About 70 per cent is held by institutional holders according to brokers. DCC has been a strong supporter of the McCanns, helping them bring their original company, FII, to the stock market in 1981, and in their purchase of Fyffes in 1986. It has a seat on the board and is a financial adviser. Fyffes has been keen to expand into the market on the European mainland, and since its IPounds 60m rights issue in June 1991, has kept the market guessing over likely acquisitions. It suffered two setbacks last year when Del Monte was sold to a Mexican concern and when the ERM crisis forced it to abandon a IPounds 52m deal with Saba Trading. The company has some IPounds 90m in cash, and negligible debt. Last December two of the McCann directors sold off a quarter of their holding to repay borrowings, at a market low of 64p per share. DCC bought 7.7m of the 11m shares sold by the McCanns. Dole has been building up its banana interests in France, and clearly views Fyffes as a company which would mesh well into its European strategy.</p>

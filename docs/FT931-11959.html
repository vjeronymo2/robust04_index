			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Japanese paper groups in Y630bn merger OJI PAPER, Japan's biggest paper company, yesterday announced it was combining with Kanzaki Paper, the fifth largest, in one of Japan's largest industrial mergers. The merged group, linking the country's two most profitable paper companies, will have a market capitalisation of about Y630bn (Dollars 5.07bn). The move follows the decision by Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp to merge this April, creating Japan Paper Industries, the market leader. Oji said its merger with Kanzaki would create the industry's second largest group in terms of overall sales. However, the group would be the largest paper manufacturer with an annual output of 3.5m tonnes. The combined company would also be more profitable than Japan Paper Industries. Kanzaki is the country's largest coated paper manufacturer, a high-margin product. The terms of the merger are five Oji shares for six Kanzaki shares. On the Tokyo stock exchange, Kanzaki was trading up Y11 at Y615 and Oji down Y4 at Y871 before being suspended ahead of the official announcement. The paper industry has been particularly exposed to the economic slump, as it expanded capacity rapidly during the late 1980s, causing a severe glut amid the current fall in demand. Oji Paper said the industry faced the worst recession since the second world war. Demand was flat during 1992 and could decline this year. Japanese paper companies are struggling with high costs of wood and labour, and are also facing increasing environmental costs. The industry's plight has been exacerbated by increasing overseas pressure for an open Japanese domestic market. Last April, the Japanese government signed an agreement with the US to import more paper into its Dollars 27bn domestic paper and paperboard market. US companies presently have only 1.7 per cent of the market. 'These mergers are a fantastic device for closing down excess capacity, which is presently between 10 and 15 per cent above demand,' said Mr Thomas Clephane, partner at Morgan Stanley in New York. However, although the new company would rationalise some production facilities, Oji said it would not cut any staff. The difficulty in rationalisation through reducing personnel has made mergers among Japanese companies slow in producing positive results.</p>

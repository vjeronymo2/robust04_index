			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Eric Watkins: "Diminished Quantities of Oil </F> Discoveries in Yemen"]    [Text] Bernard Essotier, president of the Canadian  Occidental Petroleum Company, remains optimistic vis-a-vis the  Yemeni oil industry, despite the drop in amounts of new oil  discoveries in Yemen and the rising cost of continuing  exploration.    Essotier also insists that there are large reserves in  Yemen,  but conceded that the area's secrets cannot be known until  additional information is available. He says: "We are continuing  to work on an active program of exploration in the concession  area granted to us, where we can produce some oil. We still  expect to test small setups. We are working hard and actively to  complete this, because these wells are close to our existing  facilities."    In view of the fact that the drop in oil prices is  negatively  affecting the budget earmarked for exploration, the Canadian  company is not at present pushing to find large discoveries in  the remote parts of their concession area, which totals 37,500  square km [sq km]. Rather, it is concentrating on the smaller  discoveries, which can be incorporated economically into the  existing facilities.    It is worth mentioning that the oil fields and facilities  belonging to the Canadian company are located in the al-Masilah  region in Southern Yemen.    These facilities are connected by a 138 km pipeline south to  the port of al-Shuhayr on the coast of the Gulf of Aden.    The Canadian partner announced that, since the start of  production in September 1993, its concession area has produced  546 million barrels of oil. Production has reached an average of  135,000 barrels per day [bpd], i.e., one-third of Yemen's oil  production.    Despite Essotier's doubts that his company's production from  its producing fields will increase very much in the coming year,  he expressed optimism regarding increased oil discoveries in his  company's concession area. He said: "There are still good  quantities, particularly in the lower strata," referring to the  fact that solid rock bases are located under the higher  limestone formations, where oil is usually found. He added: "We  have one well that produces 8,000 bpd of excellent quality oil  in a natural smooth, stable flow. This indicates a broad area,  some of which is connected with others, which encourages us to  continue our activities."    In a related development, the Canadian company is exchanging  data with other companies that control nearby concession areas,  especially with the Clyde, Lasmo, and Nimeyer companies, active  to the north and northeast of the al-Masilah fields.    With regard to the Canadian company's discoveries, those  active in the oil business think that there is a not  inconsiderable amount of oil there, but they have so far been  unable to find conclusive evidence. In April 1993, the Total  Company announced the discovery of a field that could yield  12,000 bpd, located east of al-Masilah. North of al-Masilah, the  Clyde Company is currently evaluating results, after the recent  discovery of a field located close to the Canadian company's  concession.    It is said that Lasmo has so far dug three wells in which  nothing was found, while the Nimeyer Company has just begun to  implement its digging program.    With the diminishing possibily of finding major quantities  of  oil, the oil companyies, in order to assure economic  feasibility, will be obliged to gradually intensify their  exploration programs and concentrate their efforts on small  discoveries close to their present facilities.    Nevertheless, workers in the oil business insist that even  these modest exploration efforts might be economically  unfeasible, in view of the existing agreements with the Yemeni  Government, which stipulate participation in production.</p>

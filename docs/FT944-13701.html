			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities lower on drift by bonds, dollar Wall Street Most US share prices finished lower yesterday after stocks paralleled a uncertain drift by bonds, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.71 at 3,850.59, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up 0.69 at 461.52. Despite its slight gain, declining issues on the NYSE led advances by a two-to-one margin, on heavy volume of 326m shares. In the other leading markets, the Nasdaq composite closed down 2.95 at 758.26 and the American SE composite dipped 0.88 to 452.85. The Dow industrials began with a 16-point deficit, but managed to crawl back to their starting point by mid-morning thanks to some improvement in the bond market. Longer dated Treasuries, which were carrying their highest yields and lowest prices in more than two years, appreciated on the Conference Board's announcement that consumer confidence had sagged last month. But the ensuing bargain-hunting quickly petered out, and concerns over the weak dollar and monetary policy soon reasserted themselves. The blue chips began to slump anew, only to claw most of their way back by the close. Some stocks performed well, however, largely in response to a generally favourable tranche of earnings news. The second round of results from the energy group produced a few pleasant surprises. Texaco, one of the Dow components, gained Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 63 after it posted third-quarter net income of 98 cents, about 25 per cent better than analysts had forecast. Exxon, another Dow industrial, earned a late reward for better-than-expected results revealed during the previous session. The stock climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 60 3/8 . But it was Mobil, up Dollars 3 to Dollars 83 1/4 , which fared the best among the oil companies. Dean Witter Reynolds lifted its rating on the stock as the company completed a study on ways to cut costs and restructure its operations. USX-US Steel was marked down Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 3/8 even though its third quarter net, published after Monday's close, jumped to Dollars 1.11 from 41 cents a year earlier. By contrast, Eastman Kodak escaped unscathed after it posted earnings of 57 cents, well under forecast. The stock added Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 48, though it had fallen by nearly 11 per cent since mid-September on anticipation of just such a result. Sprint, the long-distance telephone company, slumped Dollars 1 1/2 3 to Dollars 33 1/4 after announcing a joint venture with Tele-Communications, Comcast and Cox Enterprises. In pharmaceuticals, Baxter International lost Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 on news that its third quarter net had fallen short of Wall Street expectations. Dr Pepper/Seven-Up jumped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 24 1/2 on the revelation of talks over a possible acquisition of the soft-drinks company by Cadbury Schweppes, whose ADRs receded Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 on the Nasdaq.</p>

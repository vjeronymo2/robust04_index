(the Act), in conformity with the standards jointly promulgated by the Attorney General and the Comptroller General in 4 CFR parts 101 through 105. The Act:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Requires the Secretary or his designee to attempt collection of all claims of the United States for money or property arising out of the activities of the Department; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Authorizes the Secretary or his designee to compromise claims that have not been referred to another executive or legislative agency for further collection action where the claim does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest, or to suspend or terminate collection action where it appears that no person liable on the claim has the present or prospective financial ability to pay any significant sum thereon or that the cost of collecting the claim is likely to exceed the amount of recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

Such a claim may not be subdivided to avoid the monetary ceiling established by the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Joining of two or more single claims in a demand upon a particular debtor for payment totaling more than $100,000 does not preclude compromise or termination of collection action with respect to any one of such claims that does not exceed $100,000 exclusive of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

When initial attempts at collection by the office having responsibility for such claims have not been fully successful, the claim file shall be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for Administration for further administrative collection procedures. Claims shall be referred to the Assistant Secretary for Administration well within the applicable statute of limitations (28 U.S.C. 2415 and 2416), but in no event more than 2 years after the claims accrued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACS MAKE A REPRESENTATIVE SHOWING IN O.C.  </P> <P> Three Orange County congressmen rank among California's top recipients of  political contributions from the energy and health-care industries, according  to a new study by Common Cause.  </P> <P> However, the study indicates that Orange County lawmakers rely less heavily  than most congressmen on special interest money. It also shows that political  action committee contributions to the county's conservative Republican  delegation came almost exclusively from business groups.  </P> <P> The Common Cause report analyzed contributions made by political action  committees -- called PACs -- to California's 45-member congressional delegation  from 1983 through 1988.  </P> <P> "What it shows is the extraordinary extent that special interest . . . money is  involved in congressional campaign financing," said Common Cause President Fred  Wertheimer. "The lobbying groups that put up the money to finance these  campaigns are getting special advantages over the average voter."  </P> <P> Common Cause is backing several measures that would restrict PAC contributions.  </P> <P> In Orange County, Reps. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton) and Robert K.  Dornan (R-Garden Grove) ranked sixth and eighth, respectively, on the list of  California representatives who received financial support from the energy  industry.  </P> <P> Dornan, however, was near the bottom of the list of overall PAC money  recipients, when the contributions were calculated as a percentage of their  total campaign contributions. In dollar terms, though, he was in the middle  tier, with a total of $400,582 from PACs.  </P> <P> Health-care political action committees contributed heavily to Dannemeyer and  Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), who represents southern Orange County.  Dannemeyer ranked seventh on the list of top health PAC recipients, while  Packard finished in eighth place.  </P> <P> A strong advocate of offshore oil drilling, Dannemeyer is a member of two key  subcommittees of the House Energy and Commerce Committee -- the energy and  power subcommittee and the panel on health and the environment.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer received $63,500 in contributions from energy PACs during the period  of the study, including contributions from Standard Oil of California, Shell  Oil Co., Mobil Corp. and Exxon Corp.  </P> <P> Although Packard does not serve on any health-related committees, he is a  former dentist and one of the few health professionals in Congress. Between  1983 and 1988, the American Medical Assn. and the American Dental Assn. alone  contributed nearly $34,000 to his campaigns.  </P> <P> Dornan is not a member of any energy-related committees, but he has supported  offshore oil drilling in the past. In an interview Thursday, he said he is  tempering that position in light of the overall reduction in global tensions in  recent months.  </P> <P> "I'm able to move closer to the position of a (Sen.) Pete Wilson," who opposes  oil drilling off the California coast, Dornan said. "The issue of our  dependence on foreign oil is not nearly as critical as it was six months ago."  </P> <P> On the issue of special-interest contributions, Dannemeyer said: "There's no  doubt in my mind that those of us who serve in the legislative arena will have  our voting records analyzed, and if we vote consistently with the concerns of a  particular industry, they're going to help us.  </P> <P> "Whether or not the prospect for support is going to influence how any of us  vote, I don't make that step in my thinking. There is an appearance, perhaps,  of a connection. In my case, it doesn't exist," Dannemeyer added.  </P> <P> Packard said he does not emphasize fund raising and is comfortable as long as  he relies more heavily on individual contributions than on money from political  action committees. He said he would not object to limits on PAC contributions.  </P> <P> Dornan said he could support legislation limiting the influence of political  action committees. However, he said he opposes the existing laws which limit  contributions from individuals.  </P> <P> "I think it's limiting freedom of speech to limit individual citizens," Dornan  said, "but PACs, I don't care what the limitation is, up to and including  abolition."  </P> <P> The issue of PAC money perhaps is less volatile in Orange County because Orange  County congressmen generally are less dependent on political action committees  than the rest of their California colleagues.  </P> <P> Dornan, who collected only 10% of his 1983-1988 political contributions from  PACs, ranked 42nd out of 44 in terms of the percentage of his dependence on  special interest money. (Rep. Gary Condit who won office in a special election  in 1989, was not included in the study.)  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) took in 17% of his total  contributions from PACs, putting him in 40th place. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher  (R-Lomita), who represents northwestern Orange County, finished 32nd, taking  34% of his money from PACs. Packard placed 26th, with PACs contributing 42% of  his total, while Dannemeyer followed in 25th place, with PACs accounting for  44% of his contributions.  </P> <P> In terms of actual dollars contributed by PACs in the five-year period, Dornan  finished 22nd, with PAC contributions of $400,582, followed by Dannemeyer, in  23rd place, with $380,167. Packard placed 27th, with $338,392. Cox and  Rohrabacher, who both were first elected in 1988, finished 41st and 42nd, with  respective totals of $190,648 and $175,074.  </P> <P> Staff writer Alan C.

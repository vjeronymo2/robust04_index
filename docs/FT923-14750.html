			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Philanthropy looks to the future: Alan Pike on Business in the Community, 10 years old this week SEVERAL hundred business leaders will on Wednesday tour the east end of London, where Booth founded the Salvation Army and Dr Barnardo his famous children's charity. This week's visitors will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of Business in the Community, which encourages companies to take social responsibilities as seriously as business ones. The most passionate advocates of corporate community involvement believe that a new social movement to rival those of reformers such as Booth and Barnardo is developing in Britain's boardrooms - a movement in which business acknowledges that it has responsibilities extending beyond the creation of wealth and employment. If this view is proved correct, the next 10 years may also see the business sector taking a stronger role in social policymaking. Business philanthropy is not new. There are few Victorian cities without industrial benefactors to thank for universities, libraries or housing estates. However, much of that activity disappeared with the development of the welfare state and the decline in family-owned businesses and regional head offices, although large companies continued to donate money to charity and support other activities outside their business interests. A new wave of corporate social activity began in the early 1980s in response to the effect of the last recession on industrial areas and youth employment. Enthusiasts for links between business and the community have spent their time since then trying to turn an array of piecemeal initiatives into a new dimension in business life. Many large companies are abandoning their traditionally ad hoc responses to charity and are developing more clearly focused, professionally managed community involvement policies. Mr David Grayson, director of the organisation's business strategy group, predicts that the next step will be the integration of community activities with all other aspects of a company's business. 'If the secondment of staff to voluntary organisations is linked to a company's broader personnel policy, and support for projects is integrated with its marketing strategy, it not only makes community affairs into a more mainstream business activity, it opens up much larger sections of a company's budget to community involvement policies.' Wednesday's visits will illustrate the striking variety of social projects for which the organisation drums up business support. Business leaders will see the conversion of a former public baths into a centre for people affected by Aids and HIV; a hostel for the homeless run on lines determined by the residents; and a range of training and small-business start-up schemes. These include Circus Space, which trains circus artistes, provides educational performances and is developing a disused power station in Hackney into a community centre. Research by the Charities Aid Foundation shows that 41 companies each gave more than Pounds 1m-worth of support to the voluntary sector last year. In most cases the bulk of it was in non-cash assistance such as staff secondments and equipment. Mr Grayson believes companies should also start trying to influence policy developments. 'In the US, companies are using experience gained from years of involvement in specific educational initiatives to begin speaking knowledgeably about the education system itself. You now get US companies putting forward proposals to the federal and state governments about how the education system should develop and change.' He cites Training and Enterprise Councils in England and Wales - and City Challenge, the government's urban regeneration programme - as examples of ways in which UK businesses are becoming involved in developing policy rather than supporting individual schemes. When companies support schemes in isolation, he says, the value of their contribution is reduced. He sees a need for the government to create initiatives which enable local authorities, voluntary organisations, businesses and other agencies to work together in a more co-ordinated approach to community action. Some companies, if they support community activities at all, still do so out of philanthropic motives and shrink from the idea of becoming partners with public agencies in social programmes. But Mr Grayson, summing up the organisation's first 10 years, says a growing number of business leaders are becoming more adventurous and more knowledgeable. 'Ten years ago,' he explains, 'any discussion about education usually consisted of industrialists blaming the schools because they were unhappy with the educational achievements of young recruits. 'Now you are far more likely to hear businesspeople, perhaps with experience of serving on Tec boards or as school governors, appreciating what happens in schools and arguing detailed policy points. That is an example of corporate community involvement making progress.'</p>

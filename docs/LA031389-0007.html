			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli soldiers killed two Palestinian guerrillas who entered Israel's  self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon on a mission to infiltrate the  Jewish state. The armed guerrillas were spotted on the edge of the security  zone, about five miles north of the Israeli border. No Israeli troops were  injured, military officials said. The radical Popular Front for the Liberation  of Palestine-General Command issued a statement saying the guerrillas were part  of a squad on a military operation. The confrontation, the third between  Palestinians and Israelis in less than three weeks, is expected to increase  Israeli demands that Washington halt its talks with the Palestine Liberation  Organization.  </P></p>

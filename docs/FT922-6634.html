			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Company register reform is urged CHAMBERS of Commerce are to press the government to support the establishment of a mandatory trading register for all companies along the lines already adopted by many EC countries. Representatives of the chambers are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, on June 8 to seek ministerial backing for a wide-ranging overhaul of the system of registration. The initiative is designed to simplify and speed up the process of company licensing and registration and to improve the flow of commercial information available. Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the Association of British Chambers of Commerce, told the association's conference in Brighton that British companies faced heavy burdens of compliance. The report of an association working party on the issue presented to the conference says there is widespread confusion and ignorance, particularly among new businesses, about regulatory and licensing requirements. Mr Brown said British companies had to compete with a culture which sought to inhibit business and had to deal with regulatory bodies which sometimes appeared set on preventing the creation of wealth. There was, he claimed, considerable scope for streamlining the process of obtaining registration or licences. The chambers were proposing - in place of the existing piecemeal approvals - a network of trading formalities centres where the registration process would be co-ordinated. The centres would provide a 'one-stop' entry point at which all businesses could quickly establish the necessary procedures for compliance. Chambers say many business opportunities are lost because of the 'information gap'.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: PRESSURED FOR AIR TIME  </P> <P> You'll pardon me if I don't have a clever beginning to this column. I don't  have time.  </P> <P> There are 24 hours in every day. I used to watch television six hours and 44  minutes a day, leaving me with 17 hours and 16 minutes.  </P> <P> After I scheduled seven hours and five minutes to sleep and two hours and 15  minutes to eat, I was left with only seven hours and 56 minutes to write.  </P> <P> Then we got cable television, and what with the news channel, first-run movies,  MTV, country-Western, spiritual, entertainment and sports, my viewing cut into  my workday. Then my husband said, "While you're watching that channel, you're  missing a good show on the other channel," so we bought a VCR so we could tape  one show and watch another.  </P> <P> But when do you watch the shows you've taped? So I took time away from my two  hours and 15 minutes eating time and ate in front of the TV set.  </P> <P> Naturally, we began to buy cassettes to fit the VCR. I bought Jane Fonda so I  could get my body in shape. However, I had to take time away from my seven  hours and five minutes of sleeping time.  </P> <P> On my birthday, a son rented two movies as a present. I panicked. They had to  be viewed by10 a.m. the next morning. Already I had a stack of taped shows that  I hadn't had time to view. I put the movies ahead of the tapes, rescheduled  Jane Fonda for 4 a.m., and watched "Terms of Endearment" and "Easy Money" at 5  and 7 a.m. It was close, but I made it.  </P> <P> As the weeks go on, I feel the pressure more and more. With the VCR taping  shows day and night, with my husband running from room to room,  channel-searching to see what we're missing, with the new cassettes on  everything from how to repair your plumbing to how to be more assertive, the  new films and video music, we're falling behind.  </P> <P> We're beginning to cut corners. We've got "60 Minutes" down to 30, "20/20" down  to 10/10, and anything on World War II we fast-forward because we know the  ending.  </P></p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Continental Air creditors file suit against Lorenzo CREDITORS of Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier and one in bankruptcy since late 1990, have filed a suit against Mr Frank Lorenzo, the airline's former chairman and chief executive. The suit, brought by the official creditors' committee, claims Dollars 180m in damages. Mr Lorenzo, known as a pugnacious union-buster and wily deal-maker, quit as Continental's boss in August 1990, although he remained a director. At that stage, he also sold the privately-owned Jet Capital company - in which he and other Jet Capital directors had an 80 per cent stake - to Scandinavian Airlines System. Jet Capital, in turn, held a big stake in Continental, and SAS ended up with 18.4 per cent of Continental's voting rights. However, before the end of 1990, Continental had sought protection under Chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code - a situation which still exists, although the airline has now filed a reorganisation scheme with the courts. Under this proposed plan, ordinary shareholders in the airline would get nothing - rendering SAS's equity stake worthless. The creditors' lawsuit alleges that Mr Lorenzo, Jet Capital and Mr Robert Snedeker, another Continental director, received Dollars 41.6m as a result of the series of transactions with SAS in August 1990. It suggests that the payments were made when Continental was already insolvent, breaching Mr Lorenzo's and Mr Snedeker's duties as directors of the company. It also argues that Mr Lorenzo and Mr Snedeker benefited from a preferential transfer which preceded the SAS deal. The creditors' committee stressed that SAS was not a defendant in the suit. Lawyers said the suit alleged a mixture of fraudulent conveyance, breaches of fiduciary duty and preferential transfer. Mr Lorenzo's Houston-based investment company said the businessman believed the actions cited in the creditors' complaint were 'perfectly appropriate and in the best interests of Continental'. It added that Mr Lorenzo and Mr Snedeker has been advised by lawyers that the suit was 'totally without merit'.</p>

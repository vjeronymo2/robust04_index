			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Jan. 11, IRNA -- The English daily `TEHRAN  TIMES' in its editorial here Tuesday [11 January] called for  cordial relations between Tehran and Riyadh to abort efforts by  small groups in both countries to create tension and crisis  between them. However, the daily noted that these groups are  not in decisive positions either in Tehran or Riyadh which have  always played key roles in OPEC since the creation of this  highly significant world economic organization.    "In the final analysis what counts is the decisions reached  at the level of the leaders of the two countries regarding the  creation of cordial relationships," the daily added.    The daily added that on the final days of 1993 oil prices  sank to the lowest level in the past five years and the average  price for OPEC oil basket stood at about dollars 12.67 making  serious difficulties for most of the petroleum exporting  countries.    In fact OPEC is the only international organization which  sets price on a single raw material that is produced mainly by a  number of the third world countries, the daily said. It added  that the industrially developed countries which had been  accustomed for too long to the arrogant assumption that it was  their natural right to determine prices both for the raw  material they imported from the third world as well as the  industrial commodities they exported to those countries, are  trying to weaken OPEC And undermine its very foundations.    The countries in the region, Iran and Saudi Arabia in  particular, realized the problems of the region, said the paper,  adding that its security needs will have to be settled and  resolved through peaceful cooperation among themselves. Once  the regional countries have learned to settle the basic issues  of the regional security through peaceful strategies, more  expanded cooperation such as preserving their natural right to  set the price of oil will automatically follow, it concluded.</p>

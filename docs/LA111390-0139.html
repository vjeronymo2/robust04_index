			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Laguna Playhouse has received two $5,000 grants for its Disabled Actors  Project from the BankAmerica Foundation and the McDonnell Douglas West  Employees Community Fund. The 2-year-old project trains young physically  challenged actors.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Toyota USA also contributed $5,000 to the project.  </P> <P> "We are especially proud that this particular program not only provides  cultural accessibility, but also acts as a therapeutic human service by  building self-esteem among youngsters overcoming a variety of physical  impairments," said David J. Knutsen, of BankAmerica's Laguna Beach branch.  </P> <P> The McDonnell Douglas grant was the first made by the fund to the Laguna  Playhouse. In another first-time grant, the Subaru of America Foundation  contributed $1,000 to the Playhouse for its Youth Theater.  </P> <P> More than $5,000 was raised Sunday at the Righteous Brothers' Hop in Fountain  Valley in an evening of entertainment to benefit Rainbows to End Hunger, the  Education Network and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Righteous  Brother Bill Medley headlined the event, which featured the bands After Hours  and Mystery School and performers Ken Orso and Mary Ekler.  </P></p>

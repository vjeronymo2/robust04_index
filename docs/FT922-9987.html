			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Arts: Ornette Coleman &amp; Prime Time - Jazz Whatever else you have heard about the harmolodic theory of jazz - the mention of it can still bring jazz buffs to blows - Ornette Coleman's agitato ensemble playing leaves an indelible mark on the musical memory. His technique, pioneered in the 1950s, has influenced musicians ever since. The term he invented for group improvisation, where each musician is in a different key, stands for harmony, movement and melody. All instruments play an equal but leading role and each works independently: but towards the same colourful end. The Prime Time band which has executed this theory since 1975 has traditionally employed a double (electric) rhythm section to beat the message home. On this tour, the band featured a keyboard player (David Bryant) and tablas (Badal Roy) in addition to electric bass (Al McDowell), two guitars (Kenny Wessel and Chris Rosenberg) and son Denardo Coleman on drums. The resulting new sound is no less challenging - the alternate meshing and colliding of instruments is still there - but with more spaces between. The movement (much of it provided by Denardo's demonic drumming) is as energetic but more approaches are made to melody and harmony than hitherto. The guitars and piano are often used to introduce a piece, working at a melody until Ornette appears on alto or tenor sax to chase it away with a wonderful blizzard of notes. In one number - there are no introductions - Chris Rosenberg picked out what sounded like Bach's cello Suite No. 1 for several minutes until Denardo came hammering across him with an industrial samba, Ornette hard on his heels with an almost straight calypso solo. While the keyboards provide an extra melodic dimension, the clack and bong percussion of Badal Roy's tablas add excitement and colour to the new group. The guitarists twitch and also play a kind of funk with the wah wah; the bass rumbles menacingly in McDowell's hands (and ultimately in Denardo's when the two swap jobs). Scribbling serenely among this controlled anarchy on saxophones or trumpet, resplendent in a suit apparently made from cooking foil, which dazzles under the spotlight, is Ornette. Thirty years after he dropped harmolodics on to an unsuspecting New York scene, the sight and sound of Ornette Coleman with the alto is still contemporary, modern and artistic. His most recent work is on the soundtrack for Cronenberg's Naked Lunch (Milan/BMG), recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra 'without order, sequence, key or strict tempo'. Seated and sawing frenziedly at the electric violin in front of Prime Time he remains fresh, vital and often baffling. Royal Festival Hall. Sponsor: Silk Cut</p>

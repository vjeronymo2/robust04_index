			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / International Company News: Arbed shuffles shareholdings ARBED, the Luxembourg steel group, has failed to find a third large shareholder to form an industrial partnership, Reuter reports from Brussels. However, it has completed a reshuffle of share-holdings with the Luxembourg state and Societe Generale de Belgique to establish the vehicle which will eventually form the partnership. The Luxembourg state and SGB have each transferred 440,000 shares to partnership vehicle Luxembourg Generale Arbed (LGA). This brought Luxembourg's stake in Arbed's voting stock to 31.87 per cent, or 34.11 per cent of total share capital. SGB's stake fell to 14.96 per cent of voting stock, or 19.33 per cent of total share capital. LGA owns 14.22 per cent of voting stock, or 12.45 per cent of share capital.</p>

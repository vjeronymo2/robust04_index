			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fu Gang (0265 0474) and Chen Yun (7115 5366)] </F>   [Excerpts] Beijing, 31 Jan (XINHUA) -- While covering news  at the State Administration for Industry and Commerce's Economic  Inspection Department, reporters noticed that department  Director Niu Hongrui had just received a letter. When he opened  it, he saw a congratulatory discount card. On the left lower  side of the card were printed these words: When mailing, this  card must be placed in a corresponding envelope. Holding up the  card, Niu Hongrui said to the reporters: This is called  "compelling other people to buy the designated product." It is  an act of unfair competition. [passage omitted]    In the past month or so, some gratifying changes have taken  place in the market order in our country. Niu Hongrui  summarized these changes as follows: 1) The momentum of  regional blockades has subsided somewhat. In the past,  authorities from many cities used administrative means to  restrict goods from other areas from entering their cities.  This practice particularly occurs more often on the eve of  festivals. This phenomenon has decreased now. For example, in  accordance with the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Inner  Mongolian autonomous regional government has rescinded  regulations restricting the sale of wool to places outside the  autonomous region. 2) When administrative organs for industry  and commerce were investigating unfair competition practices,  fewer people would come forward to plead for mercy. 3) Once  they were subject to investigation, the majority of people  involved would consciously acknowledge their wrongdoing and  accept punishment.    What about complaints of unfair competition and their  handling by administrative organs for industry and commerce? Ma  Yanling, deputy director of the Economic Inspection Department,  said: In the past month or so, administrative organs for  industry and commerce in various localities have received many  complaints, some of which have been registered, investigated,  and handled. For example, on the first day of implementation of  the "Law Against Unfair Competition," the Lanling Industrial  Trading Company of Hainan Province placed an advertisement about  its 1 million yuan lottery in HAINAN JINGJI BAO [HAINAN ECONOMIC  DAILY], designating 30,000 yuan for the special prize and 10,000  yuan for the first prize. However, the "Law Against Unfair  Competition" clearly stipulates that in promoting sales with  lottery tickets, the highest prize for the lottery must not  exceed 5,000 yuan. The Hainan Provincial Administration for  Industry and Commerce immediately suspended, according to law,  the company's sales with lottery tickets attached and fined it  10,000 yuan. [passage omitted]    In conclusion, Liu Hongrui told reporters: In accordance  with the requirements of a market economy, the State  Administration for Industry and Commerce will set up a fair  trade bureau, the main functions of which will be to supervise  transactions by major elements of the market; to check monopoly  and unfair competition; to investigate and handle, according to  law or on the basis of being authorized, cases involving  smuggling and selling of smuggled goods and other illegal  economic activities; to protect the rights and interests of  consumers according to law; to investigate and punish acts  seriously harming the rights and interests of consumers; to  supervise economic contracts according to law; and to guide the  work of contract arbitration organizations. The Fair Trade  Bureau is being organized.</p>

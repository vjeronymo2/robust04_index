			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government will resume official development  assistance (ODA) to Burma where there currently are moves toward  democratization. This will be the first ODA given to the  country since 1988. The Japanese Government recently exchanged  correspondence with the Burmese Government. As a first step,  Japan will provide the country with approximately 15 million yen  in March in the form of financial grant. Financial cooperation  will center on humanitarian aid such as medical equipment via  nongovernmental organizations (NGO's). The government has not  yet decided to start full-scale aid such as yen loans, but will  make a decision after watching the progress of the country's  democratization efforts. Japan's action is in contrast to that  of American and European nations, which are being cautious about  resuming aid to Burma.</p>

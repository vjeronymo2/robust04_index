			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LA QUINTA FAILS TO STOP LOS ALTOS' HEAVY HITTER  </P> <P> Playing in the Garden Grove League, the La Quinta High School boys' volleyball  team didn't play against any team with a hitter as powerful as Los Altos'  Raymond Thorsky.  </P> <P> And the Aztecs' introduction to the 6-foot-4 senior Tuesday night wasn't a  welcome one.  </P> <P> Thorsky had 31 kills to lead Los Altos to a 14-16, 15-6, 15-8, 15-7 victory  over La Quinta in the second round of the Southern Section 3-A playoffs at the  La Quinta gym.  </P> <P> "Thorsky's as good a hitter as we've seen," La Quinta Coach Larry James said.  "Of course, we play in the Garden Grove League and I don't mean to disparage  the league, but he's better than anyone else we've played against."  </P> <P> Los Altos Coach Dana Brega said Thorsky "had an off-night."  </P> <P> "He usually plays a lot better," Brega said. "He can hit better than that. I  thought he was a little inconsistent."  </P> <P> Thorsky had 10 kills and a stuff block in the second game as Los Altos erased a  3-0 deficit. Mike Allen added five of his 15 kills in the game.  </P> <P> James said La Quinta's short lineup -- the Aztecs have only one player taller  than 6-3 -- struggled against Los Altos' tall front line, which included 6-6  Brian Burgess and the 6-4 Thorsky.  </P> <P> La Quinta didn't appear to be intimidated by the height disadvantage early. The  Aztecs rallied from a 5-1 deficit in the first game behind seven kills by Green  to take a 14-10 lead.  </P> <P> But Los Altos fought off four game points and eventually tied the game at  14-14. But a Los Altos hitting error and a kill by Chris Doherty gave La Quinta  the victory.  </P> <P> "Los Altos started playing a lot better defense after the first game," James  said. "They just stood around a lot the first game."  </P> <P> Brega agreed.  </P> <P> "We start slow sometimes," Brega said. "We haven't been doing that a lot  lately. We didn't practice (Monday) and it seemed like we hadn't played in a  long time."  </P> <P> Paul Price had 16 kills and four blocks, Green had 13 kills and Doherty added  11 for La Quinta.  </P> <P> "I think we played reasonably well," James said. "We're not very big and they  were. We didn't pass well in the middle games and I think we lost some of our  composure at the end."  </P> <P> La Quinta hit two flat spots in the final two games.  </P> <P> Los Altos built an 8-1 lead in the third game, but La Quinta capitalized on  four errors and cut the deficit to 9-7. But a kill and a block by Burgess  helped Los Altos pull away for a 15-8 win.  </P> <P> Burgess' blocking and five La Quinta errors helped Los Altos pull away from a  6-6 tie in the fourth game.  </P> <P> In the 2-A division:  </P> <P> Santa Margarita 3, Simi Valley 2 -- Zak Pelzel had 13 kills and eight blocks as  host Santa Margarita (16-4) rallied for a 12-15, 12-15, 15-12, 15-9, 15-13  victory.  </P></p>

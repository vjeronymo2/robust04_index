			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WALES TRANSPLANT TO TEXAS MAKES CHAMPIONSHIP SPARKS FLY;  </P> <P> SMITHS GO HAMMER AND TONGS FOR WORLD TITLE IN CALGARY  </P> <P> They came from 10 nations -- 54 brawny blacksmiths all in their 20s, 30s and  40s except one, Jay Sharp, 68, of Salmon, Ida., the "grand old man of  horseshoeing," to compete in the 10th-annual World Championship Blacksmiths'  Competition.  </P> <P> They pulled red-hot steel from coal-fired forges that spiraled dense clouds of  smoke under a big tent at the Calgary Stampede. They shaped the glowing steel  into horseshoes with tongs and hammers.  </P> <P> The sound of hammers clanged against anvils as farriers spent four days  competing with one another in a dozen different events earlier this month.  </P> <P> They had come from Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Norway, Scotland,  Sweden, Switzerland, the United States and Wales for this Super Bowl, World  Series and Wimbledon of smiths. One Californian, Lee Green, 28, of Yucaipa, was  among the contestants.  </P> <P> And then there was Sharp, a living legend among farriers throughout the world,  three-time winner of the World Champion Forging Award, reputed to be the best  manufacturer of blacksmith tools on Earth.  </P> <P> "They ought to give me a senior citizen bonus," chortled Sharp between puffs on  his pipe. "Everyone I'm competing against is young enough to be my son,  grandson or great-grandson."  </P> <P> After all the fires in the portable forges were extinguished, after the smoke  cleared and the clanging ceased, Grant Moon, 26, a native of Wales, who  emigrated to Peaster, Tex., three years ago, was declared 1989 World Champion  Blacksmith and winner too of this year's World Champion forging award.  </P> <P> The World Champion Blacksmith title was for forging and shoeing, the World  Champion Forging Award strictly for specific forging competition. Allan Ferrie,  32, of Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, Scotland, was barely nosed out by Moon.  </P> <P> As World Champion Blacksmith, Moon won $1,000 and the coveted silver horseshoe  nail presented by Mustad, a 157-year-old Swedish firm, the world's largest  producer of horseshoe nails, sponsor of the competition. He won another $1,000  and a hand-crafted Jay Sharp striking hammer for being the World Forging  Champion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sharp Understudies  </P> <P> Sharp also presented a punch used for clipping toes of horses to the top  blacksmiths from each of the 10 competing countries. "The grand old man of  horseshoeing" handcrafted the toe clips at his back-yard blacksmith shop.  </P> <P> Many of the farriers in the competition have understudied the old master at his  school for advanced forging. Shayne Carter, now 28, from Draper, Utah, the 1984  World Champion Blacksmith, was a Sharp prodigy.  </P> <P> "I came to the United States in 1986 to spend three weeks with Jay at his place  in Idaho solely to enhance my chances of winning the World Championship  Blacksmith title," said Magne Delebekk, 28, of Kvastebyen, Norway. This was the  fifth time Delebekk has flown to the Calgary Stampede from Norway for the  blacksmith competition.  </P> <P> Ninety percent of the blacksmith tools used by the smiths in the World  Championship were hand-crafted by Sharp in his one-man shop in the tiny Idaho  town.  </P> <P> Sharp makes pritchels to punch holes in horseshoes, fullering hammers to make  creases in the shoes, fire tongs, toe clips, rounding hammers and various other  tools used in shoeing horses.  </P> <P> He has been a farrier since he was 13, shoeing his first horse on a ranch in  the Whitetank Mountains of Arizona. He rodeoed. He cowboyed. He spent four  years in the Navy in World War II. But most of his life has been devoted to  forging tools and shoeing horses.  </P> <P> He has a year of back orders for his tools from farriers throughout the United  States and 27 foreign countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stubborn as a Mule'  </P> <P> "Jay is stubborn as a mule. He refuses to hire any help. He bangs away on his  anvil seven days a week from sunup to sundown," said Rachel Sharp, his wife of  15 years. "I got him chained to his anvil. I let him off for lunch and dinner,"  she said, laughing.  </P> <P> She is Sharp's sixth wife and has outlasted the other five, his longest  previous marriage being seven years. Sharp said he never leaves his blacksmith  shop except for the four days each year he comes to the Calgary Stampede for  the championship competition.  </P> <P> Of about 40,000 farriers in the United States, 18 were entered in the World  Championship this year, with a like number from Canada. Bob Marshall of  Mission, British Columbia, has won the World Champion blacksmith title five  times; Dave Duckett and now Grant Moon, both Americans, have each won it twice.  </P> <P> For the spectators the variety of competitive events were fascinating to watch.  The "Eagle Eye," for example, saw all 54 contestants allowed 10 seconds each to  study the same hoof of the same horse, then required from memory to make a shoe  to fit that hoof within a 15-minute time limit. Judging was based on accuracy  and fit of the shoe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wide Selection of Shoes  </P> <P> The international competition used a wide range of horseshoes in the various  events, including German lateral, Welsh mining, mule shoes, Belgian hind, cow  hocked, Swiss side weight and French trotting horse.  </P> <P> The total prize money amounted to $7,800. Only Grant Moon, who won a total of  $3,000 for the two top titles and in other competition, made enough to pay  expenses.  </P> <P> Blacksmithing is an art dating back to when man first used steel and rode  horses. Competition among blacksmiths possibly has been going on since then. A  famous Norman Rockwell cover on the Saturday Evening Post in the 1930s showed  blacksmiths competing at a county fair.  </P> <P> But the competition at the Calgary Stampede, the Great Western outdoor show,  matches the top smiths from around the world, including, in particular, "the  grand old man of horseshoeing."  </P></p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Survey of Business Parks (6): Passion cooling rapidly - Supply and demand THE PASSION for business parks which drove builders and occupiers into a frenzy during the prosperous years is cooling rapidly. The affair clearly developed too far and too fast. Companies are no longer so impatient to rush out of crowded town centres into gleaming glass boxes on greenfield sites, and developers have to think again about wooing them with vast numbers of new buildings. That might be a blessing in disguise as there were always going to be more parks than the market could bear, even during a a surge in business. For some it is too late for a change of direction. They planned the wrong buildings or put the right ones in the wrong place, assuming that tenants would take what they were offered as long as it looked like a business park. It will be hard to fill this space, let alone achieve rents required to meet land prices which soared over Pounds 1m an acre in some over-heated parts of the south. Not every park is a potential disaster; in fact, the best are racking up rents comparable with neighbouring town centres. Nor has demand completely disappeared; tenants are merely taking longer to make up their minds. More than 10m sq ft was absorbed in 1990, but this was down by 20 per cent on the previous year and less than 1.5m sq ft has been taken up so far in 1991, according to the business space database compiled by Applied Property Research. Unfortunately this slowdown has coincided with an unstoppable surge of development which saw completions almost double to 15m sq ft in 1990 and provide for another 13.5m sq ft this year. Little new is being started without a pre-let but the cumulative stock is equivalent to more than 18 months' supply at present take-up rates, says APR. Gross figures hide wide variations in quality. 'We have been searching - along with other agents - for new buildings required by Nissan and Smith Kline and keep coming back to the same ones,' says Roger Saper at Jones Lang Wootton. 'There is very little around in the 100,000 sq ft bracket worth considering.' Sometimes the buildings cannot be faulted but are in locations which cannot compete for town centre tenants because of poor communications or amenities. Jonathan Walters of Hunting Gate Developments points to office buildings on industrial sites 'masquerading as business parks' which would remain unlet for a considerable time even when the economy recovers. His own project, the 760,000 sq ft Shire Park in Welwyn Garden City, had proven the importance of careful planning and location, he says, drawing names such as Digital and ICI. Only about a dozen schemes are true business parks, and they are due to provide around 15m sq ft within five years, 6m of which has already been taken, according to James Donald of Strutt &amp; Parker. A similar amount is in the planning pipeline and will take 10 years to feed through. 'Demand for true parks will continue to exceed supply for the foreseeable future,' he says. But what happens to the 'false' parks. Lesser schemes could be forced to revert to warehousing and industry, even though office prices were paid for the land. The economics may not always be too steep a problem, says Mr Saper, as rents for warehousing west of London have grown into double figures. 'But there is still a lot of pain to be disclosed following imprudent purchases during the boom,' adds Mr Walters. Forced or not, a move away from pure offices would bring a welcome return to the distinction with industry/warehousing parks which was lost in the fervour of the property boom. APR says 70 per cent of the buildings now being constructed are pure offices, most of them concentrated in the south-east. However, difficulties may be in store for even the most successful office parks. Some sprang from the relaxation of planning regulations in 1987 which enabled flexible-use buildings to be provided for high-tech companies needing a combination of offices, storage and production space. As values soar over Pounds 30 a sq ft, those tenants will be considering the sense of paying such high rents for non-office space. A new surge of relocation off these parks could be in store as rent reviews come up, say Fiona Denby and Ian Scott at Fletcher King. They see an opportunity for re-emergence of the high-office shed - once dubbed mid-tech but now labelled more accurately as 'flex-tech'. These provide up to 50 per cent office content at the front but a shed with six-metre eaves and roller doors behind. The flexible use conforms to original intentions in the planning changes but rents are closer to industry than offices. For instance, at Slough Estates' Winnersh Triangle in Reading and Burton Property's City Park in Welwyn, costs are around 60 per cent of equivalent office space. One danger is reverting too far. Denby and Scott emphasise the need to maintain advances made in parking provision, landscaping and building materials since the days of the bog-standard trading estate. Future large-scale business centres - dubbed 'fourth generation' parks - will probably have to provide a mix of pure office and multi-use facilities, separated into sub-parks but sharing similar communal amenities and low-density sites. Some flexibility is already being built into parks such as Aztec West, near Bristol, where Arlington has recognised the need for smaller office buildings. Set around courtyards and lakes with wine bars, leisure clubs and cafes, the aim is to provide an intimacy redolent of the town centre. The fact that tenants are willing to pay town-centre rents of Pounds 16.75 a sq ft shows the success of such innovations. The popularity of business parks seems assured. Some big deals are in the pipeline, particularly in the pharmaceutical, food and drink sectors, which are gearing up for the single European market. Almost 40 per cent of park tenants are planning to expand and a queue of others ready to move in, says Andrew Jackson of Weatherall Green &amp; Smith. Spectacular figures for potential overall supply become almost irrelevant, as they take no account of widely varying quality. Usually it is only experienced developers such as Speyhawk, Trafalgar House and Arlington who can provide the standards necessary to attract employers. 'The landscaping, leisure clubs and shopping are not just for decoration. Companies need them to sell the idea of relocation to employees used to city centre facilities,' says Peter Mantle of Jones Lang Wootton. That is why designers harp on about a minimum size for these parks; only the big ones can afford this sort of service. The rest may be better off looking for a different sort of customer.</p>

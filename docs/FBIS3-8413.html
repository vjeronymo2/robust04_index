			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 7 (CTK) -- The government  coalition of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and  the Slovak National Party (SNS) is seeking the support of  parliamentary parties for early elections being held in June and  for stabilization of the government, Premier Vladimir Meciar  said on Monday [7 March].    The HZDS has informed its coalition partner, the SNS, of its  talks with the opposition Democratic Left Party (SDL) to be held  this evening, Meciar said. He declined, however, to give  details on the content of the forthcoming talks, arguing that it  was to be only "the first official meeting."    The SNS considers calling early elections as soon as  possible  to be a pre-condition for stabilizing the situation in Slovakia,  SNS Chairman Jan Slota said. On the SDL negative stand  concerning its participation in a coalition with Slota, Slota  said that "the party is the party and Slota is Slota." He said  that "the Slovak part of the SDL" was aware of the necessity for  early elections to be held in June due above all to economic  reasons. "It is clear who in the SDL's deputies' group is of  what nationality," Slota said regarding the opposition left  party.    Meciar said that coalition talks to be held Tuesday would  concern the staffing of the foreign ministry and privatization  ministry. After the dismissal of Jozef Moravcik as foreign  minister President Kovac refused to appoint Jozef Prokes, SNS  honorary chairman and deputy premier, as a new foreign minister.    Kovac demanded that the post of the minister of the  administration of national property and its privatization be  also filled. Meciar had been charged with managing the ministry  earlier when the president refused to name Ivan Lexa, the state  secretary in the Privatization Ministry and Meciar's close  co-worker, the new privatization minister.</p>

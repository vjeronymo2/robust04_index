			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Spain's steel aid backed by Brussels THE European Commission has backed Spanish government plans to restructure the steel industry in the north of the country. Spanish officials in Brussels said yesterday they were happy with the decision to recommend approval of Ecu2.82bn (Pounds 2.16bn) of aid to CSI, the state-owned holding company. But the Commission's decision must now be approved unanimously by EC member states, two of which - Germany and Italy - are still negotiating with Brussels about subsidies to their state-owned steelmakers. In particular, the Commission faces a damaging political row with Germany if it does not approve plans to subsidise the building of new steelmaking capacity at the Ekostahl plant in east Germany. Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister, acknowledged yesterday that his efforts to block new subsidies for the Italian and Spanish steel industries had caused friction between Germany and its EC partners. Bonn has argued that because the aid to Ekostahl would be given only once in connection with the privatisation of the former communist companies, it could not be placed in the same category as subsidies for Spanish and Italian steel companies. 'We have good arguments why Eko is different,' Mr Rexrodt said yesterday. Industry ministers will next meet in November for what could be their only chance to vote on the Italian, Spanish and German subsidies. The Commission's ambitious plan to revive the ailing EC steel industry will fail if the subsidy issue is not resolved, because private steelmakers will not agree to capacity cuts if the market still appears to be distorted by state aid. The Commission said yesterday it hoped that by approving the Spanish plan, the whole steel industry would be encouraged to present firm restructuring proposals. The original deadline for the submission of capacity reduction plans was today. The Commission's reluctance to agree the original plan for CSI a year ago angered Basque and Asturian steelworkers, who would have borne the brunt of cuts. Formal approval of the programme still depends on the fulfilment of tough conditions. The Spanish authorities must make 'irreversible' cuts in capacity; bring forward closure of the Anzio steel plant; and convince Brussels that a majority of funding for building new capacity at Sestao comes from private investors. Meanwhile, private producers have been driven into loss by the effects of recession, overcapacity and low prices. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, is set to propose a formal investigation into a FFr2.5bn (Pounds 280m) capital injection for Bull, the French computer manufacturer, granted earlier this year by the previous French government. He would ask commissioners to back his call for an inquiry next week. Only last year, Brussels approved FFr6.6bn of subsidies for Bull, on the grounds that FFr2.6bn was research funding, and the rest was justified to help return the company to profitability.</p>

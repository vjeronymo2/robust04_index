			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Travel: Nepal beckons keen trekkers - Practical Traveller THERE ARE many reasons to go to Nepal, but trekking is one of the best. Whether your aim is to live out macho fantasies as a latter-day Edmund Hillary or to amble lackadaisically through the Himalayan foothills, Nepal - home to eight of the world's 10 highest peaks - offers an unmatched range of options. There are two basic types of trek. First is the teahouse variety where one follows well-worn mountain paths, staying at lodges-cum-restaurants dotted along the way. Teahouse expeditions suit independently-minded travellers who are wary of joining a group. Staying in lodges may also bring you into closer contact with the Nepalese who inhabit the mountains in surprisingly large numbers. For the first-time trekker, going it alone effectively confines you to two regions - the Annapurnas and the hills around Khatmandu. The latter is often overlooked, but offers scenic rewards. Going to Everest alone is possible, but tricky. About three-quarters of trekkers make for Annapurna, an area of often spectacular beauty where lurid green rice terraces, yellow bamboo, white mountains and yelling children vie for your attention. Annapurna treks start in Pokhara, an eight-hour bus journey or a short flight west of Khatmandu. Flying (Pounds 40) affords magnificent views. Book early and ask for a seat on the right of the aircraft. You will need a trekking permit (which includes a conservation fee), available from the central immigration office in Khatmandu or Pokhara. The latter is reputed to be slightly saner. There are several Annapurna treks, the best-known of which are the Annapurna Sanctuary (9-12 days), the Jomosom trek (14 days) and the Annapurna Circuit (16-21 days). You may wish to hire porters (Pounds 3 a day) and an English-speaking guide (Pounds 5). Ask at any Pokhara hotel or trekking agency. Mountain lodges, which are fairly spartan, are unlikely to cost more than Pounds 5 including food. Accommodation is usually in dormitories (there are some double rooms) and you will need a sleeping bag. Other essential items to take include trainers (or worn-in hiking boots), sturdy backpack, torch, medical kit, high-factor suntan cream, hat or cap, waterproof jacket, lightweight pullover and sunglasses. The alternative to going it alone is to join a group, which makes it much easier to visit Everest and remoter areas in the east and west. Expeditions with Sherpa guides and porters are generally more luxurious than the teahouse alternative. Porters carry your backpack, tents are erected for you, food prepared and tea and hot water (for washing) brought to your tentside in the morning. Food, usually prepared on kerosene burners to avoid deforestation, is often surprisingly sophisticated. I went with London-based Promotion Nepal (tel: 071-229-3528), which offers treks in all parts of the country. Its Classic Everest Trek (Pounds 886 for 20 days) approaches the mountain from Solu, the route followed by Edmund Hillary in 1953, and ascends the Khumbu region to 18,000ft. A 28-day trek on the Tibetan border of far western Nepal works out at Pounds 1,595 per person. International flights on Royal Nepal Airlines cost a further Pounds 630. Sherpa Expeditions (081-577-2717) grades its treks: A-types take less than eight days and can be tackled by anyone able to run for a bus, while D's (the most difficult) are for hardy souls used to mountain walking. Sherpa's Manaslu High Trek (21 days' walking) visits a previously restricted area in central Nepal and costs just under Pounds 2,000 including flights. Other UK-based operators are: Exodus (081-673-0859); Classic Nepal (0773-873497); Five Valleys Treks (0752-567617); Himalayan Quest (0926-450835); Himalayan Kingdoms (0272-237163) and Worldsaway (0373-827914). The best time to trek is October and November when the air is clear and the vegetation lush. December to February may be cold at high altitudes. In spring you need to go quite high to get above the haze. Monsoon time (June to late-September) should be avoided unless you like leeches.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to the nation by President Yoweri Museveni; place </F> and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] Fellow Ugandans, the 28th day of March 1994 is the  day when elections for the Constituent Assembly [CA] will take  place. It is an important day for our country as it marks the  culmination of a long process in our people's participation to  make a new constitution, a constitution that will lay a firm  foundation for a democratic governance and ensure a stable  future for our country. You started this process when you  presented your views in your constitutional memoranda to the  Constituent Assembly commission. Now the time has come to elect  those who will represent your views in the Constituent Assembly.    I, therefore, appeal to you fellow Ugandans who registered  to  vote to turn out in large numbers and vote. By turning out to  vote in big numbers, you will ensure that the right people get  elected to represent your views in the Constituent Assembly.    The NRM [National Resistance Movement] government is  committed to ensuring that we have successful Constituent  Assembly elections. As you know, part of the turmoil our country  has gone through has been on account of rigged elections.  Rigging elections means robbing the will of the people to chart  out their own future and to determine their own destiny.    Therefore, the NRM government is determined to ensure that  no  rigging takes place in these elections. We passed the  Constituent Assembly statute in the NRC [National Resistance  Council] with this in mind. Where, for example, there used to  be a number of ballot boxes, we have provided for one. Where  casting a ballot would be done in a voting booth where all types  of electoral mischiefs could be committed, we have provided that  voting be done in full view of the people but far enough to  ensure secrecy for the voter. Where ballot papers would be  ferried to be counted at one central point, we have provided  that counting of votes must be done at the polling station and  on the same day. In an effort to prevent gerrymandering of  constituencies, we have provided that the county should be the  best constituency unit.    All this and more is evidence of our resolve to put to an  end  the bad habit of rigging elections. I am informed, however,  that a good number of our people are already addicted to  election rigging, that it is almost impossible, according to  these people, to conduct free elections. Complaints about  partisan returning officers and presiding officers who violate  every requirement for impartiality have reached me. I am  appealing to these people and also warning them to change their  ways and act in an impartial manner as is expected of them and  as the law provides; otherwise, the full force of the law will  be brought down on any electoral official who misconducts  himself or herself in the performance of his or her duties.    I also call upon the RC's [Resistance Councils] to document  every malpractice they may witness in the performance of duties  by the returning officers or presiding officers so that they  make it available to the legal machinery after the elections or  even during the elections. We shall not condone or give quarter  to anyone who engages in electoral malpractices.    I have been assured that sufficient preparations have been  made to ensure the smooth holding of these elections. In a  society such as ours, where technological and communications  problems prevail, it may not be possible to rule out possible  last-minute hitches here and there. Where such unforeseen  problems arise, the commissioner of the Constituent Assembly  will no doubt put in place practical measures consistent with  the CA statute.    I have heard that there are fears in some quarters that some  people may disrupt these elections. I wish to assure the whole  country that security measures are well in place and no one will  be able to disrupt these elections. Anyone who harbors the idea  of disrupting these elections and tries to do so will be dealt  with decisively. Please take no heed of anybody spreading this  kind of rumor, but instead go to the polling station and vote  for the candidate of your choice.    To the CA candidates: (?Put) an end your long and hard  struggle to win the hearts of the people for your election. All  of you cannot win and inevitably, many of you are bound to lose.  Therefore, those of you who lose should know that it is the  verdict of the people and should respect it. And those of you  who win should appreciate the responsibility that the people  have entrusted to you and the challenge that this entails. I  wish you all successful CA elections. Thank you very much.</p>

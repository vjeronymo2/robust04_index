			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK growth hits six-year high The UK economy grew at its fastest rate for six years in the second quarter of this year, while the balance-of-payments deficit fell to its lowest level since 1987. The figures provide further evidence for the increasingly healthy nature of the recovery. Household budgets suffered, though, as the recent tax rises contributed to the sharpest quarterly fall in the level of personal disposable incomes for 15 years. The squeeze on consumers may explain why economic growth has not yet translated into a widespread 'feelgood' factor. However, statistics from the Central Statistical Office yesterday also suggested that economic recovery was now being 're-balanced', away from consumer-led growth and towards a more healthy export and industry-driven recovery. Gross domestic product was 1.1 per cent higher in the second quarter of the year, compared with the first quarter, and 3.8 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. The figure was higher than the government's previous estimates of year-on-year growth of 3.7 per cent, and faster than most previous City estimates. Although many economists believe growth will moderate this year, the unexpected strength of the recovery provides further support for the government's controversial decision to raise bank base rates to 5.75 per cent to reduce any inflation pressures created by this rapid expansion. In another fillip for the government, the UK current-account deficit narrowed in the second quarter of the year to Pounds 700m as exports rose, imports fell slightly, and overseas investment flowed into Britain. The drop was welcomed by the City, where many economists had feared that the deficit would worsen dramatically this year as growing demand sucked in imports. The Treasury dubbed the figures 'very encouraging'. The rapid surge in exports, officials noted, suggested that UK manufacturers were becoming increasingly competitive and may be reaping the benefits of sterling's devaluation after the UK's exit from the European Exchange Rate mechanism in 1992. One beneficiary was the corporate sector, which reported record levels of profit and financial surplus in the second quarter. Meanwhile, real personal disposable income, measured in current prices, fell 1.8 per cent between the first and second quarters - the fastest quarterly drop since 1981. Compared with the same period a year ago, disposable incomes were 1.2 per cent lower. The CSO said the fall reflected tax rises and a small overall drop in employment incomes. The population responded by reducing spending and saving, and increasing borrowing. The personal-sector savings ratio fell to 9.3 per cent in the second quarter of the year, from 11 per cent in the first quarter - the largest quarterly drop for eight years. Total consumer spending growth slowed to 0.2 per cent between the first and second quarters, down from the government's previous estimate of 0.4 per cent growth. The squeeze on household incomes may add to political pressure on Mr Kenneth Clarke to hold back from further tax measures in the November budget, amid Conservative party concerns that the recent economic growth has not translated into greater political support for the government. Nevertheless, City economists argued that although consumer spending was likely to fall further this year, the growth in exports would more than offset that, creating a healthier and more sustainable recovery.

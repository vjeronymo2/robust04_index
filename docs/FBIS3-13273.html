It accused Israel of being behind such  deceptive lies.    In the first comment on reports about a message received by  Syrian Jews from sources claiming to belong to the Syrian  Islamic Party for Justice and saying that it is permissible to  spill Jewish blood, a Syrian official said that no such name  exists at all.    He added that the claims by American Jewish organizations  that Jews in Syria were threatened and are facing the danger of  revenge for the Hebron massacre, and the crocodile tears shed  for the Jews of Syria by Israel and its Jewish organizations,  from whom the American Jewish organizations get their orders,  are all part of the continuous attempts to confuse and cast  doubt on the situation in Syria and on the Syrian position  advocating a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace.    The Syrian official said that Israel knows very well that it  would only reap failure and that it would never be able to  absolve itself of the crimes it commits in broad daylight  against Arab citizens and holy places.    He accused Israel of always trying to force Arab Jews to  immigrate to it, and then committing massacres against them to  force them to commit massacres. [passage omitted]</p>

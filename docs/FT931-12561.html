			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / HK political boundary plans get first airing HONG KONG Governor Chris Patten's plans for the territory's political development will receive their first airing tomorrow when the colonial government publishes legislation for the creation of an electoral boundaries commission. The commission, regarded as one of the government's less controversial proposals, will have three members, one a High Court judge who will act as chairman. It will make recommendations to the governor's Executive Council on the boundaries of 20 one-member constituencies in the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's law-making body, for the 1995 elections. These members will be returned by universal suffrage. The commission will be responsible for the conduct of the elections. The impartiality of Hong Kong's electoral system will be strengthened by the commission, an official said.</p>

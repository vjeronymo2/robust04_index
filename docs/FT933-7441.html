			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Summertime special for the stock markets: A look at the revival in equity prices Happy days are here again. Stock markets in the US, UK, Germany, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Spain recorded all-time highs this week, even though August is normally a quiet month for share trading. With economic recovery still sluggish in the US and the UK, and non-existent in France and Germany, markets might seem to have little to be excited about. So for those who are still baffled, here is a bull's-eye view of the euphoria. Why are stock markets reaching record levels? 'It all comes down to low inflation, low interest rates and low bond yields,' according to Mr Dick Barfield, chief investment manager at Standard Life, the insurance company. Bond markets have been rallying round the world. Lower inflation expectations have boosted bond prices, and so cut bond yields. Investment institutions regularly switch between bonds and shares, so as yields on bonds fall, shares become more attractive. A further factor is that inflation had been so high for so long that investors in the 1980s demanded a high real (after inflation) return. That may now be changing. 'The market has now come to believe in lower real interest rates rather than merely lower nominal interest rates,' says Mr Michael Hughes, head of global investment strategy at BZW, the securities company. That is more good news for both equities and bonds, since it allows yields to fall, and thus prices to rise even further. Returns on cash deposits are also falling, and expected to fall further, especially in continental Europe now that the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism allows governments to set economic policy in relation to their own needs, and not those of the Bundesbank. Again, when returns on cash fall, the attractions of equities increase. A small difference in the market yield can make a lot of difference to share prices. If investors are prepared to accept a 3 per cent, rather than a 4 per cent yield, share prices will rise by 33 per cent. Lower interest rates are of obvious benefit to industry as they reduce the cost of doing business and increase profits. All this adds up to a bull market. How do markets look in terms of traditional valuation measures, such as price-earnings ratios and dividend yields? 'Most of the valuation measures look pretty expensive compared with the 1970s and 1980s, although not when you look at the 1960s,' says Mr Barfield. As Mr Albert Edwards, global equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, the securities house, says: 'the UK market is at its most expensive in terms of the price-earnings ratio since 1972' - a peak which was swiftly followed by one of the worst bear markets in history. However, bullish investors and commentators argue that the historic price-earnings ratio is based on earnings depressed by a long recession. As economies grow again, earnings will grow rapidly and that means the prospective p/e ratio is much lower. The dividend yield on UK shares is currently 3.6 per cent, compared with an average of 5 per cent over the period 1918-1992; but BZW's Mr Hughes points out that a large part of that time-period is biased towards those years when inflation was a problem. The real yield on equities is currently positive, normally a good sign. In the US, the dividend yield is even lower, at 2.86 per cent. Historically, when the yield has dipped below 3 per cent, the stock market has subsequently dropped sharply, notably in 1929 and 1987. But Mr Hughes argues that earnings growth is now coming through in the US, so the prospects for dividend growth are good. Is it too late to invest? Private investors have an unfortunate tendency to invest at the top of the market; the time to sell shares, according to the legend, is when 'elevator boys' are passing on stock tips. The UK rally has been so rapid that Mr Barfield says, 'I can't be wildly bullish but I wouldn't want to dissuade investors from entering the market given the yields on other assets.' Mr Hughes adds: 'For a private investor I don't think it's time to put in a lump sum, but they should keep up regular savings schemes.' Is it all doomed to crash, as it did in 1987? Bullish observers argue that things are very different from 1987, when markets and economies had been buoyant for several years. Now much of the world is either emerging, or close to emerging, from recession. 'In 1987, equity markets got well ahead of bond markets. This rally is more soundly based,' says Mr Barfield. What normally upsets markets is something they did not expect - such as inflation rising. Kleinwort Benson's Mr Edwards thinks that inflation may eventually revive. 'Governments are very unpopular so they will pursue a low interest rate policy and they will probably keep the policy up for too long,' he says. That may lead to renewed inflation in the medium term, he adds, but 'the problem won't hit equity and bond prices until 18 months from now'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A regular Security Council session, chaired by  President Nazarbayev, was held yesterday. At issue were  questions related to the state of equipment of the Armed Forces  of the Republic of Kazakhstan with technology, armaments,  material, and technical resources. The concept of formation and  implementation of long-term defense programs and development of  the defense complex of the Republic of Kazakhstan were also  examined. General Sagadat Nurmagambetov, the defense minister,  and Economy Minister Mars Urkumbayev presented reports. An  exchange of opinions was held, summed up by Nursultan  Nazarbayev: We must precisely decide what an army needs -- how  many men we need -- he said. We should urgently tackle all  questions connected with equipping the Armed Forces, we should,  to a maximum degree, reduce import of military products from  outside, and to the best of our possibilities manufacture such  products in Kazakhstan. The head of state set an objective--in  one week's time--to set up a commission on the military  industry. Its chairman will be directly responsible for the  situation in this important sphere, which should provide  reliable defense capability for our sovereign state.    By their decision, the Security Council approved of the  concept of formation and implementation of long-term defense  programs and development of the defense complex. The council  also endorsed several changes in its membership. In particular,  Bulat Baekenov was appointed secretary of the council.    Speaker Abish Kekilbayev, Akizhan Kazhegeldin, first deputy  prime minister, Deputy Prime ministers Galym Abilsiitov and  Asygat Zhabagin, and heads of a number of ministries and  departments, as well as responsible officials from the  presidential administration and that of the Cabinet of Ministers  participated in the session.</p>

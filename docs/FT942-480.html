			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / DoT land purchases attacked: National Audit Office says Pounds 1.1bn spending for roads was mostly unnecessary The Department of Transport has spent more than Pounds 1.1bn since 1986 on acquiring land and property to build roads, most of which are unlikely to be needed, says a report to be published today by the National Audit Office. The public expenditure watchdog says delays in finalising the route of trunk roads and motorways force the department to buy far more property than is eventually needed. It also criticises the department for wasteful management of its growing estate. Property records are incomplete, rent arrears are more than double the target level, vacancy levels are too high and sales of surplus property take too long, the NAO says. The government's road-building plans mean the transport department has been acquiring and managing increasing amounts of property. Property-owners blighted by plans for new roads and road widening can ask the department to buy their property. But the NAO found that about 60 per cent of properties bought under these provisions were not required when the final route for road schemes was decided. In one scheme for widening junctions on the M20 motorway, 78 per cent of the property bought was not needed. The main reason for the unnecessary purchases is delay in finalising preferred routes, says the NAO. In the cases examined for the report it had taken an average of 10 years to decide a preferred route after announcing a scheme. Two schemes took 20 years or more. Some Pounds 220m was spent buying property in 1992-93, and just Pounds 10m released by selling unwanted parts of the estate. Annual spending on acquiring land had increased by 200 per cent in three years. The cost to the department of managing its estate was Pounds 4.3m in 1992-93, bringing in rental income of Pounds 7.5m. The management of much of the property is contracted out to seven housing associations, a residential property agent and seven commercial and agricultural agents. Rent arrears of Pounds 2m had accumulated by March 1993, more than Pounds 500,000 of which was judged by the agents to be irrecoverable. The level of arrears, 21 per cent of collectable rents, was more than double the department's target. More could be done to collect the arrears, the NAO says. An additional Pounds 300,000 a year could be brought in by charging market rents, the NAO estimates. And further action is needed to reduce vacancy levels, running at a quarter of the estate. The NAO also found that almost a third of the land no longer needed for roads had been held for more than the three-year target set by the department for disposal - in many cases for avoidable reasons.

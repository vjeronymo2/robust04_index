			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Tennis: Now Courier is the target - The rise and rise of the Dude from Dade City IF HE had not been involved in an almighty row in a Rome car park last May, Jim Courier, the personable American from Dade City, Florida, might not now be the world's No. 1 tennis player. After being confronted by his two coaches, Jose Higueras and Brad Stine, who accused him of not having the guts to be a great player, Courier came to terms with his own fears of success and immediately won the French championship. His upward progress since then has been remarkable. For the past two weeks, though, the Dude from Dade (I suppose it was inevitable]) has discovered the truth of that old saying about life being tough at the top. On Saturday, February 8, the dynamic 21-year-old beat California's Derrick Rostagno in the semi-finals of a tournament in San Francisco and overtook Sweden's Stefan Edberg at the top of the ATP Tour computer rankings. From that moment, he was there to be shot-at. The first shots were fired the very next day by Michael Chang - and very accurate they were, too. The diminutive American, ranked 16 at the time, beat Courier 6-3 6-3 - perhaps to remind him that he owed Chang a debt. For it was Chang who, in 1989, became the first American winner in Paris since Tony Trabert in 1955. Last Sunday, in the Brussels final, Courier found himself facing another man with something to prove. Boris Becker, like Edberg, had asked the organisers of the Donnay Indoor for a wild card. Becker's mission was simple. A year ago, he had at last become the world's No. 1 by beating the holder, Ivan Lendl, in the final of the Australian Open. 'It was the greatest moment of my life,' Becker said at the time, 'the culmination of a dream.' Edberg ended that dream by taking the No. 1 ranking away from Becker twice in 1991 and, finally, keeping it. So, in Brussels, Becker wanted to beat Edberg to begin the repair of his ranking, which had slipped to No. 5. Then, too, he had a score to settle with Courier. He wanted to show the American upstart - who, three weeks ago in Melbourne, usurped his Australian crown - that his own surprising loss there to John McEnroe was a mere accident. (Actually, McEnroe had quite a lot to do with it, I can assure you). When Becker beat Edberg convincingly in their Brussels semi-final last Saturday, Courier said he expected a difficult final against a man he had never beaten in three previous meetings. How right he was. Although the American played well, wielding those ungainly but effective ground strokes with great energy and skill to win the first two sets and create three match points in the third set tie-break, Becker played even better. The powerful German, all determination, saved all three match points with positive, attacking play and went on to win a marvellous encounter 6-7 2-6 7-6 7-5 7-5. It lasted four hours and 56 minutes, the longest final in the two-year history of the ATP Tour, and Becker played as well as I have seen him for years. At last, he was serving and volleying again instead of trying to prove he is a great base-liner - which he isn't and never will be. It has been a particulary tough baptism for Courier, and this week in Stuttgart he has had the pack snapping at his heels again. Joining Edberg and Becker were Lendl, Guy Forget, Goran Ivanisevic, and a young man of whom you have heard me speak before: Richard Krajicek, of Holland. Courier's victory against this young giant on Thursday was particularly significant because it was the match that never was - the semi-final of the Australian Open that could not be played because of Krajicek's shoulder injury. Courier did well to keep the Dutchman at bay because he is the most-improved player in the world over the past six months and really believes he is destined for greatness. For Courier, though, it will continue, week after week, with the pressure building all the time. That is how it has been ever since the rankings began in August 1973 when the mercurial Rumanian Ilie Nastase was judged by the cold, calculating eye of the computer to be the greatest. Courier is the 10th man to be ranked No. 1, the latest of a distinguished line that includes Jimmy Connors whose continuous 160-week reign from July 1974 to August 1977 is the longest yet. Lendl was only three weeks short of that total when, in May 1983, Connors displaced him to enjoy the eighth of his nine spells at the top. The full list, showing the total number of weeks each man reigned and the number of times he returned to the summit, makes interesting reading because it is a sort of unofficial ranking list across the generations. In its fashion, it goes a long way towards answering the perennial question - who WAS the greatest? So here it is: 1. Lendl (270 weeks in eight spells as No. 1); 2. Connors (268, nine); 3. McEnroe (170, 14); 4. Borg (108, six); 5. Edberg (66, three); 6. Nastase (40, one); 7. Wilander (20, one); 8. Becker (12, two); 9. Newcombe (eight, one); 10 Courier (two, the reigning No. 1).</p>

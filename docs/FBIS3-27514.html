			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The responsibility  for the disruption of cooperation between China and Britain on  Hong Kong's political system rests entirely on the British side,  said a Foreign Ministry spokesman at a weekly news conference  here this afternoon.    The Hong Kong Legislative Council [Legco] today passed the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements. The Hong Kong Government will also submit the  second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for discussion.    The Foreign Ministry spokesman said that last December,  before the Chinese and the British sides had reached any  agreement on the district board election arrangements, the  British side submitted the first-phase draft of legislation to  the Hong Kong Legislative Council, thus directly causing the  termination of the talks between China and Britain.    Now, in disregard of repeated dissuasion by China, and the  aspirations of all the social strata in Hong Kong for a  settlement of the question concerning the 1994-1995 election  arrangements through negotiations, the British side has had the  first-phase draft legislation on the 1994-95 election  arrangements passed by the Hong Kong Legco and also decided to  submit the second-phase draft legislation to the Legco for  discussion.    The spokesman said: "This fully shows that the British side  does not have sincerity to solve the question through  cooperation with the Chinese side, and is bent on moving further  on this erroneous path.    "The door of negotiation has been closed by the British  side," he said.    "The responsibility for the disruption of cooperation  between  China and Britain on Hong Kong's political system rests entirely  with the British side," he said.    He noted that the Chinese side reiterates that without an  agreement between China and Britain, the framework of the  three-tiered political system established through British Hong  Kong authorities legislation cannot last beyond June 30, 1997.    The British side today published a white paper to disclose  the detailed contents of last year's Sino-British talks.    An understanding not to disclose to the public the contents  of the negotiations was reached between China and Britain before  the talks began last year, he said.    Today's act by Britain "is against the understanding," he  said. "The Chinese side cannot but make due reactions," he added.    Asked about Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans, in a  recent TV interview in Australia, expressing strong support for  the political package of Chris Patten, the spokesman said that  what was now at issue between China and Britain on Hong Kong "is  not whether Hong Kong should have democracy, but whether  commitment is to be honored."    He said that there were a series of agreements and  understandings between the two countries on the evolution of  Hong Kong's political system. "But the British side is now  trying to repudiate them and have its own way. This is  absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese side," he said.    "In the more than one hundred years during the British rule,  there has been no democracy at all in Hong Kong," he said. "It  is with ulterior motives that Britain pushes a Chris Patten  package in Hong Kong before it leaves. It will be futile to  defend the package.    "The maintenance of Hong Kong's social stability and  economic  prosperity is not only in the interests of China and Britain,  but also of those countries that have economic interests in Hong  Kong," he said.    "The question of Hong Kong is a matter between China and  Britain before June 30, 1997, and from July 1, 1997, it will be  purely an internal affair of China," he said. "It is  inappropriate to make irresponsible remarks on the political  affairs of Hong Kong."</p>

The power of the  Finance Ministry within the Hosokawa government has grown so  strong that the prime minister is now unable to control it.  There are growing complaints from people around the prime  minister who say "The Finance Ministry should be brought under  control, by force if necessary," but it is also true that the  prime minister cannot do much in the economic realm, such as  stimulating the economy, without the cooperation of the Finance  Ministry. The prime minister is growing increasingly irritated  by this dilemma.    The prime minister recently expressed his strong discontent  with the Finance Ministry to one of his acquaintances, saying:  "They do not bring us any ideas. Nor they want to listen to  what we tell them." The recent problem arises from the Finance  Ministry's persistence in combining in a package the issues of  reducing income taxes and raising the consumption tax.    The prime minister does not support taking care of these  issues together in view of the condition of the ruling coalition  parties, wherein the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is  opposed to the idea of raising the consumption tax. He thinks  that the government should implement the income tax cut first  and put off acting on a consumption tax increase until later.  His office has asked the Finance Ministry repeatedly to come up  with a plan that supports this line of thinking. For a while,  the Prime Minister's Office suggested as a compromise "making a  promise to carry out a cut in the consumption tax in the future  but proposing to make perishable foods tax-free and to impose  high tax rates on table luxuries to enable the SDPJ to accept  the consumption tax increase." But the Finance Ministry is said  to have rejected this suggestion and instead to have insisted  that "such a tax cannot be called a consumption tax, and that is  tantamount to restoring the commodity taxes."    The reason why the Finance Ministry is so persistent about  raising the consumption tax [while at the same time reducing  income taxes] is not only because of the financial authorities'  basic stand in quest of "balanced finance," but also because of  the support for such stand by people like Ichiro Ozawa, general  secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. On the other  hand, the prime minister himself has so far kept on saying, "We  cannot pump out deficit-covering bonds." He now simply cannot  declare that he has decided to go ahead with the income tax cuts.    Even the meeting of the Government-Ruling Parties Economic  Issue Consultative Council, which the prime minister had hoped  would play the role of an intermediary on the matter, broke up  on 6 January, after the ruling parties revolted, saying: "When  there is only one answer (that the consumption tax increase  should be handled as a separate matter), the Finance Ministry  persists on handling the two issues together. As long as that  is the given condition, there is no use in continuing the  talks." As a result, it has become very likely that the prime  minister will not be able to make an announcement on economic  stimulus measures in mid-January as he has publicly pledged he  will do.    For the prime minister, if that happens, this setback will  come on the heels of the one concerning his failure to formulate  the 1994 budget before the end of 1993. As such, there are  emerging voices among those around the prime minister which say,  "We should emulate Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international  trade and industry, and the Prime Minister's Office should show  its leadership even if takes the tough step of firing some  senior officials if necessary."    But if the relationship between the Prime Minister's Office  and the Finance Ministry deteriorates further, there can be  problems in adopting emergency economic stimulus measures and in  formulating the third 1993 supplementary budget and the regular  1994 budget. As for the question of how to handle the Finance  Ministry, it may be said that the prime minister is now having  his ability called into question.</p>

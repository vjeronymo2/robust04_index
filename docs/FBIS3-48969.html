It is  obvious that Boban and Tudjman would like, in a rather  masochistic way, to see Croats experiencing something similar to  Ahmici and Stupni Dol [sites of massacres of Muslim civilians by  Croat forces]. For several days this country's media have been  citing a figure of 74 civilians killed in Krizancevo Selo.    The West European and other world TV broadcasters who are  stationed only a few km from this village have not reported a  single line about this case because they have, of course, found  nothing to report.    Following the lies of the Croatian media, yesterday four  European agencies, THE DAILY TELEGRAPH, CNN, the BBC, and  REUTERS visited the site; they saw no trace of any massacre.  The only thing they witnessed was the fact that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina fighters in this area had scored yet another  great military victory.</p>

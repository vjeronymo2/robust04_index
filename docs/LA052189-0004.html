			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> Sixteen Candles (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.) is an uneasy mix of the  sympathetic and the synthetic, the raucous and the racist -- pity poor Gedde  Watanabe, cast as a sex-starved Chinese exchange student. It also asks us to  believe that an entire family would forget Molly Ringwald's 16th birthday.  </P> <P> With Red Dawn (Channel 5 Sunday at 8 p.m.) John Milius convinces us that a  full-scale Soviet invasion could happen here, only to settle for making a cheap  rabble-rouser. Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen play high school resisters to  Red rule.  </P> <P> Mike Hammer: Murder Takes All (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) finds Stacy Keach's Hammer  kidnaped, drugged and parachuted into the Nevada desert outside Las Vegas --  and that's just the beginning.  </P> <P> Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of Jessica McClure (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another  new TV movie, tells of the baby rescued from an abandoned well in Texas in  1987. Roxana Zal and Will Oldham play her young parents.  </P> <P> Footloose (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is not particularly inventive, but it  does have two jaw-dropping musical turns and Kevin Bacon in an electrifying  star turn as a Chicago hipster who clashes with small-town pastor John Lithgow.  </P> <P> I Know My First Name Is Steven (NBC Monday and Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is a new  four-hour, two-part TV movie about the boy who was kidnaped in Northern  California at age 7 and who escaped at 14. Steven is played by Luke Edwards and  Corin (Corky) Nemec; Arliss Howard plays his kidnaper.  </P> <P> In Weird Science (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), another John Hughes illustrated  teen-age daydream, Anthony Michael Hall and Ilan Mitchell-Smith conjure up a  computer-built dream woman, played by Kelly Le Brock -- to her credit -- as if  she were real.  </P> <P> Revenge of the Nerds (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a delicious, gratifying  underdog fantasy starring Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards.  </P> <P> Arthur (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is that sparkling 1981 screwball comedy  with Dudley Moore, John Gielgud and Liza Minnelli; you may have problems with  the fact that Moore's millionaire is inarguably an alcoholic.  </P> <P> Of Channel 5's week of youth flicks, the winner is Martha Coolidge's Valley  Girl (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), starring Nicolas Cage as working-class  Hollywood High Romeo and Deborah Foreman in the title role.  </P> <P> Meatballs (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a pleasantly raunchy summer camp  comedy with Bill Murray.  </P> <P> Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (Channel 28 Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is one film  that uncontestably has made a difference. On the one hand, it's a demanding  experiment in which an ultra-cool neo-film noir style is brought to bear on the  documentary form -- and most likely why it wasn't Oscar-nominated -- and on the  other, a brief for a miscarriage of justice so persuasive that it succeeded in  getting Randall Dale Adams sprung from a Texas prison after serving 12 years  for a murder he always claimed he never committed.  </P> <P> The Revenge of the Stepford Wives (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a TV movie  in every way superior to its big-screen original, a horror fable which imagines  the worst possible backlash to women's liberation on the part of the  beleaguered American male.  </P> <P> Bustin' Loose (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) finds paroled convict Richard Pryor  obliged to drive teacher Cicely Tyson's eight emotionally disturbed kids  cross-country; this 1981 comedy is uneven but ingratiating.  </P> <P> Tom Selleck is perfectly cast as a World War I flying ace caught up in an  adventure-filled 1920 race against the clock from Istanbul to Afghanistan in  High Road to China (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). Bess Armstrong is equally well cast  as Selleck's beautiful, resourceful leading lady.  </P> <P> Too bad Zorro, the Gay Blade (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) isn't as funny as  George Hamilton is in his dual role as the foppish son of the legendary Zorro  and his gay twin brother.  </P> <P> Gallipoli (Channel 13 Saturday at 10 p.m.), director Peter Weir and writer  David Williamson's sweeping, splendid World War I saga, stars Mark Lee and Mel  Gibson as two young soldiers whose loss of innocence in battle represents  Australia's own loss of innocence.  </P> <P> The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log  listings service.  </P></p>

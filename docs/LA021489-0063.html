			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Protestant vigilantes took responsibility for killing a Roman Catholic lawyer  in his home in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Patrick Finucane was slain Sunday by  three men, and his wife, Geraldine, was wounded. Finucane had acted for clients  involved in the outlawed Irish Republican Army's campaign against British rule.  The banned Ulster Freedom Fighters claimed responsibility in a coded message  telephoned to the British Broadcasting Corp. in Belfast. Irish nationalists  accused a British official of making Finucane a target by saying some Northern  Ireland lawyers were "unduly sympathetic" to guerrilla groups.  </P></p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Labour's pay plans suffer further blow LABOUR party plans to reform wage bargaining were dealt a further blow yesterday when the AEU engineering union rejected a second attempt in two weeks by the Trades Union Congress to resolve inter-union differences on the issue. The decision of the executive of the the AEU, the UK's fourth-largest union, illustrates difficulties faced by the Labour movement in formulating a consensus on plans to create a national minimum wage and hold a yearly national economic assessment. Such an assessment, in which a Labour government, unions and employers would take part, would be used to set a national minimum wage. The two policies form the centre-piece of Labour's plans to reform wage bargaining. Failure to find a meaningful compromise could leave the Labour party open to charges that it and the unions have not resolved the pay-bargaining difficulties that helped to topple the last Labour administration in 1979. AEU objections to the plans of the TUC and the Labour party are especially damaging because the union is one of the more moderate, and normally among the party's most loyal supporters. The AEU executive decided it could not accept a redraft of a TUC paper in which unions were asked to agree that, in pay talks for higher-paid workers under a Labour government, they would not cite any rise in the proposed national minimum wage. The wording has changed from the previous draft, which said unions would disregard the minimum wage in talks on other pay levels. AEU members fear the new version still implies an unacceptable erosion of wage differentials. AEU representatives will press at the TUC general council tomorrow for further changes, although some executive members believe the clause should be removed. The union, which supports a national minimum wage, will also seek amendments to other parts of the document to emphasise further the rejection by unions of any form of wage restraint. Mr Bill Jordan, AEU president, said suggestions that skilled workers' pay should be held down were 'not only economic madness, but will be implemented over this union's dead body'. He said the Labour movement needed to study the issue further. Failure to do so might lead to a dangerous diversion from Labour's central objective of regaining power. Employment, Page 9</p>

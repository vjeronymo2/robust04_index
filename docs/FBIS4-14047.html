			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Dani Rothschild, the </F> coordinator of government activities in the territories, by  Smadar Peri -- place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Peri] Major General Rothschild, do you  believe 'Arafat?    [Rothschild] It is not a question of whether I believe him  or not. The question is whether he can implement the agreement.  I believe that he wants to; however, if 'Arafat does not  realize that he is assuming responsibility for a system as  complicated as that of a country -- and whether or not he has  sovereignty is of no significance here -- and if the world does  not understand that he requires aid on a large scale, then there  is no chance of turning a new leaf.    [Peri] These are certainly good times. The coordinator of  government activities in the territories is almost conducting  public relations on behalf of 'Arafat.    [Rothschild] Definitely. Not because I like 'Arafat so much  but because I want this agreement to succeed. If the  Palestinian authority does not show the residents that it is  better than we were in the civilian-economic sphere, there is no  chance of this agreement ever being implemented.    We can hold talks in Cairo, Paris, and Washington until the  sun goes down but if we fail to implement what is agreed upon  because of a lack of resources, then what have we achieved?  Their needs will grow threefold or fourfold after the agreement  in comparison to their needs while we were in control. If we  also consider the fact that they will be able to collect all the  taxes they want to, then there will really be no chance of  getting anything done.    [Peri] People are saying that 'Arafat is deliberately  stalling because he does not want the agreement at all. He does  not want to be the mayor of Jericho and is afraid of being  assassinated in Gaza.    [Rothschild] I do not know if he is afraid. I think 'Arafat  is becoming increasingly aware of the difficulties. I believe  that one of his fears, which have accumulated during the  negotiations, is that he will be unable to meet the needs and  expectations of his public. He has no choice, however, because  with every day that goes by without changes on the ground he  loses more supporters of the agreement. Afterwards, things will  be even more difficult for him.    The more profound and detailed the negotiations become, the  more the Palestinians realize how complicated their problem will  prove to be; how impossible it is to bring about changes in the  field within a short time; and to what degree the shortage of  resources dashes any hopes of meeting the public's expectations.  They are frightened by the burden of responsibility they will  have to assume and the scope of the needs they will have to fill  with regard to a population who currently receives services in  all walks of life.    [Peri] You are a member of the Israeli delegation to the  economic talks with the Palestinians. How much money do they  need in your assessment?    [Rothschild] Our budget stands at 300 million shekels this  year. They will need at least three times that amount because  our budget does not include security. Today, we finance the  salaries of 400 policemen. The Palestinians are talking about  9,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho. Salaries are  not everything, there is also maintenance. Whoever talks about  adding 200 classrooms must understand that even after the  construction work is over, one still has to pay wages to  hundreds of teachers. They also want to increase the number of  clerks, build residential apartment buildings, set up a sewage  system.    [Peri] How do they perceive self-administration?    [Rothschild] It is easier to speak of Gaza because Jericho  is a very isolated area. It all depends on the kind of  resources the Palestinian authority will have at its disposal.  According to studies carried out by us, the public's standard  of living will drop by 20 to 25 percent compared to its present  level, which is already low.    Unless a great deal of money is invested in the Gaza Strip  very soon it will turn into a tinderbox. Not so much against  Israel but primarily against the Palestinian rule. If people  say that 'Arafat is frightened of an agreement, or at least  hesitant, then that is the reason.    [Peri] What do you expect them to do?    [Rothschild] We are encouraging 'Arafat to appoint a  council, but he is stalling. A decision should be made now on  who is to head each system -- health, education, customs, and so  forth, and these people should be brought in so as to have time  to overlap with us before they take charge. They have to set up  an entire economic system and to man the tax authority whose  staff resigned at the outset of the intifadah.    Under the agreement, they are committed to certain levels of  income tax, VAT [value added tax], and customs. Yet they do not  have a system which knows how to impose, calculate, and levy the  taxes. You cannot build such a system in a day.    Rami, Nabil Sha'th's son, arrived this week to acquaint  himself with the computer system which we are going to leave to  the Palestinian administration in Gaza. He is still in shock.  It is a sophisticated system, and they have no one to operate  it. You cannot work from day to day. You have to train people  in each sphere of life.    This week in Cairo, for instance, the transfer of the  Finance  Ministry's powers was discussed; namely, that Israel is to  cancel all its contracts with suppliers. But they do not have  answers to the most basic questions: How will they operate  elevators? How will they obtain oxygen for hospitals? What  will they do about all the daily systems based on these  contracts?    [Peri] Have your public and secret meetings with  Palestinians included meetings with Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] people?    [Rothschild] Since Hamas is an illegal organization, people  who meet me are only willing to admit to an affiliation with the  universal Islamic network. I have spent many hours in  conversation with these people. I acquired an in-depth  acquaintance with how their network operates, what its  objectives are, and how it seeks to achieve these objectives.    One of their leaders told me: We are no pistol revolution.  We did it once in Egypt (the assassination of President  al-Sadat), and the alternative is someone who is much more  diffident, hesitant, and much more brutal. Therefore, our  method is to cultivate the support of a broad social stratum.  How? We invest in the target public everything the  administration cannot invest.    [Peri] Is it possible that we screwed up, that we should  have opted for the radicals?    [Rothschild] I definitely think we conducted contacts with  people who do not necessarily represent the Palestinian society.  The problem with Faysal al-Husayni and the other salon leaders  was that their power stemmed from their affiliation with the  PLO, and not from a self-built position in the Palestinian  street. We conduct negotiations with them, but the street does  not recognize them.    In my opinion, one of our mistakes was not having held  sufficient contacts with the authentic leaders, and the  intifadah has indeed generated such leaders. We could have  found them in prisons. On the Palestinian street. One does not  necessarily make political agreements with them, but a dialogue  with them is definitely possible. But it should be understood:  I will not propose -- and I never have -- that we hold contacts  with Hamas, whose motto is the destruction of Israel.    [Peri] I understand from your answer that the agenda should  have been turned around: We should have started with the local  radicals -- not Hamas -- and bring in the Tunis wheeler-dealers  afterward. We should have skipped al-Husayni, 'Ashrawi, and the  likes.    [Rothschild] Yes. We should have started out by talking  with the street leaders. With those who are capable of getting  5,000 or 10,000 people out to hurl stones. They would have been  capable of getting the same 10,000 to extend olive branches.  The PLO alone cannot do it.    I have always been in favor of launching a dialogue with the  street leaders, because you can run the area with them, and they  have no problem cooperating with us. Guys like Hisham  'Abd-al-Raziq or Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, who have served many years  in prison -- they are not afraid. They have already thrown  their grenades. Faysal al-Husayni cannot criticize them,  because they will immediately answer: And where have you been?    [Peri] If we indeed made a mistake in this issue, is it  still possible to fix it?    [Rothschild] We are fixing it, because now we are holding a  dialogue with representatives of the Palestinian street.    [Peri] It is still unclear who will rule the territories:  'Arafat and the people from Tunis, or the young local leadership?    [Rothschild] I am convinced that if the people from Tunis do  not give the local youngsters a measure of control, they will  find it very hard to rule. The young generation, however, will  also find it hard to go it alone. Even if they are considered  the leaders in the streets of Gaza, they have no funds. Only a  combination of PLO funds -- raised by regular contributions and  organized by a well-ordered system -- and the authentic local  leadership, can provide some chances for normal functioning.    [Peri] Will the real problems in the territories surface  only after the withdrawal, with the present level of terrorism  being only a sort of prelude?    [Rothschild] I am not all that concerned about the security  problem, although it tops our list of priorities. I believe the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is strong enough to solve this  problem eventually. It is very possible that the Palestinian  police will be interested in proving it can cope with terrorism  within the area under its jurisdiction, whereas terrorism will  still prevail in the areas under our control.    [Peri] Do you believe that the Palestinian police will be  able to squelch Hamas activity?    [Rothschild] I believe that the primary objective of the  Palestinian police will be not to prevent Hamas attacks against  us, but rather to foil attacks on the Palestinian council, to  prevent Hamas taking over the streets and its attempts to  disrupt daily affairs in Gaza and Jericho. They will leave it  to us to foil Hamas attacks against Israel.    [Peri] If Israel has early warnings about a Hamas attack,  will the Palestinian police cooperate with us, or will it leak  the information to Hamas members?    [Rothschild] According to the agreement between us, if there  is a warning about somebody who plans attacks against us, the  PLO has to foil these attacks. We must remember, however, that  the Palestinian police will not be homogeneous. There will  probably be some people there whose opinions do not necessarily  coincide with those of the PLO. There are enough people in Gaza  who find this agreement utterly disagreeable and who will do  everything possible to foil it, including attacks on Israelis  and on the Palestinian autonomy institutions.    [Peri] The Palestinian street is a great and frightening  unknown. Do you find a deep and eternal hatred for us there?    [Rothschild] There is hatred, but I would not term it  eternal. It is a hatred which is not politically motivated, but  is rather constituted of negative feelings toward our behavior,  whether this behavior is justified or not. A son who sees his  father under detention, or who has to undergo brutal searches  and insults can never forget this -- nothing will change this  fact. I am not talking here about those wounded and killed.    [Peri] What about the slight to their honor?    [Rothschild] The insult done to their honor is one of the  main factors contributing to their hatred. This hatred,  however, is limited only to those affected, and does not mean  that the Palestinians will not be able to coexist with us over  the long term.    [Peri] What does coexistence with the Israelis mean for the  Palestinians?    [Rothschild] It is a slogan for wanting to receive all the  benefits Israel can give them without Israeli presence in the  territories. It means working in Israel, trading with us, and  enjoying Israeli freedom.    I believe that over the prolonged months of negotiations  'Arafat has learned about a Palestinian public he was unfamiliar  with. This is a public which has learned a lot from us over the  last 26 years. It is a demanding public which has learned to use  the media. They used CNN against us, and now they are using it  against 'Arafat. It is not the public to which 'Arafat was  accustomed in Beirut, Amman, or Tunis, a public which was used  to obey his every order.    [Peri] Do you hear them criticize 'Arafat?    [Rothschild] Now they criticize him openly, whereas once  they dared to criticize him only secretly. The difference is  that today they give vent to their criticism openly over the  pages of AL-QUDS. They say that if 'Arafat believes he can  establish the 23d dictatorship in the Middle East here, he is  mistaken. It is not only that somebody is willing to write this  down, there is also somebody who is willing to publish this  criticism. [passage omitted]    [Peri] You sound very pessimistic.    [Rothschild] I am not pessimistic, I am concerned. If the  agreement we achieved will not be implemented on the ground, we  will have achieved nothing. Unfortunately, we can do very  little to help implement this agreement. The chances of  implementing it depend on how the Palestinians shoulder the  responsibility, their ability to manage affairs and their  leadership. I am rather worried about all of this, because I  still do not see any signs that the Palestinian side is ready to  assume this responsibility.</p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / KIO case to continue, court rules in Madrid The Madrid high court yesterday ruled that a lawsuit filed over a year ago by the Kuwait Investment Office against seven former executives of its Grupo Torras Spanish holding should go ahead, Reuter reports from Madrid. The decision follows four rulings last year throwing out the case. The new ruling cannot be appealed against or overturned. The KIO put Torras into receivership in December 1992, claiming losses of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.4bn), and next month filed penal charges against the seven for fraud and mismanagement, which it said had led directly to losses of Dollars 1bn. A spokesman for former Torras deputy chairman Javier de la Rosa, one of the seven accused, said the ruling would provide a welcome opportunity to clear the facts. Other defendants are Mr Fouad Jaffar, former KIO general manager, former KIO chairman Mr Fahad al-Sabah, former Torras managing director Mr Jorge Nunez Lasso de la Vega, former Ercros chairman Mr Narciso de Mir, and former Torras officials Mr Juan Jose Folchi and Mr Miguel Soler Sala. In addition, the KIO filed suit in London last year against 21 former KIO officials. In April last year, two companies controlled by Mr de la Rosa filed an affidavit demanding the KIO declare a repurchase agreement on share participations in the Torras group, and last September Mr de la Rosa, Mr de Mir and Mr Nunez filed charges in Barcelona against Torras officials for allegedly harming the companies' interests. Spain's National Securities Market Commission last year investigated Torras and found irregularities in its group share participations.</p>

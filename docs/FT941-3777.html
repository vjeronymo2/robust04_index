			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Loophole in Irish Republic's extradition law to be closed by end of next month A loophole in the Irish Republic's extradition law, under which an IRA suspect was released from custody in Dublin yesterday, is expected to be closed by the end of next month, Tim Coone writes. Mr Anthony Gorman (above), wanted in Britain in connection with the 1992 killing of an army sergeant outside a recruiting office in Derby, was released by a district court after the Irish state offered no evidence against him. New legislation in the republic will prevent IRA suspects blocking extradition to Britain on serious criminal charges on the grounds that their crimes are 'political'. The bill completed its Dail (parliament) stages with little opposition, and is due to go to the Senate next week. Defence lawyers for IRA suspects can argue now that possession and/or use of a non-automatic firearm is a political offence, and non-extraditable under the Irish constitution. The Irish Department of Justice says the bill will be brought into force once 'speciality' arrangements are in place between Ireland and the UK to prevent a suspect being charged with a different offence to that upon which he or she has been extradited. Both governments are finalising arrangements which are expected to be ready in time to coincide with the passing of the new extradition bill.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BET and Rank prefs downgraded CREDIT RATINGS on the preferred stock of both BET and Rank Organisation were downgraded sharply yesterday by Moody's Investor Service, the US rating agency. Both companies' stock was cut by two notches, from A2 to Baa1, while both also lost the top Prime-1 rating on its commercial paper. The BET move reflected the lengthy restructuring expected in its core businesses, 'intense competitive pressure' on operating margins and possible delays in disposing of underperforming assets, Moody's said. It expected Rank's recovery from the recession to be 'significantly delayed,' and added that the company would need to continue to restructure to improve returns.</p>

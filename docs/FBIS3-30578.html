			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We have just received the following statement  from the Office of the President of the Republic:    The presidential Council of Defense and National Security  held its 36th session last night [4 February] with Franjo  Tudjman, the president of the Republic of Croatia, in the chair.  The council examined the current foreign-political situation in  connection with the resolution of the Croatian Assembly passed  on 2 February 1994, and the presidential statement of the UNSC  [UN Security Council] of 3 February this year. Having heard the  report of Foreign Minister Mate Granic on his return from  official visits to Italy and the Vatican and diplomatic contacts  with other countries, the council adopted the following  conclusions after a discussion on these and other matters:    1. The council thoroughly examined the UNSC presidential  statement and decided to take all necessary steps in order that  all controversial issues resulting from this statement be  explained to the UNSC regarding the implementation of the demand  concerning the Republic of Croatia. The aim is to enable the UN  secretary general -- within the fixed deadline -- to submit to  the UNSC an authoritative report based on facts.    2. The Council assessed that the UNSC presidential statement  was adopted on the basis of an unjust and unsubstantiated  request by Haris Silajdzic, and accusations of the involvement  of 30,000 members of the Croatian Army in the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina supported by some Islamic countries, with the  clear aim of exerting international pressure on the Republic of  Croatia and on all warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in order  that a political solution be found.    In connection with this the council said that Croatia -- in  line with its constitutional provisions and the agreement on  friendship and cooperation, signed by the president of the  Republic of Croatia and the president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency on 12 July 1992, has supported the defense efforts of  the Croatian and Muslim people in Bosnia-Herzegovina since the  beginning of the Serbian aggression against Bosnia-Herzegovina,  thus preventing Bosnia in its entirety from becoming part of  greater Serbia. Croatia also accepted over half a million  refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina and is today caring for 282,000  mostly Muslim refugees.    3. The presidential Defense and National Security Council  was  surprised to hear both the Sarajevo Government accusations and  the UNSC presidential statement -- considering that Croatia,  judging by the general recognition on behalf of international  factors -- showed the highest level of cooperation in its  efforts aimed at ending the war and finding a political solution  to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The Council maintains that Croatia should persevere in its  peace-making policy. The aim of such a policy is to ensure the  integrity of the Croatian nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is  threatened by both Serb and Muslim aggression, this being in the  interest of both the Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  the security of the Croatian state.    In this connection the council draws attention to the need  for the international community to take effective steps toward  ending the war caused by the Serbian aggression, and toward  ending the offensive of Muslim Armed Forces against Croatian  areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially in central Bosnia where  tens of thousands of Croatian civilians are threatened in some  enclaves.    4. Concerning the accusations that Croatian Army elements  are  involved in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The council stresses  that the Croatian Army units are deployed only in the border  area between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, above Dubrovnik  toward Stolac and Neretva [inside Bosnia-Herzegovina's Trebinje  municipality]. They are holding defense lines against the Serbs  in accordance with the above-mentioned agreement on friendship  and cooperation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. The  council reiterated that Croatia had allowed about 2,000  volunteer soldiers of Bosnia-Herzegovina origin to go to help  their [Croat] kin in Bosnia in order to protect them from  aggression and ethnic cleansing.    The world is aware that the volunteers, deployed in HVO  [Croatian Defense Council] units, did not engage in any  operations to capture territories that belong to somebody else,  but only defended their centuries-old hearths. The Croatian  public has supported them in this because they and their  compatriots from those areas [Herzeg-Bosna] had joined Croatian  Army ranks to defend Croatia from the Yugo-Communist and Serbian  aggression.    In comparison to Croatian volunteers, three times more  Mojahedin fundamentalists from foreign states are fighting on  the Muslim side. Not only Croatia but Europe as well is worried  by the growth and strengthening of fundamentalism.    5. Concerning the allegations that regular Croatian Army  units are deployed in central and southern Bosnia. The Defense  Ministry of the Republic of Croatia will propose necessary steps  in line with the demands made in the UNSC presidential  statement. Croatia once again expresses its preparedness and  calls for the international community to establish the real  situation and the validity of the allegations. Further  conclusions of the UNSC should be based on this.    If the Muslim forces do not halt the offensive in central  Bosnia, the Assembly's Chamber of Deputies believes that the  government and the president of the Republic of Croatia should  review and reconsider current diplomatic relations between the  Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and,  in line with their assessment, take all adequate steps.    The council calls for an immediate and unconditional  cease-fire and the resumption of talks in order to reach an  agreement between Croats and Muslims in line with the proposal  of the contractual agreement -- on establishing a lasting and  permanent peace between the Croat and Bosnian Muslim nations in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and on the basis of further coexistence --  tabled by President Tudjman at a meeting with the Bosnian  [Muslim] delegation in Bonn on 10 January 1994.    If these efforts yield no results, Croatia should reconsider  all relations with the government in Sarajevo, and the  government of the Republic of Croatia has been given the task of  drawing up a list of all Bosnia-Herzegovina representative  offices and organizations active in the Republic of Croatia.  The council believes that it is untenable that the government  in Sarajevo should use the territory of the Republic of Croatia  to plan and organize logistical support for its military  actions, which result in the expulsion and ethnic cleansing of  Croats [in Bosnia].    The council demands of the international community to  proclaim the threatened Croat areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina  protected areas, and help secure the survival of the Croatian  nation.    The council has accepted the proposal to join the NATO  program Partnership for Peace, and lends its support to  Croatia's intention to join the process. In connection with  this, the Foreign Affairs Ministry has been charged with drawing  up a final proposal on this and taking concrete steps. [passage  omitted]    The council was informed about the steps taken to implement  the declaration on the normalization of relations between  Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was noted  that the declaration should be implemented immediately, without  any speculation in that respect. The council put a special  stress on the fact that the agreement in principle on the  normalization of relations between Croats and Serbs is not  directed against Muslims. On the contrary, the agreement should  be seen as a contribution to the efforts to reach a speedier  solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The council lends its full support to the efforts of the  Croatian Government to solve all disputed issues with the  neighboring Republic of Slovenia as soon as possible, and it  points to the need to deal simultaneously with the problem of  the Piran Bay and connecting Croatia with Europe.</p>

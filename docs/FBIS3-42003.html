			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1725 GMT on 14 January carries the regularly  scheduled ``Details'' program. The program, hosted by Nikolay  Svanidze, contains excerpts of interviews with Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev, and Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia Vladimir  Kryzhanovskiy, by unidentified correspondents. Places and dates  of the interviews are not given.    The program opens with an excerpt from Kravchuk who says  that  14 January is New Year's Day according to the ``old calendar.''  Therefore, he wishes the people of Russia and everybody a Happy  New Year. Kravchuk says, ``And on the whole, this month, is,  let's say, a new beginning because today is the beginning of a  new account. Because today's document is the beginning of a new  page for Ukraine, for Russia and for the whole world.''    Svanidze then says that in Moscow today the presidents of  Russia, the United States, and Ukraine discussed nuclear weapons  and Ukraine agreed to withdraw to Russia 176 intercontinental  missiles and approximately 1,500 warheads for dismantling.    Next follows an excerpt of Vladimir Kryzhanovskiy's  interview. He says: ``Ukraine is not backing down. I would call  it a trilateral compromise. All three sides made some  compromises. I would not say that the biggest compromise was  made by Ukraine.''    In a further excerpt of the Kravchuk interview, Kravchuk  says: ``To embark upon the path of confrontation or ambition is  a bad thing. Most in Ukraine understand this, I know.  Unfortunately, there are people who see things differently.  Fortunately, such people are in the minority.''    Then Kryzhanovskiy says in his interview, ``The president,  in  this case, is carrying out, in full and in principle, the will  of the people. Moreover, there are even certain, I would say,  contradictions between him and the parliament, which wants these  weapons to remain on the territory of Ukraine for a certain  time, until certain conditions prevail.''    Svanidze says that Kravchuk is in a difficult situation. He  has been performing a balancing act for the past two years --  balancing the temptation to be leader of a nuclear state and the  impossibility of keeping these ``expensive toys.''    Kryzhanovskiy is then shown saying, ``We are not thinking of  servicing of these nuclear weapons. We were counting on them  being serviced by Russian specialists alone.''    Next is an excerpt from Kravchuk, who says, ``The nuclear  weapons which we inherited from the former Soviet Union could  not be used by Ukraine, speaking frankly, as a guarantor of  security or as weapons of deterrence, because they were  manufactured in Russia, the codes -- in Russia, the buttons --  in Russia. Therefore, that is all an illusion.''    An excerpt from the Kozyrev interview follows. He says,  ``Against whom were the nuclear missiles in Ukraine, which were  installed by the former Soviet Union, directed? Against the USA  and NATO, and they are aimed at the USA and NATO. They are not  aimed at Russia. And the missiles which are in America? They  used to be aimed at the Soviet Union -- and now in Moscow...  [pauses] and incidentally, that bilateral, Russian-American  agreement is much more important for us. Why? Because American  weapons used to and are still to this day aimed at Moscow.  Nuclear weapons, each of which is capable of wiping out in a  second what we have here.''    ``Well, the agreement reached on not targeting them, the  flight assignment is to be canceled, and that process will be  finished in about two month's time. That is what the Presidents  of Russia and the United States agreed in Moscow. That is to  say, you and I are no longer rabbits. At least, in two month's  time we will not be in a situation where any madman may at any  moment press that infamous button by accident and a missile will  fly according to an assignment set years ago - namely towards  us. It will fly, but most likely, into space. Do you  understand [word indistinct]. That is a substantial thing. The  Ukrainian missiles -- that is, those in Ukraine, are not aimed  at us. Therefore, it may be important for the Americans -- the  missiles are aimed at them.''    Svanidze, shown sitting on a sofa beside Kozyrev, asks if  the  missiles can be pointed a new target. Kozyrev replies: ``But it  is not that easy to retarget them, and Moscow is the one who has  to retarget them because that infamous button for these missiles  is in Moscow. But naturally, we will not do that. We will not  point these missiles at ourselves.''    Svanidze says that pressure has been brought to bear on  Kravchuk from domestic and foreign forces. He was beset by  crisis in 1993 and anti-Russian feeling is running high in  Ukraine, but compensation is promised Ukraine for giving up its  nuclear weapons.    Kravchuk is shown saying, ``Taking account of the fact that  there will be compensation for the tactical and strategic  nuclear weapons, that there will guarantees of national  security, financial, economic, technical and guaranteed aid.  All of that is in Ukraine's interest.''    Svanidze then says that Ukraine has not managed to step out  of Russia's shadow and embark upon independent dialogue with the  West, but Kravchuk did what he had to do as president of a  country beset by economic problems such as Ukraine's.    Kravchuk is again shown. He says, ``It is not that one will  be the older and the other the younger, that one is the older  brother and one the younger brother, that one is the leader and  the other is subordinate. The peoples will be equal. Equal in  all their relations, one a bit more, one a bit less.''    A further fragment of Kozyrev's interview follows: ``The  episode with Ukraine is the clearing away of Russia's old  obstructions. Do you see? Essentially, the meeting on the  Ukrainian theme, unfortunately, took place two years later than  it should have done and this is the reason for the delay in the  process of the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from Ukraine.''</p>

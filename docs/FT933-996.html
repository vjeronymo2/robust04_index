			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Sport: Ringside seats by an empty stage - Golf FROM FIRST light on the Open's final day, spectators pack the grandstands that frame the 18th hole in anticipation of the drama to come. They are taking part in one of sport's rituals; the long wait that is so often necessary to reserve a seat for the action. At the Open, at least they are more involved than most. The long hours can be spent watching members of the supporting cast, who, with one eye on aeroplace schedules, complete their rounds in the time it usually takes to play nine holes. They can applaud Jack Nicklaus into the sunset once more, or laugh at the buffoon who is past caring and has more money than he knows what to do with and takes four putts from 20 ft. But is there anywhere else in sport where spectators pack the grandstand with no guarantee that they will see a single shot played? They used to say that if they opened the gates on non-match days at Old Trafford, the people would still come and watch the grass grow. This came to mind on Thursday when I joined the spectators as they parked themselves in the 18th grandstand at The Belfry even though nothing, absolutely nothing, was happening at the time on this hole in the Ryder Cup. The players, on their practice rounds, were on the front nine, the cheers that heralded their deeds just within range of our ears. 'What are we doing here when all the action is out there?,' I asked the young couple adjacent. 'Have you been out there?' they asked. 'And did you see any more of the action following the matches than we are seeing here?' Their thesis was correct. The Ryder Cup is a unique event in many ways and one of them is that for two days at least, just four holes out of 18 are in operation at any one time. The owners of the Belfry have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds creating natural spectating areas around most holes. But 25,000 people (the size of the sell-out crowd) into four holes just will not go. The Ryder Cup, more than any other event in the sport, is based on atmosphere. People rely on scoreboards and whispers through the trees to discover what is going on. You might think the cognoscenti would stay at home and watch on television but the people in attendance here are not voyeurs of big-time sport. The true golfers prefer seeing a snatch in person than just as another TV event. Yes, they spend large amounts of time doing and watching nothing, but there are rewards. The young couple, myself and all the others pleasantly passing the time on an idle Thursday morning, chatting about Manchester and the Olympics, Aston Villa's win over Birmingham, the clearing fog and Watson's wobbler over signing Sam Torrance's Gala Ball menu, witnessed a small exclusive. Hours before the news was announced at the opening ceremony, we knew that the Americans, John Cook and Lee Janzen, would not play in the first morning's foursomes. We knew this because while their colleagues were out on the golf course, away from our view, this pair suddenly came out and started practising their chipping in front of us on the home green. This was not done to keep us amused. No, when they had chipped and putted for a short while, we heard the news in a whisper from the pair to a confidante. It was Cook, I think, who revealkedf: 'No, we are not in there tomorrow morning.' We digested the information and added it to our list of discussions. We thought about sharing it with the part-time grandstanders who came later. Days spent by the 18th green of the Ryder Cup are rarely in vain. Later, we witnessed the opening ceremony. And tomorrow the young couple plan a dawn vigil to be sure of their seat for the final day's singles. For while all the 12 matches could finish out in the country, the chances are that those that matter will be played out on this wonderful hole. Seven of the 12 went to the 18th four years ago and in all of them the hole was either won or lost and you can imagine the consequent pull on the emotions. That is why there will not be a spare seat anywhere by the time the players go down the first hole and begin a journey that will lead many of them back to a scene that is quite unmatched anywhere else.</p>

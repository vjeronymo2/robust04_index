			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER HAS 3 OF 6 INDIAN HOMERS IN WIN  </P> <P> Joe Carter hit three home runs in a game for the third time in his career,  becoming the first major league player this season to do so, as the Cleveland  Indians used the long ball to beat the Texas Rangers, 7-3, Saturday night at  Arlington, Tex.  </P> <P> The Indians, who snapped both their own four-game losing streak and Texas'  three-game winning streak, managed only six hits, but all of them were homers.  </P> <P> "When you're going good, the balls jump off your bat," Carter said. "When  you're swinging terrible, you pop those balls up. This was one of those days  when I was on every pitch."  </P> <P> The Rangers' Charlie Hough (5-7) was victimized by five of the Indian homers --  a Texas franchise record -- including the three solo shots by Carter and Andy  Allanson's two-run homer in the seventh that broke a 3-3 tie. The homers gave  Carter 12 for the season.  </P> <P> Cory Snyder hit the other Cleveland homer, off Ken Rogers in the ninth.  </P> <P> Cleveland's Greg Swindell (10-1) scattered 10 hits, struck out five and walked  two before he was replaced in the seventh by reliever Greg Jones, who earned  his 16th save.  </P></p>

The announcement was made during his meeting with Russian  Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin who made a stopover  in Baku on his way from Tehran.    Adamishin told the AZERTAC news agency that his talks with  Kuliyev focused on ways to settle the Karabakh conflict. He  stressed that Russia favours Azerbaijan's territorial integrity  and calls for the withdrawal of Armenian troops from all  occupied lands and the return of refugees.    Speaking about the future political status of  Nagorno-Karabakh, the Russian diplomat said that this issue  needs further consideration. It can be solved only after the  war is over, all troops are withdrawn from the occupied  territory and the blockade is lifted, he said.</p>

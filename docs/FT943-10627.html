			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / French nationals killed in Algiers France reacted to the killing of five French gendarmes and consular officials in Algiers yesterday by promising fresh protection for its embassy staff and by sending its foreign and defence ministers to the Algerian capital. Mr Alain Juppe, the foreign minister, and Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, flew to Algiers to pay homage to the victims, shot early yesterday by terrorists who were trying to drive a car bomb past a French school and into a housing complex where many French official personnel live. The car bomb was later defused. The incident brings to 15 the number of French, and to more than 50 the number of foreigners, killed by Islamic fundamentalists contesting the Algerian government's suspension of elections two years ago which the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) was poised to win. Since last autumn, the fundamentalists' hardline factions have targeted foreigners as a means of bringing international pressure to bear on the authorities. Before leaving for Algiers, Mr Leotard said he would see what could be done to 'imp-rove protection', explaining that yesterday's attack had taken place during the changing of the gendarmes' guard at the school and that three gendarmes had been killed and a fourth wounded, in addition to two consular officials killed. The French foreign ministry issued a statement calling on the Algerian authorities to guard the French community better and to hunt down yesterday's killers as well as reiterating Paris' warning for all French to stay away from Algeria. There are believed to be some 2,000 French nationals as well as a much larger number of dual passport holders in the former French colony. Fearing a worse alternative in the creation of an Islamic theocracy, France has so far given reluctant and partial backing to the current Algerian regime. Paris has called for the government to open a dialogue with moderate Islamic groups.</p>

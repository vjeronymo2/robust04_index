			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A TALE OF TWO CHARGERS;  </P> <P> BANKS' CHARGER FUTURE IS STILL UNDER DISCUSSION;  </P> <P> IS HE IN?: THE TROUBLED LINEBACKER WILL CONTINUE HIS DRUG REHABILITATION IN SAN  DIEGO AND IT APPEARS HIS CHANCES TO RETURN TO THE TEAM HAVE IMPROVED..  </P> <P> The Chargers had a tentative agreement to trade drug-troubled linebacker Chip  Banks to the Cowboys Monday. But the deal fell through when Banks and his  counselor, David Katz, agreed that Banks' rehabilitation should continue in the  San Diego area and not anywhere else.  </P> <P> Later in the day Banks traveled to Stockton and met with Charger owner Alex  Spanos and Steve Ortmayer, the team's director of football operations. There  they discussed what future Banks might have with the Chargers.  </P> <P> Spanos, who has stated publicly that Banks will never play again for the  Chargers, reiterated that sentiment Monday.  </P> <P> "My position has not changed," Spanos said.  </P> <P> But Spanos left a crack in the door open for Banks' return when he added,  "we'll deal with the trading deadline when it comes."  </P> <P> The trading deadline is 1 p.m. today. After it passes, the Chargers could still  sign Banks and bring him in for workouts on a trial basis. It is believed  Ortmayer has been trying to convince Spanos to give Banks a second chance.  </P> <P> Dallas' interest in Banks began heating up Saturday when John Wooten, the  Cowboys' director of pro personnel, visited Banks in San Diego. The two visited  for two and a half hours. But the more Wooten talked to Banks the more he  realized Banks' rehabilitation must continue in San Diego.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't have been there if I didn't think Chip couldn't still play," Wooten  said Monday. "But I think it's best he stay where he is, not only in terms of  football, but in terms of getting his life back together."  </P> <P> Katz said Banks has just finished a 90-day extended care program at the Rancho  L'Abri center in Dulzura. The next step for Banks, Katz said, is an extended  care program in what he called a "recovery home."  </P> <P> Katz said the recovery home is in the San Diego area. And its rules would allow  Banks to practice and travel to road games if the Chargers decide to give Banks  another chance at football. The recovery home program is scheduled to take one  year.  </P> <P> Banks, 30, hasn't played since the 1987 season. He missed all of 1988 in a  contract dispute. Meanwhile, he was arrested five times on various drug and  sexual abuse charges in the last 18 months.  </P> <P> Ortmayer said it is now unlikely the Chargers will trade Banks before the  deadline. Ortmayer also said it is improbable the Chargers will trade unsigned  running back Gary Anderson before the deadline.  </P> <P> "We feel very strongly that they (Anderson and his agents) have not made an  effort to get this (a contract) done," Ortmayer said. "Consequently we feel  this player (Anderson) is more valuable to us than anybody else."  </P></p>

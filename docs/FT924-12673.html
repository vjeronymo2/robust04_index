			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Clean sweep for China's reformers CHINA'S economic reformers scored a virtual clean sweep yesterday when they dominated appointments to the Communist party's two key bodies, the politburo and its standing committee. As such the appointments represented another victory for Deng Xiaoping, the country's 88-year-old pre-eminent leader. At the weekend the party endorsed Deng's ideas for the rapid modernisation of China and in so doing embraced deregulation and the free market. At elections held yesterday, the politburo was expanded to 22 from 14 while its all-important standing committee, which oversees day-to-day policy, was increased by one position to seven. The retirement of two hardline individuals from the standing committee enabled three reformers to be appointed. Jiang Zemin, party general secretary, and Li Peng, China's prime minister, retained their positions, as expected. They are joined, however, by Zhu Rongji, 64, the industry minister, General Liu Huaqing, 77, and Hu Jintao, 49, the former party secretary for Tibet. Zhu is expected to be in charge of implementing economic reform; General Liu, whose appointment makes him China's highest ranking soldier, will be responsible for modernising China's army - the largest in the world. Hu, a protege of the late Hu Yaobang, has been appointed head of the central committee secretariat. Its five-member group includes Wen Jiabao, a supporter of deposed party leader Zhao Ziyang. The composition of the politburo reveals further the dominance of pro-reformers versus those politicians who wanted to hasten slowly on China's modernisation. Twelve of the 15 members outside the standing committee are new appointments, most of whom analysts in Beijing identify with reformist tendencies. There is greater representation from provincial China, where economic reform is well rooted. Central government ministries are also better represented with Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and Li Lanqing, minister for foreign economic relations and trade, both joining the body. Ding Guangen, Deng's bridge partner, was also appointed to the politburo and may well be Deng's eyes and ears on the council. The new politburo is younger than its predecessor. The odd man out is General Liu, but diplomats in Beijing said he was one of the only soldiers capable of gaining the respect of the military.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chu Zhaorui (0328 0340 3843): "Current New </F> Trends in Dissolving Marriage"--edited by Lao Qin (0525 0530)]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A comprehensive analysis of a  recently completed nationwide social investigation and various  regular surveys reveal the following new trends in dissolving  marriage at present:    With regard to divorce cases, there are more wives than  husbands requesting divorce. About 70 percent of the cases are  requested by wives. Of the wives requesting divorce,  intellectual women account for a bigger share, i.e., 86.1  percent. There are more divorce cases in big cities than in  small and medium cities, and in particular, more cases occur in  coastal open cities. More couples under 35 are seeking  divorce--they account for over 60 percent of the total divorce  cases. More divorce cases involve couples married shortly after  falling in love --they make up 69.16 percent of the total. Also,  more divorce cases are found among those who have  children--64.82 percent of the total.    With regard to divorcees, several "added" new trends have  appeared. There are more advanced-age divorcees. There is no  lack of divorcees who are in their 50's. People in their 60's  getting divorced are not rare, and divorce cases involving  septuagenarians are often heard of. A weird report carried in  SHANGHAI FAYUAN [0006 3189 3127 5373] says that an 80-year-old  woman and her 84-year-old husband insisted on divorcing each  other. There are more early-married couples getting divorced,  such cases now hitting a record high. More actors and actress  get divorced than ever before. This is especially so among young  performers whose divorce rate is as high as 70-80 percent--a  fact that is known to all. There are also more self-employed and  contract work households getting divorced after becoming better  off. In some cities, the divorce rate among the self-employed  has reached 12.4 percent. Some well-to-do people have even used  money in exchange for agreement to divorce. In addition, more  divorce cases have appeared among people going abroad. More and  more people who have gone abroad to study or to "earn credits"  have divorced their "ladies in the rear [liu shou nu shi 3966  1343 1166 1102]" or "gentlemen without wives by their side [tai  kong nan shi 1132 4500 3948 1102]."    As to reasons for divorce, the new trends are as follows:  A remarkably increased number of divorce cases involve a "third  party." Such divorcees account for about 25 percent of the total  divorcees around the country, and the percentage is as high as  70 percent or so in coastal developed areas. People divorced  because of "inharmony in sex" have also increased, the  percentage of such divorcees being 34.7 percent nationwide and  60-70 percentage in certain areas. More people are divorced due  to emotional discord. Over 95 percent of the divorce cases are  attributable to emotional and personality conflicts rather than  economic problems; still less are they due to political reasons.  More often than not, divorce is caused by overt or covert  psychological reasons or not-to-be-slighted social factors. An  increased number of people seek divorce because of such factors  as promotion, job transfer, or going to other places to study.  Those who are mockingly described as "Chen Shimei" of the new  age have increased in number. Also increased are cases in which  husbands and wives separate and go different ways under the  influence of the reform and opening environment or because of  their different values.    In addition, the following new trends have appeared with  regard to the attitudes and ways in dealing with divorce. People  who do not consider divorce to be disgraceful have increased to  73.90 percent. Those taking an indifferent attitude account for  14.83 percent. And only 11.77 percent think that divorce is  disgraceful. There are more cases of negotiated divorce than  cases of divorce based on the court's judgment. In the past  these two kinds of divorce cases were in the ratio of 1:3. Now,  the ratio is 3:1 in such big cities as Shanghai. More people  treat divorce in a civilized manner. Some divorcees hold balls  and banquets and travel on the occasion of divorce. After  divorce, some still contact each other and set dates for meeting  with their children. More divorcees can justly appraise and deal  with their previous spouses--they account for 61 percent of the  total divorcees. While 40 percent of the divorcees say they can  consider remarrying, actually more of them tend to remain single  in view of the difficulty and trouble in getting remarried.  Throughout the country, there are about 9.9 million unmarried  men aged over 30. This is about 3.3 times more than unmarried  women over 25. Recently, an increase is noted in the number of  unmarried people between 28 and 49 years of age, and the trend  is going upward. Beijing has 600,000 unmarried adults, Qingdao  has 420,000, and Guangzhou has over 1 million. In early 1991, a  public official bachelors' club, the first of its kind in China,  was founded in Beijing. Meanwhile, a bachelors' party also  appeared in Qingdao. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Bucking the trend: Costs tightly controlled in acquisitions spree - A company headed by a Labour MP MINDING your Ps and Qs has a special meaning for Mr Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP who is executive chairman of Birmingham-based Transfer Technology Group. It is nothing to do with etiquette. 'We are supplying equipment to improve companies' productivity and quality rather than raise their capacity,' he says. 'People will invest in them in downturns and upturns.' The P and Q effect is one reason why TransTec has managed to weather the recession so well, in spite of what at first glance looks an unpromising line-up of customers - the automotive, aerospace and steel industries figure heavily - and products such as manifolds and aluminium castings. In July TransTec announced a 63 per cent rise to Pounds 3.46m in first-half pre-tax profits. The result looks incredible in today's environment, but the real story of how the company is bucking the trend lies beneath the surface. TransTec is the successor company to Central &amp; Sheerwood, in which the late Robert Maxwell was the largest shareholder. A reverse takeover in May 1991 involving Mr Robinson's Transfer Technology put the MP for Coventry North West into the chair of the enlarged company. That provided the springboard for a raft of acquisitions that have turned TransTec into a tightly controlled collection of specialist engineering businesses. Products range from seals and rubber pro-ducts for the oil industry to texture rolls for the steel industry and turbine blades. The acquisitions help explain how TransTec boosted turnover by 64 per cent to Pounds 49m in the first half of last year. But what about the profits? Mr Robinson points to a number of tough acquisition criteria. Companies have to be heavily export-oriented - that is vital for a specialist engineering company, he says, given the decline in the UK's industrial base. They also need a gross margin of 50 per cent. 'Selling abroad is so costly,' says Mr Robinson. They should be low-volume businesses with big market shares which do not compete head-on with the Japanese and their export markets and product applications should be widely spread. The result of the acquisition spree is a company with about 1,900 employees  -almost all of whom are in the UK - and with more than 75 per cent of its business outside the UK. It has an enviably even spread of sales between European, north American and the fast-growing Far Eastern markets. On top of that is a strong technology base and a drastically reduced dependence, compared with two years ago, on the automotive industry, where Ford Europe is its biggest customer. In the group are a smattering of world and European market leaders and some niche businesses exploiting trends that have overridden the recession. Mr George Baker, sales director at the control technology division, picks out two examples. TransTec's electrochemical technology for making turbine blades is selling well in the growing market for gas turbines in power generation. And its new manufacturing technology for fuel injection systems, he says, is benefiting from tighter emission controls, especially in the US. Customers' scrap rates from existing equipment are rising as they try to meet the new rules. TransTec's most recent acquisition, the Matrix grinding machine business, is best known as half of the controversial Matrix Churchill machine tool business. Once companies have been acquired by TransTec costs are tightly controlled. 'That is vital,' says Mr Robinson. 'With 95 per cent of our commitment in the UK we cannot afford to let slip the cost advantage of being based here.' Manufacturing strategy is another important element. With some exceptions, Trans-Tec subcontracts basic manufacturing but retains responsibility for research and development, assembly, testing and marketing. 'This suits our philosophy,' says Mr Robinson. 'Why put money into building manufacturing plants when it can be used to develop overseas sales?'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Similarly, NWF objects to proposed 43 CFR 4.1381, which authorizes ``[a]ny person who receives a written decision from OSM'' pursuant to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) or 773.25(c)(2) to file a request for review of OSM's finding that such person is in an ownership or control link to any person cited in a violation notice within the scope of 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b). No provision for citizen-initiated appeals of these decisions exists under the proposed rules, NWF states. ``Decisions by OSM not to act on the information provided by citizens, or decisions to issue permits in the face of information that indicates an ownership or control link to a violation, should be subject to review by the Office of Hearings and Appeals,'' NWF comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NWF also criticizes lack of notice to affected citizens. Although proposed 43 CFR 4.1372(b) provides to ``OSM and all interested parties'' the right to file an answer to a request for review of a decision to suspend or rescind a permit as improvidently issued and to request an evidentiary hearing even if the person requesting review does not, it is silent as to how interested parties other than OSM are to know that a request for review has been filed, NWF states. Only counsel for OSM would be served with a copy of a request for review under 43 CFR 4.1109, NWF observes. Similarly, the rules proposed in 43 CFR 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 for review of OSM decisions concerning ownership and control links provide ``no notice to citizens who may be substantially and adversely affected by a reversal of a determination of ownership and control linkage,'' NWF comments. Specific provisions for notice to all affected persons of appeals of both kinds of OSM decisions should be adopted, NWF urges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OHA agrees that provisions for notice to citizens of appeals of OSM decisions concerning permit suspension and rescission and concerning ownership and control links and for rights of appeal of such OSM decisions were not included in the proposed rules. Adding such provisions to the final rules on the basis of NWF's comments, however, without providing an opportunity for notice and comment, might be regarded as inconsistent with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> American Federation of Labor  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Donovan,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 757 F.2d 330, 338&hyph;40 (D.C. Cir. 1985). After consultation with OSM, OHA may propose rules concerning these issues in the future. Meanwhile, no right of appeal by citizens from OSM decisions not to find an ownership or control link is available under these rules. Citizens may of course avail themselves of existing procedures, e.g., 30 CFR 773.13, 842.11, 842.12, 842.15, and 843.21, and petition for leave to intervene in proceedings under &sect;&sect;4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 in accordance with 43 CFR 4.1110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes in the Final Rules From the Proposed Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OHA believes no revisions to proposed 43 CFR 4.1370&hyph;4.1377 and 4.1380&hyph;4.1387 are required in response to the comments. However, OHA has made the following changes to the proposed rules to improve their clarity and to remove references to section numbers of the rules proposed by OSM: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. 43 CFR 4.1373(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence, and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. 43 CFR 4.1373(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. 43 CFR 4.1375: An alternative deadline is provided for issuance of an initial decision when no hearing is held. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. 43 CFR 4.1380: The language concerning the kind of OSM decisions from which a request for review may be filed has been revised to replace references to 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b) with a more general description, i.e., decisions on challenges by an applicant or other person shown in the AVS to an ownership or control link or the status of a violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. 43 CFR 4.1381(a): The specific references to proposed 30 CFR 773.24(d)(2) and 773.25(c)(2) and to 30 CFR 773.5 and 773.15(b) have been replaced with language describing the kind of OSM decision from which a request for review may be filed, i.e., a written decision by OSM, in response to a challenge from an applicant or other person shown in the AVS, on whether or not the ownership or control link has been shown to be erroneous or has been rebutted and/or whether the violation covered by the notice remains outstanding, has been corrected, or is the subject of a good faith appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. 43 CFR 4.1383(a): The phrase ``If a hearing is requested'' has been added at the beginning of the first sentence, and the remainder of the sentence revised, to account for the possibility that a hearing might not be requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. 43 CFR 4.1383(b): ``of the date of the hearing'' has been added at the end of the sentence to make clear that notice shall be given at least 10 days in advance of the hearing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

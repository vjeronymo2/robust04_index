			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERNARD BLIER; 50 YEARS IN FRENCH FILMS  </P> <P> Bernard Blier, the plump and balding French actor who incarnated hapless  husbands, conniving cops and heartless hit men over a movie career that spanned  50 years, has died, his son announced Thursday in Paris. He was 73.  </P> <P> Blier, winner of this year's prestigious Cesar award (France's equivalent of  the Oscar) for a career that included roles in about 150 films, died in  suburban Saint-Cloud after what was described only as a long illness.  </P> <P> His best-known movies ranged from Yves Allegret's "Maneges" (1949) to "Buffet  Froid" (1979), directed by his son Bertrand and starring Gerard Depardieu. He  also played opposite such greats as Jean Gabin and Simone Signoret, generally  as a corpulent, moon-faced sidekick with a caustic sense of humor.  </P> <P> Blier was born in Buenos Aires where his father, a biologist, was on assignment  for the Pasteur Institute.  </P> <P> From his first film in 1937, Raymond Rouleau's "Trois, Six, Neuf," ("Three,  Six, Nine"), followed by six other movies that same year, Blier was a  workaholic. His last role was in Moshe Misrahi's "Mangeclous" in 1988.  </P> <P> "My work is my joie de vivre," Blier once said. "Never do I go to the studio  like one goes to the office. I hate vacation."  </P></p>

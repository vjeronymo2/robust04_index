			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Uruguay Round negotiators to tackle tariff cuts TRADE negotiators in Geneva yesterday resolved to press ahead rapidly with country-by-country negotiations on cutting tariffs and other barriers to trade in goods, which form a crucial part of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. Other countries urged the US and EC to present details of their farm trade accord reached a fortnight ago. This is expected to provide the springboard for the resumed negotiations. According to US officials, the text of the agreement is awaiting approval by Brussels. Mr Warren Lavorel, US chief negotiator, said Washington hoped to present a revised detailed tariff offer before the end of the year. The Round aims to cut tariffs on average by at least one-third, but the US and EC say they want to go well beyond that.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A SuperSaver offer that isn't quite so super - Mike Truman casts an analytical eye over Norwich Union's promise to 'make your dreams come true' BEFORE a financial adviser can sell a policy, he is supposed to ensure that it is appropriate to the client's circumstances. If he does not, he could face a claim for damages from his client and an investigation by his regulatory body. No such rule protects those who reply to direct mail advertising and apply for policies by post. One such product which hit doormats all over the UK recently is the SuperSaver plan from Norwich Union. The front cover of the mailer promises 'Cash to make your dreams come true] A big cash payout when you're 65.' But the plan is not a pension policy. It is a with-profits life assurance policy, so the premiums do not qualify for tax relief and the growth in the fund is reduced by the tax the life company has to pay. The SuperSaver differs from a standard with-profits plan in several ways. First, it does not offer a choice of policy term - the policy runs to age 65. Second, the premium increases by a fifth each year for the first five years so that it has doubled from the sixth year on. It has no medical requirement because, in case of non-accidental death, it will pay out only the premiums paid (without interest) or the surrender value, if higher. This makes the policy 'non-qualifying.' There will be a charge to income tax on higher-rate taxpayers when the policy matures. So, is it good value? The obvious comparison is with a personal pension plan, since that is designed to produce a lump sum and pension at retirement. The SuperSaver illustration projects a capital sum of just under Pounds 860,000 at age 65 for a 20-year-old paying an initial premium of Pounds 60 a month. This is based on the LAUTRO-approved growth rate of 10.5 per cent. For a personal pension, the comparable growth is 13 per cent, to allow for the tax exemption that pension funds enjoy. Since pension premiums get tax relief, the same initial net premium of Pounds 60 would represent a gross premium of Pounds 80. Allowing for both these factors, the pension fund could be expected to reach Pounds 2.2m. Of this, one-quarter (or Pounds 550,000) could be paid out as a tax-free lump sum. The remainder would have to be used to buy a pension for life, but this could be 'guaranteed' so that at least five years' pension would be paid out even if the recipient died sooner. On present annuity rates, a level pension with such a guarantee would come to just under Pounds 200,000 a year. So, the pension plan would pay Pounds 500,000 on maturity, tax free, plus a further Pounds 1m (subject to tax) guaranteed over the following five years, compared with the SuperSaver projected maturity payout of Pounds 860,000. And the pension would go on paying Pounds 200,000 a year gross until death. If the projected payout from SuperSaver is compared with that from the cash lump sum and the first five years of a guaranteed personal pension net of basic rate tax, it is not until the age of 50 that the SuperSaver projects a better return - yet, it is advertised as a policy for those between 18 and 55. The one group for whom this policy could have advantages is those who want the 'death by accident' insurance and are in an occupation that makes this difficult to get. A 20-year-old window cleaner who started paying Pounds 60 a month into a SuperSaver would have a death by accident benefit of Pounds 60,000. Insurance broker Sutton Winson in Twickenham, west London, said the cheapest policy it could find for someone in such an occupation was Pounds 96 a year  -ironically, from Norwich Union. Eight pounds a month would start to make a hole in his tax savings. But anyone without sufficient life cover should get proper term assurance covering death from any cause, not just by accident. Chris Armstrong, of Norwich Union's direct marketing division, pointed to the traditionally high surrender values that the company pays on its with-profits contracts. He said this gave more flexibility than a personal pension in difficult times when people needed access to their money. He agreed, however, that no one should enter into a long-term contract intending to surrender it; a warning which is reinforced by the surrender values presented clearly in the literature. In no case is the surrender value (calculated under LAUTRO rules) projected to exceed the premiums paid within the first five years. Armstrong saw the contract as a savings plan for those who wanted something more than a building society but did not want the risk of direct equity investment. It was not a replacement for pension planning, he said. But for those who have inadequate pension arrangements, it seems that SuperSaver is not quite so super after all. 'The most appropriate targets for this plan are people who want to save for a cash lump sum and who are already in pension schemes or who do not have the option of joining one,' said Armstrong.</p>

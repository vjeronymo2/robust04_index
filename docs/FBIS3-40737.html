			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rachid Drif: "Antiterrorism: the Infernal </F> Circle"; first paragraph is ALGERIE ACTUALITE introduction]    [Excerpts] The terrorist threat remains omnipresent,  and the dismantling of armed groups by the dozen has not been  enough to check the violence. The armed movement's leadership  remains divided and fragmented, and the two underground wings  that took over the reins of the FIS [Islamic Salvation Front]  following its dissolution--Djaz'ara and Salafist--seem to be  clashing over the question of leadership. Meanwhile, no  "moderate" official of the dissolved Islamic party has come out  in favor of negotiations or participation in discussions with  the Committee on National Dialogue.    The communique from Said Makhloufi, the former "military  official" in Abdelkader Chebouti's Armed Islamic Movement [MIA],  has the merit of clarity: no dialogue and "armed struggle" until  the arrival of an "Islamic republic." That communique, according  to its author, comes in response to a meeting by the Djaz'ara  (Algerianists close to A. Hachani) that reportedly was held in  Batna at the behest of Abderrezak Redjam, former "boss" of the  FIS intelligence department.    A. Redjam is also one of the decision makers in the  "emergency unit," an FIS body established following the arrest  of Abassi Madani and Ali Benhadj in June 1991. That was the unit  in charge of clandestine tracts and propaganda for the dissolved  FIS.    Redjam, from Batna, had allegedly issued something called a  declaration "of union" (Bayane el Wihda) reporting that the  various secret FIS groups (Salafists, the Djaz'ara, and the  Muslim Brotherhood) were uniting.    Makhloufi claims that that union will split up and that only  the "Salafist path" will remain. Oddly, Makhloufi's remarks  remind one of early publications by Abdelhak Layada's Armed  Islamic Group (GIA), in which the emphasis was on the Salafist  wing in the various armed groups that had united under the  "single command" of "emir Abou Adlane" following a meeting held  at the start of 1993.    S. Makhloufi is therefore claiming to be one of the  Salafists--the radicals in the Islamic movement--and he points  out that an agreement was reached stipulating that the prime  condition for dialogue would be a return to the electoral  process.    Until recently, however, that was the condition being  insisted on by the Djaz'ara's emergency unit and repeated in  every communique from Mohamed Said, one of that wing's leaders.    No change in position has been published so far. The  disagreements between Makhloufi and the Djaz'ara seem to be the  same as those that divided Chebouti and the "emirs" of the armed  groups. The latter denied his right to be the supreme leader  because he did not take part in the "operations."    Makhloufi opposes the "politicians" for the same reasons,  just as he criticizes them for having attempted to negotiate  with the authorities through M. Merbah and Shaykh Benazzouz  Zebda. But there is also one fact that he insistently draws  attention to: Redjam and Said Guechi halted his participation  and that of Kamreddine Kherbane in meetings by the Majlis  Echoura following the events of June 1991 because of their  preparations for "jihad" [holy war]. That was when Makhloufi was  publishing his "pamphlet on civil disobedience" and going so far  as to say, in an interview with the newspaper EL KHABAR, that  "the time for jihad has arrived." Makhloufi is therefore  excluding the politicians from the decisionmaking center and, at  the same time, denying the existence of splits among the armed  groups, a report that he labels brainwashing and manipulation.  <H5>  Salafists and GIA </H5>   Since the deaths of Omar El-Eulmi and his brother  Abdennacer,  the two "muftis" of Layada's GIA who were killed five months  apart, and the arrest of Yekhlef Cherrati, the MIA's ideologist  and author of the first fatwa [Islamic legal ruling] authorizing  FIS members to commit murder "as part of" the jihad, there has  been little information about the new mufti or muftis of the  terrorist groups.    In "traditional" organization charts such as the GIA's, an  "Islamic legislative committee" headed by a "learned man" was in  charge of issuing various fatwas regarding the activity of the  groups.    That was the theory. In fact, a person with some knowledge  of  theology and possessing an audience among the underground  members would be in charge of "urgent" fatwas as well as  everyday writings.    In the case of Makhloufi's communique, which well-informed  observers say is genuine, one finds elements apparently inspired  by ECHAHADA, the GIA's underground bulletin, excerpts from which  were published by EL-WATAN EL ARABI at the beginning of the year  and whose source remains unknown.    There are similarities in the division into "zones," the  organization of the movement, and the establishment of internal  rules and of "legislation" governing the violent units.    Ten months ago, ECHAHADA published a set of "bylaws" for the  GIA in 65 articles, an "exclusive interview" with Layada, and  "carefully worked out" documents setting forth the organization  of a national movement. While Layada admitted being the GIA's  emir, he denied being the author. It would seem that Makhloufi,  who belongs to the same wing, is drawing his inspiration from  those documents. The outline of such a Salafist-type  organization could already be found in the "hard core" of the  "Allal" group, where there existed, under the "orders" of the  emir, a coordinator (Layada), a restricted majlis echoura  (Belbachir, Bouferaa, Bentebbiche, and Zermane, who is now in  prison and the only survivor out of the four), and an official  in charge of religious indoctrination (Zeraoui Hammadache, who  has been arrested). That organization was inspired mainly by  religious texts, but also by the various experiences of the  violent groups, examples being the group headed by Mustapha  Bouyali--the "emir" of El-Achour--who demanded of his movement's  members the "baya'a," or oath of allegiance, and who, taking his  inspiration from religion, had formed one of the first "majlis  echoura" in the Islamic wing in 1982. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Links </H5>   A GIA document distributed at the beginning of the year  mentioned a special "recommendation": set up "joint" armed  operations and establish links between different groups. It was  that same document, issued by the "western front," which first  mentioned plans to "strike at foreign investments and then at  their representatives."    The Armed Islamic Movement is fragmented, and despite the  "efforts" of political leaders or heads of terrorist groups such  as Layada and Chebouti, both now gone from the scene, plans for  a structured nationwide organization have failed.    But there are small illegal groups that join together for  specific operations, and terrorists with police records--and who  are therefore wanted by police--pass from one group to another  and frequently move from one region to another.    Ties and contacts exist between former members of the  dissolved FIS who have gone underground, and it is all those  networks that now make up the terrorist web that is so difficult  to evaluate. The GIA and MIA are only acronyms--the entire  movement forms an obscure and constantly changing whole with no  definite lines of organization but with networks that link up  with each other from time to time.    It is possible to begin with one individual and trace one's  way back to various tiny groups and movements.    For example, police arrested a man named Damerdji Kamel last  12 March for aiding a terrorist group. He has just been  sentenced to six years in prison.    Damerdji was collecting money at the request of his  brother-in-law, who is none other than Moussa Kraouche, the  spokesman for the Algerian Fraternity in France (FAF).    The sums of money collected in that way were to be turned  over to a certain Sayeh Attia in Medea. In exchange, Kraouche  provided Damerdji with a checking account in France.    Sayeh Attia, alias "Khan," alias "Younes," has been a wanted  man for several months. He is considered a "very dangerous  member" of the armed movement.    A native of Ouled Hellal and 37 years old, he is one of the  perpetrators still being sought in connection with the attack on  the barracks in Boughezoul that resulted in 18 dead at the start  of the year.    Several soldiers had their throats cut, and the group had  accomplices inside the barracks.    According to investigators in the security services, Attia  is  the son of a harki [Algerian soldier who fought for the French  against Algerian revolutionaries] and a former member of the FIS.    One of the group's leaders who is still a fugitive is  "Djaafar El-Afghani," whose real name is Si-Ahmed Mourad. A  "repentant" former musician, he is a native of Tablat. Today he  is considered one of the most formidable terrorists--like Allal,  known as "Moh Leveilley," with whom he reportedly was in contact  in their neighborhood in Hussein-Dey.    Si-Ahmed Mourad, who was involved in the attack on the  airport with members of the MIA, has an exploit to his credit  that tells it all. At the age of 29 years, while operating in  the Algiers region, he was among the perpetrators of the attack  on the former minister of defense. According to confessions by  former members of his group, he made detailed plans for  kidnapping the three French consular agents that he wanted to  exchange for Layada, and while living in Algiers, he went to  Boughezoul for a "big operation." He is the sort of hard-core  individual for whom violence has no limits: one of the Salafists  who do not hesitate to slit throats for the "cause." With them  there can be no dialogue, and everyone, even the Djaz'ara, has  realized that.</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Nuell Pulled From 'Today': Dave Nuell, who was negotiating with NBC to take  over the troubled "Today" show Jan. 8, is no longer a candidate for the job,  the Washington Post reported Monday. NBC News president Michael Gartner  notified Nuell by overnight letter Friday that negotiations with him were  terminated and that NBC had decided to withdraw its offer. Nuell, 47, guided  "Entertainment Tonight" to its current success in TV syndication. He was  stunned when reached in Santa Barbara. "We had a three-year firm deal that NBC  reneged on. I intend to take every remedy I have to try to repair the damage,"  the 20-year broadcast news veteran said. "We have tried at NBC News to conclude  an agreement with Mr. Nuell since the earliest days of September," NBC News  executive vice president Dick Ebersol said. "Our efforts to do so seem to have  been continually thwarted. Our needs at the 'Today' show are such that we have  to move on." NBC sources said that Marty Ryan, executive producer of the  program, will remain in charge for now. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

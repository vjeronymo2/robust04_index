			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Danielle Yang] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 28 (CNA) -- A French technology  exhibition will open at Taipei's World Trade Center on July 1,  with more than 100 French manufacturers participating.    On display will be high-tech products from the aerospace,  transportation, energy, telecommunications, electronics,  measuring and control equipment, environmental technology,  construction, medical, and petrochemical industries.    The four-day exhibition will be jointly sponsored by the  French Institute in Taipei (FIT) and the French Committee for  Trade Events Abroad (CFME). The show is the centerpiece of a  series of "French Month" activities, which begin June 20.    Noted French high-tech companies such as Dassault, [passage  indistinct] the Mirage-2000 jet fighter; high-speed railway  manufacturer GEC Alsthom; Nuclear Energy Company Cogema, and  Fram Atome will display their latest products at the show, which  is France's biggest exhibition in Asia in the past 15 years.    CFME President Paul Hunsinoer said the French technology  exhibition will introduce French expertise and developmental  experiences in high technology to Taiwan firms, hopefully  leading to bilateral cooperation.    FIT Director Jean Paul Reau said the French Government  unveiled a forward-looking plan in February to promote a new  strategy toward Asia aiming to increase its export ratio in the  Asian market from the current 7 percent to more than 10 percent  of its total exports within five years. He said Taiwan was at  the forefront of the plan.    Reau said that because France specializes in some high-tech  industries which are being developed here, it can fully supply  and transfer its high-technologies to Taiwan.    Taiwan is situated at the hub of Asia and is an admirable  economic and trade power, Reau said. He added that there is no  barrier for technology transfer to the island.    Some 130 French enterprises have set up footholds in Taiwan,  Reau said. He added that the French technology exhibition will  allow the people of Taiwan to see a totally different view of  France besides the traditionally romantic one. The second  French technology exhibition is scheduled to be held in Kuala  Lumpur in October this year.</p>

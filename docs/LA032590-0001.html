			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> O, HAPPY DAYS!  </P> <P> I enjoyed reading "O, Happy Days!" The cover, showing a neighborhood in Sherman  Oaks in 1957, was particularly interesting. Only one thing was missing -- a  picture of that same street as it looks 33 years later.  </P> <P> WM. R.

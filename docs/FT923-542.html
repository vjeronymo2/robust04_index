			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Cadbury attacks old-boy network BRITISH COMPANIES should adopt an objective approach and appoint to their boards more women and others from a wider variety of backgrounds, Sir Adrian Cadbury said yesterday. Sir Adrian is chairman of Pro Ned, the organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors. The body yesterday called on company chairmen to abandon the 'old-boy network'. Sir Adrian said shareholders are also entitled to full information about all aspects of directors' pay, and standards should be openly debated and agreed. Writing in Pro Ned's 10th annual review, Sir Adrian said companies should 'look beyond the limited circle which the chairman and their boards normally have in mind'. He said they would benefit by drawing on a wider pool of talent, including divisional directors of leading companies, academics and those with extensive management experience in the public and voluntary sectors. Mr Colin St Johnston, Pro Ned managing director, said a recent survey by the organisation had shown that 86 per cent of senior business people and investors were dissatisfied with the appointment process of non-executive directors, and less than a quarter of companies prepared a job profile for these appointments. Sir Adrian said that selection should involve the board as a whole through a nomination committee. He said the process should begin by discussing the skills and experience which would complement those of existing executives. He said one of the main themes running through the report issued earlier this year by a committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, which he chaired, was the need for able, independent-minded, non-executive directors. He stressed that non-executives were an integral part of the board rather than having a separate existence. Sir Adrian favours changing 'non-executive director' to the US term 'outside director' - 'an accurate description without overtones'.</p>

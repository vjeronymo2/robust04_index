			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Hong Kong land talks extended British and Chinese diplomats negotiating the future of military land in Hong Kong have for the second time postponed conclusion of their talks in an attempt to reach an agreement. Mr Guo Fengmin, China's chief representative to the Joint Liaison Group (JLG), a bilateral group which deals with Hong Kong's reversion to China in 1997, said the 29th plenary of the JLG would reconvene on Thursday. Tomorrow Hong Kong's Legislative Council votes on Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation. Miss Emily Lau, an activist for greater democracy in Hong Kong, said China had delayed making a decision in order to intimidate legislators ahead of tomorrow's vote - expected to be close run. Last Thursday the JLG meeting was suspended until yesterday in the hope of an agreement being produced. Both teams worked until early yesterday morning on the terms of a deal which is expected to result in the Hong Kong government building the Chinese navy a new base, and refitting an unknown number of existing British military bases for use by the People's Liberation Army. Mr Hugh Davies, his British counterpart, said: 'There were still some issues in the defence lands portfolio which need to be sorted out.' It is understood that the two sides reached agreement yesterday and that it is being referred to Beijing for ratification. A sticking point was a Chinese demand that the UK government guarantee completion of the naval base and refitting of military sites. It is understood a form of words which satisfies the Chinese but which does not commit the UK Treasury to pay for the work has been agreed.</p>

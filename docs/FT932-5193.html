			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UN starts aid appeal for Angola THE United Nations yesterday launched a Dollars 226m appeal for humanitarian aid for Angola, where 'on a conservative estimate' 1,000 people a day are dying from famine and malnutrition as a result of the upsurge in fighting. Miss Margaret Anstee, UN special envoy for Angola, who presented the appeal in Geneva, said afterwards that donor nations had pledged an estimated Dollars 70m in immediate response, and more had been promised. Describing Angola as a 'forgotten tragedy', the appeal document said renewed civil strife had 'caused thousands of deaths, injuries, massive internal displacement, destitution of over 2m Angolans, material deprivation, psychological trauma and the collapse of social and economic systems'. Miss Anstee said that, in the absence of a ceasefire between government forces and Unita rebels, the UN was proposing an emergency plan for one month as part of the year-long aid programme. She dismissed claims by Unita that the UN was biased in choosing where to deliver aid, but admitted Unita-held areas were less secure for aid workers. Unita now controlled an estimated 75-80 per cent of Angolan territory, she said.</p>

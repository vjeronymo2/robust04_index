Radetskiy  assumed the post of defense minister, we must admit that at this  stage the Army's social problems have not only exacerbated but  also acquired a specific quality. Over the last two years, we  spared no effort to return thousands of Ukrainian servicemen  from the hotspots of the former USSR to Ukraine, in accordance  with a presidential edict. About 20,000 servicemen returned  home while we were expecting 150,000.    Thus, our expectations fell flat. Very rapidly, the number  of those who wanted to serve in the Ukrainian Army dramatically  plummeted. Today, a contrary process is gaining momentum: A  mass drain of officers has started. Some 60 percent of young  officers have recently requested dismissal. In Odessa Military  District alone, some 2,500 officers resigned in 1992, while in  1993 this figure increased by 30 percent.    It is sad that among those who do everything in their power  to resign, there are many high-skilled professionals who only  yesterday dreamed of coming back to Ukraine and continue serving  under the national banner.    Enlisted men also do not wish to serve in our Army. Most  military units are 30 percent under strength. Desertion  continues to be a commonplace phenomenon. The number of young  people who want to enter military high-education institutions  has decreased threefold. Even those whose dissertations are  almost ready are leaving.    What makes our servicemen shun the Army that we created? Of  course, some of the reasons are widely known, including the  acute housing problem (we have more than 80,000 homeless  servicemen), low wages, and a dramatic downturn in the prestige  of the military profession.    However, there is another reason which is equally important.  The point is that over a long period of time, officers have  been living in a state of uncertainty. They feel that nobody  needs their professional skills. What will happen to them  tomorrow? What does the upcoming reduction of the Army have in  store for them? Will their social problems be resolved? Nobody  gives them any answers. Besides, the Army has no ideological  platform, which in turn causes complete confusion.    The servicemen's uncertainty is aggravated with serious  mistakes made by the Defense Ministry leadership in the sphere  of personnel policy. In the initial stage of forming the  Ukrainian Armed Forces, at the initiative of the Officers' Union  led by General Major V. Mulyava, an open purge of the officers'  corps was carried out. Preference was given to people  recommended by those political forces that supported General  Colonel K. Morozov.    Since General V. Radetskyy came to the Army, there have been  attempts to improve the situation. However, very soon,  ministerial offices were manned by people from the new  minister's team. Incidentally, these people do not always have  necessary education and experience.    For example, we once resolutely opposed the policies of  General V. Mulyava who arranged it so that specialists employed  in his department were not responsible for anything. Nobody was  allowed to hold them responsible for desertion of soldiers,  hazing of conscripts, or conflicts in military units. We hoped  that the appointment of General V. Kobzar would bring positive  changes. However, the ministry has started to form bodies that  resemble former political departments, which is even more  dangerous than former inaction.    People in the Army are enraged by the fact that military  colleges that had a long tradition of training officers are  being closed down and their property looted. At the same time,  it is hard to understand why the ministry appoints a  professional commander who has no concept of resolving  pedagogical and scientific problems to the post of Department of  Military Education chief. This person's lack of flexibility can  do more harm than former chiefs' activities.    It is hard to put up with the return of those military  chiefs  who were lying in wait while our Army was being built. Today,  they all rushed to divide the spoils of victory. This leads to  never ending reshuffles and fights for cushy jobs.    I understand that this overabundance of generals seems  quite natural to Defense Ministry officials, but among the  military this trend meets with ever growing indignation.  Officers keep asking me: Is this a feast in times of trouble  or intoxication with success? Are the degeneration of military  training in units, the deterioration of combat readiness, and  the destruction of the system of military education considered  accomplishments?    I understand perfectly well that General V. Radetskiy is  making his first steps in his new post and it would be unfair to  blame everything on him. I also understand that after the  publishing of this article I am going to become an object of  harsh criticism.    However, being one of those who initiated the fight for the  creation of a new Ukrainian Army, I cannot put up with the fact  that our most elated ideals may be rejected as worthless junk  and buried under the trash of personal ambitions and militant  nonprofessionalism. I am grieved to see that having discarded  many useful things that existed in the Soviet Army, we have  inherited solely its negative traits. The people hoped that we  would build an Army from which servicemen would return home  unharmed, where officer's honor would be the most valuable  virtue, and where brotherhood in arms would not be a meaningless  phrase. It seems that today, we are farther from this ideal  than we were two years ago.    The Committee for the Social Protection of Servicemen is not  going to turn a blind eye to these drawbacks. We will continue  to fight for rooting out these disgraceful phenomena, even if  somebody does not like this.    The Defense Ministry Chief Personnel Directorate can serve  as  a vivid example of an over-staffed department. In the former  Soviet Army, 100 specialists were dealing with personnel issues  of servicemen deployed in three military districts. The same  number of officers led by Lieutenant General A. Ignatenko  resolved the complex issues of the formation of the Ukrainian  Armed Forces. Right now, when the numerical strength of the  Army has been reduced twofold, the number of personnel clerks  has doubled.    The race for ranks and posts has reached exorbitant  dimensions. I remember how we were planning that there would be  no more than 100 generals in the Ukrainian Army. However, as  early as this year, there are more than 300 of them. Thirty two  officers were promoted to the rank of general on Ukrainian Army  Day alone. I want to point out that there are only 200 generals  in all of NATO.    We have become accustomed to breakneck careers. The  unheard-of promotion of V. Mulyava from sergeant to general has  become the talk of the town, but the fact that V. Kobzar in  three months covered the distance between colonel to lieutenant  general is also far from normal. I, for one, was a regiment  commander for 13 years before being promoted to general.    K. Paustovskiy once wrote that in times of flourishing,  states produce heroes and in times of decline -- bureaucrats.</p>

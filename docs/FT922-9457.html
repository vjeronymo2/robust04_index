			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World standard training targets to be promoted THE GOVERNMENT is for the first time actively to support the promotion of world-class targets for training. Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, in a letter to the chairmen of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils, said one of her main goals was to raise awareness of national education and training targets. The targets were initially set by the government but were abandoned by her predecessor, Mr Michael Howard, who subsequently supported their voluntary resurrection by the Confederation of British Industry. Mr Howard never said they were one of his priorities. Tecs will be responsible at local level for working towards the ambitious targets, which include 80 per cent of young people reaching National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) at level two by 1996. At present, 40 per cent achieve that level. Resources will be provided at national level to promote the targets through the National Training Task Force, a group of senior business leaders. Mrs Shephard, in her letter to the 82 Tecs, outlined six goals that she wanted to achieve in the Tec area. She will discuss them today when she meets G10, the group of 10 chairmen of Tecs that represents the common concerns of the movement to government. G10 will present its own agenda for change at the meeting. Tecs are concerned about various issues, including cuts in training budgets this year which they claim may affect the quality of training. Mrs Shephard will find it as difficult as her predecessor to fight for more funds from the Treasury but Tecs believe she may take a more active approach to promoting them. Mrs Shepard's goals are: raising awareness of and securing commitments to targets and securing their delivery; boosting the performance of Investors in People; promotion of Tecs, defence of their budgets and clarification of their relationship with government; and taking forward work on women's issues.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DON'T CAUSE TROUBLE  </P> <P> When will the papers start printing something about the 98% of the people in  the Valley who don't try to cause trouble.  </P> <P> I'd like to see the papers ask people what types of things they'd like to see  in the future. Porter Ranch is an example.  </P> <P> With a new mall planned for that area, why don't the papers ask what kind of  stores we shoppers would like to have? Or how about asking businesses if they  would be interested in locating there?  </P> <P> I will put my vote in now for Porter Ranch to have a Nordstrom so I won't have  to drive so far to shop there.  </P> <P> LUCINDA DERANGO  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

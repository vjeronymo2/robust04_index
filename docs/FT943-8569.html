			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan computer products boosted The strength of the yen has spurred Taiwan's exports of computer-related products to Japan, but not enough to turn around the latter's bilateral trade surplus. Taiwan's exports to Japan of information products, including hardware and software, jumped 67.5 per cent in the first half of 1994, compared with a year earlier, according to the Taiwan Industrial Development Bureau. Such exports are expected to surpass Dollars 450m for the year, against Dollars 232m last year. The Taiwan dollar has fallen by nearly a quarter against the yen in the last year. The bureau predicts Taiwan-made information products will make up 17 per cent of Japan's computer market by the end of the year. Japanese demand was boosted by increased demand for DOS software, which Taiwan produces relatively cheaply, as it is one of the main producers of IBM-compatible personal computers. DOS programs are the basic operating software for IBM-type PCs. However, Taiwan's computer industry remains heavily reliant on expensive high-technology imports, mainly from Japan. Key components including the liquid crystal display for computer monitors, hard disk drives, and more advanced memory chips are bought from Japan. Imported components make up roughly half the production cost of a personal computer made in Taiwan. That figure contributes to Taiwan's trade deficit with Japan, which was Dollars 14.42bn in 1993 and is forecast to top Dollars 16bn this year. Taiwan ranked fifth in output of computer hardware products after the US, Japan, the UK and Singapore in 1993, according to government figures. Revenues for the information sector (hardware, software and services) climbed 15.5 per cent to Dollars 10.8bn, of which Dollars 1.1bn was generated from software and services.</p>

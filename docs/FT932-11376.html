			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Union steels E German resolve MR Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, yesterday vowed to intensify strike action in east Germany if employers do not reinstate a previously agreed contract. 'We do not want eastern German workers to remain poor, a mezzogiorno,' he told the FT. 'We do not want the employers to break the tradition of collective wage bargaining in east Germany, and then later in west Germany.' Earlier this year employers cancelled the March 1991 contract with the union which would have equalised eastern and western wages by 1994. They did so because of recession in western Germany and low productivity in the east, which in the metal, engineering and steel sector, is lagging behind western Germany by about 70 per cent. 'There are some industries - take Opel, the new car plant, for example  - which have higher productivity than in the west. But the issue is not an economic one,' said Mr Steinkuhler. 'It is a political one. We need an industrial policy for the region.' Mr Steinkuhler dismissed the argument that a low wage economy might in fact help make the eastern German economy competitive through attracting more investment. 'And what would low wages do? The younger generation and skilled workers would migrate westwards. Stemming migration was one of the reasons why we signed the contract in 1991. Thousands of people were leaving each month. We cannot allow that to happen again,' he said. In any case, the dapper union leader explained, this year's pay rises of 26 per cent for metal and engineering, and 21 per cent for the steel, calculated on western German wages levels for 1992, do not take into account the fact that working hours are longer, holidays shorter, and benefits fewer in eastern Germany. Eastern wages, in reality, are 60 per cent of western German levels. 'Why should they pay west German prices with east German wages,' he asked. Mr Steinkuhler is on a 'whistle-stop' tour of the five east German states to coincide with the first official strikes held in the region since 1933. Yesterday he told stevedores in Rostock that they had the freedom to strike and defend their rights. The last time they tried was in 1931. Two years later Hitler banned all strikes, and the communists followed suit when they assumed power. Despite the subdued response to the strikes, Mr Steinkuhler said he was prepared to ballot, on May 10, the metal and electrical workers in the three remaining states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Berlin-Brandenburg. But he added, if some enterprises pay wage increases as agreed in the contract, he will ask these factories to sign individual contracts with the union. Other officials hinted the union might be prepared to postpone the timetable to income parity but in no way would this year's wage increases be compromised. Whatever the outcome, Mr Steinkuhler is convinced workers in eastern Germany will no longer be afraid to strike.</p>

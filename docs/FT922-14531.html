			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Pressure on Mexico in Nafta talks US and Canadian trade chiefs are expected to press their Mexican counterpart at a meeting in Montreal today for concessions in key areas of negotiations towards a North American free trade agreement (Nafta), write Bernard Simon in Toronto and Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mexican restrictions on imports of automotive products and on foreign investment in the energy industry are likely to be among the issues during the three-day meeting of US trade representative Mrs Carla Hills, Canadian trade minister Michael Wilson and Mexican commerce secretary Jaime Serra Puche. Although a senior Canadian official said the meeting would lay the groundwork for the 'final phase' of the Nafta negotiations, there is still uncertainty whether an agreement can be put in place before the US elections in November. A Canadian official said 'a considerable amount of work' remained to be done on some of the most sensitive issues. The automotive sector is among those where the strongest disagreements remain. The three countries have so far failed to come up with common definitions for determining rules of origin.</p>

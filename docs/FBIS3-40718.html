			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Dec. 1--In what could be termed as the  most soul-searching exercise since Mr. Narasimha Rao came to  power in June 1991, a meeting of the Congress(I) Working  Committee here tonight devoted the bulk of its time to  discussing the party's debacle in Uttar Pradesh and what needed  to be done to make good the loss of the traditional base among  the backward sections of society including the minorities.    The Committee meeting to deliberate on the election results  in the five States of the Northern belt and the future  implications of the verdict for the party appears to have been  dominated by the Union Welfare Minister, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, who  has been highly critical in the last four days of the leadership  for its failure to capitalise on the fertile ground for the  Congress(I) in the Hindi heartland.    To continue: The party spokesman, Mr. V.N. Gadgil, who  briefed correspondents on the deliberations of the Committee  meeting, said only six members of the CWC got an opportunity to  express their views on the just concluded elections and the  Committee would continue with the introspection session  tomorrow. Mr. Kesri, who was the first speaker at the meeting,  was expected to continue with his speech tomorrow as he had to  leave mid-way to attend an official function.    Among those who took part in the two and half hour meeting  were Mr. R.K. Dhawan, Mr. A.K. Antony, Mr. Sitaram Kesri, Mr.  N.D. Tiwary, Mr. K. Karunakaran and Mr. Pranab Mukherjee.  Presided over by the party president, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao,  the meeting was attended by all the memberts barring four who  were busy either in Shimla or Jaipur in managing the post-poll  situation in these States. Those absent at the meeting included  Mr. Rajesh Pilot, Mr. Balram Jakhar and Mr. Nawal Kishore Sharma.    In response to questions, Mr. Gadgil said two members of the  Committee disapproved of the letter of the Union Minister for  Parliamentary Affairs, Mr. P.R. Kumaramangalam, seeking the  resignation of all members of the CWC for their collective  failure in managing the U.P. Assembly election. Asked about the  reported resignation of Mr. Kumaramangalam, Mr. Gadgil expressed  surprise over the development and said he was not aware of any  such resignation.    Supports Rao: In his presentation before the CWC, Mr. R.K.  Dhawan is reported to have argued in favour of Mr. Narasimha Rao  and maintained that the defeat of the BJP was a historic  achievement for the party. He referred to 'deliberate attempts'  by vested interests to project that the Congress(I) was nowhere  in the picture and said the rank and file in the party had  proved beyond doubt that the party was strong and the people  were behind it.    Mr. Kesri in his speech is reported to have complained that  the party did not succeed in projecting the achievements of the  Government for the welfare of the backward classes, particularly  its decision to implement the Mandal Commission report. He  pleaded that Committee members take note of the changed social  reality, particularly in U.P., and emphasised the need to create  a more pro-backward and minorities image. A strong plea for  greater representation of BCs and minorities in the party power  structures was also made.    The controversial issue of distribution of tickets among the  kith and kin of the big guns in the party in Rajasthan and the  consequent damage to the prospects of the party in the State  also figured in the course of the deliberations. However, no  names were mentioned in this connection.    It was mentioned that the success in Madhya Pradesh was  partly due to the distribution of party tickets to 80-odd  members of backward classes. The Committee was told that the  minorities in other States opted for the Congress only because  they had no choice unlike as in U.P. A suggestion was made for  strengthening the Seva Dal as a volunteer force to match the RSS.    Research wing: There was a suggestion for the creation of a  research wing to analyse the election results particularly in  Uttar Pradesh. It was mentioned that of the 28 seats, won by the  party in the State, 20 had been captured after a gap of several  years. It was also said that in Madhya Pradesh, there was  consistency in the performance of the party in the 1991 Lok  Sabha and the current Assembly elections and a point was made  whether there was any model which could be replicated from the  M.P. example.    A member of the Committee suggested that a three-day  extended  session of the CWC meeting be called after the coming session of  Parliament for a detailed review of the election results. The  CWC would consider the suggestion tomorrow.    The ongoing session of the CWC is certain to overshadow the  scheduled customary meeting of the Congress(I) Parliamentary  Party coinciding with the winter session of Parliament tomorrow.</p>

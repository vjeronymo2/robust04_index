			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Nuclear Research: Commission To </F> Vote on Three Specific Research Programmes"; as released by  Brussels Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] The European Commission is due to vote on March 10  on its proposed Decisions for nuclear research over the next  four years. As the Council of Ministers has still not adopted  the 4th Framework Programme for European Union R&amp;D of which  the  specific nuclear programmes form part, it is not yet clear what  procedure the coming Commission meeting will adopt: Any change  in the overall budget agreed on for the Framework Programme  could, of course, have repercussions on the amount available for  the specific programmes.    There are three specific Euratom programmes for Union  research and education actions in the nuclear domain, covering  nuclear safety and security, controlled thermonuclear fusion and  the future activities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) between  1995 and 1998. The draft Decisions which are due to be adopted  on March 10 set out the criteria which should govern the  selection of joint EU action in these fields, the scientific and  technological aims of the programmes and, of course, the budget  figures. Provisional funding for the three programmes is set at  160 million ECUs, 794 mECUs and 300 mECUs for nuclear safety,  fusion and JRC activities respectively.  <H5>  Nuclear Safety </H5>   Although the EU's nuclear industry is considered relatively  safe, at least when compared with other parts of the world, it  remains unacceptable in the eyes of significant sections of  European society.    The Commission argues, therefore, that European research in  this field should be targeted towards raising understanding of  the issues involved and awareness of the risks associated with  the use of nuclear energy and the entire nuclear fuel cycle.  The technical maturity of EU nuclear technology by no means  rules out the desirability of seeking new technological  solutions for the industry's problems, particularly  concentrating on the areas of radiation exposure for people and  the environment.    The activities proposed illustrate the new approach the  Commission would like to adopt, exploring ways of improving the  use of nuclear energy through an integrated approach dealing  with the three areas that cause most concern: reactor safety,  management of highly-radioactive material and the dangers of  fissile material falling into the wrong hands.  <H5>  Nuclear Fusion </H5>   The long-term aim of EU action in this field, which brings  together in one international programme all the thermonuclear  fusion activities carried out in the EU Member States, Sweden  and Switzerland, is to produce safe and environmentally-friendly  prototype reactors, which can eventually be used to produce  acceptably-priced electricity. It will take decades and huge  amounts of cash to attain this goal. For the period 1994-1998,  the priority aim is to set out the detailed plans for the Next  Step experimental reactor, whose purpose is to demonstrate the  scientific and technological feasibility of nuclear fusion for  peaceful purposes. Next Step comes under the four-partner  cooperation between Euratom, the US, Japan and Russia on  ITER-EDA, the International Thermonuclear Experimental  Reactor-Engineering Design Activities.    In parallel, research efforts will be concentrated on two  other areas of activity:    a) improving the technological concepts necessary for the  design, in the more distant future, of a demonstration reactor  (DEMO) capable of producing substantial quantities of  electricity; and    b) in the even more distant future, providing technically-,  economically- and environmentally-acceptable solutions to the  problems associated with using nuclear fusion to produce energy.  These activities will be conducted through both DEMO and ITER.    Given the overwhelming cost and time-span involved, the  Commission intends actively to encourage industry to participate  in the research and will be examining the possibilities of  extending international cooperation beyond ITER.  <H5>  Joint Research Centre </H5>   The JRC will continue to conduct strategic and applied  European research. In accordance with the priorities set out in  the White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, its  activities will be geared towards reinforcing the international  competitivity of European industry. They will also aim to  guarantee the independent scientific expertise necessary for  implementating EU policies, provide the EU institutions with  competent scientific services, improve public safety and  environmental protection and, finally, reduce the disparities  existing between the Member States in terms of scientific and  technological know-how.    Over the next four years, the Commission recommends that the  work of the JRC should be concentrated on two categories of  research into nuclear fission safety and controlled  thermonuclear fusion: institutional research activities, on the  one hand, and scientific and technical support for EU policies,  on the other.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned from the provincial meeting of tax  bureau directors, which was held a few day ago, that the new  taxation system was operating well in Hainan and had smoothly  converged with the province's preferential policy. In the  course of implementing the new taxation system, the Hainan  special zone's taxation policy remained unchanged.    After the convergence of the new taxation system and  preferential policy in income tax, the province has continued to  implement the enterprise income tax rate of 15 percent and the  policy of giving enterprises various tax exemptions and  reductions in time-limit terms. The specific contents are as  follows: 1) Fifteen percent income tax will be collected from  foreign-invested and domestically invested enterprises in Hainan  (with the exception of state banks and insurance companies) on  income from their operations and other sources, and they will  exempted from local taxes. 2) Preferential considerations will  be given to the income tax enterprises should pay in accordance  with the professions they are in, the time limit of their  operations, and the size of their investment. 3) Forty percent  of the income tax which investors from outside the borders have  paid for profits made in the province will be returned to them  if they reinvest this portion to set up new enterprises or  expand production in China and their operation last no less than  five years. All such income tax will be returned to enterprises  which reinvest the portion of profits in the province's  infrastructure, agricultural development, export of products,  and enterprises which are verified by the provincial government  as advanced technology enterprises. Those which have operated  less than five year and quit the province should give back the  returned income tax mentioned above. 4) Foreign investors who  do not set up any institutions in China will be exempted from  advance income tax when it comes to their dividends, interest,  rents, fees for use of franchises, and income from other  resources they get from Hainan.    With regard to the turnover tax: 1) With the exception of  tobacco, wine, sugar, and mineral oils on which the collection  of value-added and consumer taxes in the production process is  halved, no value-added and consumption taxes will be levied on  goods produced and sold by enterprises on the island. 2) No  consumption tax will be levied on taxable consumer goods which  are directly exported by producing enterprises of the Hainan  special zone or exported through foreign trade enterprises; a  zero tax rate will be pursued in the direct export of the  products on which value-added tax should be levied, and, as for  the tax volume of imported goods, enterprises are entitled to  apply with tax institutions for tax reimbursements according to  state stipulations. As far as products which are free from  value-added and consumption taxes in the production process and  sold to foreign trade are concerned, after they are exported,  the foreign trade enterprises should apply with tax institutions  for tax reimbursements according to state stipulations. 3) No  business tax will be collected from the business revenues of  foreign banks and Sino-foreign joint-venture banks (insurance  companies) set up in the Hainan Special Economic Zone within  five years from the beginning of the operations. After their  tax-exemption period expires, business taxes will be levied on  them at a rate of 3 percent.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pirelli gives minorities more time on rights PIRELLI, the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday bowed to pressure from minority shareholders in its Amsterdam-listed Pirelli Tyre Holding (PTH) subsidiary by amending the terms of its proposed rights issue announced in October. Under the proposal, disclosed at a shareholders' meeting yesterday, Pirelli is giving minorities in PTH more time to decide to subscribe to new shares being issued by the use of warrants. The scheme will allow the timing for the rights issue, which will double PTH's share capital by raising Fl 465m (Dollars 259m), to remain unchanged while meaning that minority shareholders have much more time to decide to subscribe. The original proposal for a one-for-one rights issue at PTH's nominal share price of Fl 10 was criticised by minorities, which own 21 per cent of the company. Brokers complained the terms obliged them to subscribe to the new stock or see their holdings diluted. The announcement of the original plan triggered a 45 per cent fall in PTH's share price as minorities dumped shares ahead of the deal. Shares in PTH were sold at Fl 54 on flotation in June 1989. The decision to revise the terms gives minority shareholders a six-month breathing space to decide whether to subscribe after the rights issue takes place next January. Pirelli will underwrite the entire transaction and offer minority shareholders warrants, excercisable over a six-month period following PTH's annual meeting in June 1993, at a price equal to the shares' nominal value of Fl 10 each. Minority shareholders will have time to assess PTH's financial performance throughout 1993 before committing themselves to buying new shares. Meanwhile, PTH will benefit from urgently needed new funds as soon as the rights issue takes place next January.</p>

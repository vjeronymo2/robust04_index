			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Craxi fails to hand in passport The mystery surrounding the whereabouts of Italy's disgraced former Prime Minister Bettino Craxi deepened yesterday after he sent a sick note telling magistrates he was too ill to hand in his passport. Milan magistrates last week ordered the former Socialist party leader, who faces 20 different graft investigations, to surrender his passport for fear he might flee the country. But Mr Craxi, prime minister from 1983 to 1987 and one of Italy's best known politicians, has disappeared and is thought to be abroad. The certificate, signed by a foreign doctor whose nationality has not been released, is reported to refer to diabetes, a condition which Mr Craxi has suffered from for many years. Milan magistrates could issue an international arrest warrant for Mr Craxi unless he materialises by the weekend.</p>

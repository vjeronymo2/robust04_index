			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: ICL shows 40% fall to Pounds 23.4m - Outcome depressed by restructuring charges and higher interest costs Restructuring charges, higher interest payments and weak markets depressed 1993 pre-tax profits at ICL, the UK-based computer company owned by Fujitsu of Japan. However, Mr Peter Bonfield, chairman and chief executive, said ICL had achieved its objectives: to improve revenues, reduce overheads, remain profitable and conserve cash. After deducting restructuring charges of Pounds 47.7m (Pounds 33.9m) and net interest costs of Pounds 25.2m (Pounds 22m), pre-tax profits for the year to end-December fell by 40 per cent from Pounds 38.6m to Pounds 23.4m. Turnover improved 6 per cent from Pounds 2.48bn to Pounds 2.62bn, and after a higher tax charge of Pounds 18m (Pounds 10.4m) and minority interests of Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 1.9m) retained earnings were Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 26.3m). Year-end net debt was reduced to Pounds 51m (Pounds 94.2m), giving gearing of 18 per cent. ICL raised Pounds 50m from Fujitsu last year through a rights issue with the guarantee of a further Pounds 50m this year. Mr Bonfield said the company had spent more than Pounds 1bn on acquisitions, joint ventures, research and development and rationalisation over the past three years. Last year it spent Pounds 209m on research and development. It aims to work more closely with Fujitsu on advanced projects to share costs. In particular, ICL is working on a joint multimedia venture which the Japanese company is funding. ICL has undergone substantial reorganisation in the past three years. The company now derives more revenues from computing services than from hardware manufacture. Mainframe sales account for less than 10 per cent of revenues. The company has been split up into 26 semi-autonomous business units to achieve a better market focus while controlling costs. The business units demonstrate a diversity of growth and profitability. Revenues at CFM Group, ICL's facilities management operation, grew by 77 per cent last year, while sales in the retail systems unit grew by 17 per cent. Pressure on costs and staff numbers had been maintained, Mr Bonfield said. Overheads had been reduced by about Pounds 100m last year while staff numbers, currently about 25,000, were being reduced by an average of 5 per cent a year. Plans to float up to 49 per cent of the company on the London Stock Exchange are still in place, but await improved economic conditions. Mr Bonfield said he saw no improvement in the market, but that 1994 would see the completion of restructuring measures and the elimination of much of the company's debt, giving the possibility of improved profits in 1995.</p>

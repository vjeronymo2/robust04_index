			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> '89 ENCORES;  </P> <P> ON THIS LAST DAY OF THE YEAR, AND OF THE 1980S, THE VIEW STAFF PAYS A RETURN  VISIT TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO MADE NEWS IN 1989.;  </P> <P> ENDING UNCERTAINTY  </P> <P> When he was 36, author Richard Yates wrote a novel, "Revolutionary Road," which  was lavishly lauded by playwright Tennessee Williams. In the decades since  then, Yates has consistently produced books that have been critically praised  but commercially unrewarding. His themes have never been upbeat, and he has  supported himself and his family largely on fees from teaching creative writing  classes.  </P> <P> When he was interviewed last July, Yates was teaching at USC while working on a  novel based on material drawn from his stint as a speechwriter for Atty. Gen.  Robert Kennedy.  </P> <P> The book's title -- "Uncertain Times" -- sums up the writer's financial status  over much of his working life. Ironically, it is "Uncertain Times" that has  brought Yates the measure of economic security he has long sought to support  his writing.  </P> <P> Contracted to another publisher for the book, Yates was unexpectedly offered a  two-book contract with his long-time supporter, Seymour Lawrence, who gave him  the advance to write his first novel nearly 30 years ago. "It was a lucky  break," allows Yates, who is winding up his teaching obligations at USC this  month.  </P> <P> For the new year, Yates looks forward to devoting all his time to his book.  "Uncertain Times" is scheduled for publication in the spring, and perhaps for  Yates, times will be uncertain no more. ELIZABETH VENANT  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Hastings Kamuzu Banda on 9 May; place </F> not given -- live or recorded]    [Excerpts] Bwanas and donas [ladies and gentlemen], good  evening. Tonight I am speaking to you [word indistinct] joy and  indeed with a sense of satisfaction for what we have  accomplished in this country so far. I say this for a number of  reasons. Next week, on Tuesday, that is on May the 17th, we  shall be holding our general elections where Malawians will be  exercising their democratic rights to elect those that will  govern this country for the next five years.    Malawians will vote freely for the presidential and  parliamentary candidates of their choice. I therefore wish to  appeal to all registered voters to come in their large numbers  on 17 May to cast their votes. They should not feel intimidated  by anyone for any reason whatsoever. I want to assure every  Malawian that the police and the Army will be vigilant on that  day to ensure that no one disrupts the elections. [passage  omitted]    It is understandable that as 17 May gets closer, passions in  the political debates and in public meetings tend to get  intensified. The political tensions that can result if such  passions are not properly checked or handled can be most  unfortunate, most unfortunate. As a people, who have been  united, for all these years and have enjoyed peace and calm for  31 continuous years, it would be most unfortunate if we allowed  our [word indistinct] political differences to disturb our  long-standing political stability. It is important that we  remain united, peaceful, and calm.    We must always remember that despite our political  differences we are all Malawians. We have lived together very  peacefully for a long time, despite our tribal and cultural  differences. There is, therefore, nothing to stop us from  cohabiting happily as members of different political parties.  We should behave like members of the same family who will  always maintain family unity during difficult times, no matter  how intense their differences or rivalry may be. As we approach  the election day next week, the eyes of the world are focused on  us. They are working to see if we can maintain our national  peace and hold on to our long-standing political stability as we  go through this period of vigorous political campaign and  elections. I therefore appeal to all Malawians to behave like  ladies and gentlemen during these elections as we have always  done in equally sensitive situations in the past. We have  already gone through the transition period so far in a peaceful  and most commendable manner. Of course there have been some  disturbances here and there, but these have been of a minor  nature and to some extent have been understandable. [passage  omitted]    The outside observers have commended us for the manner in  which we have managed our transitions. [passage omitted] In some  countries in our continent the tendencies of losing political  parties have been to refuse to accept their defeat at the polls.  Losing parties have challenged the results of free and fair  elections. I think this was most unfortunate. I want all  political leaders in this country to understand that contrary to  the wishes of all of us, some political parties will (?instead)  lose on 17 May. This is the nature of political competition in  democracy. Political parties must, therefore, be realistic and  accept their defeat gracefully, and the winning parties  (?should) celebrate their victory with sympathy, understanding,  and a high degree of political tolerance. [passage omitted]    I want them [international observers] to know that my  government is committed and determined to have free and fair  elections in this country. I hope that the external and  internal observers intend to be objective and unbiased in their  observations and reports on political events in this country.  [passage omitted]    Similarly, I wish to acknowledge the presence of both the  local and external press among us. We are indeed happy that we  now have a free press in this country. We are glad that our  young local pressmen and women are cooperating with their  experienced colleagues from outside. During this critical  period, it is my hope that the media will inform (?first)  Malawians and the international public truthfully so that people  are able to have unbiased opinions on the political process in  this country.    Let me now end by thanking the various friendly governments,  countries and international organizations who have helped us  financially and materially with the smooth running of the  transition and the coming elections themselves, by sponsoring  seminars and workshops organized either by the government, the  national consultative council, the electoral commission or other  related committees. [passage omitted].</p>

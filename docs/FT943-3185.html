			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Minimum solvency to protect pensions Sir, Your article 'Pensions body calls for more time on short-falls' (September 12) suggests that the National Association of Pension Funds has changed its views on the need for a minimum solvency requirement (MSR) as proposed in the government's white paper on pensions. This is not the case. The NAPF continues to believe the MSR is an essential part of the new framework to ensure greater protection of members' benefits. It will provide an early warning of a scheme running into financial difficulties and will be important in underpinning the proposed compensation scheme. However, the annual minimum solvency test is only a snapshot at a point in time. The best way to maintain the security of members' benefits is for the employer to make a long-term commitment to fund the scheme on a prudent basis, subject to regular review by independent actuaries. Satisfying the MSR on a regular annual basis should be seen as a by-product of such prudent long-term funding. Where a scheme is being funded on a prudent long-term basis, any shortfall against the MSR is very likely to be temporary and should not automatically have to be corrected in the short time spans proposed by the government. In such circumstances, and if the employer's covenant is good, the new Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority should have authority to allow longer periods for solvency to be restored. Such an approach would help to ensure that precipitate and unnecessary action is not taken where the MSR deficit is judged to be of a temporary nature and is likely to be corrected by continuing normal funding.

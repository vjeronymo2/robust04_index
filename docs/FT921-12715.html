			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Behind the scenes at Perrier's drama: The Agnelli's fight with Nestle For the past few days Europe's industrialists have watched in astonishment as Nestle, the secretive Swiss food group aided and abetted by BSN of France, one of its closest competitors, has fired the first salvos in what could be a bitter battle against the Agnelli family of Italy for control of Perrier, the famous French mineral water. Why have these pillars of European industry come to blows over Perrier, for which Nestle this week mounted a FFr13.42bn (Pounds 1.37bn) hostile takeover bid with Indosuez, the prominent Paris bank? And how have some of Europe's best known banks - not only Indosuez, but also Lazard Freres and Credit Agricole in Paris and Mediobanca in Milan - become embroiled in the battle? It began in November when Ifint, an Agnelli vehicle, announced a partial bid for Exor, the wine-to-property group that controls 35 per cent of Perrier. After protests from Exor's minority shareholders - notably from Indosuez and Credit Agricole angry at being excluded from the bid - the Agnellis agreed to mount a full FFr5.6bn offer. The temperature rose when earlier this month Saint Louis, another company associated with the Agnellis, bought 13.8 per cent of Perrier's shares. This triggered an investigation by the French stock market authorities which are also considering whether Ifint should be forced to make a full bid for Perrier. In the meantime the Exor bid has been put on ice. The bourse and Exor's minority investors were not the only aggrieved parties. BSN, which has since 1987 been a close ally of the Agnellis (who indirectly own 5.8 per cent of its stock), is said to have been furious that the Italians could consider a major move into mineral water - where it is a big player with the Evian and Badoit brands - without its knowledge. This presented a potential problem for Lazard Freres. It owns 6 per cent of BSN and Mr Michel David-Weill, its senior partner, is vice-president of the company. Lazard also has a decades-old relationship with the Agnellis and with Mediobanca, their main Italian adviser. Mr David-Weill has for years worked closely with Mr Enrico Cuccia, Mediobanca's veteran honorary chairman. Italian and French analysts suspect that Lazard was also concerned about the Agnellis' growing links with Worms et Cie, the family's partner in Saint Louis. The situation was further inflamed when Mr Umberto Agnelli, who has been spearheading the family's French interests, told the Italian press that the Agnellis wanted to raise their stake in BSN. Mr Antoine Riboud, president of BSN, retaliated with an interview in a French newspaper in which he threatened to exercise his right of veto over any attempt by the Agnellis to buy more shares. So it was that Nestle, long anxious to expand its interests in the lucrative mineral water market, found no shortage of allies when putting together its bid for Perrier. Indosuez, the Agnelli's opponent over the original Exor bid, was roped in as Nestle's joint investor, thereby giving the bid the stamp of the French financial establishment. Credit Agricole, which owns 8.5 per cent of Perrier, swiftly declared its support. As an Exor shareholder, Credit Agricole, like Indosuez, doubtless realised that a Perrier bid might help it to squeeze more money out of Ifint because of the implicit rise in the value of Exor's holding in Perrier. The Agnellis bid for Exor at a time when the Perrier share price was around FFr1,200 against the FFr1,475 offered by Nestle. Last but not least BSN, an old ally of the Agnellis and a direct competitor of Nestle in many markets, agreed to a 'sweetheart deal' with the Swiss group whereby it would buy Volvic, one of the Perrier waters, if the bid succeeds. Most analysts consider this a masterstroke for Nestle. 'If BSN, the number two player in mineral water, buys Volvic, its market share would be nearly as high as Nestle's after the bid,' said Mr John Graham, European food analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'This means Nestle ought to avoid monopoly problems.' Nestle also obtained court orders to freeze temporarily the voting rights of both the Agnelli allies, Exor and Saint Louis, in Perrier. On the same day Mr Jacques Vincent, chairman of Exor and Perrier, vowed to fight against the Nestle bid. What will happen next? The Agnellis said on Wednesday they will not counter-bid for Perrier. Nor will they raise their offer for Exor, although there is still a possibility of the French stock market authorities forcing them to do so. In the meantime Exor still controls Perrier. Presumably Nestle is confident that the bourse will veto St Louis's share purchase, otherwise it would not have risked making a bid if Exor and St Louis combined controlled 48.8 per cent of Perrier's shares. Alternatively, Nestle could mount a counter-bid for Exor. In the meantime the protagonists must also be assessing the longer-term implications of the fracas. The relationship between Lazard and Mediobanca does seem to have been strained. 'Lazard faces a conflict of loyalties,' said one Italian analyst. 'Their old links with Mediobanca, based on years of old-fashioned banking diplomacy, may now be buckling under the weight of modern commercial considerations like their investment in BSN.' Meanwhile the Agnellis are counting the cost to their reputation. Until Exor they had shown great skill in making opportunistic deals in France, partly by using their social contacts with prominent figures such as the Mentzelopoulos family with whom they negotiated the Exor deal. But the Agnellis do seem to have miscalculated BSN's reaction both to the Exor deal and to the prospect of their increasing their holding in BSN itself. They also may have underestimated the French banks' hostility to their trying to buy control of Perrier on the cheap. Mr Umberto Agnelli is particularly exposed. He headed the family's drive into France after a short, unsuccessful stint as managing director of Fiat in the late 1970s. Last year he was named as heir apparent to the chairmanship of Fiat by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, his older brother and the present patriarch. This week's events may have been outside Mr Umberto Agnelli's control, but they have dealt a blow to his family's aura of infallibility, at least in Italy. Some sections of the Italian press still loyally suspect that, behind the scenes, the Agnellis are beavering away on a machiavellian masterplan. The family does, of course, stand to make a huge capital gain should the Nestle bid go through. Saint Louis alone may pocket a profit of FFr600m on its Perrier stake. More important to the Agnellis is the impact on their relationship with BSN, their chosen partner for expansion into the French food industry. The partnership has been beneficial to both sides especially in Italy where the Agnellis have helped to open doors and identify opportunities for BSN. One of their most successful ventures has been Galbani, the cheese group which they own jointly but which is managed by BSN. In spite of the public sniping both BSN and the Agnellis must be anxious to avoid damaging their long-term relationship. 'Somehow they have got to find an amicable solution,' said Mr Louis Morvan, food analyst for James Capel in Paris. 'After all, it is in everyone's interest for all this to end in a gentlemen's agreement.' Nestle sales, Page 21</p>

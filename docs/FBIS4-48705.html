			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dakar, 24 May (KNA/PANA) -- Senegal is ready to  help restore peace in Rwanda through an increased participation  in the United Nations Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), its  president, Abdou Diouf, said in Dakar today.    Speaking on his return from a three-day visit in the USA,  where he was given an honorary doctorate at the University of  Connecticut, the Senegalese head of state however said Senegal  must have the necessary material support if it is to make an  increased contribution to helping restore peace in the war-torn  country.    "As with other countries, we have been approached by the  U.N.  and we are going to increase our participation to the United  Nations Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), provided that  material means are given to us to perform our mission," said  Diouf. [passage omitted]    Senegal, which has often participated in peacekeeping  missions, currently has about ten officers in the U.N. Mission  in Rwanda.</p>

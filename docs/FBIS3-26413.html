			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Christine Chan] </F>   [Text] Air China, one of China's three largest airlines,  has ordered five Boeing jets, worth some U.S. $300 million [as  published], to be delivered this year.    Company president Yin Wenlong said yesterday that the new  planes would bring the Beijing-based airline's fleet to 66.  Eight freighters were delivered last year.    Mr Yin said recent investment had put Air China in a  position  to repay leasing obligations worth 1.4 billion yuan (about  HK$1.24 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) a year.    The first jet, a Boeing 747-400, is scheduled to be  delivered  by the end of this month. The 12-year lease financing  agreement, worth U.S.$145 million, was signed yesterday.    The Export-Import Bank of Japan is providing 60 percent of  the loan, while a group of banks including Mitsubishi Bank,  Diamond Lease Co and Sanwa Bank is providing the rest.    Interest on the 60 per cent slice of the loan has been set  at  90 basis points above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),  and on the remainder at 120 basis points above LIBOR.    Mr Yin said the company, which deals with one-third of  mainland air traffic, planned to expand to cope with the  expected 20 percent annual growth in the market.    "We have ordered five Boeing jets for delivery this year.  One Boeing 767 will be delivered in March, and one Boeing-737  will be delivered in each of April, July and October," he said.    Five other Boeing jets would be bought for delivery next  year.    Air China is one of the mainland's three largest airlines.  The other two, China Southern Airlines and China Eastern  Airlines, have become shareholding companies and have received  approval to list abroad.    Mr Yin said Air China would do likewise, but would carry out  the necessary restructuring first.    He said Air China, one of 55 enterprises chosen by Beijing  to  take part in modernisation experiments had set up a holding  company in December last year.    Air China would now be one of 27 enterprises in the Air  China  Group. It is now operating on 58 domestic and 29 international  routes.    Last year, its revenue totalled six billion yuan and flew  1.5  billion tonne-kilometres -- the measure used by the industry.    Taxed profit was more than 200 million yuan and gross profit  700 million yuan.    Mr Yin forecasts revenue of nine billion yuan on traffic of  1.8 billion tonne-kilometres this year. Taxed profits are  expected to be about 300 million yuan.</p>

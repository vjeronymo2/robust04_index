			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: US recession puts United Technologies sharply down THE impact of the US recession on the airline, building and automotive industries has severely hurt first-quarter earnings at United Technologies, the diversified engineering group, which turned in results significantly worse than expected. Although it had warned that earnings in the first half of 1991 would decline, the first-quarter net earnings of Dollars 40.2m, or 25 cents a share, were sharply below the 75 cents anticipated by most analysts. 'I had expected a bad quarter and reduced my estimates to 50 cents a share,' said one, 'but these figures were terrible'. In the first three months of 1990, UTC had net earnings of Dollars 134.5m, or Dollars 1.01 a share. Revenues were flat at Dollars 4.8bn. Mr Robert Daniell, chairman and chief executive, said harsh economic conditions had a severe impact on first-quarter performance. 'Airline travel, building construction and automobile production; all are down sharply. This is the first time all three of these core commercial markets simultaneously have been at the bottom of their industrial cycles. 'We are not running our businesses on the assumption that the recession is nearing an end,' he added. Operating income in UTC's power segment plunged to Dollars 113m from Dollars 249m a year ago. At UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney aero-engine business, which recently said it would cut between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs by the end of June, revenues from its lucrative spare parts business dropped 25 per cent in the first quarter. The company blamed this on sharply reduced airline travel and poor results at the airlines. Profits from UTC's building systems dropped to Dollars 31m from Dollars 90m. Almost half of this was attributed to the Brazilian operations of UTC's Carrier air conditioning company where volumes fell sharply. The industrial segment suffered a loss of Dollars 5m against profits of Dollars 15m a year earlier, which was blamed on the 18 per cent decline in North American car and light truck production in the quarter.</p>

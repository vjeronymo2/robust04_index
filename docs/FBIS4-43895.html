			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Owen Bowcott: "Loyalists Use Savagery as </F> Political Weapon"]    [Text] The pools of blood mingled with beer on the floor  of O'Toole's bar is further evidence that the hard core of  Northern Ireland's working-class loyalists is increasingly  alienated and ready to resort to acts of savagery.    Protestants are convinced they have most to lose from the  Downing Street declaration, and loyalist hardliners believe the  IRA has proved that violence gains polltical advantage.    The result has been a surge in loyalist killings. Peace,  seen through the distorted logic of paramilitary calculations,  equals war. Despite the declaration's promises of  reconciliation, paramilitary gunmen have killed 10 more people  in the province in 1994 compared with the same period last year.    The rise reflects, in part, the volatility caused by the  resurgence of the INLA [Irish National Liberation Army], which  has concentrated more in recent months on retaliatory attacks on  loyalists. Underlying such shifts in republican paramilitary  tactics, however, is the fundamental alienation of the loyalist  community. Their sense of betrayal was sharpened by the  Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, which formally gave Dublin a  consultative role in the affairs of Northern Ireland.    Much of the current loyalist paranoia is also linked to the  growing fear that the Catholics' higher birth rate will soon  undermine Protestant numerical dominance of Northern Ireland's  six counties.    The results of the 1991 census appeared to reinforce such  anxieties. Catholics were estimated as forming between 41 and  43 per cent of Northern Ireland. That represented a  considerable advance on the figures of 10 years' earlier, when  many republicans refused to take part in the headcount.    Proof that such calculations feature prominently in the  loyalist paramilitary imagination came earlier this year with  the release of a doomsday plan for repartition to ensure a  permanent Protestant majority.    Using maps published 10 years ago as part of an academic  study on political options for the province, the UDA [Ulster  Defense Association] suggested the establishment of an  ethnically-cleansed Protestant homeland, which would involve the  surrender of the equivalent of least two counties to the Irish  Republic.    Although the plan chillingly contemplated "expulsion,  lnternment or nullification" of those Catholics on the Wrong  side of the redrawn borders, the Democratic Unionist Party  leader, Ian Paisley MP, welcomed it as a "very valuable return  to reality."    The document also exposed class divisions. Hardline loyalism  is predominantly the creed of an impoverished Protestant working  class, which feels isolated in its ghettoes. "Sinn Fein's  theory that a last-minute deal can be put together with the  middle and upper Protestant classes should not be ignored," the  report warned. "lt does have validity."    Anecdotal evidence of Protestant farmers being shot or  intimidated out of their land along the border in Fermanagh and  Armagh is also persuasive.    The result has been a growing conviction that neither the  Government, police or army can be relied upon to deal with the  republican menace. Clashes between the authorites and loyalist  paramilitaries have become more frequent and violent in recent  years.    Earlier this month, the UVF [Ulster Volunteer Force]  threatened to extend its paramilitary campaign to the British  mainland for the first time. Its targets would be republican  activists and Irish officials living in London.    John Hume MP, leader of the predominantly Catholic Social  Democratic and Labour Party, claimed his increased vote in the  European elections was proof of growing support for the peace  process and the Downing Street declaration.    The immediate evidence of Saturday night [18 June], however,  lends greater support to those Unionist leaders who have been  sounding alarmist warnings that the province is slipping slowly  into civil war.</p>

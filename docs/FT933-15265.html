			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Contractors offer big savings to councils COMPANIES providing services for councils under compulsory competitive tendering are cutting their prices when the contracts are renewed, according to figures published today in the Local Government Chronicle. The figures contradict the common view that the companies which won contracts on the first round had treated the exercise as a 'loss-leader'. Eight of the first nine authorities to renegotiate contracts for refuse collection since the scheme started in 1988 have achieved real-term price cuts of 18.4 per cent or more. Councils using private contractors obtained savings varying from a 30 per cent real reduction for Runnymede district council to 18.4 per cent for Tonbridge. Medina district council, in the Isle of Wight, is the only authority so far to have suffered an increase. Three contractors - Biffa Waste, Tylers, and Cory Environmental - have so far won contracts. Only in Cherwell, in Oxfordshire, has the council's own direct labour force kept the contract, by accepting a reduction in price from Pounds 1.2m in 1988 to Pounds 840,000 this year. Direct labour organisations, which in most cases beat private sector competitors when the contracts were first put out to tender, found the figures alarming. Mr Mark Bramah, principal adviser to the Association of Direct Labour Organisations, said previous studies had suggested contract prices would rise when retendered. He said: 'I find it surprising that they are coming in cheaper. There may be underlying reasons in each case, such as the impact of the recession on private sector bids. Local authorities' own resource problems could also be affecting their specifications.' Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman, managing director of CD-C Research, which produced the figures, estimated that further contracts to be awarded in the next two months would confirm that private companies were prepared to offer low prices in order to gain substantial volume in the UK market.

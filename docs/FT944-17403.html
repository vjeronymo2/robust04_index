			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Man in the News: Milan's smooth Machiavelli - Francesco Saverio Borrelli The battle between Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media magnate turned prime minister, and the Milan judiciary has reached a point of no return. Both sides are on a collision course. The script could not have been dreamt up better in Hollywood: a prime minister whose business empire is under investigation for corrupt practices seeks to incriminate the very judicial authorities who are investigating him. The Rubicon was crossed this week when Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, the Milan public prosecutor and the figure behind the anti-corruption investigations of the past two and half years, decided to discard his normal caution. In an explosive newspaper interview on Wednesday, he warned Mr Berlusconi that the investigative net was tightening around him and his Fininvest empire. If this was not enough, he insinuated that Mr Alfredo Biondi, minister of justice, had behaved unprofessionally while defending a client in the collapse of the late Mr Roberto Calvi's Banco Ambrosiano. In response, the five month-old rightwing coalition government endorsed a tough response, albeit with private reservations among some ministers. A formal complaint was lodged on Thursday with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, asking him as head of the higher magistrates' council, the Italian judiciary's governing body, to examine the case for disciplinary proceedings and prosecution against Mr Borrelli. Mr Borrelli coolly joked about the prospect of prison: 'I'm ready with my toothbrush and pyjamas.' The 64-year-old public prosecutor could face a minimum jail sentence of 10 years for undermining constitutional authority. But he clearly intends to hang on to the post he has held since 1987. 'I don't even give it (resignation) a thought] Why should I leave the magistrature?' he asked. He has even postponed plans to apply for a promotion to head the appeal court in Florence, where this Neapolitan-born member of the judiciary has spent much of his career. Mr Borrelli has played a backstage role throughout the two and half years that Milan magistrates have made the headlines with their anti-corruption investigations. However, he is credited as the strategist behind the investigations - known as 'Tagentopoli' (bribe cities) - that have unearthed a pervasive system of bribes and illicit funding involving the nation's leading businessmen and politicians. His discreet presence contrasts with that of public idol Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the investigative magistrate in Milan who in February 1992 broke the first 'Tagentopoli' corruption scandal. Mr Di Pietro is blunt-speaking, flaunts his peasant origins and cares little about his clothes. Mr Borrelli is soft-spoken with fluent sophisticated language. Sartorially, his spare, stooping frame is always immaculately clad. While Mr Di Pietro is a computer buff and likes the occasional shooting foray with friends, for Mr Borrelli it is classical music, philosophy and horse-riding. However, the partnership between this smooth intellectual with the grasp of Machiavelli and the industrious policeman with his gift for computer technology has been central to the Milan magistrature's success in exposing the accumulated vices of Italy's postwar political system. Mr Borrelli has been content to let his junior absorb the limelight, realising the magistrate had the kind of honest aura that could catch the public imagination. Thus it was Mr Di Pietro who, in the name of the Milan magistrates, went on television to announce their collective resignation in July in protest at plans by the Berlusconi government to introduce legislation to curb the judiciary's power of preventive detention. The government retreated. Again, it was Mr Di Pietro who was delegated to attend the annual gathering of top businessmen at Cernobbio in early September at which he suggested the outlines of legislation to come to terms with the problems created by the corruption scandals. But it was Mr Borrelli - in consultation with jurists and academics - who orchestrated the legislation to deal with the huge backlog of corruption cases and the prospect of indefinite corruption investigations. The aim was to encourage those who had paid bribes to come forward with generous plea-bargaining opportunities, and corresponding penalties for those who failed to confess within a specified time. The move was squashed because the politicians objected to the Milan magistrature trying to usurp the lawmaking role of parliament. In retrospect, it was the refusal of the politicians to take up this olive branch that has accelerated the current conflict. Mr Borrelli and his fellow magistrates knew their continued inquiries would affect many institutions - including the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police. They also knew the government could be damaged by the investigations into Fininvest, which risked leading to Mr Berlusconi and at least one other minister. As the pace of investigation has quickened after the summer break, Mr Berlusconi and his ministers have sought to challenge the behaviour of the judiciary. It is this that led to Mr Borrelli's now famous interview on Wednesday. Three possible reasons have been advanced by political analysts for his decision to go public with his warning to Mr Berlusconi. The first is that it was the angry reaction of the Milan magistrature against a prime minister whose government has failed to find a mutually satisfactory politico-judicial solution to end 'Tagentopoli'. The second is that it was a move to unseat Mr Berlusconi and break up his Forza Italia movement to favour the ascendancy of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, which has been courting Mr Borrelli and Mr Di Pietro. But it is the third that seems the most plausible: it was a desperate attempt to head off government moves to stifle their inquiries. For Mr Berlusconi is now threatened with being ousted from office by those who opened the way for him to become prime minister in the first place by discrediting the old political parties.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Major invites Yeltsin to London PRESIDENT Yeltsin may visit Mr John Major in London on his way to a United Nations Security Council meeting in New York, now confirmed for the end of this month. The two leaders would discuss issues including Russia's application for full membership of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. The visit, which would be short, has yet to be finalised. The invitation, seeking to confirm the prime minister's role on the world stage, coincided with Tory demands for greater clarity in Labour's defence policy. Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of 'looking for a photo-opportunity, not an agenda'. Page 2</p>

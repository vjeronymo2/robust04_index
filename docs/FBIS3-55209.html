			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Silence Again?"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] In the past few days a lot of  questions from readers have been coming into our newspaper's  editorial office: Will SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA support its  colleagues' action? Even without this the newspaper was  unlawfully closed down for almost three months, and subscribers  failed to receive a great deal of important, true information  about a whole period in the life of Russia and the world.  Surely we will not be left without a newspaper again, they ask  worriedly.    Although we fully share the undoubtedly just indignation of  our journalist colleagues at the prevailing price chaos and  bureaucratic chaos, we are nevertheless forced to say no to the  collective protest action. We hold too dear the possibility --  recently infrequent -- of communicating with our readers, we  have too much to say, we have too many lies to refute. For us,  the SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA journalists, silence is a luxury we  cannot afford.    We have our own score to settle with the present  authorities,  and it too is not small. No one intends to compensate for the  losses to readers and the journalists' collectives which were  brought about by the unlawful closure of the newspaper, and  subscriptions to our newspapers are being hindered and blocked  in every way at the mail offices. Every conceivable and  inconceivable obstacle is placed on the path of every issue of  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA published. The situation is exacerbated many  times by the fact that the editorial office's current account  was unlawfully impounded literally until yesterday. Because of  this we are not in a position to settle our accounts with our  partners in the production and distribution of the newspaper in  a timely fashion.    In the face of this, to be published, to get through to the  reader, having penetrated the cordon of obstacles, means to  conquer.</p>

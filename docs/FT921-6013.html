			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A writer's write-off I OWE various amounts to some credit-card companies. I am making small monthly payments and no interest is being charged. Later this year I should be in a position to clear all these debts by selling some film/TV rights of a novel. I am not a full time writer. I have a full time job where tax is deducted at source. Will the sale of these rights simply be added to my taxable income by the Inland Revenue or can I deduct the debts from the payment I receive and just pay tax on what is left? No, the debts are not deductible. If it is to your advantage, it may be possible for you to claim relief under section 534 (or possibly 535) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. This depends upon more facts, figures and dates than you have disclosed - including the date of the novel's first publication. Look up either the section numbers or 'Copyright, assignment', in the index of one of the tax manuals in your library. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

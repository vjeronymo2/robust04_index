A spokesman of the German Foreign Ministry said that the EU  [European Union] was investigating whether Greece had broken the  Union's laws or international law. "It is in our interest to  have more stability in the region, not less," the spokesman said.    The question will be discussed on Friday in Athens during a  meeting of the EU troika, in which the Belgian, Greek, and  German foreign ministers will take part. The blockade of  Macedonia would be one of the most important subjects in the  talks, an EU spokesman said.</p>

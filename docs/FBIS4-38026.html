			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 27 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni  authorities have decided to turn Aden's brewery -- the only one  in the Arabian peninsula -- into a soft drinks factory.    The decision was a reaction to northern war propaganda which  has tagged southerners "beer drinkers and atheists," Yemeni  sources said. Alcohol is forbidden by Islam.    The brewery conversion, announced by Aden television Monday,  was also aimed at pleasing conservative Gulf monarchs who have  looked favourably on the south during the two-month-old civil  war, the sources said.    A special committee chaired by the breakaway south's trade  and industry "minister" Yahya al-Jifri will supervise the  brewery's conversion, the television said, quoting a decree by  "president" 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    The brewery in al-Mansurah, a northwest suburb of Aden, was  opened in 1981 with the help of former East Germany. It employs  200 people.    Before war erupted on May 5 the brewery produced a million  half-litre bottles of beer a month under the trademark Seera.  Water shortages brought production to a halt at least two weeks  ago.    In 1993 the brewery made a net profit of 100 million Yemeni  riyals, more than eight million US dollars on the official  exchange rate.    The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic  on  May 21, two weeks after war broke out between al-Bid's forces  and northern troops loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.</p>

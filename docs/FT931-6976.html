			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Contra-Cyclical indicates pay-out cut Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust yesterday said that, due to the deterioration of dividend levels, it would recommend a reduced distribution for the 12 months to March 31 1994. Sir Alan Walters, chairman, said: 'We are disappointed that we have had to take this action which has been dictated by the current economic conditions. The revised dividend level is one which we believe can be sustained and which will do justice to the expectations of our other classes of shareholder.' The pay-out for the year was likely to be less than 9.5p per income share - 'a base from which dividend growth should resume'. Directors stressed that the total dividend of 12.75p for the current year, as forecast in the prospectus, would be achieved.</p>

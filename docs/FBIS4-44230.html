			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been reported that the decision on Cyprus  taken at the European Union's [EU] Corfu summit has given the  green light to full EU membership for south Cyprus and Malta.  Osman Ertug, Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' New York  envoy, described the development as an unfortunate decision and  said that it will not help the negotiation process on the island.    In his statement to Anatolia Agency, Ertug pointed out that  the decision will deepen the rift in Cyprus and added: With  this decision, the EU leaves us no alternatives but to merge  with Turkey. If south Cyprus merges with the EU, then we have no  options but to integrate with Turkey.</p>

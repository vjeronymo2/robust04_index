			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE SPIRIT OF DUKE ELLINGTON  </P> <P> While the name might have been a bit misleading (fewer than a third of the  15-man Duke Ellington Alumni Orchestra were actually alums), the spirit of  Duke, who died shortly after his 75th birthday in 1974, was enthusiastically  brought to life under the direction of Herb Jeffries at the Palladium.  </P> <P> Although few serious jazz listeners need any reminders of Ellington's  importance as a leader or a composer, Jeffries, who sang with the orchestra  between 1940 and 1942 and had a hit with "Flamingo," was sincere in his quest  to restate the obvious.  </P> <P> Perhaps it needs restating, however, as the 750 or so attendees were more  interested in dancing Friday night than they were in listening to a quality  effort diminished only slightly by the booming sound system of the 50-year-old  Palladium.  </P> <P> Of course, when Ellington first introduced those tunes, many of which became  immediate standards, he was leading a dance band. It was only later that  Ellington was afforded the concert halls and studious attention given his  European classical counterparts.  </P> <P> "I wanted to give something back to the earth," Jeffries said following the  first set. "Without Duke, well, I don't know what would have happened."  </P> <P> Be that as it may, 50 years after "Flamingo," Jeffries' burnished baritone and  sensitive phrasing are in good shape, his vibrato in firm control on up tunes  like "Jump for Joy" and on the more demanding ballads like "Sophisticated  Lady," to which he lent an attractive, seductive quality.  </P> <P> In between came mighty instrumental efforts by an all-star band that included  inspired solos by cornetist Bill Berry and trumpeter Snooky Young, saxophonists  Marshall Royal, Teddy Edwards, Bob Cooper and Bill Green, trombonist Buster  Cooper and pianist Art Hillary. The rhythm section of bassist Monty Budwig and  drummer Frank Capp, the latter filling in for an ailing Louie Bellson, provided  an aptly swinging impetus for the band.  </P> <P> Featured briefly were the Cunninghams, a husband-and-wife vocal team whose  three-tune set of Ellington tunes showed a heartfelt affinity for the music.

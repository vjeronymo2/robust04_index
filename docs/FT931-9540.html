			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Floating franc idea starts to sink MR Alain Madelin, the leading proponent of a floating franc in the probable next French government, yesterday conceded that he had, at least for the moment, lost his argument for more currency flexibility. On behalf of his centre-right UDF party, Mr Madelin negotiated with the RPR Gaullists the joint programme which the two parties are pledged to put into effect if, as the polls overwhelmingly suggest, they win the March general election. This programme, unveiled on Wednesday, commits a new government to 'use all necessary means to maintain the value of the currency' including reinforced monetary co-operation with Germany. Asked yesterday how he could reconcile this with his earlier public support for unhooking the franc from the D-Mark and therefore from German interest rates, Mr Madelin said he had defended his viewpoint in negotiations inside the opposition. 'I did not succeed in convincing my friends,' Mr Madelin said. 'Nevertheless they do agree that France cannot tolerate for any length of time interest rates which stifle its economy, push companies into receivership and risk an explosion of unemployment.' The French opposition is effectively calling for greater monetary co-operativeness from Germany. If this is not forthcoming, Mr Madelin's views might gain ground. His influence resides in the fact that, unlike other devaluation proponents in the opposition, he is pro-European and a leader of a mainstream party.</p>

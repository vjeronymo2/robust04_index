			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CEAUSESCU BARS DEMOCRATIC REFORM;  </P> <P> ROMANIA: THREE THOUSAND OF THE FAITHFUL APPLAUD. MANY WESTERN AMBASSADORS  BOYCOTT PARTY CONGRESS.  </P> <P> To the applause of the faithful, President Nicolae Ceausescu today rejected the  democratic reforms sweeping most of the rest of the East Bloc in a five-hour  speech to a congress of the ruling Communist Party.  </P> <P> "The ruling out of the capitalist system . . . is the leading requirement for  the creation of a just society," the orthodox leader told more than 3,000  delegates packing downtown Palace Hall.  </P> <P> Many Western ambassadors boycotted the gathering to protest human rights  violations under Ceausescu.  </P> <P> The Romanian leader has also become increasingly isolated in the East Bloc as  one-party rule unravels in one Warsaw Pact country after another under the  pressure of popular unrest. Only Albania also remains staunchly Marxist.  </P> <P> Ceausescu showed no sign today of changing course.  </P> <P> He urged the 3.8 million party members -- about 15% of Romania's population --  to maintain the principles of "scientific socialism," instituted in 1965, the  year he took over.  </P> <P> Delegates, in a clearly rehearsed show of affection, rose frequently to clap  and chant "Romania -- communism" and "Ceausescu -- heroism."  </P> <P> They were silenced after about 30 seconds by a peremptory wave from Ceausescu,  who peered out from a huge dais decorated with the hammer and sickle.  </P> <P> Organizers had said 115 delegations from 82 countries were expected, but all  NATO countries except Turkey stayed away. Reform-minded Communist or Socialist  parties from Hungary, Italy and Finland also refused to attend in protest over  the country's poor human rights record.  </P> <P> Ceausescu has encouraged the creation of a personality cult unmatched anywhere  in the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Delegates leaped to their feet every few minutes today during the speech. They  clapped rhythmically and chanted other slogans such as "Ceausescu and the  people," or "Ceausescu -- the Romanian Communist Party."  </P> <P> Ceausescu's wife, Elena, and their son, Nicu, both of whom are ranking party  officials along with several of their relatives, gazed impassively from the  stage.  </P> <P> The main entrance was draped with a banner proclaiming: "Long Live the Romanian  Communist Party headed by its Secretary-General, Comrade Nicolae Ceausescu."  </P></p>

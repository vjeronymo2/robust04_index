			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report on Russian Federation economic statistics, by </F> Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr Frenkel, the  Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Is the Rate of Inflation  Falling?"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   A decrease in the rate of inflation that manifested itself  in  November continued in December as well. Over the 7-14 December  period prices and rates for basic goods and services rose by 2.3  percent, including by 2.2 percent for foodstuffs and by 2.5  percent for nonfood items. Rates for paid services to the  population rose by 2.6 percent. The greatest rates of price  increases were registered in the cities of Western and Eastern  Siberia--4.1 to 4.8 percent; the lowest in the cities of the  Volgo-Vyatka and North Caucasus regions and in Kaliningrad  Oblast--by 1.4 percent.    The dynamics of weekly price increases over the past four  weeks were as follows:                        11/23           11/30          12/07          12/14   Rate of price       102.09          102.2          102.9          102.3  increases for  goods and  services   including:   foodstuffs          103.1           102.0          102.9          102.2   nonfood items       102.5           102.5          102.5          102.5   paid services for   103.6           101.3          105.4          102.6  the population    <H5>  Food </H5>   Prices for basic foodstuffs rose by 2.2 percent; over the  preceding week they rose by 2.9 percent. Over the elapsed week  the greatest prices increases were registered with respect to  eggs (by 6.0 percent), as well as fish and fish products (by 4.6  percent). Prices increased by more than one-third: for eggs--in  Roston-on-Don, Orenburg, Vladivostok, and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk; for  frozen fish--in Penza and Orenburg.    Prices for macaroni items and cereals, butter, vegetable  oil,  salt, and vegetables rose by 3-4 percent. Price increases of a  lesser magnitude--by 1.5 to 2.9 percent--occurred with respect  to milk products, confectionery items, flour, bread and bakery  products, and fruit.    Price rises settled into a stable pace (no more than 1  percent a week) with respect to meat and meat products, sugar,  and vodka.  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   Prices for these items rose over the week by 2.5 percent.  This rate of price increases remained stable over the past four  weeks. Over the week prices for sewn items and knitwear  increased by 3.0-3.6 percent, and for footwear, cultural,  personal, and household items, as well as fuel sold to the  population by 1.6-2.0 percent.  <H5>  Services </H5>   Fees for paid services to the population rose by 2.6 percent  over the second week of December. The greatest price increase  was registered with respect to notary services (by 48 percent).  In 80 out of 132 monitored cities of Russia the cost of  certifying a will by a notary public increased 1.9-fold. Fees  for some varieties of paid health care services increased by  8-15 percent. Apartment rents remained at the same level in all  cities except Berdsk. In Berdsk they increased 58.8-fold (from  17 kopeks to 10 rubles [R]).  <H5>  Industrial Production </H5>   Over the first 10 days of December 1993 production of most  varieties of products counted in periodic reports has declined,  which may be seen from the following table:                        Total items   Of Them: Production Declined As Compared                                    To the Corresponding Period of   Last Year           As a          Preceding    As a                      Percentage    Month        Percentage                      of Total                   of Total   Industry--total     152           137          90            91      60   including the following sectors:   fuels and           15            11           73            6       40  electric power   ferrous             2             2            100           2       100  metallurgy   machine building    31            26           84            17      55  and metal  processing   chemical and        24            24           100           20      83  petrochemical   timber,             10            10           100           2       20  wood-processing,  and pulp and  paper   construction        9             8            89            8       89  materials   light               14            14           100           10      71   production of       18            16           89            9       50  nonfood consumer  items (without  light industry  products)   food processing     29            26           90            17      59      In the fuels and power generation sectors, over 12  days of December of this year production of the main kinds of  energy resources is characterized by the following data:                             In Real Volume     Average Daily Production as a                           Since the          Percentage of the Corresponding                           Beginning of the   Period of                           Month   Last Year                Preceding Month   Electric                 35.0               98               106  power--billion kwt/hr   Thermal                  35.5               98               111  energy--million G-cal   Coal--million tonnes     9.5                93               109   Natural gas--billion     21.7               99               99.9  cubic meters   Oil--million tonnes      9.9                88               98      Over 12 days of December of this year, 7 million tonnes of  oil were refined, which is 7 percent more than over the  corresponding period of this year's November, including in the  following associations: Omsknefteorgsintez--by 11 percent,  Salavatnefteorgsintez--by 14 percent, and  Bashneftekhimzavody--by 29 percent. The output of automotive  gasoline increased over this period by 10 percent, and of boiler  oil--by 7 percent. Overall, as compared to the level of 13 days  of last year's December, the volume of refining increased by 2  percent.    The increase in the volume of oil refining resulted to a  considerable extent from the fact that greater quantities of oil  previously intended for exports now are being delivered to oil  refining enterprises.    Out of 12 associations of the Gazprom RAO [All-Russia  Joint-Stock Society], seven increased the volume of gas  production as compared to the first half of the preceding month,  including Surgutgazprom by 3 percent and Nadymgazprom by 2  percent.    As compared with the corresponding period of this year's  November, coal production has increased at almost all  coal-producing enterprises with the exception of the Vorkutaugol  association, where because of recent strikes it fell off by  one-quarter.    In ferrous metallurgy over 12 days of December the  production of iron ore declined by 14 percent as compared to the  analogous period of November, including at the Lebedinskiy  (Belgorod Oblast), Kachkanarskiy (Sverdlovsk Oblast), and  Korshunovskiy (Irkutsk Oblast) ore mining and processing  combines by 20-30 percent and at Kostomukshskiy by 48 percent,  which is due to restrictions on delivery of electric power to  the aforementioned combines because of arrears in payments.    Production of steel and finished rolled metal has declined  as  compared with the level of the analogous period of November by 2  percent, and that of last year by one-quarter; of steel pipe,  respectively, by 9 percent and 55 percent.    The data on the output of most important items in  machine building are shown below:                               In Physical        Average Daily Production as a                             Volume Since the   Percentage of the Corresponding                             Beginning of the   Period of                             Month   Last Year                  Preceding Month   Large electric             98                 50               120  machines--units   Metal-cutting machine      204                41               79  tools--units   Excavators--units          288                129              90   Freight railcars--units    64                 18               57   Automobiles--thousand units   trucks                     9.2                52               78   passenger cars             27.6               86               88   buses                      1.6                102              125   Tractors--units            425                10               100      Over the elapsed days of December, there has been an  increase  in the average daily production of special, specialized, and  component system machine tools, city telephone cables, and  trolley buses as compared with both the corresponding period of  last year and the preceding month. At the same time, with  respect to most items the current level of daily production was  below that for the corresponding period of 1992, including  diesels and diesel generators, metal-cutting lathes, bridge  electric cranes, trucks, friction-free ball bearings (declined  by half), drop forges, mainline freight railcars, automotive  trailers and semi-trailers, and tractors (by a factor of 6-10),  which to a large extent is the result of a decline in solvent  demand for products.    In the chemical and petrochemical industry the  current situation is as follows:                                  In Physical       Average Daily Production as a                                Volume Since      Percentage of the                                the Beginning     Corresponding Period of                                of the Month   Last Year                     Preceding Month    Synthetic ammonia--thousand   263               85              93  tonnes   Sulphuric acid--thousand      203               66              93  tonnes   Mineral                       198               72              100.6  fertilizer--thousand tonnes    Chemical filament and         7.0               57              99.8  fiber--thousand tonnes   Automotive tires for          872               72              95  agricultural vehicles,  motorcycles, and  motorollers--thousand units       As compared with the first half of last year's December,  there has been a considerable decline in the output of  calcinated soda, polyethylene, synthetic rubbers, and  microbiological fodder protein (by 32-43 percent). Production of  polyvynilchloride resin, pipe and pipeline components made of  thermoplastics, polyvynilchloride-based plastics, and tires for  agricultural vehicles amounted to less than half of last year's  volume.    The volume of average daily output of a majority of  indicated, as well as other varieties, of products also was  below that for the corresponding period of this year's November,  with the exception of polypropylene, whose daily output exceeded  November level by 13 percent, and movie film (by a factor of  three); production of calcinated soda remained at the same level.    In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper  industry, over the elapsed 12 days of December as compared  with the analogous period of this year's November, the average  daily production increased with respect to practically all of  the most important varieties of products (with the exception of  wood-chip board and cardboard):                                In Physical       Average Daily Production as a                              Volume Since      Percentage of the                              the Beginning     Corresponding Period of                              of the Month   Last Year                   Preceding Month    Sawn lumber--thousand       345               70              100.9  cubic meters   Commercial                  51.1              92              153  cellulose--thousand  tonnes   Wood-chip board--thousand   92.6              79              95  standard cubic meters   Paper--thousand tonnes      89.0              80              100.1   Cardboard--thousand         38.5              74              86  tonnes      The average output of commercial timber over the elapsed 10  days of December amounted to 198,000 cubic meters, which is  one-third less than over the same period of last year.    Cutbacks in deliveries of timber to sawmills and  wood-processing plants has led to a decline over the period  since the beginning of the month in the output of mine props (by  37 percent), wood-fiber board (by 28 percent), and matches (by  51 percent).    In the construction materials industry over the  elapsed period of December the average daily production of all  varieties of products counted in periodic reports (with the  exception of ground lime and dolomite) has declined over the  elapsed period of December as compared with the analogous period  of this year's November:                                In Physical       Average Daily Production as a                              Volume Since      Percentage of the                              the Beginning     Corresponding Period of                              of the Month   Last Year                   Preceding Month    Cement--million tonnes      1.3               87              81   Construction                289               81              91  brick--million units of  standard bricks   Pliable roofing materials   14.7              79              78  and rolled  insulation--million  square meters   Window glass--million       2.8               68              94  square meters      In the cement sector, the average daily product output was  the lowest over the entire elapsed period of the year--110,500  tonnes as compared with 127,000 tonnes over the corresponding  period of last year's December. The average daily production of  roof slate, high-grade asbestos, asbestos-cement pipe and  couplers amounted to 60-74 percent of the level of 13 days of  last year's December.    At the same time, in the first half of December Rosstrom AO  [Joint-Stock Society] enterprises, which produces two-thirds of  the total output of decorative ceramic tile in Russia, increased  their production by 6.5 percent as compared to the first half of  last year's December.    In the light industry over the elapsed period of  December as compared with the analogous period of November there  has been an increase in the average daily production of cotton  and linen fabrics and sack cloth. However, as compared with the  corresponding period of 1992, the output of all items counted in  weekly reports has declined: of children's footwear--by 61  percent; woolen fabrics--by half; silk fabrics, jackets, and  footwear--by 40-42 percent; knitwear--by one-third; and  hosiery--by one-quarter.    In the production of complex home appliances, over the  elapsed period of December as compared to the corresponding  period of November there was an increase in the daily production  of television sets and sewing machines (by 2-14 percent), tape  recorders, video tape recorders, and bicycles (by 24-31  percent). At the same time, the average daily production of  refrigerators and freezers, washing machines, electric irons,  and radio receivers declined by 11-19 percent; electric vacuum  cleaners, by 28 percent; and motorcycles, almost by half. As  compared with the analogous period of last year, production  declined with respect to all categories of goods (with the  exception of color television sets). There has been no  production of radio receivers since the beginning of the month  at the Mayak plant (Kursk Oblast) and the Irkutsk radio plant  and of electric vacuum cleaners at the Omsk electromechanical  plant.    Production of basic foodstuffs over the elapsed  days of December amounted to:                             In Physical        Average Daily Production as a                           Volume Since the   Percentage of the Corresponding                           Beginning of the   Period of                           Month   Last Year                Preceding Month   Meat, including          67.7               76               84  category I  subproducts,  total--thousand tonnes    Butter,                  7.5                80               80  total--thousand tonnes    Whole-milk products      205                87               94  recalculated as milk,  total, thousand tonnes       The only item where an increase in production was registered  as compared to both the corresponding period of last year and  that of the preceding month was vegetable oil--by 21 percent and  24 percent, respectively.    With respect to most varieties of foodstuffs, the daily  output has declined as compared to the same period in November,  which in a number of instances is due to the seasonal nature of  production. For instance, with respect to commercial edible fish  and canned fruit and vegetables production declined,  respectively, by 20 percent and 26 percent; the output of  granulated sugar fell off by more than one-third.    As compared to the corresponding period of last year there  has been a considerable decline in the production of bakers'  yeast--by 20 percent, macaroni items--by 40 percent, and mineral  water--by 44 percent.    With respect to butter, canned meat, tea, and food  concentrates neither the level of the corresponding period of  last year nor that of the preceding month has been reached.  <H5>  Housing construction </H5>   In January-November 1993 commissioning of housing in the  Russian Federation was characterized by the following data:                        Commissioned,       January-November       Share in                      million square      1993 as a Percentage   Total                      meters of total     of 1992                Volume, in                      space                                      Percents   Enterprises and     22.8                101                    100  organizations of  all forms of  ownership   of them:   state enterprises   11.8                96                     52  and organizations    joint-stock         5.0                 116                    22  societies      As compared to the corresponding period of 1990 the volume  of  housing construction has declined by 40 percent.    The private sector (individual housing construction and  cooperatives) accounted for approximately one-fifth of the total  volume of the housing commissioned. The pace of construction in  this sector will increase by more than 3 percent as compared to  the preceding year.    Overall over 1993, it is planned to put into place more than  42 million square meters of housing. The volume of housing  construction is expected to increase in a majority of regions in  Russia; an especially high pace of housing construction is being  observed in Tomsk, Ivanovo, Kostroma, and Ulyanovsk Oblasts and  the city of St. Petersburg.  <H3>  Construction of Most Important Objects in the  Agro-Industrial Complex </H3>   Capital investment worth R3.2 trillion from all sources of  financing was put into strengthening the material and technical  base of the agro-industrial complex [APK] and improving the  social and living conditions of its workers in January-November  of this year, which is 28 percent less than over the  corresponding period of last year.    Money from the state budget of the Russian Federation  comprises one-fifth of the total volume; it is directed mostly  at construction of the APK's most important production objects  in accordance with federal targeted programs. In 1993,  construction of 910 such objects is envisaged at 709  construction sites in the Russian Federation. As of 1 December  1993, only 19 were actually put on line, including partial  operation. The level of commissioning of the APK's most  important production capacities and facilities comprised about 6  percent of the annual start-up program, which is seen from the  following data:                    Quantity                      Objects Put on      Utilization of Capital                                                Line Over           Investment Over                                                January-November    January-November 1993                                                1993   Construction    Objects              Total    Billion Rubles,  Sites                                         Including for                                                Start-Up                                                Construction                                                Objects   Total           Including                  Start-Ups                  in 1993   Total           709          910     348      19                  119.8        50.4   including by program:   "Development    73           73      12       --                  11.7         2.2  of the Baby  Food  Industry"   "Russia's       65           119     36       1                   16.9         5.9  Bread"   "Sugar"         30           36      13       --                  9.7          2.1   "Fish"          92           115     63       --                  7.5          5.9   "Vegetable      8            11      5        --                  6.2          5.9  Oil"   "Fertility"     39           40      18       5                   3.5          2.1   "Rebirth of     252          349     134      10                  44.1         19.7  the Russian  Countryside  and the  Development  of the APK"   "Rebirth of     18           27      11       --                  0.9          0.5  the Russian  Linen"   Nonprogram      132          140     56       3                   19.3         6.1  part      As of 1 December 1993, work on 94 extremely important APK  construction projects has not yet started; almost one-half of  them are part of the "Development of the Baby Food Industry" and  "Fish" programs.

As of 1 December of this year, 2.7 million tonnes of  sea-bound export cargo have accumulated in the main sea ports in  Russia, which is 37 percent more than on this date last year.  The greatest remainders of this cargo were in the ports  Nakhodka--561,000 tonnes (19 percent more than during the  corresponding period of last year), Vostochnyy--480,000 tonnes,  Vladivostok--282,000 tonnes, Vanino--246,000 tonnes (twice as  much), St. Petersburg--354,000 tonnes (by 8 percent), and  Kaliningrad--188,000 tonnes (1.7-fold).    Overall, remainders of export cargo awaiting shipping in the  main sea ports increased by 1.4 percent as compared to 1  November of this year; they decreased in the ports of St.  Petersburg, Vostochnyy, and Novorossiysk (by 4-11 percent), and  increased in the ports of Kaliningrad, Vanino, and Vladivostok  (by 9-16 percent).  <H3>  Deliveries by Waterway Transport to the Regions of the Far  North </H3>   As of 1 December of this year, about 43 million tonnes of  cargo had been shipped to the regions of the Far North and areas  equated to them, which is 25 percent less than the volume of the  cargo shipped as of the same date last year.

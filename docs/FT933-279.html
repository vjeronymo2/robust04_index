			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Survey of Peru (28): Review report awaited - Anti-drugs efforts in Peru have been thrown into confusion by a shift in US policy THE new US administration and its shift in drugs policy threw anti-drugs efforts in Peru into confusion. This month the US Drugs Enforcement Agency said it would probably have to cease operations out of the Santa Lucia military base in the Upper Huallaga valley, Peru's main coca-growing area. The base is being put in jeopardy by cuts called for by the US Senate in the State Department's anti-drugs efforts. Meanwhile the US administration is carrying out an inter-agency review of its anti-narcotics efforts, which is expected to result in a reduced emphasis on international interdiction and eradication efforts. Human rights concerns, after President Fujimori's institutional coup on April 5 last year, have already led to cuts in US military aid. The US Senate voted last week to suspend aid to Peru until it compensates survivors of a US airman killed when a Peruvian military aircraft strafed a US C-130 transport aircraft on a Peruvian-authorised anti-narcotics mission in April 1992. The Santa Lucia base - which costs an annual Dollars 13m - seems to have succeeded in reducing trafficking out of the Huallaga Valley - only to move it to more remote areas. 'It's worked as far as it goes, but you'd need 20 or 30 Santa Lucias to be able to control the main trafficking regions in the country,' says one US official. Nearly two thirds of the world's supply of cocaine comes from coca produced in Peru. The US State Department said in a report to Congress in February that there are 129,100 hectares under coca production, of which over half is in the Huallaga valley. (Peruvian officials often cite an area twice as big or more.) Official Peruvian policy is aimed at containing the growth of coca production. It emphasises alternative development for farmers and crop substitution, a solution hindered by the remoteness of the coca-growing areas and a lack of roads. Peru ratified the 1988 UN convention on narcotics in January 1992, after which legislation was introduced to make money laundering a crime and to control chemicals used in cocaine production. The police have been responsible for anti-narcotics operations; the army for the fight against terrorism. The links between drugs traffickers and terrorism brought calls for efforts to be better co-ordinated. However, the police have generally been jealous of their territory, while the army is often accused of being in the pay of drugs traffickers. Retired General Gaston Ibanez O'Brien denies that the corruption of army officers by drugs traffickers is as widespread as often depicted. Still he admits it goes on. 'Where there are drugs, there is corruption. It's fatal.' The problem is worsened by low pay: a general commanding a division is paid, he says, Dollars 320 a month. 'People are vulnerable when they are paid so little: it's not justifiable but it's understandable.'</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Cardiff mail strike called 'unnecessary' ROYAL MAIL yesterday denounced as 'totally unnecessary' the nine-day dispute by 900 postal staff in Cardiff over the introduction of a new shift system. The dispute has paralysed the letter service in south Wales, and Royal Mail has called on the Union of Communication Workers to put a proposed peace formula to the strikers for their approval. Management said the proposed framework agreement it negotiated with the union's executive had been turned down by the local branch officials. Royal Mail said: 'There is no justification for this dispute. A framework for a settlement has been worked out between Royal Mail and UCW national executive members. We are deeply disappointed this framework has been rejected by the local UCW leadership who must shoulder the blame for the continuation of this dispute.' Mr Les Parry, an executive member, denied the union had agreed any framework. He said: 'Negotiations have been going on slowly but there has been nothing to put to the union locally.' Royal Mail said last night that about 2,500 postboxes had been sealed. It advised those wishing to send documents to Companies House in Cardiff to send them instead to Companies House in London.</p>

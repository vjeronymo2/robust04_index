			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gennadiy Melikyan, Russian Federation </F> minister of labor, by POSTFACTUM; place and date not given:  "Social Policy Must Not Be the Hostage of Political Speculation"]    [Text] [POSTFACTUM] Gennadiy Georgiyevich, the Russian  president's message to the Federal Assembly speaks of the need  to reduce the social costs of the policy of reforms. Yours is a  key ministry in the social sphere. What do you see as the way  to resolve this problem?    [Melikyan] Strictly speaking, this is our main task, and it  was for this that our ministry was created. In 1993 we  succeeded in preventing a further fall in the living standards  of the bulk of the population and in avoiding mass unemployment.  And yet we cannot speak of any turning point or the start of  one. The production slump is intensifying, and stoppages of  enterprises and their transfer to a reduced work week are  assuming an increasingly mass nature. The growth in nonpayments  and the lack of funds in enterprises' accounts have led to a  sharp increase in delays over paying wages. It is natural that  all this displeases and alarms people and creates social  tension. It will be no exaggeration to say that the situation  in the social sphere is close to being a crisis situation.    [POSTFACTUM] Does this mean that there are no conditions  today for implementing an effective social policy?    [Melikyan] If I thought that, I would make a proposal to  abolish the ministry as being useless or at least tender my  resignation. It is possible and necessary to elaborate a  policy, but a realistic policy. People both at the top and at  the bottom must be clearly aware that there are no  miracle-working prescriptions for a rapid and substantial  improvement in people's lives. This is above all because  society's objective potential and the actual resources which can  be used for these purposes have diminished. Until the  production slump ends and we surmount the economic crisis, the  public loaf will merely diminish in size, not increase.    Second point. I do not want to say that the ministry is  doing everything it can. We have let slip a great deal and been  slow to implement a number of measures. At the same time far  from everything depends on us and our work. The resolution of  the problems of incomes, employment, and working conditions is  determined, in the final analysis, by the overall economic and  financial policy that is implemented.    Therefore I would formulate as follows my present credo as  the minister responsible for a certain area of social policy.  First, not to set myself unrealizable goals, not to make  promises I cannot fulfill. But to strive for the maximum within  the framework of the actual potential and the decisions adopted.  Second, to be sure of real, not declarative support for the  social measures being taken on the part of the president, the  government, parliament, and the organs of power of the  republics, the krays and oblasts, and the autonomous entities.  Social policy must not be the hostage of political speculation  and intrigue or of egotistical regional or corporative interests.    We are convinced that in the present grave economic  situation  the emphasis in social policy must be placed on effective  actions in several very important areas that are capable of  producing a tangible return within a short time. We have put  corresponding proposals to the government. They have been  approved in principle. We are now working on specific documents  -- draft laws, government decrees, and presidential edicts.    [POSTFACTUM] Which drafts, specifically, do you mean?    [Melikyan] I will name those that seem most significant. We  propose to curb growth in the labor remuneration fund or the  consumption fund at enterprises which have wages that exceed the  average for industry. I emphasize: curb, not freeze, and  introduce this measure temporarily, in conjunction with other  measures to suppress inflation and to overcome disproportions in  labor remuneration.    Further, we propose to introduce a mechanism for curbing  growth in the prices of certain most important foodstuffs --  above all, bread, milk and certain dairy products, and meat  products, with the exception of delicatessen ones.    We deem it expedient to take control of the present practice  whereby leaders of state enterprises and of joint-stock  companies with state participation receive wages that are  exponentially higher than the average wage for the enterprise.  The difference can be of the order of 10 times or more,  including at enterprises whose financial position is far from  good. This rightly displeases working people. The ministry  prepared a draft decree "On the Terms of Labor Remuneration for  Leaders of State Enterprises on the Conclusion of Agreements  (Contracts)." V. Chernomyrdin, chairman of the government,  signed our draft. So this payment procedure is coming into  force.    One of the most "explosive" social problems today is  probably  that of the delays over paying wages. Before the system of  mutual transactions in the national economy is regularized, we  propose introducing a calendar sequence of payments, with the  exception of wages. These are to be paid by way of a top  priority at the rate of up to six times the minimum wage. In  the event of a delay in the payment of wages, the labor  collective or the trade union has the right to raise the  question of dismissing the leader from his post.    In addition, we have prepared a number of documents aimed at  increasing the monetary incomes of the employed population.  These are draft laws on the minimum living wage and on  indexation of the minimum wage and a draft government decree on  increasing the labor remuneration of working people in the  budget-funded sphere.    In our country, incidentally, budget-funded working people  made up the bulk of that category of the population which lives  below the poverty line. This is borne out by the fact that when  we at last began paying indexed wages to working people in  budget-funded sectors in February, the proportion of the poor  population fell from 34 percent (data for January this year) to  17 percent, i.e. it was exactly halved. It turns out that those  on low incomes are budget-funded working people and some  pensioners.    Finally, before the Law on the Minimum Living Wage is  adopted, the authorities in the components of the Federation and  organs of local self-management are to be recommended to emulate  the experience of Nizhniy Novgorod, Voronezh Oblast, and the  city of Moscow and put into practice a system of targeted  assistance for the most needy citizens.    [POSTFACTUM] One gets the impression that far from everyone  will support your plans. Some will criticize you for proposing  antimarket measures, others for the fact that your proposals  will entail an increase in inflation.    [Melikyan] We propose to regulate monetary incomes and  prices by economic means, not administrative ones, so there is  nothing antimarket here. This is the usual practice in any  countries where the state seeks to regulate economic life and  not to avoid this. This is the practice in countries which we so  like to call civilized.    Now about the inflationary effect of the proposed measures.  I believe that growth in the money supply should not be limited  all the time. Restrictions on demand, i.e. a reduction in the  demand for output owing to a lack of money, depress production  itself, particularly consumer goods production. The limitation  of monetary incomes should not be made an end in itself, but  their growth should simply be regulated.    In general, I am a committed supporter of the idea that the  best means of social protection for the able-bodied section of  the population is to create conditions so that people can earn.  The whole country must not be turned into a social security  department, when the population puts its trust not in its own  qualifications, activity, and initiative but in social benefits.    In addition, the argument over the consequences of our  indexation proposals is of an abstract nature at present. We  proposed starting the new stage of indexation in March, but this  has not happened, although the leadership realizes at the top  level that there is no getting away from this. A struggle is  being waged between representatives of the social bloc and the  financial bloc.    [POSTFACTUM] This struggle will be manifested particularly  visibly during the discussion of the draft budget in the State  Duma. How do you rate the prospects for the budget's adoption?    [Melikyan] In my view, the budget does not suit anyone in  its present form -- neither political parties nor corporative  groupings. Everyone will criticize it, and everyone will seek  to extort as much as possible for himself. I am afraid that the  budget's passage will drag on for a long time. I do not even  rule out the possibility that we might once again be left  without a budget, as last year.    [POSTFACTUM] It is already obvious that the first three  months of this year brought about a production slump on a still  greater scale than in any period during the previous three or  four years. This will evidently give a new boost to talk of  introducing an economic state of emergency. What is your  opinion of this?    [Melikyan] There is a lot of talk of this, but nobody knows  what it means. If this term denotes a rapid response to the  economic situation within the framework of the Constitution and  the laws, then I am in favor of it. Although, in my view, this  is not an economic state of emergency but normal operational  work in an economic crisis situation.    It is another matter that certain political forces invest  this concept with different meaning, when emphasis is placed not  on the word "economic" but on the word "emergency." Such forces  exist on the extreme flanks of both camps -- both the democratic  camp and the opposition camp. Therefore, when the idea of an  economic state of emergency is advanced as a smoke screen for  pushing a political "emergency," I am against it.    This is why it is so important to implement the Agreement on  Civil Peace in practice. Knowing the positions of "Russia's  Choice" and "Democratic Russia" on the one hand and of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, the Communists, and the  Agrarians on the other, I find it hard to imagine that they can  reach agreement on anything with one another. Nevertheless, we  must move toward accord in the name of the well-being of Russia  and its citizens.</p>

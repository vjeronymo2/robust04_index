			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: ICI If Imperial Chemical Industries is a bellwether, then yesterday's results contain some gloomy news not only for the UK but for the world at large. The company does not expect a recovery in demand for commodity chemicals till 1993, and then a slow one at that. Though its restructuring programme is running to plan, there is as yet little visible effect on the bottom line. That left pharmaceuticals as the star performer. They account for only 13 per cent of turnover but actually produced over half of group operating profits. ICI's aggressive restructuring means it is well geared to recovery once the cycle turns. But the delay justifed yesterday's 2 per cent fall in the shares. The current year looks difficult, especially since growth in pharmaceuticals may be slowed by the expiry of the US patent on Tenormin, the highly successful angina treatment.</p>

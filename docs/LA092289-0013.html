			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLANK CHECK FOR THE HARD LINE IN EL SALVADOR  </P> <P> Mid-September's ground-breaking meeting in Mexico between the Salvadoran  government and guerrillas ended with an agreement to begin monthly negotiating  sessions with international mediation. Will these talks go beyond  public-relations posturing? Perhaps. There are new, strong pressures on the  major players to pursue a political end to a civil war that has claimed 70,000  lives since 1980. Progress, however, will be meager until the United States  demands serious diplomacy for its billion-dollar investment.  </P> <P> The critical fact that makes negotiations possible is that the 9-year-old war  remains stalemated. The guerrillas, strong militarily, continue to take a heavy  toll on the army and are crippling the government economically. But victory  still eludes them, and the population, though largely sympathetic to the  insurgents' reformist aims, is war-weary; almost 70% want a political, not a  military solution to the war.  </P> <P> For President Alfredo Cristiani, negotiations at this point are largely a  public-relations ploy to show the United States that, despite his party's close  association with wealthy elites, reactionary social policy and death squads, he  is really a man of peace. But there are mounting pressures on Cristiani to take  negotiations seriously.  </P> <P> He came to office in June on promises of economic recovery and an end to the  war. But the treasury is almost bankrupt, and deficits, trade imbalances and  recession threaten to make the economic crisis worse. It is slowly becoming  clear, even to some of his business-sector supporters, that no one will invest  in economic recovery until the war winds down, and that a military solution is  a distant hope at best.  </P> <P> The growing logic of a political solution is still opposed by many hard-liners  in the ruling Arena party and the military. "We have nothing to negotiate" with  the guerrillas, Defense Minister Gen. Rafael Humberto Larios said recently. His  response to the 11-day unilateral cease-fire that the guerrillas initiated  before the talks in Mexico City was to mount major counterinsurgency operations  in five provinces.  </P> <P> The guerrillas have pared down many of their longstanding demands, but remain  firm on these: the prosecution of military personnel involved in the torture  and murder of civilians, and a general reforming of the high command. This is  anathema to senior officers. For decades their institution has been untouched  by civilian control, their political crimes and corruption beyond the reach of  the judicial system.  </P> <P> Continuing a war that is personally profitable and paid for with the lives of  junior officers and forcibly enlisted draftees is preferable to giving up their  historic power and privilege -- as long, that is, as the United States foots  the bills. Negotiations will have a chance only when cuts in aid persuade the  military that Washington is serious about a political settlement.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration does not seem to share Ronald Reagan's messianic  impulse toward Central America, yet Secretary of State James A. Baker III is  noticeably unwilling to rethink policy toward El Salvador. He may understand  that U.S. policy is in trouble, but he wants to avoid a sustained, acrimonious  congressional debate about supporting a reactionary regime and a hopeless war.  </P> <P> Here, too, pressures are slowly building. To many in Washington, the defeat of  the Christian Democrats by the ultra-rightist Arena in last March's election  signaled a policy failure. Despite the $3.6 billion given to El Salvador since  1980, neither the war nor the poverty and repression that fueled it was close  to a solution.  </P> <P> El Salvador is already the third-largest U.S. aid recipient in the world. Now  costs will rise, both for continuing the war and propping up an anti-democratic  and virtually bankrupt, corrupt government. Supporters of continued aid are  reduced to pointing out that at least Cristiani is not Roberto D'Aubuisson, the  Arena leader who has been linked to political murders. No one is asking the  really important question: Will the Arena government do better than the failed  Christian Democrats in ending state terror and economic injustice?  </P> <P> In July an attempt by a House panel to restrict and condition aid to El  Salvador failed, but it did lead to the first floor debate on Salvador policy  in five years. Last week, an important group of senators on the Appropriations  Committee, led by Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.) and Tom  Harkin (D-Iowa) brought forward legislation that would have sent an important  message to the military. But a majority in the Senate proved as reluctant as  the House to initiate a reconsideration of policy.  </P> <P> The Senate bill would have released $85 million in military aid, but only after  the President certified certain improvements in El Salvador. What's more, the  final one-third would have been released only if key congressional committees  concurred that both the U.S. and Salvadoran governments were making a serious  effort to "settle the conflict . . . through . . . negotiations," "protect . .  . human rights," and preserve political freedoms.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration and its Senate allies claimed that such conditions  demonstrated a premature lack of faith in Cristiani. Hogwash. If Cristiani were  serious about pursuing negotiations and ending rights abuses, he would not  object to such a bill -- and a smart senator would see it as providing  Cristiani with exactly the kind of leverage he needs to persuade the military  to go along.  </P> <P> Instead, it's business as usual: The United States will write another blank  check and the hard-liners in El Salvador will nod at rhetoric about democracy  while pursuing their ill-fated war. If future peace talks are to have any  meaning, the Bush Administration and Congress must reconsider their reluctance  to get tough with the government in San Salvador.  </P></p>

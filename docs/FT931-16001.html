			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pizza Express to join market PIZZA EXPRESS, the privately-owned restaurant chain founded by Mr Peter Boizot in 1965, is coming to market through a reverse takeover organised by the Watford-based Star Computer Group. Trading in Star Computer's shares was suspended at 47p on December 22 at the company's request pending an announcement about a 'substantial acquisition'. Yesterday Mr Boizot and Mr David Blechner, Star's chairman, confirmed that a deal should be finalised next month. 'We are at the paperwork stage,' said Mr Blechner. Under the terms of the proposed deal Star will fund the acquisition of Pizza Express by issuing some 35m new shares at about 40p each. The Pizza Express chain comprises 70 restaurants, mostly in London and the south-east, including 49 independent franchises and nine restaurants run by Mr David Page who is expected to be in charge of the day-to-day operations of the company. It is the oldest and probably the most successful of the pizza chains in Britain with profits last year of about Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds 29m. Mr Boizot, who acknowledged that he will receive a 'substantial cash sum' as a result of the deal, will become chairman of the new publicly-quoted company and its largest shareholder with 'at least' a 20 per cent equity stake. He is also keeping two of his London restaurants, Pizza on the Park in Knightsbridge, and Kettners, in Soho, which together have an annual turnover of between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m. The deal will also allow Mr Boizot's current minority partners, with whom he has had some recent disagreements, to cash in their stakes. After the acquisition, and a proposed rights issue to pay off debts and provide capital for expansion, Star will become a self-contained subsidiary of Pizza Express. Star supplies software and services to specialist markets and has been substantially restructured by its current management led by Mr Blechner. It returned to profitability in its latest financial year posting a pre-tax profit of Pounds 119,000 against a loss of Pounds 886,000 in the previous year.</p>

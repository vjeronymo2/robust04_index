			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Architecture: Academe's Coventry climax - Colin Amery praises the new work by Richard MacCormac Patronage is the key to good architecture. When a top British company has the courage and skill to commission a leading architect to design one of its major buildings the result can be inspiring, both for British business and the architectural profession. The new residential training college for Cable and Wireless at Coventry shines like a beacon of encouragement in a world where good architecture is badly held back by both the recession and client timidity. Quite simply it is one of the best and most thoughtful new buildings to have been built in England for some time. When it came to its search for an architect for a new college on a rural site near Coventry, Cable and Wireless was wise enough to follow the route of a private competition by interviewing a shortlist of potential candidates. The company's choice of Richard MacCormac's firm of MacCormac, Jamieson and Prichard was made for two reasons. First, it appreciated the experience of the firm in the building of academic and residential buildings. Second, Cable and Wireless recognised the firm's distinction: Richard MacCormac had made it to the top of the architectural tree as president of the RIBA. Before choosing, the selectors took a tour of MacCormac's existing buildings, such as the waterside, residential Sainsbury Building at Worcester College, Oxford, the New Court at Fitzwilliam College and the more recent chapel at the same college in Cambridge. These showed the clear aesthetic and practical development of the practice over the last decade. MacCormac's most recent building in Oxford is the Garden Quadrangle for St. John's College; and his competition winning scheme for Balliol is awaited with interest. Cable and Wireless is relatively unusual for a British company (although one that is global in its activities), in wanting to build a residential training centre from scratch on a virgin site. Many British companies find it almost irresistible to acquire a old country house, preferably in a stately park. The site outside Coventry is close to the University of Warwick and shortly to be bordered by a new business park. It is perfectly placed and designed with assurance and imagination. MacCormac has rare gifts. He is fascinating to talk to and refreshingly flexible in his approach to architectural debate. His quiet thoughtfulness shows at every point in the Cable and Wireless College. The company wanted somewhere that immediately gave a sense of a special place of learning; a place where residential life is made dignified and enjoyable by the surroundings. You sense its special qualities the moment you arrive, driving past the water and scrunching on the gravel as you reach the gently modulated steps beneath the wave-like curves of the roofs. A parallel series of single-storey teaching studios stretch out on each side of the main entrance. As you pass through you reach the central space of the college - an oval court that is partly sheltered and partly open to the sky. This is the heart of the college: in a traditional way the refectory, library and common rooms gather here. The college garden separates you from the residential buildings. At one end of the long garden court is the leisure and fitness centre. Water plays an important part in the overall layout - a long rill running through the garden culminating in a waterfall beneath the leisure centre. The firm of Colvin and Moggridge were the landscape architects and they seem to have understood the sense of almost oriental simplicity of the architecture. The gardens, water, trees and varied surfaces underfoot all unify the whole site and create a rare feeling of another world. The atmosphere of calm is as much to do with the choice of materials as it is with the sense of enclosure. The specially made green ceramic tiles on the wave-like roofs have an extraordinary capacity to reflect the changing light in the sky. The stone and concrete is everywhere finely finished; the palette of colour inside and outside is natural and elegant. There is no sense of pretension or contrivance about this building. It is a place which is respected and liked by those who work there. Prof David Ashton, the college's chief executive, explained how well the traditional collegiate qualities of the design help to cement working relationships on his courses on advanced communications technology. The architect and the client had to marry the everyday world of human relationships, laboratory and classroom teaching with a mass of high-tech equipment and its necessary services. This is where the students learn. They do so in a new building that, by its beauty and careful planning, demonstrates that good architecture can inspire and humanise the most arcane technology.</p>

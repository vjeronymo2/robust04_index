			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA special correspondent </F> Lieutenant-Colonel Nykyfor Lysitsya under the rubric "Urgent!":  "Expenses Instead of Profits--Or, Where To Get the Funds  for Aircraft Maintenance?"]    [Text] I have had occasion to write more than once about  the difficult situation that military aviation finds itself in  owing to the lack of fuel. I will thus only point out that most  pilots have not met the standards for flying time this year, and  a considerable portion of them have lost their qualifications.  There are units where combat readiness is maintained only by the  leading combat crews.    But is the situation really hopeless for our fliers? No. I  had occasion to be persuaded of this when I heard the  presentations of many officials at a session of the military  council of the VPS [Air Forces] that was just held in Vinnytsa.  Concrete proposals were made there with regard to obtaining  funds for fuels and lubricants, moreover through the efforts of  the fliers themselves. I will cite only a few of them. That will  possibly promote their realization.    It is no secret that some military transport aircraft are  being used to ship the most diverse types of freight, both  within the borders of Ukraine and to other countries. And it is  providing quite a bit of profit, both for the state and for the  armed forces.    However, as commander of the military-transport aviation  forces Major-General of Aviation Petro Matyukhin indicated in  his presentation to the military council, the quantity of  aircraft for this purpose could be increased considerably--first  of all through better organizational work. Advertising,  clear-cut planning and timely support are all needed here. It is  not sufficient today. So it turns out that one crew flies more  than four hundred hours in a year, but another takes their  aircraft up for just a few hours.    Matters are sometimes paradoxical with the provision of  spare  parts. Some parts for the aircraft are manufactured in Kiev and  are delivered to Tashkent, to the plant where the aircraft are  manufactured and their servicing and repairs under guarantee are  performed. From there those parts, for example the so-called  UZI, are returned to us again, to Ukraine, to be installed in  aircraft; but they have now crossed the borders with customs and  transport charges, and are thus considerably more expensive. It  is not difficult to guess where that leads.    The pilots of military-transport aviation this year gained  operational experience in yet another use of the Il-76 aircraft.  Here, as they say, misfortune forced them to. Fires that broke  out in the forests of the Crimea demanded the use of unusual  measures. The military aviators were fighting the fire in their  mighty aircraft. It would be better, of course, if they did not  have to do such things, but no one is insured against natural  disasters. Great fires break out at various around the globe  every year. The pilots of military-transport aviation could take  part in extinguishing them. Their services need only be  requested.    Helicopters can be used as well as aircraft for the shipment  of freight for so-called commercial purposes. There is a  squadron of the giant Mi-26 helicopters, say, in the regiment  commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Mykhaylo Shymkov. These are the  most modern rotary-winged craft, able to ship freight of many  tonnes great distances, perform installation work and the like.  None of them are being used today, however. The reason is that  the main rotor blades and some other parts have exhausted their  service lives. There is nothing with which to procure new ones  from Russia, since our financial difficulties are well known.  But the rotor blades do not need to be purchased. They could be  obtained through barter, say, for engines for the same  helicopters. Those units, after all, are manufactured here in  Ukraine by the Motor-Sich plant. The regiment even has spare  engines on hand. This not-very-complicated operation need only  be organized and carried out.    When the Mi-26 helicopters are able to obtain their new  "wings," they will be able to repay the funds spent on them a  hundred times over. Great amounts of money, after all, are spent  to install just one single derrick or electrical-transmission  line tower, and the gain is twofold--profits for the state and  the armed forces, and experience in practical flight work for  the helicopter crews. All of this need only be organized and  brought to life.    The Commander of the 14th Air Army, Lieutenant-General  Viktor  Lyashenko, pointed out in his presentation to the military  council that quite a large quantity of aircraft in good working  order that are not part of the regular composition of air units  is concentrated at the aircraft repair plant in Lviv. Large sums  of money are spent every day to preserve them and keep them in  working order. They are moreover becoming functionally obsolete,  and will not be suitable for use after a certain time. They  still have value today as combat aircraft, and thus could be  sold to those countries where such types of aircraft are in  service. So why not sell them?    The storage area also has unmanned reconnaissance drones  that  could lose their combat capability or become functionally  obsolete after some time. It would thus be better to sell them  on the world arms market. Some of the funds obtained could be  spent to develop and produce more modern aircraft of that type.    Quite a few surplus motor vehicles have accumulated in the  support units of the air forces. They have been mothballed, as  they should be, and put into long-term storage. But there are  not suitable conditions for storage everywhere. The equipment  moreover grows obsolete even under the best of conditions, both  functionally and physically. Considerable amounts of funds and  mat&eacute;riel are expended in order to preserve them and  maintain  them in battleworthy condition as well. A proposal was thus made  at the military council to conduct an inventory of all surplus  vehicles, so as to determine which it would be efficient to  keep, as they say, for a rainy day, and which it would be best  to get rid of while buyers can still be found for them. Some of  the funds received could be used to buy new, contemporary models  of vehicles that are in short supply today or could be needed in  the future. The superfluous vehicles could otherwise be turned  into scrap metal in several years.    There is another problem. Quite a few difficulties are  arising in the aviation units with the turnover of scrap metal.  According to the prevailing directive instructions, all should  turn over scrap metal only to the Vtorchormet organization.  Taking advantage of its monopoly position, however, this  outdated state organization has been dictating its own terms.  All aircraft have to be cut up into pieces of the appropriate  sizes and delivered by one's own transport to the receiving  stations. And there, under certain conditions, they will  possibly accept them, and after some time they will possibly  also pay at prices they set themselves.    It is often simply impossible to meet these conditions.  Where  can they get the heavy cutting apparatus? The aircraft are made  from alloys, after all, such that they cannot be cut into pieces  by ordinary cutting or even a simple oxyacetylene torch. And the  scarcity of fuel reduces to a minimum the possibility of  delivering scrap to the Vtorchormet receiving stations. Quite a  few aircraft that have lived out their "winged" service are thus  "rotting away" in the corners of airfields.    At the same time, as was emphasized at the military council,  there are several organizations that would be glad to cut up and  take away aircraft that are unfit for service themselves, and  pay considerably more than the aforementioned Vtorchormet. They  moreover do not ship the scrap metal outside the boundaries of  our state, but rather intend to use it in Ukraine. But the  "taboo" from above does not let them do so. So it turns out that  it is no use to them, but they cannot give it to anyone else.    One could also make other proposals with regard to obtaining  funds for the upkeep of military aviation. But these are  certainly enough to conclude that we are still enduring losses  in places where we could be getting profits. The approaches to  resolving the problems must thus be changed. This should  moreover be done today, otherwise tomorrow will be too late. The  sources for obtaining funds could be gone, and the need for them  could disappear if the pilots lose their combat qualifications.</p>

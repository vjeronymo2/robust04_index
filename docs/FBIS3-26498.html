			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Britain's HK, Hong Kong, Airport Plan </F> Criticized"]    [Text] A statement was issued by the Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office under the State Council on the new Hong Kong  airport on January 25.    The statement said that the Hong Kong British authorities  disregarding objections by the Chinese side, allowed the Hong  Kong-British Legislative Council (Legco) to pass a bill last  week allocating HK [Hong Kong] $1.67 billion for the new airport  project, before any agreement had been reached between China and  Britain on the financial arrangement for the new airport. They  also decided to apply to Legco for another appropriation of  HK$4.6 billion.    According to the British side, the debt to be left over to  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region after 1997 will run  up to over HK$45 billion, under the present financial  arrangement for the airport project. It will be nine times the  total debt limit set in the memorandum of understanding signed  by the heads of governments of China and Britain.    By continuing to apply for fund allocation when the whole  financial arrangement by the British side has already violated  the memorandum of understanding, the statement noted, the Hong  Kong authorities are creating further obstacles to talks on the  Hong Kong new airport project.    The Chinese side declared in the statement that before any  agreement on the financial arrangement for the new airport  project is reached by the two sides,    1. The Chinese side and the government of the future Hong  Kong Special Administrative region will not be liable for any  expenditure and debt incurred by building the new airport;    2. The land to be used and the prices of the land, including  the land to be occupied by the new airport and the land to be  used along the railway line leading to the airport, must be  leased through the Sino-British Land Committee according to the  provisions of Annex 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration;    3. All contracts associated with the new airport project  that  cover the time beyond June 30, 1997 that are approved by the  Hong Kong British authorities without the consent of the Chinese  side will be invalid after July 1, 1997;    4. Any law or ordinance associated with the new airport  project adopted by the Hong Kong Legco will become invalid after  July 1, 1997;    The Chinese government has always supported the construction  of a new airport in Hong Kong, the statement said. In order to  separate political issues from economic ones, it, has approved  the land-to-sea project at Wanchai, Central, and the seabed  tunnel project at the Western Harbor.    The statement expressed regrets over the British side's  repeated breaches of the agreement reached between the two  governments. However, it still hopes that the British side will  earnestly deliberate ever the positive proposals raised by the  Chinese side on reducing costs and debts, strengthening  management and supervision, and producing a financial  arrangement in accordance with the memorandum of understanding,  so as to restore talks on the new airport issue.</p>

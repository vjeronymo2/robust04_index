			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Paid advertisement on communique issued by the </F> Superintendency of Banks and Insurance on 10 February 1994; from  the "Global TV News" newscast]    [Text] Communique    1. The Superintendency of Banks and Insurance, in complying  with the general law on banking, financial, and insurance  institutions and in accordance with its basic law, on 10  February has decided not to authorize the formalization of the  Latin American Business Advisory Center, CLAE.    2. It is a known fact that the Superintendency of Banks and  Insurance, considering the interests of CLAE investors, has  shown a great deal of willingness and flexibility to facilitate  the formalization of this enterprise. Nevertheless, this has  not been possible due to serious irregularities, of which we  will mention the main ones:    A. Despite frequent requests from this Superintendency,  the CLAE Board of Directors has not clearly explained the  destination of the funds received from the public. In the  information delivered to this Superintendency as of 31 December  1993, CLAE directors declared that approximately 90 percent of  CLAE investments were placed in German government bonds issued  between 1924 and 1930 [as heard]. According to CLAE directors,  the value of those bonds was reportedly $308 million. CLAE  directors have not been able to prove the ownership or  authenticity of those bonds, or the way or means used to  purchase them, the actual value paid for them, and other  conditions. All the missing information, according to German  government authorities, are absolutely necessary to confirm the  authenticity of those bonds. In addition, CLAE directors have  not been able to prove the legality and value of the other  assets. The announced investments in lobster and asparagus  production are only reported with a value under $800,000, and no  evidence is provided of their capacity to generate income.    B. CLAE directors have not presented irrefutable proof, as  required by law, of the total amount of money they actually  received from the public. On 29 April 1993, when they took  control of CLAE, its directors reported that the amount received  from the public was approximately $206 million. Afterward, on  31 December 1993, in a report sent to the Superintendency on  diskettes, the amount reported was $454 million. In addition,  that amount did not agree with the balance sheet presented that  same day by CLAE directors, who have not explained the  differences or supplied the necessary information on the credit  accounts in order to directly confirm the amounts with its  creditors.    C. CLAE has not presented irrefutable evidence, as  required by law, proving its real financial situation. Despite  the facilities given by the Superintendency of Banks and  Insurance, CLAE directors have not satisfactorily proven the  real value of its assets and liabilities. Therefore, it has not  been able to determine its exact financial situation. Based on  the scant information supplied by its directors CLAE reportedly  faces a loss surpassing $110 million, which technically and  legally places the institution in an obvious bankruptcy  situation.    3. In accordance with the law, the Superintendency of Banks  and Insurance has issued instructions to its ad hoc attorney to  report the situation to the judicial authorities in order to  determine the responsibilities in the case. In the same manner,  and also according to the law, it has asked the Supreme Court of  Justice to order the closure of the Latin American Business  Advisory Center, CLAE.    [Issued] Lima, 10 February 1994    [Signed] General Secretariat</p>

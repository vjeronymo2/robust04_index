			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stanislava Medic-Antelj] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- The chief objective of  the Yugoslav government this year is to radically reduce  inflation which, owing to the stringent sanctions imposed by the  U.N., reached a monthly rate of one million percent last  December. The package of economic measures adopted on December  30 envisages a much more restrictive monetary policy, TANJUG  learns.    Though the printing presses are operating at top capacity,  churning out 1.6 million banknotes a day, the mint cannot meet  the demand for cash money. An ever-increasing amount of  banknotes is needed to buy an ever-decreasing quantity of goods.    The government aims to substantially cut public spending and  procure more revenue from sources such as taxation. Tax  benefits will be abolished and payments to employees in kind  banned. The average net wage this year is projected at 55 U.S.  dollars.    Owing to the rigorous sanctions imposed in late May 1992,  the  vast majority of Yugoslavs are living below the poverty line and  are short of many essentials, including medicines.    A recent survey showed that around 75 percent of industrial  facilities have ground to a halt because of the lack of fuel,  raw materials and semi-manufactures.    One of the anti-inflationary measures whose implementation  will start in the first half of the year is easing the tax  burden on the economy by shifting the responsibility for social  welfare from companies to the state. In addition, some 300,000  people who are currently on forced leave will lose their jobs  and receive unemployment benefits from the state.    The federal government estimates that implementation of  these  measures will result in a drop in industrial production in the  first half of the year, after which it would pick up and record  a 6.7 percent growth in the third quarter. The GNP is projected  to increase 6 percent.    The government said easing of the sanctions and unblocking  of  Yugoslavia's assets in foreign banks were preconditions for  cutting back the inflation rate.    Late last year, Prime Minister Radoje Kontic addressed a  request to this effect to the International Monetary Fund, World  Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / System under strain yet again: David Marsh and Peter Norman answer the questions you have always wanted to ask about the workings of the ERM The cause of European economic and monetary union suffered a further setback this week when the Spanish government on Thursday was forced to devalue the peseta by 8 per cent. Portugal reluctantly devalued the escudo by 6.5 per cent. European monetary officials were an hour into a long-planned meeting in Brussels when Mr Manuel Conthe, director-general of the Spanish Treasury, sprung the news that Madrid wanted a devaluation. The crisis in the Exchange Rate Mechanism raised fresh questions about the future of Europe. Why is the ERM in this mess? After five realignments in the past eight months, the ERM is not fulfilling its aim of forming a zone of monetary stability. Paradoxically, present difficulties arise partly because the ERM was kept far too stable for 5 3/4 years up to the crisis in mid-September. Governments misguidedly saw the ERM as a dress rehearsal for economic and monetary union (Emu). Unchanged parities combined with high post-unity interest rates in Germany brought down EC inflation, but also depressed EC growth. The strain of running tight monetary policies to maintain over-valued currency rates at a time of recession has proved too much for half the EC's 12 member states - resulting in the split into 'hard' and 'soft' currency groups. When is Britain likely to rejoin the ERM? Not for quite a while. Mr John Major has made clear that re-entry won't take place this year and Conservative MPs are in no mood to contemplate membership even after that. The ERM may look more attractive, however, if both Britain and Germany can achieve strong growth with low inflation. What effect will the latest upset have on the European economy? Could be positive. Continental Europe is in recession, with both Germany and France expecting a fall in GDP this year. Any move that lowers interest rates, as the Spanish devaluation has, should help activity in Spain and elsewhere. Don't expect any dramatic improvement, however, until Germany - Europe's powerhouse - begins to recover. That could take until the beginning of next year, at least, given Germany's problems with inflation and absorbing eastern Germany. Will it have any effect on my mortgage rate? Very unlikely. Continental interest rates have been dropping slowly since March when the Bundesbank began to ease monetary policy. But UK base rates had already fallen sharply to 6 per cent between sterling's departure from the ERM last September and January. Some building societies have warned they will not pass on further rate cuts to borrowers. With the UK economy growing again, the Treasury is happy with the present rate structure. Should I buy my holiday pesetas now, or hold out for another devaluation? Spain goes to the polls with 23 per cent unemployment on June 6, so it may be wise to see if there is a political upset. The market knows Spain wanted a 10 per cent devaluation and had to be content with 8 per cent. Moreover, the speculators made a profit from selling the peseta this week and may come back for more at the first sign of political or social tension. Is there a real danger of competitive devaluations throughout Europe? Yes - especially if there is still no sign of an EC upturn by the autumn. Exporters in the 'hard' EC members have suffered big declines in competitiveness as a result of other EC currencies' devaluations of 15 per cent or more since last autumn. As the table shows, nearly a quarter of Germany's exports, and nearly a third of French exports, go to 'soft' EC countries. French companies' impatience with the new right-wing government's economic policies could rise if the economy remains depressed through the winter. Why can't governments and central banks stop all this? Faced with an international foreign exchange market trading Dollars 1,000bn a day, central banks' ability to counteract exchange rate movements is highly limited. European central banks sold DM284bn between last June and December to prop up currencies. But they failed to prevent the devaluation or floating of eight currencies. With EC capital controls dismantled, and most EC countries offering highly liquid markets in government bonds and other financial instruments, international investors now have the freedom and sophistication to switch huge sums. How much money have central bankers lost from unrest since Black Wednesday? A lot. In its failed bid to save the peseta, the Bank of Spain entered into large and very expensive contracts to buy pesetas on the forward market which will cause big losses. Britain is thought to have made a net loss of more than Pounds 2bn as a result of Bank of England operations on and before Black Wednesday. Even the Bundesbank lost more than DM1bn last September by lending foreign currency to other central banks that was repaid in devalued Ecu. The Bank of France may be one of the few winners because the successful defence of the franc cost speculators Dollars 1bn. Who are the speculators? Basically, any company, institution or individual holding or wishing to hold assets or debts denominated in currencies which come under ERM attack can be a speculator. Investors seeking protection against the effects of devaluation can turn to swaps, options and futures markets and set in train moves that topple currencies. Such investors have been joined by aggressive US-based hedge funds seeking big profits. What does all this mean for European economic and monetary union? Emu becomes still more uncertain. The monetary turbulence since September has been accompanied by a sharp deterioration of the real economy in most EC countries. Only Luxembourg is fulfilling the tough economic convergence criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty as a precondition for EC states to take part in Emu. Because of this divergence, Emu by 1997, the first date for union named in the treaty, is highly unlikely. The hard core may be ready for union by 1999. But if they go ahead it will simply confirm that the EC is developing at two or more speeds. Is there any chance that France and Germany will agree to form monetary union on their own? A possibility often mooted and often denied by Paris and Bonn. A Franco-German monetary union would be incompatible with Maastricht and the Treaty of Rome, setting up the EC. But the two countries are certain to extend existing co-operation and could jointly dominate an eventual union of the hard-core countries. What has Europe learned from recent monetary crises? Governments and central banks have been forced to take a more realistic view about the possibilities for maintaining parities of currencies viewed by the markets as overvalued. Spain's decision to give up the fight against the speculators again highlighted the difficulties dogging the Maastricht process. The upset could strengthen the case of those who say Emu can only work if there is a speedy 'locking' of currency rates of the 'hard' EC countries. But this would require renegotiation of the Maastricht treaty. A single European currency and central bank look a long way away.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Where EC exports go  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Percentage of each country's total exports going to each partner                  Hard*     Soft**     Rest of World  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belg/Lux         56.6      18.3           25.1 Denmark          35.8      18.6           45.6 France           32.5      30.2           37.3 Germany          30.6      23.8           45.6 Netherlands      55.3      20.8           23.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Ireland          35.2      39.2           25.6 Italy            42.2      15.6           42.2 Portugal         44.2      30.9           24.9 Spain            44.0      27.1           28.8 UK               39.1      17.2           43.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Greece           36.3      27.8           35.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Hard countries: Belg/Lux, Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands ** Soft countries: Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD based on 1992 figures  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buyers move on Hanson International conglomerate Hanson was one of the few stocks in the Footsie to hold its head above the waves as optimism over top of the range figures overcame the pessimism over cyclical stocks. The two-way view on the stock ensured that it finished the day only 1 3/4 better at 237p, masking unusually heavy turnover of 20m shares. Profits of just above Pounds 1bn were boosted by benefits from Quantum, the chemical arm acquired last year. And Goldman Sachs said the surge in polyethylene prices would continue to lift earnings. 'Polyethylene has risen from 28 to 37 cents a pound this year. Every cent adds Dollars 35m to profits and we expect prices to hit the mid-40s next year,' commented the house specialist. The cyclical nature of Hanson's business has been the main drag on the share price and some long term doubts persist, particularly in the US where interest rate rise worries are multiplying. But analysts were edging up forecasts on the back of earnings recovery. Mr Geoff Allum of NatWest Securities said: 'I would expect the share price to respond to the pick-up in Hanson's markets following this solid set of figures.' Mr Allum raised his earnings per share forecast to 18.7p from 17.9p on the basis of company comments that the tax charge would fall below 25 per cent.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Richard III Richard Eyre's production of the bloody tragedy is back again at the National, before it tours America. No doubt the Minnesota audience will find it as impressive as Londoners have done; but they will find it a longer sit, too, for they are going to miss a great many lines. Not because the text is badly spoken; indeed it is very well spoken - but also, deliberately, 'well-spoken' in the classy modern-English sense. Across the Atlantic, those squeezed vowels and juiceless consonants (as affected by certain upper-middle circles, J. Arthur Rank actors and theatrical knights) will cry out for surtitles. It is an under-remarked fact that whereas 'good' French, Italian or Spanish is distinguished by its clarity, 'good' British English has the phonetic marks of a rancid provincial dialect. Eyre wanted those voices because his Richard is set critically in the England of some 50 years ago. That was when Brecht was raiding Shakespeare's play for his Hitler-play, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui; Eyre repays the compliment by rendering the original as if it were the 'Ui' story. Where Brecht fingered German industrialists and aristos as the collaborators who smoothed Ui/Hitler's path, Eyre presents Richard's partners and victims as the modern Establishment who might have let Fascism into Britain. In the black spaces and the stark industrial lighting devised by Bob Crowley and Jean Kalman, it makes a terrific show. There are losses, but one almost forgets them in the dazzling glare of Ian McKellen's star Richard, crisply supported by a large and skilful team. Here, Richard's differently-abledness takes the form of galloping alopecia and stiff left limbs, compensated by a prehensile right hand that does tricks no less hypnotically fascinating than Antony Sher's famous spider-crutches. McKellen's demise is extended into one-legged ballet of a rare virtuoso order. This Richard in his time plays many parts, starting with the grim, self-regarding persona of some Second World War Generalissimo - rendered with such fruity gruffness that even from the fifth row I had to fill in some lines from memory. Little by little, the tics and twitches begin to seem generated from some desperate inner stress. Where Olivier wielded a monstrous glamour and played teasingly with his various prey, McKellen offers a brilliant solo study: it exerts an implacable grip, but reduces the other characters to abject, terrorised victims. They do what they can, but until the interval the audience responded to all their griefs as to black comedy. We were intrigued, not moved. There was no perverse erotic spark in Richard's wooing of Lady Anne (Anastasia Hille), and for Buckingham the prescribed Establishment mutter dampened Terence Rigby's solid, wary grandee. Only later, when the royal ladies went splendidly into passionate-denunciation mode, did we begin to feel for the losers. On the final scenes, Peter Darling's Richmond who will be Henry VII  -bestows a dewy sitcom sweetness that shifts the action fast-forward into the 1980s. Lyttelton Theatre, to May 26</p>

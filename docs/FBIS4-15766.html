			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" program: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The main purpose of a recent tete-a-tete meeting  between Moldovan President Mircea Snegur and the leader of the  Republic's separatist mainly Russian-speaking region of  Dniester, Igor Smirnov, was "to provide conditions for  negotiations on the status of the Dniester Region," said  Snegur's adviser Nicolae Osmochescu. In an exclusive interview  with INTERFAX, Osmochescu said the two leaders had also dealt  with a set of economic and financial problems, such as reviving  ties between enterprises in Moldova and Dniester and restoring  destroyed communications.    Osmochescu said Snegur and Smirnov had agreed that the talks  should be based on a report by a mission of the Conference on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), which proposes  extensive autonomy for Dniester, implying the separation of  powers between central authority in Kishinyov [Chisanau] and the  Dniester government, Dniester's exclusive jurisdiction over  certain matters and joint jurisdiction over others.    The adviser said Snegur and Smirnov had decided that all  future negotiations would be mediated by the CSCE mission and  Russian representatives. They also agreed that, at the next  meeting, Moldova and Dniester should be represented by  delegations rather than by their two leaders and that teams of  experts should be formed to draw up a package of accords, mainly  an agreement on Dniester's legal status.    Smirnov congratulated Snegur on the ratification by the  Moldovan Parliament of Moldova's membership in the CIS and in  the Commonwealth Economic Union, Osmochescu said. IF Note: The  ratification was welcomed both by Dniester and by Gagauzia,  another independent-minded region in Moldova. Dniester State  Secretary Valeriy Litskay told INTERFAX it made possible a new  dialogue between Moldova and Dniester, and at a new level too.  The leaders of Gagauzia, where the majority of the population  speaks Gagauz, a Turkic language, take the same view. According  to its president, Stepan Topal, Gagauzia, which unilaterally  proclaimed itself a republic, has been pressing for the  ratification of Moldova's membership in the CIS and its economic  union for the last two years. Topal told INTERFAX he expected  the policy of the Agrarian Democratic and Socialist Parties,  which the last general elections brought into power, to provide  a good basis for resuming Gagauz-Moldovan talks and putting it  at a new level.    Osmochescu said the meeting between Snegur and Smirnov had  been held in "favorable and constructive atmosphere" and had  been marked by "both sides' desire to throw off the old burden  of mutual resentment and base their decisions on today's  reality." The meeting broke the deadlock in the talks between  Moldova and Dniester, Osmochescu believes.    "Now everything depends on the level of the teams formed to  draw up the package of documents. It is important that the  people who are included in them should also wish to break the  impasse. The delegations appointed by Dniester in the past were  doing their best to obstruct the negotiations by casuistical  disputes," Osmochescu said.    He said the Dniester side agreed that the teams should  include new, realistically-minded politicians ready for  "reasonable compromise." Provided Dniester was willing to  cooperate, the talks could be completed within the next six  months, Osmochescu said. "I see two alternative solutions to  the problem. The first one is to pass a law on the legal status  of Dniester before the Moldovan constitution is adopted. Then  the law would be incorporated into the constitution. The other  is to formalize a special status for Dniester in the  constitution," Osmochescu said, adding that he favored the  former option.</p>

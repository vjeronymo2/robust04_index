			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / April public sector borrowing requirement biggest since 1987 THE public sector borrowing requirement for April was Pounds 3.6bn, including privatisation proceeds of Pounds 0.6bn. That is the biggest April deficit since 1987. The figure was slightly lower than expected but economists warned that Britain was still heading for a record deficit in fiscal 1992-93. Most expect the PSBR in the new financial year - which started last month - to reach Pounds 30bn.</p>

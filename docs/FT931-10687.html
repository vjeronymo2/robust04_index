			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Arts: Stars shine out in Sundance - David D'Arcy finds all Hollywood in Park City, Utah, talent spotting at the film festival TONY Chan shot his first feature film, Combination Platter, in his parents' Chinese restaurant in Queens, New York for Dollars 200,000. The unsentimental film has no stars - the lead is a fulltime stockbroker - and its humour hinges on an Asian-American's perspective, but the 24-year-old Chan has already been approached by three distributors interested in his movie, and by Hollywood agents interested in him. Dozens of Hollywood talent agents and studio executives crowded into the Utah mountain town Park City last month, viewing everything from the playwright Sam Shepherd's debut as a film director to two filmmakers' grim home movie of their own deterioration from AIDS. Why was Hollywood in Park City? The studio people were among the 5000 film makers, producers and others at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival, an event created so that film makers working outside the Hollywood system could see each other's films. Now Hollywood cannot afford not to be here to tap this talent pool. This year's awards reflect the festival's range. Ruby in Paradise, about a young woman who flees a backward Appalachia for a Florida resort, shared the dramatic feature Jury prize with Public Access, the tale of a handsome stranger turned psychokiller in a typical American town. Documentary awards went to Silverlake Life and to Children of Fate: Life and Death in a Sicilian Family, about three generations of poverty in a now-leveled Palermo slum. Twelve years ago the actor Robert Redford took over a foundering film festival here, and developed the Sundance Institute alongside it, to incubate and promote the work of young screenwriters outside the narrow confines of the studios. The festival accomplished that quietly, introducing David Lynch, Wayne Wang and Jim Jarmusch, among others, to sympathetic critics and distributors. It was after one young director's first film called sex, lies and videotape charmed Park City in 1989 and went on to take in more than Dollars 60 million at the box office that Hollywood began to pay attention. Attendance has risen 30 per cent a year since. Critics located the promise of American cinema there more than a decade ago, and now the box office is confirming that judgment. The big studios' growing emphasis on high budget blockbusters has also driven more modest ones into independents' hands. Actors in search of challenging roles are natural allies. The term 'independent film' has become hard to define: the Hollywood 'independent' producer's Dollars 10-million movie now shows alongside the Dollars 25,000 gay road odyssey at Sundance. Still, if the festival's mission has been to take independent films beyond their perennial art house audience, then Sundance has been a success. A dozen films from last year's festival had national releases, among them Errol Morris's documentary biography of Stephen Hawking, A Brief History of Time, and Reservoir Dogs, the bloody heist film debut of Quontin Tarantino. At least another dozen will get into theatres this year. Besides Combination Platter, the 1993 feature competition included Twenty Ducks, a picaresque link of vignettes focusing on a twenty-dollar bill changing hands over the course of several days in Los Angeles. Like many American independent films, this was a twist on a well-worn story. The Spanish-language Texan film El Mariachi offered its own version of the gangster theme, when an itinerant musician in a border town finds drug dealers' guns in his guitar case. El Mariachi's 24 year-old director, Robert Rodriguez, has been hired by Columbia Pictures to direct a higher priced remake of his own script. Columbi has also bought his next screenplay. Along with the work of precocious novices, Sundance also screened films by veterans such as Victor Nunez, of Tallahassee, Florida, who helped start the independent film movement more than 20 years ago. Nunez's Ruby in Paradise follows a young woman adjusting to strange surroundings with a slow, meandering pace that an impatient studio would want to accelerate. Curiously, Hollywood is now courting the director who turned his back on its way of telling a story. The competition also presented Boxing Helena, the debut of Jennifer Chambers Lynch, the 24-year-old daughter of David Lynch. Not surprisingly, Ms Lynch's lushly shot drama deals with a case of obsession: a respected surgeon's desire for a petulant vixen who despises him. Madonna was the first choice; but Sherilynn Fenn ended up in the part, alongside Julian Sands as the doctor. The two approach their roles in earnest, but the audiences seemed amused rather than terrified, even as the lovestruck surgeon performed a series of mutilations on Ms Fenn. Ms Lynch's film was not the only one at Sundance to be haunted by her father's presence. Other offerings featured bizarre 'stranger in town' characters who turn out to be psychopaths or angry young men with guns at the ready. This twentysomething generation has already been dubbed the year's emerging trend. Others fault that group for exploiting sheer strangeness or violence to gain attention, with screenwriting only an afterthought. Sundance's strength this year lay in its documentary competition. Leading the field was Nick Broomfield's response to America's mania for publicising appalling crimes, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer. Wuornos is a former Florida prostitute condemned to death for killing seven male clients. Wuornos claims self-defence, but the media have branded her 'America's first female serial killer.' Her notoriety proved to be an asset. The police had sought to sell the film rights to her story even before they arrested her. Also cashing in are a woman who had adopted Wuornos; and Wuornos' lawyer, an obese former rock musician who advised her to plead no-contest. Both of them are paid on-camera for arranging interviews for Broomfield. Not all the Sundance documentaries were so serious. Some were even fictional, such as the satirical rap 'mockumentary' NWH: Fear of a Black Hat by Rusty Cundieff. NWH stands for Niggas With Hats, a parody of the controversial group 'NWA,' 'Niggas With Attitude.' Fear of a Black Hat targets rap's notorious misogyny and its mania for 'badness.' Some real rappers have said that they have been stereotyped negatively by the 28-year-old Cundieff, a comedian who wrote the screenplay, directed, and stars as the belligerent rapper Ice Cold. As a first-time black independent filmmaker, Cundieff fits the Sundance profile. He also breaks it, since Fear of a Black Hat could emerge as a mass-audience hit, like the earlier movie it parodies, This is Spinal Tap. With diversity in independent film comes conflict. Young filmmakers bristle at charges that they are selling out, becoming 'Hollywood directors for hire'. Women filmmakers attack the violence that new directors often use as a trademark, and racial minorities and homosexuals clamour for equal time. With technology's expansion of low-budget filmmaking, this splintering is a natural development. It suggests that Sundance has fulfilled its mission. But the needs of Hollywood itself for ideas and talent may end up sustaining the festival.</p>

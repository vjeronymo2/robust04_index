			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Setback for CU shares THE IMPACT of last Saturday's bomb explosion continued to reverberate in the City as Commercial Union shares fell sharply on the disclosure that the insurer has not taken out reinsurance cover for terrorist attacks on its pre-1993 policies. CU said yesterday that it was lead insurer for the NatWest Tower and for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking building. 'CU has scored a rather spectacular own goal,' said one leading insurance analyst. The company is thought by insurance specialists to be liable for losses greater than the Pounds 15m it paid out for the bomb damage caused by an IRA attack in the City of London last year. Analysts are expected to cut current year profits estimates for CU by between Pounds 30m and Pounds 50m, although the latter figure is seen as a worst case figure. On Monday, the composite sector gave ground, but more on the overall market decline than any worries about Saturday's bomb, which dealers then believed would have only limited impact on the insurers. Following the 1992 bomb attack in the City, the insurance companies set up Pool Re, a mutual reinsurance company, to manage a joint terrorism fund. CU dropped 15 to 593p yesterday, although turnover was an unspectacular 1.4m shares.</p>

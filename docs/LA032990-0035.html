			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOST STILL OPTING FOR THE QUICK HEALTH FIX  </P> <P> Sick of oat bran, but worried about eating "healthy?"  </P> <P> Nancy Wellman, president of the American Dietetic Assn. in Chicago, says  Americans want to believe they have entered the age of hyper-nutrition.  However, she says, there are no quick fixes -- and no magic foods.  </P> <P> A recent Gallup survey commissioned by the American Dietetic Assn. and the Food  Information Council, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., says  95% of Americans believe balance, variety and moderation are the keys to  healthy eating.  </P> <P> "The poll shows Americans know about nutrition and health," Wellman said, "but  when it comes to translating facts into food choices, most still opt for quick  fixes and the latest health fads."  </P> <P> For example, 52% of adults reported increasing consumption of oat bran, and 48%  said they were using more vitamin supplements.  </P> <P> Yet when asked if they were increasing anything else in their diet due to  health concerns, only 8% reported eating more vegetables, and only 6% said they  were consuming more fruits or fruit juices.  </P> <P> Results of the Gallup survey were announced at a press conference here. The  survey results were based on telephone interviews with a randomly selected  national sample of 772 adults, 18 years of age and older.  </P> <P> Sixty-seven percent of the survey respondents said they believe there are  "good" and "bad" foods.  </P> <P> Thomas Stenzel, executive director of the Food Information Council, says the  perception of "good" and "bad" food leads consumers to "needlessly eliminate"  foods they perceive as bad -- including red meat and dairy products.  </P> <P> Wellman says red meat is a valuable source of iron; dairy foods are an  important source of calcium.  </P> <P> "In searching for the 'perfect' food, many people lose sight of the big  picture," Wellman says. "What's important is the nutritional adequacy of the  total diet over time, not whether individual foods are 'good' or 'bad' in terms  of fat or other nutrients."  </P> <P> Dr. Margo Denke, a nutrition research scientist at the University of Texas  Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, says that despite an awareness of basic  nutrition principles, many consumers seem to view food as medicine.  </P> <P> "They think adding or eliminating a particular food or ingredient will  automatically prevent or cure illness," she said. "Such an approach is not only  unrealistic, it can also prove harmful."  </P> <P> Denke said that while nutrition research must examine the effects of nutrients  individually, such studies should not be immediately translated into food  choices.  </P></p>

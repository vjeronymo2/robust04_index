			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives markets played a significant role in undermining share prices yesterday as a large investment institution finally unwound a large OTC, or over the counter trade, writes Terry Byland. The complex deal involved 30 stocks and was arranged by the institution some weeks ago when it bought both put and call options, on the view that the market would remain within a narrow range until the year-end. This investment fund, caught out by the December upsurge in the Footsie, had covered itself by buying heavily into the Footsie March contract. OTC deals are one-off trades arranged between the securities firm and a client and yesterday saw the final unwinding of some Pounds 4bn of such deals. The March future traded actively, recording 13,257 contracts and falling from an opening of 3,500 to 3,437 before a final quotation of 3,447. At the close, the premium stood around its fair value premium of 18 points, but had dipped to 10 points against cash earlier. Business in traded options, at 28,096, compared with 33,456 on Wednesday. The FT-SE contract, however, remained active, 15,307 deals against 15,073. Among individual contracts, the Euro FT-SE was busy, recording 1,357 contracts. HSBC topped the list of individual company options as the shares responded to the strength in Hong Kong. In Shell, (873) a trader bought back January calls and sold April calls. Focus on retail prospects saw Marks &amp; Spencer busy (806) and Royal Insurance, BP and National Power appeared to feature in the OTC deals.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1550 GMT on 11 April carries the  "We" magazine program presented by Vladimir Pozner, in which  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev answers questions from a  studio audience. Pozner begins by asking Grachev why he thinks  young people are generally so unwilling to join the Army.  Grachev answers that the country's political leaders have  changed their attitudes to the Army and the Army has been left  to fend for itself. Second, the Army has "opened up" and all  the Army's troubles are known to everyone. The Russian Army is  still a young one -- only two years old next month. When he  became defense minister, Grachev says, the first thing he felt  was that the legislative base of the Army had to be changed. He  points out the moral and physical attributes required to serve  in the Army. Pozner then opens the discussion to the floor.    A young man asks why an Army is needed in a country where  "three main chiefs gathered together and destroyed a single  state at Belovezhskaya Pushcha" [reference to meeting in Brest  between President Boris Yeltsin, Belarusian Supreme Soviet  Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich, and Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk announced the end of the USSR], and why, contrary to  the law, it is trying to recruit students from the new  humanitarian university? Grachev replies that the Army is an  instrument of the state and its main job is to ensure the  security of the state. As far as students are concerned, they  are called up only from places that do not have military  departments.    Pozner then asks: "Pavel Sergeyevich, does the Defense  Ministry give recommendations on the call-up? In particular,  did you present your point of view to anyone?"    Grachev replies: "You... [pauses] Many people are acquainted  with the law on defense. The former Supreme Soviet adopted a  law on defense in which it determined the strength of the Armed  Forces, which, it said, should comprise one percent of the  overall population. At the present moment we have about 150  million. That means we must have an Army of 1.5 million. And  where do we get it from? Here's a simple example. The spring  call-up is now upon us. We have 1,472,000 young people subject  to military law. In order to bring the Army's strength up to  about 78 percent, in such a way that the units are operationally  efficient, in this call-up we need to recruit a minimum of  500,000 men, not taking other departments into account. We have  come to the conclusion that this spring we can recruit not only  for the Armed Forces but also for all other departments only  216,000 men. That's the second reason, and, naturally we are  making recommendations."    Grachev is asked next whether a Russian citizen has the  right  to serve outside Russian territory. He says yes, in accordance  with a Supreme Soviet decision, he has such a right if he  expresses such a personal wish after six months' service, in  consultation with his parents.    Grachev clarifies his remark earlier about the Russian Army  being only two years old; it has hundreds of years of previous  history. A woman representing a group of servicemen's mothers  wonders about the cost of the best brains of our young people.  This is very high, he says, and a young man's profession is  strictly taken into account when he is called up.    Answering charges of discrimination against Muslims in the  Army, Grachev says this is indeed a problem, and it has become  especially evident over the past year. An agreement was  concluded with the Orthodox Church that Muslims should be able  to confer with priests of both churches prior to call-up. As  far as their diet is concerned, that's another matter that is  virtually impossible to solve.    Grachev assures another young man that reductions in the  Army  are not a whim of the defense minister or the military command.  "Anyone who follows what I do closely knows that I am in favor,  at least, of an Army of 2.1 million. At the moment we have 2.3  million. This is the optimal composition of an Army that can  work and defend its fatherland." He goes on: "We are conducting  a planned discharge of the officer corps, first and foremost  those who have served 20 years or more and are entitled to a  pension; second, those officers and warrant officers who have  unblemished records -- and there are quite a number of them;  and, third, those officers and warrant officers who have simply  not got used to present-day conditions, i.e. those people who  still carry political views and support certain political  parties and currents. We have pursued another path. The Army  has been depoliticized and de-ideologized and it's job is to  defend its fatherland and not to serve one particular party, of  whatever hue. Unfortunately, it is proving difficult to solve  this question at the moment."    Pozner recalls that Grachev said that he believes the ideal  strength to be 2.1 million. "That is more than one percent of  the population." "Of course", Grachev replies. Pozner goes on,  "You consider that one percent is a small amount?" Grachev  points out that people forget that Western countries are highly  developed and their strategic position is different from that of  Russia with its huge area, and, therefore, to guarantee the  country's security with just one percent of the population is  not enough.    A questioner from Volgograd complains about the waste of  life  and lack of justice in the Army. Pozner interrupts with some  statistics on deaths in the Army: In 1994, about 2,500 people  have died for various reasons. Grachev agrees, people are being  killed. "The statistics are these -- first, your figures are  insufficient. If you want to be objective, in 1993 1,349 people  were killed or died. Fifty percent of those died as a result of  auto, air, and other disasters. Something like 25 percent took  their own lives, about 20 percent lost their lives during  exercises or servicing combat equipment," and another 2 percent  died as a result of bullying.    Answering a question about pacifism, Grachev believes this  is  an "anti-state" matter. To another question he regrets that  some people who have the money are able to buy themselves out.    Pozner presents video clips with the voice-over pointing out  apathy and lack of discipline in the Army and delay in paying  wages. The video shows men operating tanks, on patrol, on naval  vessels, etc. Pozner says he is disheartened by what he hears  and asks Grachev if there is a way out of these difficulties.    "The way out is there if our elected deputies and our  leaders  in the government correctly realize that the Army is not  striving for ideals and is not asking for money just for its own  needs. Let the viewers understand that the Armed Forces still  pays for 60 percent of the overall number of Russia's  enterprises. We are financing the staff of military factories.  Therefore, our sums are realistic, and I emphasize again that  the sum now being discussed and endorsed is clearly insufficient  even to maintain servicemen's pay and the wages of its  employees."    Regarding another question from Pozner about reductions in  the Army, Grachev reminds him that it costs much more to lose an  officer than to it does to keep him on. Grachev then supplies  figures about the number of women serving in the Army. He  discusses with Pozner the number of female defense ministers in  the world -- in fact there are only two.    Pozner winds up the program with a series of brief  questions.  Grachev replies: He supports a professional army in principle,  but it would need a huge budget, and: He would prefer that the  Defense Ministry be engaged in purely political administrative  functions, but we are so used to it being run by the military  that we are not yet ready for a civilian minister.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Warning on civil service hiring Sir Robin Butler, head of the home civil service, yesterday gave a lukewarm response to calls for making top civil service jobs open to the public. Appearing before the Commons Treasury and civil service committee, Sir Robin welcomed the call in an Efficiency Unit report this week for more open competition for top civil service jobs but said the process might be expensive and cause delays in filling posts. He opposed advertising all top civil service jobs automatically, arguing that the search for outside candidates could be a difficult process. He said that the expense and delays of advertising were 'trivial questions if you want to make sure you get the best person for the job', but he added that if the minister and the prime minister were satisfied that within the system they had the person they wanted to do the job, he saw no reason for delay and expense of hiring someone from outside. Sir Robin praised many of the Efficiency Unit recommendations. He said his overall vision of the civil service was of one 'smaller than it is today' with many functions delegated to operating agencies. 'There are functions which it will not be possible to put out to the private sector - defence, areas of tax collection and so on,' he said. 'But, other than that, there are no no-go areas where it is not reasonable to look at what serves the public the best.' Questioned about why targets for the amount of market testing to be carried out by the government this year had not been achieved, he said the original targets had been far too ambitious, but it was always necessary to set ambitious goals for this kind of programme. Sir Robin's comments came as Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, warned that commercialisation of the civil service was threatening many of its core values. He said the drive for greater efficiency was laudable, but it had not been complemented by the constitutional changes needed to ensure good government. As a result basic values such as the unity of the service and the ethical principles governing the behaviour of ministers and officials were being undermined. Above all, he said, the changes were destroying the fundamental principle of ministerial accountability and responsibility. The government was 'creating administrative black holes of responsibility where effective accountability needs to be'.</p>

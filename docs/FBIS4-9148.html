			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mustafa Kurtovic from Gorazde] </F>   [Excerpts] The latest information from the outskirts, with  which contact was lost, is that the situation in Vitkovici is  dramatic. Yesterday alone, 11 civilians, six of them children  under 10, were seriously wounded. They were wounded in attacks  by portable rocket launchers and tanks from (Dilje) hill. These  people cannot be helped, as the road to Vitkovici is completely  cut off. They cannot be brought to the hospital or the medical  center. The situation in the city center resembles the worst  scene from a horror film. [passage omitted]    We have also just received information from the official  bodies that Maljutka guided missiles have hit the prison camp  with 22 captured members of the fascist army. Six captured  chetniks have been killed and eight seriously wounded in this  barbaric attack. We have also received information from the  clinic that 19 of our citizens have been wounded by sniper fire  so far. Two of them, Milinkovic Dusan and his wife, have died,  despite being given urgent aid.</p>

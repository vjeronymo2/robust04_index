			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 23 (XINHUA) -- China's investment  funds have been expanded from a mere two in 1991 to over 60 at  present.    These funds have raised more than 800 billion yuan so far,  and about 30 of them have been listed on the stock exchanges at  Shanghai and Shenzhen.    Experts here agree that the rapid development of China's  investment funds is an outcome of the current reform of the  banking system.    Being a new financial instrument, the investment funds will  play an important role in stabilizing the securities market, and  in the reform of the capital market and investment system,  according to the experts.    The investment funds have invested 40 percent of their  capital in securities and the rest in real estate and economic  entities.    At present, about 200 investment funds with a combined  amount  of capital of 30 billion yuan are waiting for approval from the  People's Bank of China (the central bank), which is working out  regulations on investment funds.</p>

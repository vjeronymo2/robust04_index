			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by economics correspondent Robert Garran and </F> George Megalogenis entitled: "Cook Pictures Aggressive Push Into  World Market"]    [Text] Australia is moving into a new era in industry  policy aimed at pushing the nation into the global economy  instead of providing help for particular industries, according  to the Minister for Industry, Science, and Technology, Senator  Cook. "In the last 10 years, we have been inward-looking,  removing impediments and opening out our economy," Senator Cook  told THE AUSTRALIAN yesterday in his first extended interview  since taking over the portfolio in January. "The next 10 years  is understanding the marketplace we're in, and being flexible  enough to adapt to it and take advantage of it." For the first  time, Senator Cook spelled out a detailed framework for the  industry statement that will be part of the White Paper on  employment to be delivered by the prime minister, Mr Keating, on  May 4.    The statement will have two broad goals: to boost the  competitiveness of local industry and to improve access to  international markets. Cutting tariffs had largely forced  industries trading in world markets to become competitive. In  the non-traded goods sector, the important issues were  micro-economic reform and competition policy, Senator Cook said.  The agreement by the States to expose their business  enterprises to more competition, by agreeing to the Hilmer  report recommendations, was crucial in spurring micro-economic  reform at a State level, he said.    The other important way to boost competition was to address  the question of access to finance by small and medium-sized  companies. "There will always be a fairly clamorous argument  between the providers of finance and the seekers of finance,"  Senator Cook said. While the banks had all said they would do  better by lending to small and medium-sized business the system  could be improved. While he would not give details it is  believed a package of finance measures will be a key part of the  industry statement. It is expected to include an education  campaign for both lenders and borrowers to overcome the  traditional reliance on lending against assets without  considering lending against cash flow, as well as improvements  to pooled development funds and infrastructure bonds and more  relaxed rules for direct bank investment in companies. Changes  are also expected to enhance the role of the Commonwealth  Development Bank which provides venture finance capital for  small business.    Senator Cook also foreshadowed improvements to research and  development incentives -- now a 150 per cent tax write-off.  "There is a case for the Government to investigate how it  encourages that investment to come sooner and quicker, in higher  technology, in computer-aided manufacture, and to develop the  necessary networks in industry in the small to medium-sized  companies, to encourage them to embrace that with a bit more  confidence," he said. The Government was still considering  whether to give incentives to multinational firms to set up  regional headquarters in Australia. Senator Cook outlined a  two-pronged strategy to boost industry access to foreign  markets: improved access to advice from Austrade and on other  government schemes and bodies, and a bigger effort, after  completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, to reach  bilateral trade agreements, especially with Asian countries. It  was also important for Australia to encourage both China and  Taiwan to join the new World Trade Organization, he said.  Senator Cook's strategy builds on the past decade, when  industry policy was dominated by former industry minister Mr  John Button, whose chief goal was to manage the dismantling of  the tariff wall around Australian industry.</p>

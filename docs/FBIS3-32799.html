			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Costa Rican President-elect Jose Maria </F> Figueres Olsen in San Jose, Costa Rica, by Jacobo Zabludovsky  from the XEW Television studios in Mexico City; from the "24  Hours" newscast -- live relay]    [Text] [Zabludovsky] Good evening, Mr. Figueres.    [Figueres] Good evening, Don Jacobo. It is nice to say hello  to you.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you very much. Congratulations on your  victory. What do you hope to accomplish in Costa Rica?    [Figueres] Thank you. I greatly appreciate your kind words.  Ahead of me I have the clear responsibility to fight poverty --  the main problem we face as a country -- in two areas. One is  the impoverishment process suffered by our middle class, the  backbone of our democratic system and our national production.  The other area in which we need to fight poverty is the poverty  and extreme poverty some sectors of our population are living in.    [Figueres] Jose Maria, you are the son of someone who was a  great friend of mine -- the three times Costa Rican President  Don Jose Figueres, whom I remember very fondly. He also tried  to end poverty in Costa Rica and was unsuccessful. What are  your plans to accomplish this?    [Figueres] Don Jacobo, I believe this is an endless  struggle,  and there are always new wars to wage. The important thing is  to persevere. The important thing is to have the social  awareness, to admit that Costa Rica has been successful in many  fields because we have always been a country united in  solidarity. Costa Rica should not lose our fatherland's  solidarity in the face of modernizing and integrating into the  world economy. We have indeed advanced toward globalization  since 1982, during the administration of Don Luis Alberto Monge,  but we want to be able to participate in the world economy in a  much more intelligent way -- a way in which we can offer the  benefits of this integration to all sectors of our society and  not only to a select few.    [Zabludovsky] Do you intend to seek admittance into NAFTA?    [Figueres] We are very pleased that NAFTA has been ratified.  We believe this is a great step forward in the integration of  our economies by the signatory countries. To us, it also  represents a challenge, because the truth of the matter is that  we have the impression that NAFTA places us at a relative  disadvantage in attracting the foreign investment our country  needs, as well as in the competitiveness of our products,  especially within the U.S. market.    We believe the countries that have signed NAFTA are not very  willing to increase the number of participants until they first  see the effect the treaty has on their own economies. I believe  that in Central America and in the Caribbean we have the  responsibility of seeking the understanding of Mexico, the  United States, and Canada to enable the Caribbean Basin  Initiative, which has benefited our economies, to offer us the  same options and opportunities available to members of NAFTA.  This would allow us to continue strengthening our economies and  to give greater support to the very positive political changes  we have seen in this area these past few years.    [Zabludovsky] Mr. Figueres, Central America and the  Caribbean are now somewhat quiet but not completely quiet. Some  40 years ago your father abolished the Army in Costa Rica and  gave your country a distinct image in the area. Do you not fear  Costa Rica might be contaminated by nearby unrest?    [Figueres] No sir, not at all. We abolished the Army 45  years ago. This has allowed our country to invest in health,  education, infrastructure, and telecommunications by way of a  series of programs that have brought much well-being to Costa  Rica. Costa Rica respects the domestic decisions of every  country. We will also always be at the head of human rights  causes and will be prepared to contribute as much as possible to  a greater peace and calm in the Central American region. This  can lead to a reduction of military budgets and to the  apportionment of those resources to social programs.    [Zabludovsky] As president-elect you now have a different  function and you must prepare your programs in ways different  from the way you prepared them when you were a candidate. You  will be sworn in on 8 May. What will you be doing from now  until then, basically?    [Figueres] We outlined a very clear platform during our  campaign. Our government commitment is to fulfill what we  promised during the campaign. We are returning to a policy that  gives prominence to domestic matters.    Economic and social concerns are two sides of the same coin.  This requires looking not only at macroeconomic projects, which  are important for the country's development, attracting foreign  investments, and encouraging domestic investment, but also at  microeconomic policies to encourage production among the  national sectors that have lagged behind in recent years.    In the social field, this means investing more on health  care, an area in which we have good services but still need to  improve the quality of the services. There is a need for more  investments in health care. There is much to be done to improve  the quality of education, at both the primary school and  higher-education, or university, levels.    I am saying this because our country wants to return to the  path of sustained mid- and long-term development. We are going  to make the government aware of the fact that our responsibility  is not only to adopt day-to-day decisions, which of course are  important and are a function of the government, but we also have  the responsibility of directing our country and our society  toward mid- and long-term objectives. This type of development  must be sustained not only to preserve our natural resources and  environment, which are new aspects that we must consider while  engaging in national production and day-to-day life, but also to  preserve and improve human life, which is after all, the  objective of all of our policies.    Costa Rica wants to join the international economy and to  compete on the basis of technology, quality, productivity, and  efficiency, not on the basis of workers being paid low salaries.  This kind of integration requires more investments in education.    [Zabludovsky] One last comment, perhaps the last question,  Jose Maria: I met your father for the first time in 1956, which  was also the first time I interviewed him. How old were you  then?    [Figueres] I was two.    [Zabludovsky] Fine. At that time he was a unique person in  Latin American politics, especially in Caribbean policies,  because he was a civilian who enjoyed much prestige in an area  where people like Fulgencio Batista and Anastasio Somoza were  presidents. In that respect, your father was an odd-ball. He  had no bodyguards and no fear, and he abolished the Army while  others in other places were upgrading and strengthening their  armies. My question is this: What did you inherit, personally  and politically, from Pepe Figueres?    [Figueres] I am proud of my father and of my name. From him  I learned to love the fatherland. I have that in my heart. I  also learned how to value people for what they are and not for  how much they have. I learned that work, regardless of how  humble it might be, brings honor. With regard to public life, I  learned that if one is going to engage in public life, one must  do it to serve others, not to serve oneself.    With these principles and ideals in mind, I have  participated  in politics and will participate in our forthcoming  administration.    [Zabludovsky] Thank you, Jose Maria. I wish you success in  governing that grand country of yours: Costa Rica.    [Figueres] Thank you, Jacobo. Good night.    [Zabludovsky] Good night.</p>

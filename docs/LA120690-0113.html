			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: MOORPARK;  </P> <P> PLANNERS OK ZONING CHANGE FOR SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Moorpark Planning Commission has approved a proposal to amend the city's  zoning code to allow child day-care centers and schools to operate in  industrial and commercial zones.  </P> <P> Commissioner Glen Schmidt said Monday he wanted to commend Moorpark for opening  opportunities for child care in the city's industrial areas.  </P> <P> "Whenever we can accommodate young folk trying to make ends meet . . . Moorpark  is taking steps in that direction. I think it's a hell of a good plan."  </P> <P> Previously, the city required a conditional use permit for child day-care  facilities in industrial or commercial zones. Now, those facilities can operate  under a different permit that is easier to obtain.  </P> <P> The Moorpark City Council initiated the zoning code amendment because the  previous code did not allow for the operation of schools in industrial zones,  and there is an industrial business in town that funds a school on-site for  employees' children. GT Water Products Inc. school serves 12 students from  kindergarten through 7th grade.  </P> <P> In addition, the council did not want businesses discouraged from providing  either day care or school facilities for their employees due to a long and  costly permit process.  </P> <P> Recently, the Moorpark Unified School District bought property in an industrial  park to build a new continuation high school.

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / BCCI official sentenced to six years for fraud MR SYED ALI AKBAR, the former Bank of Credit and Commerce International official who admitted frauds involving more than Dollars 745m connected with the bank's collapse, was yesterday sentenced to six years in prison. However the former head of BCCI's treasury division is likely to be released after serving only 12 to 18 months. Mr Justice Scott, at the Old Bailey, ordered that the two years he had already spent in French and British jails be taken into account. The judge also told Mr Akbar that he was reducing his sentence considerably following the banker's decision to co-operate with Serious Fraud Office investigators and to plead guilty to 16 charges of false accounting. This meant the prospect of another enormously expensive 'mega-trial' had been avoided, he said. If Mr Akbar had been convicted after pleading innocent he could have expected a sentence of between 10 and 11 years. Mr Justice Scott told him: 'You have pleaded guilty to an international fraud on a massive scale between 1982 and 1986. You were the chief architect of the bogus deployment of millions and millions and millions of dollars.' Mr Akbar was not responsible for all BCCI's financial problems but the bank's eventual collapse cast a shadow over the whole banking world, he said. 'The losers included not only the big battalions of banks, insurance companies and local authorities but individuals and small businesses, and for some of them the loss was fatal - that's what makes it so serious.' Although Mr Akbar stands to be released from prison after 12 to 18 months, it is likely he will be immediately re-arrested and made to face further charges in the US. He has already been indicted in Tampa, Florida, over allegations that he laundered money stolen from the Panamanian National Guard by the country's former head of state, President Noriega. The judge said Mr Akbar had personally gained or misused Dollars 61m of BCCI depositors' funds - money which he used to set up Capcom, a futures dealing company which handled most of the bank's dealing business. Investigations were unable to establish whether Mr Akbar had hidden any money for future use. According to Capcom records, all money was lost through Mr Akbar's unsuccessful dealing.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Creditors in O&amp;Y debt plan Citicorp, the US bank, and other US creditors of Olympia &amp; York Development's US subsidiary, have drawn up joint plans to increase their share of the troubled company's debt. The creditors' move to consolidate holdings of the unsecured debt of O&amp;Y's US subsidiary is seen as an attempt to strengthen their claim to the subsidiary's assets at the expense of unsecured creditors of the Canadian parent, including leading Canadian banks. Creditors of the Toronto-based parent company, which restructured under Canadian bankruptcy law last year, have looked to the US subsidiary as their best chance of recouping losses. In the latest move, Citicorp and Apollo Real Estate Investments, the New York-based property group run by Mr Leon Black, have agreed in principle to buy together some Dollars 65m of the US subsidiary's unsecured debt from Salomon Brothers, the investment bank. Salomon is understood to have acquired the debt when O&amp;Y USA defaulted on an interest rate swap contract struck in 1989. Before the latest move, Citicorp is believed to have held some Dollars 250m of the US subsidiary's unsecured debt. Apollo has steadily been buying other slices of the debt. O&amp;Y (USA) has been struggling for two years to renegotiate some Dollars 5bn of debt without resorting to the bankruptcy courts. It has made progress with plans for a settlement with creditors whose loans are secured on New York properties, but the restructuring has pitted unsecured creditors against each other.</p>

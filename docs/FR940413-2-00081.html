This award is made after a determination by the Department that a procedural error was made in processing applications under a HOPE 1 Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) published on October 6, 1992. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> for further information contact: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Gary Van Buskirk, Office of Resident Initiatives, Department of Housing and Urban Development, room 4112, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708&hyph;4233. To provide service for persons who are hearing- or speech-impaired, this number may be reached via TDD by dialing the Federal Information Relay Service on 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;TDDY, 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339, or 202&hyph;708&hyph;9300. (Telephone numbers, other than ``800'' TDD numbers, are not toll free.) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> supplementary information: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  After re-examining the procedures used to process applications submitted in response to a NOFA for the HOPE 1 program published on October 6, 1992, the Department has concluded that it made a ``procedural error'' with respect to one applicant. Section 415(b)(5) of the HOPE 1 Program Guidelines states: ``Procedural errors discovered after notification of approved applicants which, if corrected, would result in approval of an application which was not approved will be corrected by funding the application from any unused amounts or `off the top' from amounts available for implementation grants in the next funding round.'' HUD has determined that it made a procedural error in reviewing the HOPE 1 implementation grant application submitted by the New Community Corporation for a portion of the Hayes Homes public housing development in Newark, New Jersey. The Department established a minimum score in that competition by using the lowest score awarded to a funded application in the previous funding round. This minimum score disqualified the New Community Corporation from being funded in the competitive round.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon further examination, HUD concluded that it made an error in its method of establishing the minimum score, since New Community Corporation was rated on only eight selection criteria and the minimum score used was based upon applications rated under nine criteria. (New Community Corporation was only rated under eight criteria because it was the only eligible applicant in the funding round and the ninth criterion, which was intended to compare the cost-per-unit among multiple applicants, could not be applied in the case of a sole applicant competition.) Accordingly, HUD determined that in establishing the minimum score, it should have pro-rated the score awarded to the lowest funded application from the previous competitive round. Since New Community Corporation would have been eligible for funding but for HUD's failure to pro-rate the minimum score, it is funding New Community Corporation's application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Department will utilize unused amounts from appropriations for fiscal years 1992 through 1994 to fund the $24,882,854 awarded to the New Community Corporation as outlined below. The Department will allocate $9,592,854 from unused funds appropriated in fiscal years 1992&hyph;93 to fund a portion of the $24,882,854 that is being awarded to the New Community Corporation under this notice. The remaining $15,190,000 of the grant will be funded using amounts appropriated for the HOPE program in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  On August 2, 1993, the Department published a NOFA announcing the availability of $182,047,160 in funding for implementation grants for the HOPE 1 program (58 FR 41126). On September 1, 1993, the Department published an amendment to the NOFA increasing the funding being made available by $24,000,000 from $182,047,160 to $206,047,160 due to the conclusion of the processing of a reprogramming request (58 FR 46209). The funds were appropriated by the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139, approved October 28, 1991) and fiscal year 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992). In its fiscal year 1994 appropriations bill for HUD, Congress rescinded $45,000,000 from the amounts remaining available for the HOPE 1 program under the Department's fiscal year 1992 appropriation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;139) and $130,000,000 from the amounts remaining available under the Department's fiscal year 1993 appropriation (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389) for a total recision of $175,000,000 in the amount of funds made available under the previously published NOFA and amendment. On January 13, 1994, the Department published a second amendment to the August 2, 1993 NOFA decreasing the amount available by $175,000,000 from $206,047,160 to $31,047,160 (59 FR 1968). Of the $31,047,160 available under the NOFA, $9,692,854 will be used to fund a portion of the $24,882,854 that is being awarded to the New Community Corporation pursuant to this notice. The remainder of the grant will be funded using amounts appropriated for the HOPE program in 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993), Congress appropriated a combined total of $109,190,000 for the following programs: The HOPE for Public and Indian Housing Homeownership program (HOPE 1), the HOPE for Homeownership of Multifamily Units program (HOPE 2), the HOPE for Homeownership of Single Family Homes program (HOPE 3), and the HOPE for Youthbuild Program. In the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;211, approved February 12, 1994), $66,000,000 was rescinded from the $109,190,000 appropriated for fiscal year 1994, leaving $43,190,000. Of the $43,190,000 remaining subsequent to the rescission, the Department is allocating $15,190,000 to the HOPE 1 program. The entire HOPE 1 allocation of $15,190,000 will be utilized to fund the portion of the grant awarded to the New Community Corporation not funded using amounts available under the Fiscal Year 1992&hyph;93 appropriations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 29, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph Shuldiner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8896 Filed 4&hyph;12&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4210&hyph;33&hyph;M  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

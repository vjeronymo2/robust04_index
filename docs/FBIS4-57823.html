			<p>BFN     [Text] Some candidates for a clandestine trip were arrested  in Petit-Goave. Fifty Haitians, who were getting ready to embark  by boat to the Florida coast, were arrested by police. Those  people, mostly peasants, were brought before the court over the  weekend.    Members of the civilian mission went to the spot to  investigate this matter. It should be noted that this was the  first significant arrest of potential boat people since  provisional President Justice Emile Jonassaint's announcemnt of  his government's intention to suppress the departures of boat  people. Orders were given to representatives of the Haitian  justice system to apply the 17 November 1980 decree, punishing  authors and accomplices of efforts to organize clandestine trips  to foreign countries.    A clear upsurge in departures of Haitian boat people to the  Florida coast was observed during the past few weeks, following  the announcement by U.S. President Bill Clinton of a change in  the procedure of direct repatriation of Haitian refugees. They  must be authorized to seek political asylum in the United  States, on some U.S. ships, or in some other countries. These  new measures have not gone into effect yet, however.</p>

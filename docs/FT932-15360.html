			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Jobs: A case of the worst sort of ignorance - Stupidities that bedevil organisations in defiance of the best knowledge on how to run them WHY study stupidity? The Jobs column has lost count of how many times that question has been snorted at it in the five weeks since it last mentioned the Laws of Organisational Stupidity. The target of the challenges is not the laws themselves, as typified by Parkinson's First which states: Work expands to fill the time available. Everybody appears to be agreed that organisations the whole world over are bedevilled by problems that seem to fall into regularly recurring patterns. What is under challenge is my claim that such things are a fitting subject for study in schools of management, which a good many of the questioners think is somehow philosophically wrong. They argue that to focus educational attention on the said idiocies would be to accentuate the negative, whereas the purpose of schools is positive. They exist to study wise practice, not the ignorant sort, and that applies to management schools no less than to any others. Well, perhaps so if we make a certain assumption. It is that the ignorance leading to organisational stupidities amounts only to some people's failure to learn the knowledge that exists on how to avoid same, leaving them with a mental vacuum which could be filled with wisdom the schools possess. But I suspect the issue is really more complex, as depicted by the old Confucian jingle. He who knows, and knows he knows, he is a wise man - seek him. He who knows, and knows not he knows, he is asleep - wake him. He who knows not, and knows he knows not, he is a child - teach him. But he who knows not, and knows not he knows not, he is a fool - shun him. To my mind, the ignorance giving rise to the idiocies is mainly the last cited variety, the kind that's ignorant even of the fact that it is ignorance. It is not the case that management schools are the jingle's wise men needing simply to awaken sleepers and teach children. The problems persist in spite of the best knowledge anyone has of how to set up and run organisations. Hence all of us, the schools included, are the jingle's fools, which makes its advice to 'shun' them inapplicable. Unless we're to be bedevilled for ever, we have to break out of our purblind ignorance. The only way to do that is to stop proudly confining our educational attention to what we do know, and start humbly marking out what we don't know. And the only way to achieve that is to study the observable consequences as exemplified by the laws. But before proceeding farther, in case anybody here today was not in the congregation the last time they were mentioned, I had better again point out an important proviso about their character. They aren't like the law of gravity in being inviolable. They both can be and sometimes are broken, for the most part beneficially. What each one describes is merely a regularity: a type of unplanned happening seemingly too frequent to arise purely by chance. In that sense they are akin to another set of laws that do get studied in management schools - the laws of economics. Moreover, I wouldn't mind betting that the laws of organisational stupidity are at least as reliable as predictors of real-life events. Unfortunately, I haven't room to repeat all of the five I quoted last time. But since they included the first law formulated by the historian Professor Northcote Parkinson, who died in his 84th year on March 10, I will begin today's citations with his second. In his wording of the 1950s, it states: Expenditure rises to meet income. But in the light of later history, that might be optimistic. My guess is that, if tested in practice, the rule would prove to be that expenditure rises to overtake income. Whether or not that is so, the law is like the professor's first formulation in applying to individuals' private lives as well as in organisations - which is not always the case with the laws of stupidity. But another which operates at both levels is called Winkler's Twist because it was first revealed to me, as the laws' self-appointed codifier, by the British sociologist Jack Winkler. It states: Routine events stimulate only when they fail to occur. One illustration of its working is provided by the old mechanical alarm clock, whose owner slept peacefully while it went on ticking away loudly, but woke up if it stopped. The selfsame principle nevertheless has numerous ill effects in organisations, even though they are usually overlooked. Take for example incremental salary scales which, except for notional cost-of-living increases, tell employees what their pay is going to be for each of several years ahead. Since that reduces the future increments to routine events, Winkler's Twist rules that they cannot be motivating, or at least not in the positive sense as a reward. The only way to use the long-expected rises as a motivator is to refuse to pay them over, as a punishment. Fairly similar in its workings is the law defined by my FT colleague, Sally Selby. It too applies generally, albeit in social rather than individual activity, but has a more specific organisational form with wider bedevilling potential. An instance of its general aspect is the game Chinese Whispers in which a message is given to the first of a line of people, who then each pass what they think they heard to the next. The usual effect is enshrined by the old tale of the front-line officer's attempt to get 'Send reinforcements, we're going to advance' conveyed from mouth to mouth back to headquarters. It eventually arrived there as 'Send three-and-fourpence, we're going to a dance.' But the organisational law, Selby's Scrambler, states specifically that Myths about a chief's wishes multiply with each link in the chain of command. The chilling implication, of course, is that even if the said chief doesn't intend to send any message in the first place, the law is still apt to do its evil work. Witness the following incident reported by a big-company middle manager a while ago to the Harvard Business School's eminent Rosabeth Moss Kanter: 'There are courtiers around the top guys, telling them what they want to hear, flattering them. For example, there was a luncheon with some board members. The vice-chairman mentioned that he was looking for a car for his daughter. A courtier thought: 'We'll take care of it'. He went down the line, and someone in purchasing had to spend half a day doing this. The guy who had to do it resented it, so he became antagonistic to the top. 'The vice-chairman had no idea this was going on, and if he had known, he would probably have stopped it. But you can't say anything at the top without having it be seen as an order. Even ambiguous remarks may get translated into action. At the top you have to figure out the impact of all your words in advance because an innocent expression can have a major effect.' The message of same is surely that senior executives need to do more than recall the experience of Gerald Ratner and keep their talents as entertaining speakers, no matter how great, firmly under check. It does not take careless talk to cost millions, and promising careers to boot. The sad fact is that top bosses cannot avoid the risk even by never saying anything at all. For the Scrambler implies that, if there's any question important to lower rankers on which chiefs may be thought to have an opinion, then however carefully they refrain from expressing one, myths will rush in to fill the gap.</p>

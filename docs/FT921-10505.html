			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Fresh cracks in US-Japan chip pact / A report on Silicon Valley's growing anger over the market-share issue THE US trade representative, Mrs Carla Hills, disappointed US semiconductor manufacturers last week by softening her support for a key element of the US-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed last year. The agreement, in which Japan agreed to give foreign producers greater access to its Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn) semiconductor market, specifies a foreign market share of 20 per cent by the end of this year. However, playing down the significance of market share, Mrs Hills said that it is only one of about a dozen indices that the US government will use to determine whether Japan has complied with the pact. The bitterly fought semiconductor trade battle threatens to become the focus of rising resentment in the US toward Japan for its alleged unfair trade practices. Mrs Hills defended the Bush administration's record on Japanese trade, noting that several important market-opening agreements have been signed during the past three years, including the recent computer trade pact. The administration's trade policy 'is working', she claimed, adopting President George Bush's new slogan. Yet her comments, made during a brief visit to San Francisco, come amid growing concern that the semiconductor agreement will fail to provide US chip makers with greater access to the lucrative Japanese market. The foreign share of the Japanese chip market has declined during the past year, according to US semiconductor industry officials, from a high of 15.5 per cent in the second quarter of 1990 to 14.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1991. The market share data has been recalculated according to a new formula agreed on by the US and Japan in the 1991 pact. US chip makers are determined that market share should remain 'the most important measure of compliance', said a spokesman for the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), the trade group that has spearheaded the US industry's campaign. Executives are hoping that Washington will take a tough stand if current trends continue; Mrs Hills' remarks were therefore a bitter disappointment. Industry officials were particularly perturbed to hear that she had referred to the 20 per cent market share goal as only a benchmark. 'If the market share is 19 per cent,' she said, 'that will not necessarily be a breach (of the agreement)'. American computer industry executives disagree. 'Progress in semiconductor trade must be measured in terms of results, and that means market share. We will accept nothing less,' said an official at Advanced Micro Devices, one of Silicon Valley's leading semiconductor manufacturers. 'Rather than finding excuses for why Japan cannot live up to its commitments, the trade representative should be keeping up the pressure,' said an SIA spokesman. The first US-Japanese semiconductor trade agreement, in 1986, set a 20 per cent market share goal, but, when this five-year pact expired, a new deadline was set for the end of 1992. To reach the year-end market-share goal, Japan would have to import a record Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 660m)-worth of semiconductor products this year. US industry officials now acknowledge that this appears very unlikely. Another concern among executives is a steep drop in the number of 'design-wins' that they have been able to obtain in Japan over the past six months. These occur when a semiconductor device is incorporated into the design of a new electronic product. Tracking design-wins provides a rough measure of the volume of business that a chip maker can expect to achieve in coming months. The Japanese electronics companies' increasing reluctance to design foreign semiconductor devices into their products is attributed in part to weakening economic conditions in Japan. 'We are the last to be designed-in and the first to be designed-out when times get tough,' a US industry official said. The semiconductor trade dispute may come to a head this summer, when US and Japanese executives meet in Tokyo. After waging their trade battle with Japan for more than a decade, the US industry is in no mood for compromise. Unless there is a significant improvement in Japanese trade before then, the US industry is determined to retaliate. What form the US industry's response will take has yet to be decided. One of the options frequently mentioned, however, is to urge the US government to impose trade sanctions aimed selectively at Japanese companies that have failed to increase their foreign semiconductor purchases, while acknowledging the efforts of those that have adhered to the spirit of the agreement.</p>

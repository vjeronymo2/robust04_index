			<p>BFN     [Text] Rome, May 4 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata pledged to Italian Prime Minister-Designate Silvio  Berlusconi Tuesday [3 May] night that Japan will continue to  make efforts to open up its market, Japanese officials said.    "A little brightness has been visible in the Japanese  economy. We are making efforts to make Japan's market open to  the international community," Hata was quoted as saying.    The Japanese prime minister said he wants to deepen  exchanges  with Italy in politics, the economy, science and culture, the  officials said.    During a 45-minute meeting, Berlusconi replied that his  country also shares similar problems and when he assumes the  post of prime minister, Italy's economy will be strengthened and  it can make a fresh start, the officials said.    Berlusconi, appointed prime minister-designate last week,  said he is looking forward to working with Hata at the July  summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic powers in  Naples.    Earlier in the day, Hata met departing Prime Minister  Azeglio  Ciampi for two and a half hours.    Hata and Ciampi agreed that strengthening cooperation on  political problems between Russia and the G-7, revitalization of  the world economy, and assistance to African countries and other  developing nations will top the agenda at the Naples summit, the  officials said.    Ciampi said, "in the summit meeting, we would like to  discuss  strengthening cooperation on political issues between the G-7  and Russia. We also want to discuss relations between North and  South, and assistance to developing nations."    Hata reportedly replied that summit meetings of the G-7 will  assume new importance in a new era and praised Italy's role.    The Japanese prime minister said it is important to extend  aid to developing countries, and Middle East and East Europe.    Hata, who was elected prime minister last Monday, arrived in  Rome on Monday night, kicking off a series of official visits to  Italy, France, Germany and Belgium.    Hata's trip is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders  before the July summit of the G-7.</p>

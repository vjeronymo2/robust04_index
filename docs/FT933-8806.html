			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Observer: Do as I say, not as I do A bizarre battle has broken out in Brazil over the proper handling of the country's rapidly weakening currency. Brazil's central bank is threatening to sue one of the country's top TV presenters for daring to make paper aeroplanes out of banknotes on his popular Sunday afternoon show. The threat comes after Silvio Santos ignored a written warning in February. It appears that using cruzeiro notes to make paper aeroplanes constitutes a contravention of the penal code which prohibits the wilful destruction or damage of currency. The central bank explains that the cost of replacing damaged notes is very high and, in a new twist to economic theory, adds that making people aware of the need to keep their money in good condition is vital if inflation is to be reduced from its level of 1,900 per cent a year. So now we know why the bank has just changed its currency for the fourth time since 1986 and is reported to be burning 3m worthless notes a day.</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Upjohn faces Dollars 1bn lawsuit over Halcion Upjohn, the US pharmaceuticals group, said yesterday it was named in a lawsuit filed on behalf of five people who had allegedly suffered severe side-effects from using Halcion, a sleeping medication banned in the UK but widely prescribed elsewhere. The company said it was unaware of the details of the lawsuit, which is seeking Dollars 1bn in damages, according to The Houston Chronicle. The suit contends that Upjohn relied on falsified clinical studies to win approval of the medication by the US Food and Drug Administration, according to the report. Declining comment on the lawsuit, the company defended Halcion as 'very safe and effective' when used as directed.</p>

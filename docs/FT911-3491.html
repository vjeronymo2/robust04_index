			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Lloyd's Names face Pounds 100m cash call the wealthy individuals who back underwriting at the London insurance market  -are to be asked to provide about Pounds 100m in fresh funds to cover asbestosis and pollution claims in the US. Willis Faber &amp; Dumas (Agencies) is one of several members' agencies sending letters to more than 3,000 Names on marine syndicates 406 and 448, advising them of a sharp upward revision in estimated underwriting losses for the 1988 underwriting year. Names on the two syndicates, two of the biggest in the Lloyd's market, could face bills for at least Pounds 25,000 each. There is growing concern in the market in particular about the impact of claims arising from pollution in the US, to which a large number of the market's syndicates could be exposed. Lloyd's has been hit by a series of claims arising from long-tail US liability business, in which claims can emerge many years after the policies were originally written. Hitherto most losses on US liability business have stemmed from asbestosis. Now, however, the market is having to pay out for a growing number of pollution cases, mainly reflecting the costs of cleaning up toxic waste on the orders of the US government. Mr John Rew, co-author of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, a market guide, said yesterday: 'For a long time we've been warning about the dangers of US long-tail liabilities. It's a treadmill for the Names.' Mr Rew said that Chatset had revised its estimates of Lloyd's result for the 1988 year (to be published in July 1991) to an overall loss. In the Willis letter, Mr James Sinclair, managing director of the agency, said Willis had been 'shocked to learn' that the Wellington Underwriting Agency, which manages syndicates 406 and 448, had revised their 'estimated loss on both syndicates.' A total of 3,022 Names on syndicate 406 will be asked to meet a cash call of about Pounds 70m following losses recorded in the 1988 underwriting year. 3,808 Names on syndicate 448 will be asked to meet a loss of about Pounds 35m. Some members may be on both syndicates. In February, Mr Sinclair had forecast losses of a little over half these amounts. Mr John Prentice, chairman of Wellington, said loss estimates had been revised upwards following an acceleration of claims in the last few months but the figures still had to be 'finalised.' Although both syndicates 406 and 448 specialise in marine business, both devote between 20 and 25 per cent of their underwriting capacity to non-marine liability insurance. Mr Sinclair said in his letter that 'these revised amounts do not reflect any of the estimates we have been told by Wellington to date and there are a significant number of questions we think will be needed to justify the calculation.' Willis Faber, now part of the international broker Willis Corroon, owned the Wellington agency before divesting it under the terms of the 1982 Lloyd's Act.</p>

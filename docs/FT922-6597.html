			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Observer: Unkind cut Anglers at a Netherlands gravel pit thought a blow was being struck for the underdog when they saw a cavorting American pit bull terrier attacked by a giant pike. The dog, called Mahruss, needed six stitches to cuts in its forepaw. Alas for justice, although looking like a pit bull, it wasn't one. Mahruss is really an American Staffordshire terrier which, unlike the notorious fighting strain, is bred to be a companionable animal - or so says the UK Kennel Club, anyway.</p>

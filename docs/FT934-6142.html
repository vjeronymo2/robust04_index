			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Lib Dems say high earners should be taxed to boost jobs People earning more than Pounds 25,200 a year would pay an extra 3p in the Pounds 1 on income tax to fund a jobs and education expansion programme in a Liberal Democrat alternative Budget launched yesterday. Mr Alan Beith, Liberal treasury spokesman, said the only way to deal with the Pounds 50bn budget deficit was to generate higher growth through a big investment package. He said: 'Any other measures to deal with the deficit are just tokenism.' He reiterated his party's commitment to put one penny in the pound on the basic and higher rate of tax to improve education. But he said people would not start paying the higher tax until their earnings reached Pounds 25,200 - Pounds 1,500 more than the present higher rate level. The party said its Pounds 8.3bn package would be paid for by increased revenues from income tax, tobacco sales, a 400,000 fall in unemployment as well as crackdowns on wasteful expenditure. But government plans to put value added tax on domestic fuel bills would be abandoned. The basic state pension would rise by Pounds 2 a week and childcare facilities would be improved. There would be more investment in public transport, the health service and housing, while mortgage interest tax relief on new home loans from January 1995 would stop. Mr Beith dismissed calls from businessmen for spending cuts, however. 'Society as a whole would not accept us turning our back on the most vulnerable,' he said.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Styled with a built-in sense of identity - National designs can reflect culture and custom Do everyday things have a different look and feel from country to country? Many designers not only believe so: they are determined to keep it that way. Their hope is at odds with trends towards closer European union and greater international trade. Yet 'national design' can provide a much needed sense of identity while preserving - or even enhancing international competition. National identities within Europe have come centre stage since Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. In design, Denmark itself has a strong identity - a spare, practical style that we see in furniture, tableware and Bang and Olufsen hi-fi. The same values apply equally to Danish heating equipment and electronic instruments. According to Jens Bernsun, director of the Danish Design Centre, Denmark is one of the few countries where famous design classics are also popular with the general public. Many of the Danish designs on show in museums around the world can also be found in hundreds of thousands of Danish homes. The Netherlands is the polar opposite of Denmark in Community terms, a great believer in European integration. Yet it too has a strong design identity, evidence that supranational ideals need not be pursued at the expense of national character. Holland's public sector companies have long been exemplary patrons of design, the legacy of the country's historical need to design its geography. 'Holland has always been shaped by human hands, by the official sector,' says Gert Dumbar, a leading designer. The Dutch post and telecommunications company, PTT, continued that tradition when it commissioned a corporate identity from Dumbar to signal its recent privatisation. The result was a collage of elements hinting of Mondrian and the country's canal-crossed landscape. National design's ascendancy over globalism provides a visual parallel to the more general debate between McKinsey and Co's Kenichi Ohmae, author of The Borderless World (Harper Business), and Harvard Business School's Michael Porter, who holds that national stereotypes have their basis in fact and should be confronted and even exploited. As Porter writes in The Competitive Advantage of Nations (Macmillan): 'Companies at first glance seem to have transcended countries. Yet differences in national economic structures, values, cultures, institutions, and histories contribute profoundly to competitive success.' The Japanese have alphabets that gave good reason for the invention of the fax machine. The Polaroid camera satisfies an American wish for instant gratification. The British drink prodigious quantities of tea, hence the recent advent of the jug kettle. These examples show that differences of culture and custom can determine where innovation occurs. What is true for innovation in products can be true too in their styling. The UK is the main market for jug kettles, but exporters such as Tefal of France make them for the British, ignoring the British design idiom in favour of their own corporate look. One British designer who recognises this shortcoming is Geoff Hollington. His proposal for a 'British' jug kettle has elegant lines, a wooden handle, and Racing Green trim. Elsewhere, more explicit moves are afoot to celebrate national identity. In Slovenia, for example, Janez Suhadolc, a furniture designer, celebrates the country's newfound independence with chairs that allude to the architecture of Jose Plecnik. Plecnik is Slovenia's equivalent of Catalonia's Antonio Gaudi who was active in the 1920s and 1930s - when Slovenia last tasted freedom. The concern extends beyond countries where political nationalism is running strong, however. Japan has spent decades copying the West at the expense of its own cultural identity. Now some Japanese designers are seeking to unite high-tech product style with national tradition. One result is a Sony Walkman with a blue-white enamel finish which, according to the designer, evokes ceramic chopstick holders. Sold only in Japan this model enjoyed a shelf-life six times longer than a normal Walkman. Some designs stem from observation of a culture rather than immersion in it. The French television station TF1 has a logotype that resembles the label on a pastis bottle. The reference is perhaps obvious, but head of programme promotion Patrice Ferrand was happy enough. 'It nicely demonstrates its national origin.' Conversely Guardian Vie, the French life subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange Assurance wanted a British-looking identity because the French apparently believe British insurance companies to be more reputable than their own. The designers responded with a G like a fragment of the London Transport roundel and British public services colours that French visitors will have seen here. There is an ironic twist in both these cases. The TF1 identity is the work of British designers Lambie-Nairn and Company, who also came up with the current designs for the BBC television channels. Guardian Vie's British look on the other hand came from Plan Creatif, a Paris firm. These acts of creation of national identity by foreigners are not without precedent. As the historian Eric Hobsbawm points out in Nations and Nationalism, 'more often than not the discovery of popular tradition and its transformation into the 'national tradition' . . . was the work of enthusiasts from the (foreign) ruling class or elite.' The fear of designers is that by designing in a national idiom they may only produce kitsch. Hobsbawm uses the phrase 'the invention of tradition' to describe this activity. He refers, for example, to traditions such as the tartan kilt, an 18th century English invention which is now ubiquitous shorthand for Scotland. Such traditions may be invented but they have also been successful. National style can be whatever a good designer says it is.

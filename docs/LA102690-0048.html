			<p><P> October 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'RUNNING OF GRUNIONS': DELICATE CREATURES  </P> <P> A good title is suggestive. "The Running of the Grunions" is about neurotic  creatures of habit.  </P> <P> Beginning playwright Lori Romero's drama centers on two quirky sisters, a  ne'er-do well but loving brother, and their mom, who suffers from Alzheimer's  disease.  </P> <P> The production at the Flight Theatre is sensitive and well researched in its  depiction of Alzheimer's. As the disoriented mother, Mary Boucher negotiates  memory lapses with credibility, and director David J. Partington's cast  captures the nervous fear that grips the disease's second victims, the families  who must deal with it.  </P> <P> Alzheimer's is really a leitmotif for the emotional stress of the sisters. One  is annoyingly fatuous, and the role's mannered cuteness is badly overplayed by  Shari Ballard. The other sister is a genuine wreck who makes you wince in a  terrific portrayal by Juli Donald.  </P> <P> The brother (nice job by understudy Christopher Marcantel at the performance  attended) is a cliche role too reliant on smart one-liners. A divorced husband  who pops up (an earnest Walter McDowell) gives the production a momentary  masculine ballast it desperately needs.  </P> <P>  At 6476 Santa Monica Blvd., today and Saturday, 8 p.m., ends Sunday at 7 p.m.  $12. (213) 464-2124.  </P> <P> RAY LOYND  </P></p>

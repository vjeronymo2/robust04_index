			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Hollinger turns in flat first-quarter earnings HOLLINGER, the holding company for Mr Conrad Black's international publishing group, has reported flat first-quarter earnings. An improved performance by the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph group in the UK was not reflected on Hollinger's bottom line as a result of the weakening of the pound against the Canadian dollar and the reduction of Hollinger's stake at the time of the Telegraph's listing last July. Hollinger's net income from continuing operations was CDollars 6.8m (USDollars 5.4m), or 8 cents a share, up from CDollars 6.6m, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues dropped slightly to CDollars 205.7m from CDollars 209m. These figures exclude an unusual gain of CDollars 18.5m this year and a charge of CDollars 38.4m in 1992. Excluding these charges as well as discontinued operations and the cost of Hollinger's recent purchase of a stake in Canada's Southam Newspapers, first-quarter earnings were CDollars 13.7m, or 20 cents a share, compared with losses of CDollars 31.7m, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>

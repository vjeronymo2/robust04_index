			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shute buys 4.9% stake in Anglia Secure for Pounds 72,000 MR ROGER SHUTE, the convalescent ex-chairman of BM Group, the industrial concern, has taken a stake in a second quoted company. His interest again sparked a sharp increase in the target's share price. Anglia Secure Homes, which builds and manages sheltered housing for the elderly, saw its price rise from 4 1/2 p to 7 1/2 p after it disclosed that Mr Shute had acquired a 4.9 per cent interest - 1.6m shares costing Pounds 72,000. This followed the news that he had taken a similar stake in GM Firth, the steel company, and there is talk of him joining its board as a non-executive. In Anglia's case, Mr Shute's interest seems to be speculative. He said the management was strong and aggressive and he might be seen as a passive investor in an industry that 'is just about to come out of the bottom of the cycle'. Anglia lost Pounds 5.08m in the six months to March last year and Mr James Bryant, finance director, said losses had continued in the second half. At the interim stage net borrowings remained almost three times shareholders' funds of Pounds 10.8m. Mr Bryant said the group had 250 unsold homes, but on the other hand, its management subsidiary had performed well. Its bankers remained 'understanding'. Mr Shute's return to the quoted company scene follows six months of convalescence from lung disease. He remains president of BM, which he founded, until July, when the post will be reviewed. He said his paper losses on BM shares ran to about Pounds 3m.</p>

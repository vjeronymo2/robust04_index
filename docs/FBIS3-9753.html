At a constituent congress of Ludovit Cernak's National  Democratic Party-New Alternative (NDS-NA) in Zvolen, Kovac said  this unification process was natural as both groupings were of a  liberal orientation and emerged from the same movement -- now  the opposition Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) of  ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar. Kovac said that latest talks  confirmed the creation of a joint election bloc comprising the  future liberal party and Cernak's conservative NDS-NA. Kovac did  not even rule out the possibility of creating a joint party with  the NDS-NA, but added that the current legislation did not make  it possible to establish a two-wing party, like for instance the  French UDF (French Democracy Union). This model is backed by  Cernak, former chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) which  was a junior partner of the former HZDS-SNS government  coalition. Kovac said he was convinced the centrist bloc would  get the necessary seven per cent of the vote in the autumn  elections to get to the parliament.    Chairman of the NDS-NA preparatory committee Cernak said in  his address to the congress a clear economic policy which will  lead Slovakia out of the economic crisis, family development,  non- confrontation ethnic minorities policy and regional  programme were the NDS-NA's priorities. He said that the new  entity, which emerged from the SNS, would be based on  conservative values. The NDS-NA's programme is based on  national democratic patriotism, a free market, a law-abiding  state and the principles of Western democratic civilisation. He  said that "the new alternative for Slovakia was no longer  Czech-Slovak resentment... nor the extreme nationalism of the  HZDS ... nor boundless liberalism with its slogan "dog eat dog."    In the afternoon the congress will elect new party bodies.</p>

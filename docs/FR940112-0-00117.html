			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed subsection (b)(3) as it appeared in the NPR retained the current requirement that for weights of 4 pounds or more disclosure be given exclusively in whole pounds, with any remainder in ounces or fractions of the pound. The Commission received two comments on this issue, each of which argued that the use of ounces be permitted as an optional additional disclosure on products weighing 4 pounds or more. Procter &amp; Gamble wrote: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> We believe manufacturers should be allowed to voluntarily include net contents in units of ounces or fluid ounces for products containing more than four pounds or more than one gallon. This provision would again promote fair value comparisons between the largest 1 or 2 sizes of a consumer product such as laundry detergent with the smaller sizes of the same brand or alternate brands. Comparison between two sizes such as 50 oz (3 lb 2 oz) and 85 oz (5.31 lb) is accomplished much more easily by comparing ounces. Comparison between two sizes such as 48 fl oz (1 quart 1 pint) and 144 fl oz (1 gallon 1 pint) similarly is accomplished much more easily by comparing fluid ounces. We see important consumer benefits and no risks in extending voluntary use of ounces or fluid ounces to larger sizes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  PG, 10, 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Conference on Weights and Measures similarly urges the Commission to allow the voluntary use of ounces and fluid ounces to larger size packages.

The Commission believes that allowing the use of ounces on large size packages will facilitate price comparisons without any negative consequences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (c) states that for random packages, i.e., packages with varying weights from a lot of the same commodity, the decimal fractions of the pound should not be carried out to more than three places. Further, this subsection is changed to reflect the amendment to FPLA that random packages, unlike other packages, are not required to, but may, include a metric statement of mass.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

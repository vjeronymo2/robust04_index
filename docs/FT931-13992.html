			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saga joins Shell in Russian oil pact SAGA PETROLEUM, Norway's biggest independent oil company, and Shell Exploration, a unit of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, announced yesterday an agreement to co-operate with three Russian companies in developing oil and gas fields in the Timan Pechora basin in the northern Russian Archangels province. 'Shell is joining Saga in an agreement of intentions previously entered between Saga and the Russian enterprises Severgasprom, Arkhangekskgeologia and Ukhtaneftegasgeologia regarding the creation of a joint venture,' Saga Petroleum explained. The joint venture being negotiated is a proposed 50:50 Russian and foreign co-operation, and aims to develop discovered oil and gas fields. Severgasprom, the leading Russian partner in the pact, has applied for exploitation licences on behalf of the group. The licences comprise the oil fields Mid and North-Kharyaga and five gas and gas condensate fields. Saga said the joint venture also aimed to apply for exploration and production licences for an area near the discovered fields. One appraisal well is planned this year on the Mid-Kharyaga field which may be cored, logged and tested by western contractors financed by Saga and Shell. For two years Saga and its Russian partners have been negotiating a joint venture agreement and undertaken joint petroleum reserves studies, technical development scenarios and economic feasibility studies, but Saga said further appraisal activities, studies and commercial negotiations were required before the commercial viability of the fields could be declared. Saga said the group aimed this year to conclude a feasibility study, environmental impact study and a joint venture agreement.</p>

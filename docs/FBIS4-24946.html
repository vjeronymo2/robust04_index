			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 3 (XINHUA) -- A new white paper about  women in China was published to enable the world to acquire a  better understanding of women's conditions in China, a Chinese  leader said here today.    It was also done to promote the development of women all  over  the world, said Chen Muhua, vice-chairwoman of the Standing  Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) and president  of the All-China Women's Federation.    She was answering questions on the white paper entitled  "Situation of Chinese Women".    "The world has become more concerned about conditions of  Chinese women as the world conference on women will be held in  Beijing, capital of China, in 1995," she said.    Through facts and figures, the white paper reviewed the  historic liberation of Chinese women in the course of the new  democratic revolution and the socialist revolution under the  leadership of the Communist Party of China, as well as their  status and role under the socialist system.    Chen said that the policy of reform and opening to the  world,  and the process of building socialist market economy, set a  higher demand on Chinese women while bringing their intelligence  into full play.    Chen called for women all over China to enhance their  qualities and to adhere to the slogan of "four selfs" --  self-respect, self-confidence, self-reliance and  self-strengthening.    She suggested that the government should provide more  opportunities for women to engage in administering national,  government and social affairs.    On the preparation for the world conference, she said China  attached great importance to the conference and would do its  best to ensure its success.    She recalled that an organizing committee was set up in  1992.  Its 31 constituent bodies include relevant departments of the  State Council, Beijing municipal government and the press.    The conference hall has been fixed and all the preparations  are under way.</p>

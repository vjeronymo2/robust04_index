			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry will visit  the ROK next month in connection with the North Korean nuclear  issue. Also, the situation on the Korean peninsula has been  further strained. Under these circumstances, a North Korean  authority to the United Nations suddenly showed the position  today that it would resume negotiations with the United States.  As a result, changes in the North Korean attitude regarding the  North Korean nuclear issue newly attract our attention. We have  news from reporter Yi Chong-ok at the desk international affairs.    [Begin Yi recording] A relevant authority of the North  Korean mission to the United Nations said today that North Korea  is willing to resume negotiations -- which are suspended at  present -- with the United States if the ROK-U.S. joint military  exercise is suspended and if the United States confirms to North  Korea that it will resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula through dialogue.    Japan's KYODO NEWS AGENCY reported: The North Korean  authority expects negotiations with the United States to be  resumed. Also, it reported that the authority said that North  Korea would accept the additional inspections demanded by the  International Atomic Energy Agency when the U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks are held.    The news agency reported: Such remarks by the North Korean  authority seem to show that North Korea is intending to avoid  the strong steps, including economic sanctions, by continuing  dialogue with the United States.    Also, Japan's SISA NEWS AGENCY reported that the United  States had decided to immediately send U.S. Secretary of Defense  Perry to the ROK and Japan on 17 April to discuss the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula.

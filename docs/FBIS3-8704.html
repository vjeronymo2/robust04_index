At Otopeni airport the Romanian head of state made a statement  to the press on the results of his talks and contacts with  politicians and businessmen in the three countries.    Referring to his visit to Lithuania, Iliescu emphasized the  importance of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship and  Cooperation between the two countries, which augments the series  of legal documents regulating the framework of bilateral  relations. Both in Lithuania and in Belarus, where he made a  stopover and met with the new head of state, the sides expressed  the desire to consolidate bilateral ties.    The Asian tour started with a visit to the ROK, the first  official Romanian visit to that country at the level of heads of  state. The visit, President Ion Iliescu said, was a political  event that was given its due attention by both the mass media  and the political leadership of that country, which expressed  the desire to consolidate relations with Romania. President Ion  Iliescu emphasized that our country should show greater interest  in South Korea and the economic region of southeast Asia in  general since that is the most dynamic region in the world. In  this respect, he referred to various aspects of his meetings  with the representatives of some big companies that have  cooperation relations with Romanian companies. On the occasion  of those meetings, the local businessmen expressed their  interest in investing in the Romanian economy.    Referring to his visit to the special economic zone in the  southern part of China, Ion Iliescu described it as an area that  has registered spectacular progress in the past 15 years, which  took concrete shape in the development of several strong urban  centers. Foreign capital investment in the region has acquired  great proportions, with the respective zones dynamizing the  entire Chinese economy, which is in full process of  modernization and has taken a decisive turn toward the  mechanisms of the market economy.    In conclusion, President Ion Iliescu said that the tour,  which is part of a program of opening up toward regions of great  interest, has been characterized, on the one hand, by a  highlevel political dialogue to consolidate bilateral ties and,  on the other hand, by important economic considerations,  something that could also be seen from the composition of the  Romanian delegation.</p>

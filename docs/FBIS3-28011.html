			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Chung-il and Choe Chae-yong from Inchon] </F>   [Text] On 1 February, Inchon Mayor Choe Ki-son issued the  "Declaration of 2011 Inchon Internationalization" on developing  Inchon into a international city and released the plan to  develop Inchon into a key port of Northeast Asia in the 2000's.  Mayor Choe pointed out: "Inchon meets various required  conditions for being an outpost for internationalization.  Inchon is a starting point of sea and air routes as it has an  international trade port and Yongjongdo Airport, which is under  construction. It also has the Kyonggi- Inchon Industrial  Complex nearby." He said: "The positive [nungdongjok]  internationalization is the only alternative to cut our way  through the age of limitless competitions among countries, and  this can firmly be established only when local cities are  internationalized."    To achieve this goal, Inchon is planning to accomplish the  following by 2011: Development of its North Port into a port  with an annual stevedoring capacity of 25 million tonnes;  overall rearrangement of municipal functions for the convenience  of domestic and foreign visitors, whose number is expected to be  100 million a year after Yongjongdo Airport is completed; and  construction of a technopolice equipped with business, trade,  financial, port control, information, and communication  functions in a 5,350,000-pyong reclaimed land on Song Island.  Inchon plans to invite a total investment of 602.4 billion won  -- government investment of 207.5 billion won and civilian  investment of 394.9 billion won -- to enlarge the port in two  stages. For building the technopolice on Song Island, it also  plans to invite a considerable amount of civilian investment out  of the total expenses of 1.8 trillion won -- 600 billion won for  reclamation and 1.2 trillion won for building the city. Mayor  Choe said: "Not only businessmen in Inchon but also large  enterprises, such as Daewoo, Hanjin, and Sunkyong express their  intention to actively participate in the construction of the  Inchon technopolice."    Mayor Choe also presented the idea of "In Tide (in the tide  of the limitless competition)" -- a symbol of the solidarity  among Inchon, [China's] Tianjin, and Dalian and which is named  after the first two characters in each of the three cities'  names -- in an effort to link Inchon's technology with Tianjin's  labor and Dalian's resources. Inchon established sisterhood  relations with Tianjin in December 1993 and will establish  sistership with Dalian in March.    Mayor Choe will attend the opening ceremony of the standing  Inchon goods exhibition center, the first official event since  the presentation of the "In Tide" idea, to be held in Tianjin on  30 March along with about 100 businessmen in Inchon, who will  participate in the exhibition with their products.    Inchon has rapidly increased its trade with China since 1992  when ROK-PRC diplomatic ties were established. The number of  Chinese visitors to the ROK through Inchon in 1990 was 9,411,  and that in 1993 was around 116,100, increasing over 11 times.  The amount of export and import cargo in 1990 was 409 TEU, and  that in 1993 was 19,195 TEU, skyrocketing over 20 times. Like  this, Inchon is becoming a key port in the Yellow Sea age.</p>

			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Management: Lemmings leap to adopt 'just in time' The pattern is always the same. Somebody comes up with a management idea. A few companies try it out, and great claims are made for it. Packed conferences are held and consultancies multiply and prosper. More companies follow until everyone is doing it and swearing by it. Then some clever dick does research showing this marvellous practice is not delivering the goods. The believers behave as if an act of sacrilege has been committed, yet the fall from grace has begun. A new idea soon comes along to renew the process. We saw it with total quality management. Now we are seeing it with Japanese lean production techniques such as 'just in time'. Last week academics at Cambridge University published a shock-horror study suggesting that lean production can damage a company's financial health. Now Britain's JIT fanatics are all angrily defending themselves. The cycles are inevitable because companies behave like lemmings. Each new idea - TQM, JIT and all the rest - has some intrinsic worth. Yet managers apply these systems willy nilly to their operations, urged on by their peers and by greedy consultants. To judge by the JIT cycle, about four years is par for the course between mass adoption and doubts setting in. In another year or so, re-engineering and benchmarking - which all but the very smartest and the very dumbest companies now espouse - will take their turn. Looking through the papers for bargain flights, my eye was caught by some remarkably cheap deals: Hong Kong for only Pounds 250, Panama for only Pounds 265. On closer inspection I found I was looking at offshore company bucket shops noisily comparing prices for buying companies in tax-free paradise. Curious, I sent off for the details and received what looked like holiday brochures, full of photos of traditional Chinese junks, the Rock of Gibraltar and - less enticing - of Belize's Philip SW Goldston airport. As there is no question of the clients actually visiting any of these places, it is hard to see why the companies bother with pictures. For about Pounds 500 a year, the offshore specialists will supply names of directors, phone numbers, addresses and anything else to create the veneer of a company that doesn't exist. What surprised me about the brochures is how simple the business of tax avoidance is. All you need is to fill in a form (slightly shorter than the one I have just completed to join my local library), choose a country, pick a company from off the shelf, supply your credit card number and you are ready to go. It is easier than booking a holiday - and marginally cheaper, too. What does it mean for a company to have a woman on its board? Does it mean it is a forward-looking non-discriminatory employer? Possibly. More certainly it means the company is statistically less likely to go bust than those where the board is entirely male. CCN Business Information, the credit analysis company, has found that women are more unlikely to be involved in companies that fail and 50 per cent less likely to have a disgraceful string of corporate disasters behind them. That was only as I had suspected: women are simply the more honest and have superior judgment, too. Unfortunately, the real explanation seems to be otherwise. Nearly one third of the 1m directors of British companies are women, but most of these are the wives of men who have started their own business. Usually a second mortgage on the house is part of the package, and these sorts of family businesses are usually not those that are going to be involved in the latest fraudulent scam. A few months ago my one-year-old daughter received a letter claiming that a fine collection of books could be hers. All she need do was send a book to the child named in the letter, copy the letter and send it on to six of her friends. In due course she would be sent six lovely packages containing books. I was reminded of this letter as I read about the pyramid schemes that have been causing investors so much grief from Russia to Japan to the UK. The popular belief is that the poor suckers involved are either new to capitalism or pathetically naive. My daughter's chain letter suggests otherwise. It came from a financially sophisticated acquaintance who has enough money to buy her son a whole library of books. She knew, and the parents of all the recipients would have known, that chain letters and pyramid schemes are a con. Yet she was prepared to excuse herself with a lot of middle-class claptrap about promoting reading. The idea of something for nothing seems to be deeply rooted, and people who should know better are not only espousing it but passing it on to their children.</p>

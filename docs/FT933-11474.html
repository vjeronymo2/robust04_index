			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Observer: Cayzer-speak The plebs rarely attend AGMs of Caledonian Investments, the publicly quoted arm of Lord Cayzer's family fortune. But yesterday's affair was even more rarefied than usual. What on earth was John Kemp-Welch, joint senior partner of Cazenove, going on about when he lapsed into Latin during the customary vote of thanks? Cayzer family retainers note that the last time it happened was in 1987 when Kemp-Welch uttered a dictum which translated roughly as 'the past has been magnificent but let us hope that the best is yet to come'. But what inspired his latest outburst, ending with the immortal words 'nihil adhuc non vidistia' - was the Wykehamist broker reflecting the wisdom of Pliny, Horace . . . or whom? More like Ronald Reagan, Kemp-Welch admits.</p>

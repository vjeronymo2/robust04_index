			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEACH RESIDENTS ASSAIL REMOVAL OF GAME COURTS  </P> <P> State officials served residents of Ventura's pricey Pierpont area with an  unwelcome surprise Wednesday by knocking down privately constructed volleyball  courts on San Buenaventura State Beach.  </P> <P> Without warning, the state Parks and Recreation Department decided to uproot  the volleyball poles after a resident complained that the courts were  attracting unsavory people who caroused on the beach and had "sex in the sand,"  officials said.  </P> <P> The move netted an irate response from other residents of the beachfront  neighborhood.  </P> <P> "It's just a nightmare," said Karen Biedebach, 25, who helped her parents build  a court at the end of Waterbury Lane 10 years ago. "I am very, very, very  angry."  </P> <P> Biedebach said she had invited several friends to a volleyball party planned  for Wednesday night -- unaware that the state was going to demolish the wooden  volleyball posts early that day.  </P> <P> Four people from the state Parks and Recreation Department and the city of  Ventura cruised the public beach in a tractor, knocking down illegal structures  along the two-mile stretch between Ventura Harbor and Ventura Pier, said Jeff  Price, chief ranger for the state's Channel Coast District.  </P> <P> Price said no need was seen to notify residents of the action because the  structures were illegally built on public land.  </P> <P> In fact, he said, the agencies would like to find the owners and bill them for  the $100 cleanup operation.  </P> <P> Four volleyball courts, a piece of pipe probably used for tetherball and some  makeshift wooden forts were removed, he said.  </P> <P> Two months ago, the city of Ventura cleared away some of the volleyball courts  on a 40-foot-wide city right-of-way that runs parallel to the state-owned  beach, said Ann Prinz, code enforcement officer for the city. Three complaints  had been lodged, Prinz said.  </P> <P> But some people wouldn't give up.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, city and state crews for the third time removed a court near  Weymouth Lane, Price said.  </P> <P> They also recorded identification numbers on four catamarans that the state  plans to remove from the beach, Price said. He said an attempt would be made to  trace the owners and notify them first.  </P> <P> Price said private structures on the public beach have proliferated in recent  months. A resident's phone call brought the situation to the attention of park  rangers four weeks ago, officials said.  </P> <P> The caller said the volleyball courts attracted people who littered, drank beer  and bothered residents, sometimes using areas near the courts for illegal  camping, Price said.  </P> <P> "Somebody called and said, 'You know, there's sex in the sand. There's illegal  camping, and the volleyball courts are at the core of all problems.' "  </P> <P> Price said he does not agree that volleyball is the root of the evil, but he  said clearing away dunes to build courts makes the sand unstable and can cause  it to blow into back yards and houses. The dunes also provide a barrier in the  winter from high tides, he said.  </P> <P> Also, he said, people should not monopolize state land for private structures.  He encouraged volleyball players to use the 18 courts the state has built in  the two-mile stretch.  </P> <P> "The state beach is for the enjoyment of everyone in California and not for the  exclusive enjoyment of anyone," Price said.  </P> <P> Tanya Beers, 24, who lives on Belfast Lane, said the removal of a court near  her house was "too restrictive."  </P> <P> "One of the reasons we live here and pay such high prices is to live on the  beach and enjoy ourselves," Beers said.  </P> <P> Biedebach said she had played games on her court with tourists from throughout  Southern California and questioned the wisdom of removing any recreational  area.  </P> <P> "Maybe," she said, "they want to make Ventura like Bakersfield by the sea."  </P></p>

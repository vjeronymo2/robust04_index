			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luiz Orlando Carneiro from Brasilia] </F>   [Text] Cuban President Fidel Castro's invitation to former  Brazilian President Fernando Collor to spend a few days in  Varadero, a Cuban sea resort, has displeased Brazilian President  Itamar Franco and has taken Itamaraty [Brazilian Foreign  Ministry] by surprise. It is possible that Franco will eliminate  from his agenda a meeting with Cuban Vice President [title as  published] Carlos Lage Davila, who will be officially visiting  Brazil 2-7 February.    Cuban Ambassador to Brazil Jorge Bolanos went to Itamaraty  on  21 January and told Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim that  Castro's invitation to Fernando Collor was strictly personal.  According to Itamaraty spokesman Luiz Fernando Benedini, the  meeting between Minister Amorim and the Cuban ambassador had  been scheduled in advance. Benedini denied that the ambassador  had been summoned for an explanation. The spokesman refused to  comment on behalf of the minister on the possible displeasure  that Castro's invitation to Brazil's former president, found  guilty of malfeasance in office, may have caused.    According to information on hand, the former president was  supposed to go to Cuba as part of a business delegation together  with his old friend, businessman Luiz Estevao. Collor was  reportedly invited to stay at the official guest house in  Varadero where his former wife Lilibeth Monteiro de Carvalho and  his children Arnon Affonso and Joaquim Pedro have stayed in the  past. The trip of the business delegation was postponed because  the health of Luiz Estevao's father took a turn for the worse,  but Collor confirmed that he plans to spend a few days in Cuba.  Fidel Castro -- who still maintains a personal relationship  with the former Brazilian president -- was unable to withdraw  his earlier invitation.    Vice President Carlos Lage's official visit to Brazil had  been arranged some time ago. Lage's agenda includes meetings  with President Franco, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso, and Health Minister Henrique  Santillo.    [Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO PAULO in Portuguese on 21 January on  page A6 carries a 200-word report noting that "on 22 January  Collor will be boarding a plane for Cuba, the first leg of a  30-day vacation. Collor, who is traveling with his wife Rosane,  will visit Cuba, then go to Paris and end up in the Cap Ferrat  resort in France."]</p>

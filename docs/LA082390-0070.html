			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> BOLSHOI BALLET'S 'SWAN' IS ONE DULL BIRD  </P> <P> Not long ago, when Americans considered Soviet artists hostages to an evil  empire, we accepted the generally appalling state of Soviet choreography as the  inevitable price for enjoying the unsurpassed greatness of Soviet dancing.  </P> <P> No longer. The freedoms of a new era have raised everyone's expectations -- and  the familiar junk ballets of the 1990 Bolshoi tour seem a double affront. We've  certainly never been engaged by them, and now the dancers look equally  detached.  </P> <P> Tuesday, the company opened its seven-performance engagement at the Civic  Theatre with the "Swan Lake" that artistic director Yuri Grigorovich patched  together in 1969.  </P> <P> Set in bleak ruins designed by Simon Virsaladze, this is a version that does  not actually tell a story but rather makes occasional references to one -- as  if it's aiming to be a dreamlike distillation. Indeed, it sometimes becomes  literally emblematic when huge, decaying coats of arms descend to ornament  major junctures in the action.  </P> <P> Instead of the mime passages of the original that represented conversations in  movement, Grigorovich has people stand around mindlessly bowing to one another  or simply waiting until the music allows somebody to dance. He further wrecks  the work's built-in stylistic contrasts by putting the national dances onto  pointe -- but remains a staunch traditionalist regarding those three fixtures  of Soviet stagings: the Tutor, the Jester and the happy ending.  </P> <P> Diligently conducted by Algis Zhuraitis, the Tchaikovsky score has been  reworked to incorporate passages deleted from most productions -- including the  long-lost Russian dance. The most troublesome novelty: an intense pas d'action  for Odile, Rothbart, Siegfried and a swan mini-corps just preceding (and in a  completely different style from) the Black Swan pas de deux.  </P> <P> Gone are the days when this confused and fundamentally hollow collage could  command committed execution. Look at the swans in the first lakeside scene:  Like the corps, the four cygnets dispatch their choreography efficiently but  with no real spirit -- and the swan trio that immediately follows proves  disastrous in both timing and placement.  </P> <P> Look at the vulgar and unmusical bravura assigned to both the meticulous  Mikhail Sharkov as the Jester and the reckless Alexander Vetrov as Rothbart. In  the name of expanding opportunities for males in "the classics," Grigorovich  has made such men into caricatures of disruptive athleticism.  </P> <P> What happens to artists condemned to this kind of showcase? They either grow  grimly insular (Vetrov) or descend into fey mannerism (Maria Bilova, cast on  Tuesday in the pas de trois of the opening scene). This is a company with  plenty of examples at both extremes.  </P> <P> Because vestiges remain of Petipa and Ivanov, this "Swan Lake" becomes  periodically classical, allowing the Swan Queen and Siegfried (no less than the  audience) access to something authentic and purposeful.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the triumphant dynamism of Nina Ananiashvili complemented the  serene refinement of Alexei Fadeyechev in unexpected but exciting ways. With  her extraordinary upper-torso strength and magnificent ability to flow through  the choreography, Ananiashvili danced even the most lyrical passages at heroic  scale. Yet the sweetly smiling Fadeyechev made her appear a projection of his  needs: a dream-lover he conjured up and then protected with partnering of  ravishing tenderness.  </P> <P> Fadeyechev wasn't always faultless in the virtuoso challenges, and Ananiashvili  looked oddly prosaic in her first lakeside solo (after the White Swan duet),  but nevertheless they exemplified the brilliant abilities of this Bolshoi  generation -- abilities deserving something better than Grigorovich's botched  modernization of a 19th-Century masterwork.  </P> <P> Can they hope to find what they deserve within this company or elsewhere in  Moscow? In Leningrad, perhaps? In London? The question is anything but  speculative these days, and the reputation of the Bolshoi anything but assured.  </P></p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Middle East Peace Deal: EC will invite Arafat for talks THE EC will today invite Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, to Brussels to discuss economic reconstruction in the occupied territories as part of a wide-ranging political dialogue with the PLO leader. EC foreign ministers, meeting in eastern Belgium, also gave a warm welcome to European Commission proposals to double assistance to the occupied territories to Ecu500m (Pounds 383m) over the next five years. The Commission is to invite Israeli and Palestinian experts to come separately to Brussels to discuss how to bolster the economy of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, and to use money to improve health, education and infrastructure in the occupied territories. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the Commission, and Mr Willy Claes, Belgian foreign minister who chairs the rotating EC presidency, will attend today's ceremony in Washington to sign the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO. The invitation to Mr Arafat is likely to be extended after the Washington ceremony. Mr Delors appealed to western countries to co-ordinate their aid effort and warned against making loose promises of hundreds of millions of dollars without proper assessment of the occupied territories' capacity to absorb aid. 'We have seen what happened with Russia,' he said. The elevation of Mr Arafat forms part of an unfolding EC diplomatic effort aimed at responding to the Israeli-EC peace accord on mutual recognition and self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. Ministers yesterday approved a new mandate for the Commission to update a 1975 trade agreement with Israel, while holding out the prospect of aid to other Arab countries such as Jordan, Syria and Lebanon once they complete peace agreements with Israel. The EC also wants an end to the Arab trade boycott of Israeli products, and is likely to press Mr Arafat on this matter.</p>

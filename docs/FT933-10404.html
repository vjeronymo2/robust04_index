			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Advance for two building societies TWO MEDIUM-sized building societies yesterday reported improvements in their profits for the first six months of the 1993 year. An rise in margins helped the Skipton increase its interim profits from Pounds 645,000 to Pounds 4.17m pre-tax. Net interest receivable rose from Pounds 21.7m to Pounds 24.1m, thanks to a reduction in the society's wholesale funding. Operating profits rose by 14.3 per cent, from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 21.2m. The society said that the number of mortgages in arrears, including repossessions, fell by 15 per cent from the end of 1992. However, the society's bad debt provision fell only slightly from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 17.1m. Mr Ron McCormick, finance director, said that was because of an increase in provisions against commercial loans. Assets fell slightly from the year end level of Pounds 3.01bn to Pounds 2.93bn. Mr John Goodfellow, chief executive, said: 'Our objectives remain to improve asset quality, retain our cost-effectiveness and maximise non-interest income. The outlook for the housing market remains cautious, but the society is now well positioned for a period of steady growth in performance.' Meanwhile, the Coventry Building Society announced a 10.2 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.1m. The society said that its Pounds 4.2m provision for mortgage losses, while higher than the Pounds 3.6m recorded in the first half of 1992, was much lower than the second half's Pounds 10.1m provision. The results also included an exceptional debit of Pounds 841,000 reflecting the costs involved in a restructuring of the company's management. Net interest receivable was Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 23.6m) and operating profits rose by 17.1 per cent to Pounds 18.1m. The society's total assets were Pounds 2.82bn, compared with Pounds 2.7bn at the end of 1992. Mr Martin Ritchley, Coventry's chief executive, said: 'It is envisaged that as the long awaited upturn in the housing market takes effect, the society's lending activity will continue to expand.'</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> SPECIAL PROGRAMS AVAILABLE TO SENIORS  </P> <P> The city is now offering seniors free services and low-cost recreational  programs at the new West Newport Community Center.  </P> <P> The center, at 883 W. 15th St., which used to be a private school, was opened  and staffed last month to serve seniors living in that area. But few have yet  come in, said Community Services Coordinator Vicki Chin.  </P> <P> "People are just now aware that we're there," she said. "We are looking to see  how much interest there is to have these programs available in West Newport."  </P> <P> Activities this month will include blood-pressure tests and vision screening,  with no appointments necessary. Other services include Medicare counseling and  income tax assistance. Driving, dancing and exercise classes are also planned.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unidentified correspondent video report -- from the </F> "Regional News Hookup" program]    [Text] [Correspondent] In 1994, financial organs in Tibet  will gradually bring their operations in line with national  practices and make strategic preparations for financial reform.  Based on the principle of vigorously promoting sustained, rapid,  and healthy development of Tibet's economy, financial  departments in Tibet will give full play to their role in  overall financial regulation and control and in optimizing the  allocation of resources. As for this year's work, they will  give priority to increasing credits and funds for rural and  pastoral areas and to offering assistance to poverty-stricken  areas.    [Video shows a person speaking into a microphone and a  caption saying he is Ouzhu Lanjie (2962 3796 2597 2638), deputy  director of the People's Bank of China Tibet Branch]    [Begin recording] [Ouzhu Lanjie] As far as the entire  nation is concerned, 1994 is a very important year for the  reform of the financial system. The general outline for reform  of the national financial system has been drawn up and reform  measures will be carried out this year. However, because it is  different from other regions, Tibet is still at the preparatory  stage of financial reform. We must carry out these financial  reform measures to follow the general trend. In coordination  with reform by financial institutions, we have made some  important adjustments in Tibet's financial work this year.  These adjustments will be focused on financial work in rural  and pastoral areas. Based on the guidelines of the CPC Central  Committee's Financial Work Conference and Rural Work Conference,  and the National Financial Work Conference, we have increased  our investment in farming and animal husbandry sector. Last  year, we increased credits for farming and animal husbandry  sector by 16.7 percent over the previous year. This year, on  the basis of such a high percentage of increase last year, we  will increase the investment of credits in farming and animal  husbandry sector by 30 percent over last year. The investment  of credits in village and town enterprises will be even greater.  We will increase the credits for village and town enterprises  by 37 percent from last year.    Farming and animal husbandry sector is a very important part  of Tibet's economy. We should focus our financial work on  farming and animal husbandry sector and increase credits for  farming and animal husbandry production in rural and pastoral  areas. We will extend more loans on easy terms to the farming  and animal husbandry sector. Moreover, we have made a careful  and complete plan to help poverty- stricken rural and pastoral  areas shake off poverty and improve their living standards. We  arranged a low-interest loan with far more favorable conditions  than other kinds of loans to help poor areas. At the same time,  banks and credit cooperatives at all levels will pay special  attention to assist-the-poor work and make the best use of the  funds for eliminating poverty. [end recording]</p>

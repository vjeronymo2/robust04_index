			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / A labyrinth of loopholes: There will be no easy victory in the EU's war against fraud in the payment of subsidies and grants To many people, the European Union represents not fraternal partnership, but fingers in the till. Now, as the fraud bill mounts, Europe is getting tough. At a meeting in Brussels of EU finance ministers this week, Mr Peter Schmidhuber, the Union's budget commissioner, spelt out measures to stem the flow of cash being wasted through fraud and other financial irregularities. This is officially put at Ecu343m (Pounds 264m) last year, 63 per cent up on 1992, but is thought by many experts to be at least 10 times higher at about 5 per cent of the EU's annual Ecu70bn budget. The full extent of the financial deception is difficult to calculate. But the evident scale of the problem - often the result of loopholes in labyrinthine EU spending rules - is triggering mounting concern in finance ministries across Europe. Nowhere is the angst felt more keenly than in Germany, the largest contributor to EU funds. Reacting to public concern in this election year that large amounts of this money are being wasted, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, has signalled that Bonn will take a tough line on EU fraud when it takes over the Union's presidency on July 1. Mr Per Brix Knudsen, a tough-talking Dane who heads Uclaf, the Commission's anti-fraud unit, sums up Brussels thinking: 'The image that the European Union is prone to fraud is used increasingly to discredit Union policies. We must put more effort into protecting the EU's financial interests.' Mr Knudsen is spearheading efforts to reduce the losses, including a doubling in the staff of Uclaf (the word is a French acronym) from 50 to 100 by the end of the year. He is setting up a telephone hotline on which members of the public across Europe can report instances of fraud in confidence. The Commission is also on course to finalise by June 1 a package of 'administrative sanctions' which would empower member states to impose fines on companies and individuals suspected of misappropriating EU cash before there has been any resort to court proceedings. Mr Knudsen is not alone in his efforts. The Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors, the EU's main financial watchdog, has acquired new powers to take legal action against the Commission and member states if it thinks they are failing to act against fraud. Although he admits he faces an uphill struggle, Mr Andre Middelhoek, the Dutch president of the court, promises to be 'blunt and undiplomatic' in attributing responsibility. 'None of the member states are keen enough' to tackle fraud, he says. Instrumental in bringing the problem to the attention of member states has been Professor Klaus Tiedemann, a criminologist at Freiburg University in Germany who has studied pan-European abuse of government money for 20 years. According to Prof Tiedemann, between 7 per cent and 10 per cent of the Union's budget is wasted through fraud and improper exploitation of loopholes. He bases his figures on detailed inquiries into sectors such as agricultural goods, iron and steel, and social funds - all of which receive EU subsidies and other funding. Prof Tiedemann admits his overall figure is a 'guesstimate', but it is one viewed as broadly correct by other experts. Commission staff admit the amount of fraud is higher than the published figure, but say the full extent is impossible to assess accurately. According to Uclaf, EU frauds worth Ecu976m were reported between 1990 and 1993. Of this, nearly half - Ecu446m - involved funds spent in Italy. Germany accounted for Ecu204m, France Ecu97m, Britain Ecu85m, Belgium Ecu32m, Greece Ecu29m and the Netherlands Ecu25m. The reason most commonly given for the scale of the problem is the EU's complex rules for administering subsidies, especially to farmers. This funding accounts for half the budget despite attempts to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. With an estimated 3m farm-related cash transactions a year eligible either for a direct payment to a farmer or an 'export refund' to a company processing or transporting food, the opportunities for financial abuse are immense. Various methods are used, some sophisticated, others touching on farce (see box). For instance, prosecutors in Rotterdam have started proceedings against a gang of six arrested last year on suspicion of routing 120 lorry loads of sugar, supposedly meant for Croatia and Slovenia, to Italy. By forging customs documents, the gang - based in France, Italy and the Netherlands - allegedly dodged duties worth about Ecu1.8m. In the UK, two brothers, both farmers, inflated the number of sheep they owned from 18 to 180, so gaining a higher EU subsidy. By repeatedly pretending to be each other, the brothers sidestepped for some time inquiries from the UK's Ministry of Agriculture. Ultimately they were taken to court and fined a total of Pounds 6,000. In another case, two cattle dealers based in Northern Ireland were jailed in 1992 for having made about Pounds 20m from smuggling 22,000 cattle backwards and forwards across the border into the Republic of Ireland. They arranged the transfers to tie in with shifts in the pound/punt exchange rate and so exploit EU subsidies linked to currency movements. More recently, the Italian authorities arrested a gang in southern Italy for allegedly defrauding the EU of up to Ecu200m by gaining payment for wheat which they claimed was in EU commodity warehouses but which, it appears, may not have existed. The case is in the early stages of prosecution. In another case, fraudsters in Rome and Naples are alleged by the Commission to have claimed Ecu22m over several years by pretending to arrange non-existent training programmes. Many observers cite the lack of incentives (such as a significant financial reward) for member states to report irregularities as a second reason why fraud is rife. In some cases, there may even be disincentives to report irregularities: EU subsidies, whether gained legally or not, may be playing an important part in stimulating the economies of poorer regions. A third reason, according to Mr Malcolm Levitt, a former EU official who is now European adviser at Barclays Bank, is that the Commission has a 'collegial' culture with too few people taking responsibility for financial controls. As to which countries are most lax on fighting fraud, Commission officials have been reluctant to assign blame. However, the mood in Brussels is beginning to change, with a growing inclination to name countries suspected of being less than diligent in this area. In the vanguard of this trend is Germany, the EU's biggest paymaster with a net contribution in 1992 of DM22bn (Pounds 8.8bn), a figure likely to grow to DM30bn by 1997, according to Bundesbank forecasts. With the country facing a DM112bn budget deficit this year (about 3.5 per cent of gross domestic product), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is under pressure to tackle any waste of money by Brussels. In this, Bonn has found allies in Netherlands and Denmark, as well as the UK government. Mr Waigel discussed the need to raise awareness of EU fraud with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, last month. While German government officials are reluctant to name those countries most prone to fraud, Prof Tiedemann says 'empirical studies over the past decade have shown southern member states to be more inclined to fraud than those in the north'. Mr Peter Price, a British Tory member of the European Parliament and a former chairman of its budgetry control committee, singles out Italy and Greece. Such observations, though echoing fraud experts, touch a nerve with the countries named. An Italian government official responds that Italy takes 'an extremely serious' view of fraud, while a Greek government official says: 'These comments are not borne out by statistics.' A less restrained approach to discussing the problem is one way of highlighting it. As for practical steps, Mr Schmidhuber is pressing for closer co-operation between the Commission's fraud unit, Uclaf, and national police and customs forces. Many of the 50 newcomers to Uclaf will be former police or customs officers skilled in tracking international criminals. The unit is currently co-ordinating investigations into between 30 and 70 large-scale European frauds. Over the next few years, Uclaf may be helped by a shift in the pattern of EU farm payments. By the end of the decade, according to Mr Brian Gardner, of the Brussels-based farm consultancy EPA Associates, 80 per cent of the payments - twice the current proportion - will go straight to farmers, and only 20 per cent to companies processing or transporting food. He believes the new system should be easier for the police because keeping track of payments to fixed establishments such as farms should be simpler than tracking payments to companies moving goods around Europe. Despite these initiatives and the assertive mood in Brussels, the anti-fraud effort faces several constraints. Today's enthusiasm may quickly give way to ennui. One sceptic is Ms Annemarie Goedmakers, a Dutch socialist MEP and member of the budgetry control committee, who says Brussels is putting on a 'big show' of talking tough about fraud but has not been resolute enough in tackling it. Other sceptics doubt the Court of Auditors has a suitably efficient structure to identify the main perpetrators of fraud. Court policies are set by 12 officials - one from each member state - who meet each Thursday, and who may have different degrees of enthusiasm about following up specific instances of alleged fraud. The court's reports (which never name parties allegedly involved in fraud) are felt by some observers to lack the cutting edge of, for instance, the General Accounting Office in Washington, which monitors US government spending. In addition, many frauds are inherently complex and difficult to prosecute - especially given the current lack of harmony in anti-fraud legislation across the EU. At present only about 10 per cent of the EU frauds reported each year end up in the courts, and few observers expect the figure to rise significantly. All these difficulties suggest the EU's fraud fight is likely to be won only slowly. Few insiders think there are merits in devising grandiose initiatives - such as a pan-European police squad concerned with fraud  - which could lead to a duplication of efforts and antagonise member states. As EU officials contemplate what to do about fraud, the uncomfortable thought occurs that the planned enlargement of the Union - Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden are lined up for entry next year - may make matters still worse. The entry of these nations, whatever their commitment to fighting fraud, will increase the complexity of the methods needed to decide and supervise EU subsidies. Unless effective action is agreed soon to combat irregular payments, what one observer calls the 'black hole' down which money is now disappearing could soon develop into a chasm.</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Accountants fight ruling over Polly Peck work TWO top accountants are fighting a temporary suspension ruling preventing them undertaking new insolvency work, triggered by their appointment as administrators to Polly Peck International. Mr Michael Jordan and Mr Richard Stone of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, are being scrutinised for breaches in ethical guidelines by accepting the appointment when their firm had conducted work for PPI and Mr Asil Nadir, its fugitive former chairman. The work included offshore trust management and personal tax advice to Mr Nadir, and advice to the company in the late 1980s on accounting methods for its substantial foreign currency earnings which were quite legal but boosted assets and profits. The details emerged as Mr George Staple, head of the Serious Fraud Office, backed its handling of the prosecution against Mr Nadir. In a BBC television interview, he said defendants in large fraud trials 'are not short of resources and use all means at their disposal for their defence'. At Westminster there remained more general concern about the SFO. The attorney-general, Sir Nicholas Lyell, was said to have raised with Mr Staple the question of whether the SFO gave the media advance information about arrests. In further fall-out after the resignation speech of Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, on Tuesday, Labour called for a statement from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on the alleged breach of confidentiality by a senior Inland Revenue investigator in referring to the SFO the affairs of Mr Nadir. The Revenue said last night that the allegation was 'complete news to us'. Mr Stone, head of corporate finance at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and Mr Jordan, head of the insolvency arm, were last October each fined the then maximum Pounds 1,000 by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales for breaching guidelines stating insolvency practitioners should not be appointed to a company with which their firm had 'a continuing professional relationship'. The matter was taken up by the insolvency licensing committee of the institute, which met in secret but it is believed to have resolved to recommend a temporary suspension on some new insolvency appointments by the two men. Coopers &amp; Lybrand appealed, and a review committee chaired by Mr Clive Parritt, senior partner of accountants Baker Tilly, has now made a judgment on the appeal, which is expected to be made public on Monday.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Information Minister Michel Samahah with </F> unidentified correspondents following a Cabinet meeting in  Beirut--live]    [Excerpts] [Samahah] The Cabinet held its weekly meeting  under the prime minister this evening. At the outset the  Cabinet discussed the situation in the country, security, and  the media. It then discussed its agenda and approved most of  the topics, including the amendment of Legislative Decree No.  104/77 governing the publication law. The Cabinet approved two  bills on concluding agreements between Lebanon and France on a  cooperation protocol signed in Paris on 14 October 1993 and a  cultural, scientific, and technical cooperation agreement signed  in Paris on 14 October 1993.    The Cabinet approved a draft decree amending Article 14 of  the lending law at the Agricultural, Industrial, and Land  Lending Bank. It approved a decree transferring and appointing  editors and clerks in some public departments. It also approved  four decrees pertaining to the potable water authorities of  al-Batrun, al-Miyah wa Miyah, 'Akkar, and al-Kurah.    The Cabinet formed the National Authority on Childhood and  approved a memorandum of understanding with the Kingdom of Saudi  Arabia under which the Kingdom will give Lebanon $100 million to  finance reconstruction projects.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] The Cabinet did not discuss this subject.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] Several amendments were made to the appeals  attorney general's right under Article 23 to confiscate  publications without suspending them. A mechanism for quick  trials has been adopted and fines have been increased. The  NATIONAL NEWS AGENCY will tonight release the amended bill  approved by the government.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] This topic, which has caused an uproar, is  groundless. Neither the government nor the information minister  have thought of banning plays on television and radio. Whoever  watches private Lebanese stations listens to all kinds of plays.  In the media bill being prepared [words indistinct], it is one  the articles being discussed by the ministerial committee on  radio and television media. Emphasis is placed on the need for  national theatrical production in every field. [passage omitted  on the theater and culture]    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] I believe the mission is big. It does not concern  a person or a minister. It does not concern the Cabinet or the  ministerial committee. We are striving to accelerate things  with the necessary speed. I hope we will finish as soon as  possible.    [Correspondent] [words indistinct]    [Samahah] We are awaiting a Cabinet decision. This decision  [words indistinct] television and radio law after it is issued  by the Chamber of Deputies. I hope this law will be issued  soon. It is difficult to imagine Lebanon with only one company  and once voice. But all companies and all radios must adhere to  instructions.</p>

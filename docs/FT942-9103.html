			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (9): Privates on parade  -Pat Kimber studies electricity reform in the UAE The United Arab Emirates, in common with many Gulf states, is affected by the continuing low oil revenues. So for the past few months there has been talk of privatisation and the introduction of independent power producers (IPPs). Privatisation, it is argued, would release funds for other projects, cut bureaucracy and speed decision-making. The opposing arguments are practical and emotional. They include the difficulties of private sector involvement in a complex power-producing system and a previously unchallenged policy of cheap electricity for the people. But now things are changing. An official announcement that the government is to finance a study on the privatisation of public utilities came on the heels of the federal Ministry of Electricity &amp; Water's (MEW) hint that it will phase out subsidies. Tariffs have remained unchanged since federation in 1971, with no regard to power costs or inflation. Electricity prices will now begin to be raised - initially from two US cents to a still very low three cents a unit. Close attention has been paid to what the neighbours are doing. British Gas in Bahrain and international group UPGI in Oman are already building gas turbine plants. In Qatar the government has set up a private company which will eventually run all its power stations. Rumours have been circulating in Dubai that private sector companies are ready to construct power plants on the build-operate-transfer (BOT) and build-own-operate (BOO) systems, so popular in the Far East. It is not surprising that Dubai - the long-established trading centre of the region - should be the prime mover on privatisation since it has four separate power and water authorities. The UAE was formed by the federation of seven emirates - Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Fujeirah, Ajman, Ras Al Khaimah and Umm Al Qwain. Before federation each emirate had its own utility and it was assumed that the newly set-up MEW would take responsibility for the whole country. It never came about. The three large emirates of Abu Dhabi, Dubai and Sharjah still run their own electricity organisations while MEW looks after the four smaller emirates which have comparatively little income and very scattered populations. MEW's budget this year is around Dollars 100m, according to minister Humaid bin Nasser Al Owais. This will provide another 150 megawatts in the northern emirates which the federal ministry administrates. MEW is headquartered in the federal capital, the city of Abu Dhabi, under minister Al Owais. The deputy minister, Saaed Majid Al Shamsi, works mainly from Dubai. 'MEW is politically responsible for electricity and water,' he said. 'We represent the UAE internationally - for instance on negotiations for the proposed Gulf grid project. We also cooperate with the electricity companies in the three large emirates - especially on tariffs which are highly subsidised throughout the country.' Of the UAE's entire total installed capacity of 5,500MW, some 900MW is controlled by MEW and is mostly gas turbines with 130MW from diesel generating sets in the more remote areas. It is also responsible for a 132 kilovolt transmission network which is being upgraded by UK consultants Ewbank Preece. Power in Abu Dhabi emirate (including the city) is looked after by its own Water and Electricity Department (WED). The WED is now in the process of adding some 1,000MW to its present generating capacity of 2,440MW. By far the largest slice of this will come from the Dollars 1.8bn 732MW Al Taweelah B power and desalination plant - an extension to the original 253MW Al Taweelah A commissioned in 1985. Al Taweelah B is being built by a consortium headed by Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss multinational, and including ABB Kraftwerke of Mannheim, SAE Sadelmi of Italy and Six Construct of Belgium. Tractebel of Belgium is the consulting engineer for the project which will be the world's largest power and desalination station when it comes on stream in 1996. There is certain to be yet another extension and ABB looks to be a frontrunner for this contract when it is announced. Other WED power projects under construction include Medina Zayed (60MW), the 200MW Abu Dhabi main power station extension and 100MW at Al Ain. A 200MW gas turbine station with desalination plant is also being built in Mifra by a consortium led by Ansaldo Energia with gas turbines by Siemens. Deutsche Babcock of Germany has a Dollars 74m contract to undertake power station maintenance and refurbishment work. WED has commissioned UK consultants Kennedy &amp; Donkin (recently merged with the US Rust organisation) to study existing transmission networks and make recommendations for future demand. Ewbank Preece is overseeing two new 220kv links and the enhancement of an existing 220kv overhead line system. Proposals to build a load despatch centre to monitor all the water and electricity flows in Abu Dhabi emirate have finally been accepted by WED. The Dollars 90m contract has been awarded to ABB. Electricite de France (EdF) is consultant for the project which will involve a regional centre in Al Ain. Power Measurement of Australia is supplying instruments to monitor the grid system. Sharjah is in a construction boom reminiscent of Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The Sharjah Electricity and Water Department (SEWD) currently produces some 700MW, nearly all from its Layyah station in Sharjah town. Two General Electric Frame 9E gas turbine units and additional desalination plant are now being installed. This will help to meet the high summer peak when the 24-hour air conditioning demand often overwhelms the emirate's ability to cope with a rapidly increasing population attracted by the rapid building programme. Distribution remains a problem on a network which started life supplying power to the long-departed British forces base and airfield. A new link is to be built from the Sajaa gas field to Layyah and further major power line installations are planned. Dubai has seen a phenomenal growth in its power supply since the first lights were switched on in 1961. The recently set-up Dubai Electricity &amp; Water Authority (DEWA) has grown out of the Dubai Electricity Company which dates back to 1959. Capacity was then just 1.4MW from privately owned generators. Now it is nearly 2,000MW and increasing, as more plants come on stream this year. In March, the 457MW Jebel Ali G power and desalination station built by a Siemens-led consortium was fully commissioned. Jebel Ali E is undergoing a Dollars 81m conversion to combined cycle by a consortium led by ABB Kraftwerke. Kennedy &amp; Donkin is consultant for the project which includes ABB SAE Sadelmi for civil works and boiler supply by Combustion Engineering (Italiana). The extension will add two waste heat recovery boilers to the GE Frame 9E gas turbines installed in 1992. The much-talked-about Jebel Ali H is almost certain to appear in DEWA's plans before the year is out. Dubai's primary 132kv transmission system voltage has been reinforced by a 400kv network utilising the latest technology. The construction work was undertaken by the National Thermal Power Company of India (NTPC) which has recently opened an office in Dubai to supervise its increased workload in the emirates. Last year, DEWA was frequently in danger of having to cut power supply. This would have been a severe blow for the extremely efficient utility and for the people of Dubai who enjoy a highly-sophisticated lifestyle. Kennedy &amp; Donkin is advising DEWA on upgrading its control and management systems but the possibility of black-outs has forced power engineers into thinking that yet another large station, either combined cycle or steam turbines, must be sanctioned. It could be the UAE's first IPP. Pat Kimber is editor of Middle East Electricity</p>

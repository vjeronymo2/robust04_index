			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Management: Baroness takes the wheel With women setting up in business at a faster rate than men, it is perhaps fitting that Britain's new small firms minister is a woman, Baroness Denton of Wakefield. Baroness Denton, aged 56, has for the past five years been deputy chairman of the Black Country Development Corporation, a job which exposed her to the problems of small businesses. She has also held a number of company directorships, and spent three years from 1969 to 1972 as a professional racing and rally driver. The appointment coincides with moving small firms from the Department of Employment back to the Department of Trade and Industry. Small firms groups hope that under a more interventionist minister in the shape of Michael Heseltine the government may undertake a more active small firms policy. The DTI ministerial team possesses unrivalled small firms experience in the shape of Tim Eggar, a former small firms minister, and Neil Hamilton, vice chairman of the Small Business Bureau and a keen supporter of small business causes. Small business groups are concerned about the breadth of Baroness Denton's responsibilities, which include industry, the environment and (within the department) equal opportunities issues. A second worry is the enthusiasm which Michael Heseltine has expressed for the continental European model of statutory chambers of commerce.</p>

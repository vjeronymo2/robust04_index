			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk declines NOVO NORDISK, Denmark's leading biotechnology company, reported first-quarter pre-tax profits down by 14 per cent to DKr405m (Dollars 65m) from DKr470m. The group, whose leading products are insulin and other healthcare products and industrial enzymes, pointed out that it had an exceptionally good first quarter last year. Group sales were ahead by 3 per cent to DKr2.75bn from DKr2.66bn last year. The increase was achieved despite the fact that appreciation of the krone reduced the average value of invoicing currencies by about 3 per cent, said Novo. Net profits fell 6 per cent to DKr304m from DKr324m, and earnings per share to DKr8.11 from DKr8.74. Healthcare sales rose 6 per cent to DKr1.83bn, while sales by the bio-industrial division were down by DKr5m to DKr814m.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries fall sharply on rise in US business index A MUCH bigger-than-expected rise in the National Association of Purchasing Management's index of business activity sent Treasury prices plunging yesterday across the maturity range. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 1 1/4 at 101 3/32 , yielding 7.897 per cent. The two-year note was also markedly weaker, down  11/32 at 99 7/8 , yielding 5.426 per cent. The price movements flattened the yield curve, narrowing the spread between the yields on the two-year note and 30-year bond from 255 basis points to 247 basis points. Prices held their own at the opening, but nose-dived after the NAPM announced that its February index had risen from 47.4 per cent to 52.4 per cent, an indication that the manufacturing sector of industry expanded last month. The rise in the index was way above market forecasts, which even at the most bullish end had expected that the figure would remain below 50 per cent, and prompted many dealers to start liquidating long positions built up during last week's short-lived rally. The big rise in the index deflated hopes for another interest rate cut, and backed up arguments by Federal Reserve officials that the economic recovery was underway. UK government bond prices fell by as much as a quarter of a percentage point yesterday as hopes of an imminent cut in the base rate began to fade. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt fell from 116 1/2 to 116 9/32 , while the Liffe gilt futures contract moved in a range of 97.31 to 98.08, trading at 98.03 by late afternoon, down from the opening of 98.07. The market expects the Bank of England to announce further gilt issues this week now that its Pounds 1.25bn tap is exhausted, with short-dated issues the favourite candidates. German government bonds drifted lower yesterday in thin trade, following the US market's weakness. Traders said the low volumes are due to the Carnival holiday, but added that in the absence of significant economic data, the market is waiting for progress in the wage negotiations. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.26 and traded in a range of 88.12 to 88.28 on a volume of about 27,000 contracts which is well below the daily average. Japanese government bonds ended the day lower on light volumes as participants wait for signs of an easing in monetary policy. Traders said that in the short-term attention would focus on the Bank of Japan's quarterly 'Tankan' survey of business sentiment and on the US employment figures - due to be released on Friday. The Tankan is expected to show that economic growth is slowing down. However, dealers believe that the Bank of Japan is unlikely to cut the official discount rate until next week at the earliest as the central bank governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, will be out of the country from March 5 to March 11. Meanwhile, dealers expect government debt to trade in a narrow range. The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield of 5.365 per cent and ended at 5.395 per cent on a volume of about Y230bn, well below average.</p>

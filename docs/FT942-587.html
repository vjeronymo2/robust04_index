			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A strong rally in international bond markets reversed an initial poor performance by index futures yesterday, writes Steve Thompson. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 index began the session under intense pressure around the 2,859 level, with marketmakers already positioned to see the cash market fall to 2,800 and reacting to an early sell-off in the gilt- But with no fresh crisis developing in currencies, where the dollar bounced from its lowest level against the Japanese currency since the Second World War, a firmer trend in bonds produced a similar performance in the futures. After reaching a session low-point of 2,852, September rallied to the day's high point of 2,917, before ending the session at 2,912. Turnover in the FT-SE future was an unremarkable 16,681 contracts. In a fairly pedestrian traded options sector one of the London market's biggest agency brokers bought 3,500 September 2,825 calls in the FT-SE 100 option. Elsewhere, activity was relatively light with Land Securities the most active stock option with 1,354 contracts traded, followed by SmithKline Beecham 'A', with 1,174 lots dealt and Ladbroke where turnover reached 1,000 contracts. Total volume at the close was 31,818 lots.</p>

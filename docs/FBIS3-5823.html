The author of the article says:    Today our socialism is giving full play to its advantages  and  vitality as socialism with a strong chuche character, which was  chosen by our people themselves and has been built by them with  their own efforts, because it fully embodies the chuche idea.    The chuche character of our socialism finds clear  expression,  above all, in that all the lines and policies, strategies and  tactics are worked out from the stand of chuche and they are  carried into practice to the letter.    In our country today all the lines and policies of the party  and the state are shaped in conformity with the aspirations and  demand of our people and the specific conditions of the country  on the basis of the chuche idea. The dear leader who regards  the people as his teacher and respects their will to the maximum  makes it a rule always to find himself among them and work out  all the lines and policies in conformity with their aspirations  and demand. All the lines and policies of the party and the  state in our country serve for the creative life of the popular  masses and contribute to the increase of the chuche character of  our-style socialism.    The chuche character of our socialism also finds  manifestation in regarding the popular masses as the driving  force of socialist construction and resolving everything by  enhancing their role.    The question of bringing up the popular masses to be the  driving force of socialist construction has been successfully  solved in our country under the wise guidance of the dear  leader. He gives scientific answers to the questions raised by  the times and revolution with his extraordinary intelligence and  energetic ideological and theoretical activities and guides the  popular masses to keep the socialist idea as their creed. He  has brought up our people to be a people strong in independence  by guiding them to break through difficulties and trials in  their way by their own efforts in the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance with high consciousness of being the driving force  of socialist construction.    The strong chuche character of our socialism is powerfully  demonstrated in that it is confidently advancing along its path,  not wavering under any circumstances.    Ours is a people who have keenly realized in the course of  building socialism under the leadership of the party that only  socialism provides them with genuine freedom and happiness and  the cause of socialism is invincible.    The imperialists' moves to blockade and stifle our socialist  system politically, economically and militarily, hating it as a  thorn in the flesh, have been intensified as never before. But  our people are taking great strides in socialist construction,  united around the dear leader in one mind.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Staff Field Marshal President Saddam Husayn,  commander in chief of the Armed Forces, has met with several  heroic fighters and officials who had the honor of taking part  in the execution of Operation Blessed Ramadan, the operation  carried out to liberate al- Faw, the city of sacrifice and the  gate of great victory.    The leader president received the congratulations of the  heroic fighters at a hall bedecked with the flag of great Iraq.  The flag had the name of martyr Staff General 'Adnan  Khayrallah, whose death was a loss to the people and the Armed  Forces, engraved on it in appreciation of his efforts to build  the Armed Forces and enable them to defend great Iraq and  vindicate its sovereignty and territories, and also in  recognition of the great pioneering role he played in the  liberation of al-Faw.    The president received the great fighters Staff General  Husayn Kamil Hasan, who was in charge of the Republican Guards;  Brigadier General 'Abd Hamid Mahmud, who was the president's  escort; Udayy Saddam Husayn and Qusayy Saddam Husayn, whose  involvement in the battle was ordered by the leader, may God  protect him, so they may perform their duties toward the  homeland; the staff of the Armed Forces General Command; the  Army Corps and division commanders who had the honor of  contributing to the liberation of al-Faw; and escorts of his  excellency the president, may God protect him.    The leader president, may God grant him certain victory,  offered his congratulations on this eternal occasion to the sons  of his steadfast people, as well as the personnel affiliated  with his valiant Armed Forces. He recalled this splendid epic  waged by the Iraqis and the Armed Forces personnel in defense of  their territories, sovereignty, and independence. He also  commended their efforts to safeguard land and honor.    The president, may God protect him, evoked God's mercy on  the  souls of the martyrs who fell on the territory of al-Faw. He  also expressed his affection for their families, noting  appreciation for their positions. He said that the state, the  homeland, and the march are thankful to these patient families.    His excellency the president, may God grant him victory,  delivered a valuable and comprehensive speech, addressing the  injustice done to Iraqis and Arabs when they were branded as  people who are incapable of regaining lost territory.  Nonetheless, al-Faw was the beginning. In al-Faw, there was a  clash of two wills. And in this clash, one will was defeated  and a city was liberated without any (?political) move and  without the intervention of any external factors, the president  said.    In this clash, the aggressive will was [words indistinct].  It recognized in writing that it was defeated. It wished that  it had never lived to see what happened on the war front.    His excellency the president, may God protect him, also  spoke  on the Iraqis' patience and jihad in the course of their efforts  to cope with the embargo, reaffirming that the good is coming,  not because the evildoers intend to remove evil, but rather  because the evil hand that is gripping the sword by the blade  will find itself compelled to release the sword's blade when its  owner pulls it forcefully.</p>

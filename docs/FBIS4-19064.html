			<p>BFN     [Text] Mentana, Fede, and Liguori, the chief editors of the  news bulletins broadcast on the three Fininvest-controlled  television channels [Canale Cinque, Retequattro, and Italia Uno]  handed in their resignations a short time ago as a protest  against the statements made by Franco Tato, the managing  director of the Fininvest group. He told a newspaper that if  the Mammi Law [telecommunications law approved last year by  parliament] did not exist, he would have cancelled all the news  and information programs on the three channels.</p>

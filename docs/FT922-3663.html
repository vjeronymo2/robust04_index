			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenyan tea production declines 16.8% KENYA'S TEA output dropped by more than 11m kg in the first quarter of this year compared with the corresponding period of 1991, according to African Tea Brokers, an influential brokerage, reports Reuter from Cianda, Kenya. ATB said that the cumulative crop figure at the end of April stood at 56.58m kg, a decline of 11.43m kg, or 16.8 per cent, compared with the first quarter of 1991. Tea harvested in April dropped by more than 5m kg, or 29 per cent against the same month last year. ATB said widespread seasonal rain had been reported from all tea growing districts and the crop had responded well. 'But in some areas growth had been inhibited by low temperatures'. 'Showers have ceased and leaf intake has shown some decline but is still fairly heavy. With milder weather leaf intake will show a marked progressive improvement,' ATB said. Tea is Kenya's second biggest foreign exchange earner after coffee, bringing the economy Dollars 265m in 1991. ATB said 128,722 packages were sold at an average price of Dollars 1.65 in four sales in April, compared with 164,434 at Dollars 1.45 in April 1991. The packages are between 40-60 kg depending on quality. Brokers said in the first two sales there was strong demand, and prices were buoyant, particularly for brighter teas. In the latter auctions prices declined. Britain and Pakistan were the main buyers. Mr George Saitoti, the finance minister told parliament last week that growth in tea production last year was 2.5 per cent, the lowest in the past five years. Tea production rose to a record 202m kg in 1991 from 197m kg in 1990.</p>

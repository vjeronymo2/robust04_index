			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Japan hints at rice ban compromise JAPAN WILL not allow its ban on rice imports to stand in the way of successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, made clear this weekend. 'We must never spoil multinational trade talks,' he said, after reshuffling his cabinet on Friday. Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, reinforced Mr Miyazawa's comments, saying: 'Unless the government makes a decision on fundamental principles about the rice issue within this year or by early next year, the Round will not be completed successfully.' Mr Miyazawa's indication that he would be prepared for Japan to replace its ban on rice imports with a set of import tariffs marks an important change in the government's public approach to an issue which has become a central obstacle to completing the Gatt trade talks. Until last week the government had insisted that it would not compromise on its demand that the rice ban be excluded from proposals made by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director general, that all import restrictions should be replaced by tariffs. However, Mr Miyazawa's comments suggest he is seeking to capitalise on the political momentum of the reshuffle to swing policy towards a compromise. The move is likely to provoke a storm of protest from Japan's rice farmers who form an important part of the governing Liberal Democratic party's rural support. Government officials indicated that a final decision on how to replace the ban with a set of tariffs would be taken by early in the new year. The focus will shift to whether the government can reach a compromise with the farmers over measures to offset the competition from imports. It is thought likely that Japan will press for tariffs as high as 700 per cent and for them to be subsequently reduced more slowly than under the current Dunkel schedule. Mr Miyazawa said the government would make sure farmers could continue to work in security, possibly by providing financial assistance to promote the rationalisation of agriculture to create larger more efficient farms.</p>

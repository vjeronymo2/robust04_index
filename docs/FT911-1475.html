			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / A way of telling tales out of court: A moneymaking proposition for spreading enlightment I AM TOLD that people read the front half of the Weekend FT to discover information which could enable them to increase their income, and this end of the paper merely to be entertained. So I hope I'm not speaking out of place if I suggest in this column a business proposition which I have long been convinced would enrich anyone who acted on it. My suggestion is the mass marketing of reports from the Law Courts in tabloid form. But, unlike the tabloids themselves, there would be no comment, bowdlerisation or sensationalisation - subscribers would have the great satisfaction of knowing that they were actually reading the truth about acts of corruption, horror and rascality, rather than a figment or fragment. It is true that the 'heavy' papers publish unvarnished law reports, but these are highly selective, often woefully abridged, and, besides, are buried in an inky morass of other news which no one is really interested in: such as whether the Kurds' haven is safe enough for John Major to be able to sleep at night, or the state of Paul Gascoigne's physiognomy, or whether there will be growth in the spring, or when political journalists think political pundits think MPs think the prime minister thinks he might hold the next general election. This is something which is approximately five stages from reality, and on which people are apparently prepared to spend good money to read. How much more potent and commercial is the cold truth of the courtroom. On Thursday alone, for example, there was a spate of abridged reports of different cases spread across the newspapers, which, consolidated into one tabloid, would provide at least an hour's gripping reading and provoke thought that would last the rest of the day. I have space for only two here. First, in Thursday's Daily Telegraph there is Ravenscroft v Rederiaktiebologet Transatlantic, in which the mother of an employee crushed by a runaway forklift truck was awarded Pounds 16,500 damages for 'remote shock,' although she did not see the accident, was not present at her son's death in hospital, and did not see his body immediately afterwards. But two psychiatrists agreed that she was suffering 'a prolonged grief reaction as defined by the International Classification of Disease Code 309.1 (HMSO 9241540044 and 9241540052). All very interesting in the light of yesterday's decision by the courts in Liverpool not to award similar damages to the parents of those crushed to death in the Sheffield football ground tragedy, even those parents who witnessed the horror live on television. Second, this from Thursday's Independent, detailing the case of C in the Chancery Division (Court of Protection): the court, in the form of that most amiable and sensible of judges, Lennie Hoffmann, decided to make a will and dispose immediately of large chunks of C's considerable fortune, to hospital authorities and relatives, because C, now 75, was born with such mental retardation that, the court decided, she had 'lacked testamentary capacity since birth.' The report stated that 'immediate gifts of Pounds 100,000 to the friends of the hospital and Pounds 400,000 to family were ordered.' Very nice, too. I couldn't help wondering, though, whether C's family had any role in the development of the case. And I noticed that the wealthy Miss C has been a long-term patient in a National Health Service hospital. And since Miss C's pre-mortem bequests were made by order of the court on the basis of what she would have wanted, had her mind been normal, whether it might not also have considered that C would have wanted instead to spend her own money on her own comfort in a luxurious private hospital. Miss C was described as 'enjoying music, the sound of birds, the smell of flowers.' Mr Justice Hoffmann should at least have ensured that a world-renowned string quartet be paid top dollar to come and play at her bedside every Saturday night. Now, imagine cases like these distributed through your letter-box daily, with no editorial and no advertisements. It is the business opportunity of a lifetime; but to anyone who exploits the idea from this copyrighted column, and fails to pay me commission, I have a message: see you in court, and read all about it.

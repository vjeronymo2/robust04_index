			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: BCE Pounds 56,000 in the red BCE Holdings, the USM-quoted distributor of snooker, billiards and pool products, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 56,000 for the year to March 31. The outcome compared with a profit of Pounds 34,000 last year and was struck on turnover down from Pounds 5.2m to Pounds 4.27m. Losses per share were 0.2p (0.2p earnings). Mr David Fisher, chairman, said the group had ceased its lossmaking manufacturing activities, the benefits of which would accrue in future years. He added that the reported upturn in the economy had yet to have an effect in the sale of snooker products, and low consumer spending made any material increase in arcade takings difficult to achieve, Mr Fisher said.</p>

			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A mother and her boyfriend were sought by San Diego County authorities in the  abandonment, abuse and molestation of 2-year-old twin brothers found in a Del  Mar hotel. The boyfriend, Charles Thomas McCoy, 27, of Phoenix, was identified  by one of the twins and Del Mar Inn employees who viewed a photo lineup, said  sheriff's Detective Mary Stables. The twins were being treated at a hospital  for sexual abuse and what Stables described as "deep bruises from hand imprints  on their faces -- like they were shoved; cuts on their necks and cigarette  burns on their stomachs and sides." The children would not say how they were  hurt, Stables said. The detective added that the mother, whose name was not  released, also was sought for questioning after she called the hospital,  requesting to see her children, but did not show up.  </P></p>

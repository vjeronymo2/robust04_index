			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / S African rate of inflation at 8.2% South Africa released worse than expected inflation figures yesterday, pushing bond yields past the the psychological barrier of 17 per cent, and putting heavy pressure on the government's ability to keep its annual deficit at a budgeted level of 6.4 per cent, Mark Suzman reports from Johannesburg. The Consumer Price Index for July rose at an annualised rate of 8.2 per cent, up from 7.5 per cent in June and a full percentage point above the 21-year low reached in April of 7.1 per cent. In response, rates on the government's benchmark R150 bond rose to 17.05 per cent yesterday morning before dropping back to finish the day at 16.76 per cent. Bond yields, which hit a low of 11.6 per cent in January, have been rising steadily since the April elections and have soared over the past few weeks, fuelled largely by fears of higher inflation and a lack of faith in government promises of fiscal restraint. Economists estimate that the recent rise in the bond market could add between R1bn and R1.5bn (Pounds 181m-Pounds 272m) to the government's interest bill, which already accounts for some 17 per cent of the total budget. Also contributing to the bear market is continuing uncertainty over the future of South Africa's two-tier currency. Government and monetary officials are publicly committed to scrapping the financial rand investment currency, a move that will almost certainly send short term interest rates rocketing, but have given no timetable for the move. As a result, the currency and bond markets are prey to continued activity by speculators trying to second guess the financial authorities.</p>

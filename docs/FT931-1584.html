			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Row over move to halt toxic cargo RECHEM, the waste management group, yesterday said it was surprised and disappointed by a request from Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, for his German counterpart to prevent a shipment of waste being transported to the UK. Earlier this week, Mr Howard asked Mr Klaus Topfer to ban the export of about 1,000 tonnes of hazardous waste from Hamburg to Rechem's incinerator in Pontypool, Gwent. 'The government appears to be marking out the pitch and then redrawing the lines during the match,' said Mr John Shaughnessy, external affairs manager at Rechem. 'The waste involved is entirely consistent with the range of materials for which we are licensed,' he added. Rechem, a subsidiary of Shanks &amp; McEwan, the UK's largest waste management group, said it had been in advanced negotiations with Boehringer Ingelheim, owner of the waste. It added that no specialist capacity appeared to be available in Germany. The German group said it was negotiating with a number of companies in Germany and other European countries to dispose of the waste.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Igor Porshnev, </F> Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksander Panov  told Interfax that although Pyongyang's withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency complicated matters, Russia  kept effective its call for an international conference on the  Korean peninsula.    In case no diplomatic solution was found for the nuclear  problem, Panov said, the UN Security Council should attach equal  importance to the call for an international conference and  possible sanctions against Pyongyang. Panov saw the problem as  extremely delicate.    He reminded Interfax that last year Pyongyang declared its  decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  One day before it was legally entitled to act on it, Pyongyang  suspended its decision. In other words, Panov said, it remained  party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty.    According to Panov, it was not Pyongyang's decision to  withdraw from the IAEA and Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that  called for sanctions. Sanctions were not introduced against a  country for this kind of decisions, Panov said, because any  country was privileged to join a treaty or withdraw from it.    According to Panov, the international community was  discontent with Pyongyang's failure to show good will and  cooperate with the IAEA. Day in and day out it remembered to  attach conditions to whether it would or would not allow  inspections of this or that facility, which translated,  according to Panov, into a refusal to meet its pledges under the  treaty and IAEA regulations even though it remained party to the  treaty and a member of the IAEA. As a result, the IAEA failed  to get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program and  moved to raise the issue of sanctions.    No IAEA report claimed Pyongyang had enough plutonium to  produce nuclear weapons. The IAEA only stated its inability to  get a full picture of the North Korean nuclear program, Panov  said.    In Panov's view, the possible introduction of anti-Pyongyang  sanctions should be, if anything, gradual. Instead of being  tough, the sanctions ought to spell a word of warning. They  must remind Pyongyang that the international community meant  business and wanted it to comply in good faith with its  commitments. The further course of action would depend on  Pyongyang.    Panov said that both Russia and its partners were interested  in a negotiated solution of the problem. The Russian call for  an international conference gained growing support, he said.    Panov saw media reports on plans for President Yeltsin's  visit to South Korea as premature. The recently-held  Russian-Korean summit failed to discuss that issue in detail, he  said, although President Kim Yong-sam had, indeed, invited his  Russian counterpart to visit Seoul and the invitation had been  accepted. The two national leaders agreed, though, Panov said,  that diplomatic officers would discuss when exactly the visit  was to take place.</p>

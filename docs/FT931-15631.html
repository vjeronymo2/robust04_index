			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / People: Sherlock takes to the road Peter Sherlock, who resigned suddenly from Bass last year, has been picked to succeed Jack Mather as chief executive of NFC. Mather, chief executive of the transport and logistics company since 1984, is retiring for health reasons. He underwent heart surgery three years ago and told the board last year he wanted to step down early. Now 56, he will leave after next month's annual meeting. Sherlock will be the most senior outside appointment to NFC's board since its employee led buy-out from the government in 1982. According to James Watson, the chairman: 'The culture (of employee ownership) will be preserved, but Sherlock will be bringing in a new perspective; he is a man of great energy.' Sherlock, 47, started with Bass in 1972 and joined the board in 1988. He built up Bass's leisure division before moving to the company's Holiday Inns hotel operations in the US. He resigned in October, apparently unhappy with the change. One of his first jobs will be to take part in NFC's annual strategic review which is just getting under way, although Watson says NFC's broad strategy is well established and no big changes are likely. After leaving Bass, Sherlock was appointed a non-executive director at Allied Leisure last November.</p>

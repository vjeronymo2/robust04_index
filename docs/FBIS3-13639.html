			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Arye Golan </F> in Washington on 16 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Golan] Mr. Prime Minister, do you agree to a  Palestinian police force being deployed in Hebron if it serves  under the Israeli military government, and how many policemen  are we talking about?    [Rabin] I would have been happy had the policemen who served  within the framework of the Israel Police right up to the  intifadah returned to their posts. I regretted their  resignations at the time and I would be happy if they returned,  but under the clear understanding that overall responsibility  for security in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip -- as long  as we have not reached and implemented the Gaza-Jericho  agreement -- lies with the State of Israel via the military  government and the Civil Administration. We wanted the  policemen to remain, but they decided otherwise. I would be  happy if they returned to their posts, but we must realize that  they will be subservient to Israel's authority.    [Golan] Mr. Prime Minister, do President Clinton and  Secretary of State Christopher believe that your proposal to  recruit the Palestinian police in Hebron, as you have suggested,  will suffice to return the PLO to the negotiating table?    [Rabin] I did not suggest anything, I told them that was the  situation, just as I have been telling you. The resignation of  the policemen was not what we wanted. In places where policemen  showed a readiness to remain, we were pleased, and we welcome it  now too.    [Golan] Following your Washington talks, how do you estimate  the chances of renewing the talks in the near future, first with  the PLO and then with the Arab states?    [Rabin] I very much hope and believe that the Palestinians  must also have an interest in advancing the negotiations because  without a joint interest we will not reach an agreement. Peace  is not imposed. We do not impose anything on them and they  cannot impose anything on us. The peace negotiations must be in  the interest of all the involved sides. No side can dictate  terms contrary to what has already been agreed because of some  incident, no matter how tragic, such as the Cave of the  Patriarchs massacre. We did not demand any changes in the  agreement we reached with the Palestinians in the wake of  terrorist activity by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or its  likes against Israelis.    [Golan] How do you feel when demonstrators carry placards  showing you wearing a kaffiyeh?    [Rabin] I am so used to it that it does not have any effect  on me.    [Earlier in the newsreel, Golan quotes Rabin as calling the  PLO demands to evacuate Hebron settlers and deploying an  independent Palestinian police force or international force in  the town "a nonstarter," which he rejected outright. Golan says  Rabin told Israeli correspondents in Washington, that "it is  unfeasible to have an armed police force in Hebron which is not  subordinate to Israel." Rabin said Israel is considering various  proposals to alleviate the situation for the Palestinians  without harming security. "Referring to the Syrian track, the  prime minister said that in his talks with President Clinton,  they discussed the components of peace -- the scope of the  withdrawal on the Golan Heights, security arrangements, the  stages for implementing the agreement, and the substance of the  peace -- but there was no detailed discussion on the depth of  the withdrawal." Rabin also raised with the President, the  growing Russian involvement in the Middle East and "called for  better coordination between the cosponsors of the peace process."    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0600 GMT on 17 March  quotes Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu as rejecting the idea  of deploying Palestinian policemen in Hebron.]</p>

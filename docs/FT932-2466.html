			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Chloride loss deepens to Pounds 1.6m PRE-TAX losses of Chloride Group deepened from Pounds 1.41m to Pounds 1.58m in the year to March 31 but Mr Keith Hodgkinson, chief executive, was more keen to emphasise the electronics and batteries group's improved performance in the second half. There is now only an African rump remaining from the once famous batteries business and Mr Hodgkinson said that discussions for its sale were 'in progress'. That said, continuing activities on the batteries side were profitable, albeit reduced to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds 4.25m) on turnover down at Pounds 26.3m (Pounds 30.4m). Operating losses on the electronics side were static at Pounds 2.26m (Pounds 2.22m) on turnover trimmed to Pounds 73.9m (Pounds 79.7m). In the second half, however, the division was Pounds 13,000 in the black on turnover up at Pounds 39.8m, compared with the first six months' Pounds 2.27m loss on Pounds 34.1m. The electronics products fall in three areas: uninterruptible power supplies for computers; emergency lighting, which relies on the construction market but will be helped by health and safety legislation and European harmonisation; and power conversion. Mr Hodgkinson said it was only in the second half that management could be 'focused' on running the ongoing businesses. The annual figures included above-the-line charges of Pounds 376,000 (dispute settlement costs), Pounds 1.11m (headquarters moving costs), and Pounds 916,000 (losses on disposals), all of which were taken in the interim results. Losses per share grew to 2p (1.8p) and there is no dividend.</p>

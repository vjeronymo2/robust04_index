			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Galloway turns its back on the south MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, is discovering that success at the highest level of politics is not always an asset in the fight to keep a seat in parliament. Mr Lang won Galloway and Upper Nithsdale, in south-west Scotland, from the Scottish National party in 1979 and became Scottish secretary in 1990. Now many of his constituents seem to have decided they would be better off with an MP who was somewhat less preoccupied with high office. There has been speculation throughout the campaign that Galloway would return to the SNP, and there was confirmation of Mr Lang's vulnerability in a System 3 poll published in yesterday's Herald newspaper. The poll showed SNP support at 40 per cent in the constituency, with Mr Lang on 33 per cent and supporters of other parties prepared to vote tactically against him. He stands to lose a seat where he had a 3,600 majority in 1987. Mr Lang was yesterday putting a brave face on the poll. He said his canvassers had found the Conservative vote holding up well, with no sign of being overtaken by the SNP. Climbing through the ranks of government has left Mr Lang little time to cultivate his vast constituency, which has few large centres of population. 'He doesn't seem to have done much for us - he's too busy down in Westminster,' one voter said yesterday. Farmers in particular, the backbone of the local economy, say they have lacked a strong voice for their needs in negotiations over European Community policy. It may not be questions of policy which lie behind the upsurge in support for the SNP - the issue has become Mr Lang himself.</p>

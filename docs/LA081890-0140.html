			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> Big-Time Groundbreaking: There aren't many groundbreakings that draw big-time  developers Arthur B. Birtcher, co-chairman of Laguna Niguel's Birtcher; Anthony  R. Moiso, president of the huge land-owning Santa Margarita Co., and hamburger  magnate Carl N. Karcher.  </P> <P> Those people and more, however, showed up this week for the groundbreaking of  an extension of the Heart of Jesus Retreat Center in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The center, run by the Sisters of the Society Devoted to the Sacred Heart, is  the only one in Southern California that concentrates on developing the faith  of Roman Catholic children.  </P> <P> The center, at 2927 S. Greenville St. near South Coast Plaza, has been open  since 1979. The expansion will add 25,000 square feet, including an assembly  room, dining hall, playing field and living space for the sisters. They hope  for up to 29,000 visitors a year when the $3.8-million expansion is finished.  </P> <P> Birtcher, Moiso and other local heavy hitters -- including County Supervisor  Thomas F. Riley and home-builders Al and Jim Baldwin -- raised $4.3 million for  the construction and for the sisters' work. Birtcher's construction company is  general contractor on the project.  </P></p>

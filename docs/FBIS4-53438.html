			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 19 KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary  Hiroshi Kumagai said Thursday [19 May] Japanese banks have  suspended remittances of dollars to North Korea, but he denied  suggestions the move was in response to pressure from the  government. The government understands that the banks decided  to suspend the remittances for operational reasons, he said.    The United States urged Japan last month to regulate the  flow  of hard currencies to North Korea, which is suspected of using  the funds to promote a clandestine nuclear weapons program.    It is not known how much money is remitted to North Korea  from Japan, but trade and banking sources estimate the sum at 60  billion yen a year, including trade bills.    Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito denied at a scheduled  evening press meeting that his ministry gave any instructions to  Ashikaga Bank to stop the remittances.    Asked if he has confirmed that with the bank, Saito said the  ministry's Banking Bureau had no idea about it when he contacted  the bureau, and added that he has not heard anything further.</p>

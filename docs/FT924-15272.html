			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Ireland to help exporters hit by slide in the pound THE Irish government is to announce support measures today for exporters who have been badly hit by sterling's continuing slide, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, again ruled out devaluation, writes Tim Coone in Dublin. Yesterday sterling fell to a new record low of Pounds 1.10 against the punt, which prompted Mr Terry Hobdell, the chairman of the Irish Small Firms Association (SFA), to say: 'It is a serious crisis, not just for exporters but for manufacturers who face the problem of much cheaper imports from the UK.' He said the SFA was looking for a package of IPounds 150m-200m 'to underwrite exporters and those facing competition from the UK'. The government said IPounds 50m was to be made available, along with IPounds 25m from EC structural funds.</p>

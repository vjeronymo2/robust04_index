			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Germany's main parties learn lesson in polls Despite failing to clinch the city of Potsdam in the run-off in Brandenburg's local government elections, the Party of Democratic Socialism, successors to the East German Communist party, have made their point. The established parties are worried. They have reason. Of the 85 mayoral councils in the cities and towns, 30 will be headed by the PDS. That corresponds roughly to their total share of the vote. The PDS gained 21.2 per cent, 13 points behind the Social Democrats who govern the state of Brandenburg, and one point ahead of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats. Mr Rolf Kutzmutz, the self-declared informer for the Stasi secret police in the ancien regime who last Sunday lost Potsdam to Mr Horst Gramlich, the SPD's incumbent, was victorious in defeat. 'The PDS has sent a signal. From now on it will be very difficult to exclude the PDS from decision-making,' he said. Now that it has managed to bounce back in Brandenburg after unification, the question is whether the PDS can convert local gains to state and federal gains in next year's elections. It will be difficult. The PDS's real power bases in eastern Germany are in Brandenburg and east Berlin. It could well concentrate its energy in those two regions to secure representation in the Bundestag, or lower house. Its progress in forthcoming elections will also depend on what kind of campaign the established parties run. The Christian Social Union, the Bavarian-based sister party of the CDU, has already argued that the PDS is a worse threat than the far right. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, said at the weekend the PDS posed a threat to democracy. Yet recent statistics on the membership structure for some of the PDS party organisations - and the far right - clearly show that it is hardline former Communist party members who are seeking refuge in the far right, rather than among the ranks of the PDS.</p>

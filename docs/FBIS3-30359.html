			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by B.I.W.: "Arms Industry in Attack"] </F>   [Text] Tomorrow there will be an eight-hour strike of  defense industry factories. On Tuesday [1 February], the  government did not reach an agreement with the Inter-Union  Strike Committee [MKS] of arms industry employees, who on 9  February will take part in the "Solidarity" demonstration  against increasing unemployment and prices, and the decrease in  employee incomes. "Certain traditional elements of  arms-industry products will, of course, not be armed," we were  told by "Solidarity" branch head Stanislaw Glowacki.    The demands of the arms industry have changed only slightly  since the "Solidarity" manifestation in front of the Office of  the Council of Ministers last September. At that time, 2,000  employees of arms-industry factories declared that they had had  enough of the negotiations, which they saw as fruitless. After  seven-hour negotiations on 1 February, most of the demands of  the MKS (Trade Union of the Electromachine Industry, National  Section of the Arms Industry of "Solidarity," the "Metalworkers"  Federation) were included in the column of differences of  opinions with the government.    The arms-industry employees demanded, among other things,  that the governmental level of orders for military equipment and  ammunition be set "at a level that guarantees maintenance of the  state's defense readiness" (5.5 trillion zlotys). The  government did not go beyond the amounts of money envisioned in  the budget bill and declared that money obtained through the  sale of equipment would be earmarked for such purchases. As for  the issue of covering the costs of maintaining the so-called  defense reserves (readiness to begin manufacturing military  equipment in the event of war, which is required by the Army)  between 1990 and 1993, the government promised that it would  once again present the Council of Ministers with the proposal to  cover these costs with the companies' debts to the budget. The  government stressed that the budget bill envisions money for the  restructurization of this sector: money obtained from credit  guarantees and the so-called EFSAL [expansion unknown] fund.  Trade unions believe that this should be financed, in addition,  through state subsidies (only every third company retained its  creditworthiness). They also demanded separate legal  regulations concerning social protection for arms-industry  employees. The government spoke about how the popiwek [tax on  excessive wage increases] would be abolished, which the MKS also  found unacceptable. The MKS also demanded wage increases to  compensate for price increases (in September 1993 they were at  the level of 60 percent of average pay in the country). The  government pointed out that indexation of wages is not possible  now and that it is holding talks with trade unions on the issue  of wage levels.    As for the issue of recovering money for deliveries of  equipment to the former Soviet Union, the government will  continue negotiations with the Russian Federation and, as  previously, will compensate the Russian debt with Poland's dues  for the sold equipment. The MKS wants the losses to be covered  regardless of the result of the negotiations with Russia. Also  unresolved is the problem of limiting Poland's negative  balance-of-equipment exports to states under UN resolutions, as  well as the issue of prepension relief. However, the government  confirmed that the duty-free contingent for importing military  equipment exclusively concerns products that are not  manufactured in Poland or that are imported to be assembled in  Polish arms factories.</p>

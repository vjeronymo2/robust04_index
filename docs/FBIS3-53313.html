A government official, however, reported only one death and  eight injuries in clashes that took place late Tuesday afternoon  between police and an infuriated crowd protesting alleged police  brutality in the Damak district, 298 kilometres (186 miles)  southeast of here.    A senior official of the home ministry said that a mob of  over 5,000 local residents attacked the Damak police station,  throwing stones and smashing windows. They also smashed the  windshields of two police vehicles.    At least 30 police officers were injured in the melee, the  official said.    But a Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist  (NCP-UML) source told AFP that three civilians had died and 32  were injured.    Police fired tear-gas shells, blank rounds and finally a few  live rounds to disperse the crowd, a senior government official  said.    "Eight people received bullet injuries while others were  injured in a police batton charge," the official said.    "The political situation at Damak is now quiet and normalcy  has returned after a meeting of political party workers and  local administration authorities," the official added.    The incident was sparked after police allegedly mistreated  an  elderly woman whom they had asked to clear the street.</p>

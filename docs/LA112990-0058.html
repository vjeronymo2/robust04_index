			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNSON BACKS PROPOSAL FOR 'SUPER' TRANSIT  CENTER  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson urged county officials Wednesday to  convert the old Chatsworth railroad station site into "an expanded super  transit center" where commuters could catch trains, taxis and airport shuttles  in a complex equipped with restaurants, child care centers and other services.  </P> <P> Bernson introduced a motion asking that the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission help private developers construct a retail complex on the 13-acre  parcel on Devonshire Street.  </P> <P> The commission agreed in October to buy 177 miles of Southern Pacific right of  way and related properties -- including the Chatsworth station site for $450  million -- to make the properties the backbone of a commuter train system that  would carry passengers from the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere to downtown  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Bernson's motion was referred to the transportation committee.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Following is the report on the conference to review  the United Nations High Commission for Refugees' [UNHCR] five  years of work on refugee program in Vietnam.    The conference to review the five years of work under the  repatriation program for refugees were held on Friday and  Saturday in Haiphong by the UNHCR and the Ministry of Labor, War  Invalids, and Social Affairs. The conference was attended by  the representatives of the interior, foreign and other  ministries, representatives of 35 provinces and cities  nationwide which have been involved in the program.    Over the past five years, the Vietnamese Government, with  the  assistance of UNHCR and international community, have received  more than 62,000 voluntary repatriates, and helped them in  bringing their lives back to normal and learning a trade to  support themselves. Today, the UNHCR and the ECIP [EC  Integration Program] have sponsored nearly 200 job training  centers in Vietnam for returnees. Since June 1992, ECIP was  expanded to 18 provinces and cities throughout the country with  total expenditure set at $130 million.    Addressing the conference, UNHCR representative Mr.  Christopher Carpenter highly valued the goodwill, humanitarian  policy, and great effort made by the Vietnamese Government in  helping returnees to settle down in their homeland. By the end  of 1995, the UNHCR is prepared to receive more than 52,000  Vietnamese voluntary repatriates still living in camps in  foreign countries.</p>

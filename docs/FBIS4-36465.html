			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin by </F> Shlomo Ganor, in the studio on 8 June -- recorded in Hebrew with  Arabic subtitles; translated from the Hebrew]    [Excerpt] [Ganor] Dr. Beilin, what agreements were reached  between the Israeli and Jordanian delegations in Washington  during their two-day session?    [Beilin] I think that a much more solid common denominator  was reached, an additional tier was laid for the Declaration of  Principles signed on 14 September last year. The most important  thing is that the talks will continue next month in our region,  apparently both in Jordan and in Israel. I hope that the  proximity of the talks will also make them more intensive and  that we will be able to reach agreement on all the issues on the  agenda in the next few months.    [Ganor] To what do you attribute the change in the Jordanian  position?    [Beilin] I do not regard myself as an expert on Jordanian  affairs. Last September I thought we would be able to score  quick progress. For some reason, it was the Jordanians that  slowed down the rate of progress. I am glad that today they are  willing to facilitate the process, and I hope this will end in a  peace agreement with us.    [Ganor] Does the change in the Jordanian position indicate  that a similar change can be expected to take place in the  Syrian position?    [Beilin] I find it difficult to believe that the  Palestinian,  Jordanian, and Syrian tracks are unrelated. I believe that we  have a very good chance of reaching an agreement with Syria  within a relatively short period of time, that is, within  several months, because we have a common denominator regarding  three issues: A willingness to reach peace; a willingness to  implement a withdrawal on the Golan Heights; and a willingness  to have intensive U.S. involvement in order to facilitate the  process. Granted all this, I believe it will be possible to  complete the whole process.    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television Network in Hebrew at  1700  GMT on 8 June adds: "U.S. and Israeli sources say that Syria  will agree to move the talks with Israel to our region in the  near future and hold them in al-Qunaytirah on the Golan Heights  and possibly in Tiberias as well. The sources added that  Jordan's agreement to hold the talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat was  given only after receiving the OK from Damascus."] [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Jordanian MPs are found guilty of conspiracy JORDAN'S state security court yesterday sentenced two MPs to 20 years in prison with hard labour after being found guilty of belonging to an illegal armed group which the court said had conspired to replace the Hashemite monarchy with an Islamic state. They are Mr Leith Shbeilat, the country's most popular MP and his friend and colleague, Mr Ya'akub Qarrash. Two merchants from Amman were also sentenced on the same charges for 10 years each. All four sentences were commuted from the death penalty by Lt Col Yousef Faouri, the presiding judge, who delivered the verdict in a two-and-a-half-hour court session. Amman was heavily policed during the sitting, with two army helicopters circling to watch for demonstrations while troops and police cordoned a wide perimeter around the court. Mr Ishak Sarhan, a prominent member of the Moslem Brotherhood and member of the appointed Upper House of parliament, said he was astonished at the severity of the verdict. 'I am stunned and I don't think people will accept it,' he said outside the court. Mr Mazzin el Hadid, Mr Shbeilat's lawyer who was appointed by the court after the original defence pulled out, said: 'The sentence is very harsh but we respect the court's decision.' The case against Mr Shbeilat and Mr Qarrash has been highly controversial since the two MPs were arrested late in August. Both men frequently voiced their Islamic fundamentalist beliefs and the latter, in particular, was vocal in calling for democratic change and in pursuing alleged government corruption. One senior government source described the outcome of the case as 'a warning from the regime to others who want to move too fast'. The verdict must be authorised by Sharif Zeid ben Shaker, the prime minister, before it takes effect. Some Jordanians believe King Hussein, who celebrates his birthday on Saturday, may intervene further to commute the sentence.</p>

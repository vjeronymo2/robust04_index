			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Lucas finds the going tough - The Week Ahead Lucas, the motor and aerospace components group, is expected on Monday to report interim profits of between Pounds 15m and Pounds 19m, compared with Pounds 5.2m last time. Analysts still hope the Midlands-based group will make more than Pounds 80m in the year to July, and the skewing of profits to the second half reflects continuing tough trading conditions - particularly in continental Europe. Also on Monday, Argos is forecast to announce full-year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 82m, up from Pounds 65.6m last year before the Pounds 12.7m provision to cover closure of the group's Chesterman furniture chain. The total dividend is expected to be raised from 7p to 7.6p. On Tuesday Bowater, the packaging, printing and coated products group, is expected to unveil another strong performance, with full-year pre-tax profits up about one-third from Pounds 147.2m to about Pounds 196m. The total dividend is forecast to rise from 11.5p to 12.5p. Changes in the US weather and the prospects for the regulatory climate in the UK will both have their impacts on Tuesday's results from Prudential, the financial services and life insurance company. The range of analysts' forecasts is Pounds 510m-Pounds 567m in pre-tax profits, compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds 406m in 1992 - more than double the 1991 figure. The consensus on the final dividend is 13.1p. Final results on Wednesday from retail group Kingfisher, which includes Woolworth, Superdrug, Comet and B&amp;Q, as well as Darty of France, will be watched very closely after the group made a disappointing trading statement for the 24 weeks to January 15. Analysts downgraded their pre-tax profit forecasts then from between Pounds 300m and Pounds 320m to about Pounds 295m  -up from Pounds 234m, reflecting the impact of the Darty acquisition last year. Total dividend is forecast at 14.3p, after an adjusted 13.3p last year. Peninsular &amp; Oriental Steam Navigation Company is expected on Thursday to reveal pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 500m for 1993, compared with Pounds 270.4m last year. The figures will be inflated by around Pounds 250m of exceptional profits and brokers are forecasting a more modest Pounds 250m pre-tax profit from underlying business. Dividend is likely to remain at 31.5p. The City is expecting only modest growth in profits at United Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Express, which declares its full-year results on Thursday. The recovery in advertising has been fragmentary and United's national titles have come under severe competitive pressures. Derek Terrington, of Kleinwort Benson, is looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 115m compared with Pounds 109.9m in 1992. Wellcome, which has interim results on Thursday, has the dubious distinction of having been the worst-performing FT-SE 100 stock of 1993. How well it does in 1994 will be influenced by the fortunes of Zovirax, its biggest selling drug. Zovirax is now facing its first genuine competition, in the shape of SmithKline Beecham's Famvir. Goldman Sachs, the stockbroker, is looking for at least Pounds 400m of Zovirax sales in the first half and group pre-tax profits of Pounds 360m. Reckitt &amp; Colman's range of household brands is expected to make full-year profits - to be reported on Thursday - of around Pounds 280m pre-tax, compared with Pounds 181.7m in 1992 - a figure depressed substantially by Pounds 56.9m of losses on the sale of the US spice business and a Pounds 9.6m restructuring charge. A rise in the dividend of around 8 or 9 per cent is expected, after the interim was increased by 8.4 per cent.</p>

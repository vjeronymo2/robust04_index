			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chicago Board of Trade to miss talks on Globex The Chicago Board of Trade, in an apparent escalation of its dispute with Reuters, the UK-based information company, plans to stay away from talks this week on the future of Globex, the electronic futures trading system developed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CBOT and Reuters. The CBOT's absence has heightened speculation that Globex will be reorganised in April without the participation of the world's busiest futures exchange. Globex officials say the development increases the chances of offshore exchanges, notably Liffe in London, joining the system. These exchanges have been unwilling to join the system because it is managed by rival exchanges. Representatives from Reuters, Matif, the Paris futures exchange which is already a member of Globex, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange will open negotiations on a new management format for Globex tomorrow. Both the CME and Reuters have proposed models for a new agreement. Although the CBOT is a partner with the CME in the joint venture that manages Globex, it has been ambivalent about the project, which it sees as competing with its mainstream business of open outcry futures trading. The CBOT has contributed less than 3 per cent of volume to the system in recent months, and has increasingly challenged Globex's viability. Mr Pat Arbor, CBOT chairman, has described Globex as inefficient and expensive. He has said CBOT was making contingency plans for the time when it was no longer part of Globex. Ms Rosalyn Wilton, Reuters' director of transaction products, in a letter to Mr Arbor, has asked CBOT to agree to extend the hours it lists its products on Globex, and to abandon plans for Project A, a CBOT daytime trading system seen as a rival to Globex. Mr Arbor responded that the CBOT should not be subject to such preconditions. 'We simply are not in a position to cave in to new demands that would be disadvantageous our members,' he said in a statement. An exchange spokesman confirmed the CBOT would not attend the meetings, saying 'we've been disinvited'. Mr Jack Sandner, CME chairman who is also chairman of the Globex joint venture and who holds the tie breaking vote in any disputes with the CBOT, said the CME and the Matif were in agreement on a Globex structure that would resemble 'a single global exchange,' with Reuters providing services to the system. Reuters is proposing to staunch Globex's losses by signing up more exchanges to provide products on the system. It currently has leases on 346 terminals around the world. However, many agreements expire in June, and their renewal is in doubt unless the system can be made more attractive.</p>

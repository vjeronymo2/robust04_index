			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / More pressure on employment seen THE further fiscal tightening needed to control Britain's growing government deficit will add to pressures on unemployment over the next five years, a leading forecasting group warns today. The Ernst &amp; Young Item Club says that, without public spending cuts or a tough programme of tax increases, the fiscal position 'is not sustainable'. The fiscal measures would be needed on top of the Pounds 16bn worth of extra taxes announced in the Budget for the next three years. A combination of tighter fiscal policy, and the high debts of many businesses and consumers, will restrict average year-on-year growth in UK output to a sluggish 2.2 per cent over the next five years, the consortium says. The Treasury is assuming that growth will be significantly higher at 2.75 per cent a year on average. On existing government fiscal plans, unemployment is set to rise from 3m to nearly 3.5m by the end of 1997, according to the club, whose 22 members include British Aerospace, Nomura, Bass and the Halifax Building Society. Assuming no further Treasury action to reduce the deficit, the ratio of government debt to UK output is set to double over the next five years from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. 'In the long run, this is not sustainable,' the group warns. During 1993, Item predicts a modest recovery with gross domestic product expanding by 1.3 per cent on last year. Company profits are likely to be boosted substantially by to stronger manufacturing output and a pick-up in exports. On a gloomier note, the club thinks interest rates may have to rise - from a projected 5 per cent by the end of this year to 7 per cent by the end of 1994 - to prevent underlying inflation breaching the government's 4 per cent upper limit. Unemployment among 18-to-24-year-old Londoners has risen by 132 per cent in less than three years, a report from the Association of London Authorities says. There were 50,851 young adults unemployed in April 1990, by January this year that number had risen to 118,178 and half of that group had been out of work at least six months.

			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTES  </P> <P> Kim, Kang, Yun &amp; Co., an accounting firm founded by two Korean-Americans in  Los Angeles, has merged into Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, one of the nation's  Big Eight accounting firms. KKY, formed in 1980, has concentrated on providing  accounting services to Korean-owned businesses and subsidiaries of Korea-based  companies.  </P> <P> It is the first Korean-American accounting firm to be acquired by a Big Eight  firm. The major U.S. accounting companies have their eye on Korean clients for  potential new business. Ten years ago, they moved into the Japanese market by  merging with Japanese-American accounting firms that had Japan-based clients.  </P> <P> KKY's founders, Dongsoon Kang and Nack Koo Kim, will become partners of  DH&amp;S. The staff of 10 expands DH&amp;S National Korean Industry Client  Services Group, which also has a bilingual staff of 12 in New York and three in  Chicago.  </P> <P> "We are excited about the merger because it provides an excellent opportunity  to service this vital segment of the Southern California business community, as  well as to significantly expand our national effort," said Keith Renken, area  managing partner for DH&amp;S.  </P> <P> Among DH&amp;S' Korean clients are Sunkyong, Korea Explosives, Samsung,  Goldstar, Daewoo, Hyosung and Kolon.  </P></p>

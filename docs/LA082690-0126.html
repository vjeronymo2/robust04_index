			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP FIRES WARNING AT JUSTICES  </P> <P> State Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp on Saturday criticized California Supreme  Court rulings limiting legal rights in civil cases and warned that the justices  eventually could face voter rebellion like their predecessors in 1986.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's remarks, made before delegates to the annual convention of the  State Bar, represented his first such criticism of the court since a  conservative majority gained power after the defeat of Chief Justice Rose  Elizabeth Bird and two other liberal court members four years ago.  </P> <P> "Once the nation's leading court in development of civil law, in recent years  the court has stopped dead in the water and even appears to be reversing  course," he said.  </P> <P> "It is far too soon to panic," the attorney general said. "But I would remind  the current justices of the hard lesson their predecessors learned at the  polls: A court that retreats from the world around it treads on dangerous  ground."  </P> <P> In 1986, Bird and Justices Joseph R. Grodin and Cruz Reynoso were the targets  of heavy political attack because of their record on the death penalty.  </P> <P> In his speech, Van de Kamp cited rulings by the new court under Chief Justice  Malcolm M. Lucas limiting the liability of employers and insurers. The  justices, he said, had often moved to restrict the legal rights of victims --  such as "those unfairly fired from their jobs and those exploited by predatory  insurance practices."  </P> <P> In 1988, the Lucas court barred workers from collecting potentially sizable  punitive damages for wrongful discharge. In another case, the justices  prohibited accident victims from suing insurance companies after denial of a  claim.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for  governor in June, told reporters after his speech that he did not seek -- and  did not expect -- voters to deny confirmation to the five justices expected to  be on the November ballot.  </P> <P> "I don't see a tremendous resentment of this court, nor should there be," he  said. "I'm merely raising a warning flag."  </P> <P> Van de Kamp credited the new court for being "properly conscious" of the need  to restore its credibility and conceded its heavy death penalty backlog left  relatively little time for civil matters.  </P> <P> He told reporters there were some indications that in its rulings limiting  civil suits, the court was "more concerned with its workload than the substance  or merits of the cases."  </P> <P> "We have to remember that courts gain respect by the credibility of their  judgments and that courts that tend to go off the deep end either way can find  themselves in disrepute," he said.  </P> <P> Two justices attending the Bar convention told reporters after the speech that  they made their decisions solely on the merits of the cases and without concern  for whether they would be confirmed by voters.  </P> <P> "What the electorate wants to do in 1990, it will do, " said Justice Edward A.  Panelli. "We have no hidden agenda. We decide cases as we see them."  </P> <P> Responding to Van de Kamp's reference to a philosophical shift in course,  Justice Armand Arabian said, "To view our work solely as a shifting of the  pendulum is totally inaccurate." As for the coming election, Arabian said, "I  am in a state of absolute calm."  </P> <P> In all, five appointees of Republican Gov. George Deukmejian may be on the  ballot. Lucas and Justices Panelli, Arabian and Joyce L. Kennard already are  facing confirmation by voters. The governor's most recent nominee to the high  court, Appellate Justice Marvin R. Baxter of Fresno, will be on the ballot if  confirmed by the state Judicial Appointments Commission on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, concluding eight years in office, sharply criticized the court  system for the failure to implement the state's death penalty law. California  reinstated capital punishment in 1977. While more than 200 convicted murderers  have since been sentenced to death, their appeals remain in state and federal  courts and none has been executed.  </P></p>

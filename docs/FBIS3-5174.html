Speaking about his  recent trip to Israel, Suphachai said he had met with a water  management consultancy which had agreed to dispatch a specialist  team to find solutions to the worsening water shortage in  Thailand.    He said that the company was the same one which came to  Thailand 7-8 years ago. But its operations stopped when the  World Bank withdrew financial support for the programme.  Suphachai said he also asked the Israeli government to help  Thailand in agriculture, especially technology on planting crops  in salty areas. "I proposed that each project should be separate  from others. For example, the Chao Phya River project is one  project and the Nan River another," he said.    Supachai said the cost of Israel's assistance would be based  on a flexible credit system. "It is likely there will be trade  between the two countries in the future," he said. Supachai also  said he had discussed increasing exports to Israel since "The  private sector in Israel is also interested in the proposed  cooperation," he said.</p>

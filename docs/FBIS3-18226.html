			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DPA) -- The IG-Metall trade union has once  again tightened the screw of warning strikes. A record number  of 300,000 working people of the west German metal and  electrical industry participated in brief warning strikes on  Thursday [24 February] -- five days before the strike ballot on  a regular strike in Lower Saxony. The trade union had called  for an "action day" so as to demonstrate once again its  readiness to fight. On Wednesday 183,000 metal workers had gone  on strike.    In North Rhine-Westphalia, the trade union had 130,000 metal  workers take to the street, as it reported. Speaking to rally  participants in Remscheid, IG-Metall chief Klaus Zwickel called  for the "red card" for the "nay-sayers in pinstripe suits." The  strike concept stands, Zwickel stressed. In Baden-Wuerttemberg  about 54,000 metal workers went on temporary strikes, in Bavaria  35,000.    Dieter Hundt, the leader of the employers in the  negotiations  for Northern Wuerttemberg/Northern Baden, stressed that the  employers will not give in. On Wednesday evening in Stuttgart  he did not leave any doubt that in case of a strike in Lower  Saxony, which might begin on 7 March, the employers will react  with lock-outs. Then there might be "cold" lock-outs in the  southwest, Hundt said. In this area there are companies that  depend on supplies from Lower Saxony.    Dieter Kirchner, main manager of the Gesamtmetall employers'  association, accused IG-Metall of having falsely claimed that  the employers want to abolish the vacation bonus and reduce  incomes. "It is correct that there must be cutbacks in the  vacation bonus so that the companies can get out of the cost  crisis and jobs become more secure," Kirchner said. After all,  Gesamtmetall does not want a general reintroduction of the  40-hour work week, either, but a regulation with which  individual branches, such as research, development, sales, and  customers' service, "may regularly work more than 36 hours per  week."    The trade union, on the other hand, demands up to 6 percent  higher wages. However, it is willing to tone down its demands  if measures to ensure employment are taken.    This morning about 10,000 employees in the Opel works in  Ruesselsheim closed down production for about one hour. At a  rally in front of the company gate, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul,  deputy chairwoman of the Social Democratic Party of Germany,  assured the employees that if her party wins the election it  will make sure that the old strike article 116 is again put into  the Labor Promotion Law. This would deprive the employers of  the possibility of a "cold lock-out." Nowadays companies can  send their employees home without payment if they have to stop  or reduce their production because of a lack of supplies due to  a strike.    In Saxony several thousand working people expressed  solidarity with their colleagues in western Germany. At the  same time, they protested against the hesitant behavior of the  Association of Saxony's Metal and Electrical Industry concerning  the still lacking transfer of the Bavarian framework wage  contract to the wage area of Saxony.</p>

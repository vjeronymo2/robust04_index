			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALVESTON BAY REOPENED TO FISHING A WEEK AFTER OIL SPILL  </P> <P> Galveston Bay reopened to fishing Saturday, a week after a tanker-barge  collision in the environmentally sensitive waterway that authorities now  concede spilled far more oil than previously thought.  </P> <P> The state health department declared the entire bay open for taking of fin fish  but, concerned about the continuing effects of the spill, maintained a ban on  shellfish harvesting across much of the bay.  </P> <P> When salvage crews lifted one of the two barges damaged in the collision out of  the bay, they found virtually no oil on board, Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer  Todd Nelson said. That led to an increase in the estimate of the amount spilled  from 500,000 gallons to more than 700,000 gallons.  </P> <P> In Beaumont, Tex., two lawsuits were filed on behalf of hundreds of people who  say their livelihoods have suffered because of the July 28 spill in Galveston  Bay.  </P> <P> Both class-action lawsuits name Apex RE&amp;T Inc., owner of the barges, and  Eletson Corp., owner of the tanker, as defendants. The suits seek monetary  awards for each fisherman expected to lose money because of the spill.  </P> <P> A helicopter flyover Saturday morning found that southerly winds had pushed the  oil north onto beaches around the Houston Point marshlands, Nelson said. At  least 120 contract workers and 30 Coast Guard employees worked to clean that  area, as well as beaches at Redfish Island.  </P></p>

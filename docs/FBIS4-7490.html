			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ada Kostrz-Kostecka: "KERM on Ownership </F> Transformation; Everyone Will Privatize Something for Oneself"]    [Text] The law on privatization of state enterprises has a  constitutional character, and, because comments and proposals  were made up to the last moment, it was not possible to make a  decision on the spot. For that reason, during the Thursday, 10  March, KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers]  meeting, it was decided that a coordination meeting would take  place on Thursday, 17 March, and, on Friday, 18 March, KERM  would state precisely its position concerning this issue.    It turns out that the proposals went very far, when,  practically speaking, there is another privatization  philosophy--the divergence between KERM members concerned about  who is to initiate the privatization procedures, who is to  represent the State Treasury, the role of the chief of the  privatization ministry, and the role of particular ministries.    Even during the interministerial coordination meeting, as  RZECZPOSPOLITA learned, it was proposed that the Ministry of  Privatization [MPW] convert state enterprises into commercial  operations, with the enterprises' concurrence. During the KERM  proceedings, Marek Pol, minister of industry and trade, proposed  instead that the decision on the whole process of privatization  pass into the hands of branch ministries. The MPW would, in  practice, have the role of a consulting firm at the level of  preparing the privatization process as well as a store with the  enterprises, with the signing of the contract. And the Ministry  of Industry would like to be involved not only with the  privatization of these industrial and trade enterprises, for  which it is currently the founding body [organ zalozycielski],  but also with those under the jurisdiction of voivodes  [administrative heads of the voivodships].    This idea was accepted by the representative of the Ministry  of Agriculture. The Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations  would like to go even further, separating foreign trade  enterprises and independently attending to their privatization.    In the meantime, the Ministry of Privatization, as stated by  Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek at a press conference during a break  in the KERM meeting, assumes granting the enterprises  far-reaching powers that would allow them to decide on the means  of privatization. It was also proposed to abolish the half-year  time period allowed to select the privatization path, leaving  the enterprises with possibilities not restricted by time to  undertake these initiatives.    Minister Kaczmarek, when asked by reporters how he would  react if the idea presented by Minister Pol were to be accepted,  said that he would protest such a move because it was not the  privatization direction to which he had agreed. In his opinion,  this is an attempt to rebuild the branch structures. In  Minister Kaczmarek's opinion, discussion would be easier if the  package of laws concerning the State Treasury were to be  considered first.    The other subject of discussion dealt with the range of  preference for the employees. The Ministry [of Privatization]  takes the position that there should be 15 percent of free  shares, along with an absolute limit (the value of the  preferences cannot exceed 18 average wages). On the basis of  the discussion, KERM members aligned themselves rather with the  10-percent free shares concept, but with restrictions on the  rights to their transferability. They could be, for example,  registered shares (as KPW [Securities Commission] wants to  have), or they could be transerred in lots of up to 5 percent  annually.    In response to questions, Minister Kaczmarek said that there  is no concept for privatization of the  agricultural-food-processing industry. On Friday [11 March],  the minister was in Lowicz, and he spoke with representatives of  the food-processing industry there and came to the conclusion  that a concept of merging agricultural producers with the  privatization of that sector (regardless of whether they get 10  or 15 percent of the shares) is not a solution for  privatization. What is necessary are ideas and money for that  industry to make marketable products. The minister's resistance  also brings up the proposition that cooperatives have the right  to a portion of the shares of processing industries, the more so  because there are many individuals in, for example, the budget  sphere, who do not have such privileges.</p>

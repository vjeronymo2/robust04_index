			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Increase in working mothers The increase in the number of mothers returning to work has fuelled the growth of women in the labour market, the Employment Department says in its winter 1993-94 Labour Force Survey. The quarterly survey found that 64 per cent of mothers with children under 16 were economically active, up from 55 per cent in the spring of 1984. By comparison, 71 per cent of all working age women were active in the economy as opposed to 66 per cent in 1984.</p>

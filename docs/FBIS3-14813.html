			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, 26 Feb (ITAR-TASS) -- Vyacheslav Kostikov,  the press secretary of the Russian president described the  release of organizers and participants of the events in October  1993 from Lefortovo as a blasphemous action. He said today that  people whose hands and conscience have been party to bloodshed,  people who were ready to push Russia into the bloody maelstrom  of the civil war have been released without trial.    The press secretary of the Russian president believes that  the State Duma and in the first place those parties who  initiated and supported this blasphemous action are wholly  responsible for this act of moral violence. This is the first  time in the history of world parliamentarism. He believes that  the State Duma is becoming the coparticipant of unlawfulness.    Having abused the people's trust, the deputies have for the  the first time in history -- the statement he has issued says --  taken the side of evil-doers against the state. The State Duma,  which was called upon to be the guardian of law, the initiator  of civil accord, and a participant in building a rule-of-law  state, has by its own will removed from the framework of justice  persons accused of the gravest of state crimes, preferring hasty  political demarches to a just court.    The document points out that an outrage has been committed  against justice, public opinion has been rejected, and the  opinion of a president elected by popular vote has been  challenged. The haste and urgency with which the State Duma  strove to achieve the immediate implementation of its  resolution, and in essence the covering up of the evil done to  Russia, is evidence not of the Duma's desire to achieve civil  peace and accord, but of its effective incitement to political  extremism.    In the unlawful situation that has come about, the president  of Russia reserves the right to act in accordance with the  powers granted to him by the Constitution, Kostikov declared.</p>

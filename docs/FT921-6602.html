			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Rio business protests at rising crime THOUSANDS of Rio's hoteliers, shopkeepers, businessmen and tourist agents held a demonstration along Copacabana beach yesterday to protest against the resort's increasing violence, which, they say, is destroying its tourist industry. Since 1987, the number of tourists visiting Brazil has plummetted from almost 2m to 800,000, largely because of Rio's spiralling crime rate. As a result, Rio has suffered an estimated Dollars 400m loss in revenue, according to Mr Ronaldo Monterosa, president of Embratur, the Brazilian tourist authority. 'Over the last five years we have watched tourism collapse,' said Mr Philip Carruthers, general manager of the Copacabana Palace hotel and president of the Association of Hoteliers. 'Occupancy of five-star hotels in peak months has fallen from 97 per cent to 63 per cent. The main reason is Rio's appalling image, which is based on a fundamental reality - complete lack of security.' He complained that his hotel staff have to prevent guests leaving the hotel with cameras, jewellery or watches because of the 'complete ineffectiveness' of the police. 'The police here are part of the problem rather than the solution.' Immediately after the press conference, two journalists were stopped at knifepoint near the hotel and opposite a police cabin. Mr Paulo Protasio, head of Rio's Chamber of Commerce, said 'we need to mobilise Rio's taxpayers to see that this constant drop in tourism, which is the state's principal economic activity, is jeopardising everyone's jobs.' He said the aim of yesterday's march was to press the state authorities into taking action. Rio's commercial and tourism associations have presented a plan to the state governor for the creation of a new 1,500-strong bilingual tourist police force which would be well-paid and better motivated. Mr Protasio pointed out that Rio should be capitalising on the World Environment Conference, which it is hosting in June, to present a new image.</p>

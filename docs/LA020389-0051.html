			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  POLICE PLAN TO OPEN PALISADES SUBSTATION  </P> <P> In response to a series of fatal accidents involving Pacific Palisades youths  during the last two years, community leaders have persuaded Los Angeles police  to open a substation this month and to add an extra patrol in the affluent  area.  </P> <P> After meetings with police officials from the West Los Angeles Division, the  Palisades Chamber of Commerce agreed to donate its office space for the  substation, which will allow officers to file criminal reports in the area  rather than returning to headquarters several miles away.  </P> <P> In the last 19 months, 10 young residents of the community, including seven  students at Palisades High School, have suffered violent deaths, most involving  alcohol or drugs.  </P> <P> Chamber of Commerce President Arnie Wishnick said residents will continue to  meet with police to see if they can find a way to staff the substation full  time.  </P> <P> Under the current plan, the substation, which will be open for use 24 hours,  will only be used by officers who want to cut down on their travel time filing  their reports in the chamber office.  </P></p>

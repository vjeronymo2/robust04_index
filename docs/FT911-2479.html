			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: LTV hit by downturn in cars and appliances LTV, the third largest US steel group, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 46.3m, which it blamed on a slump in demand for cars and household appliances. LTV, which has been operating under the protection of the US bankruptcy courts since 1986, is the latest in a succession of US steel manufacturers to report first-quarter losses stemming from the North American economic downturn. The net loss, on sales of Dollars 1.43bn, compared with income of Dollars 44.2m on sales of Dollars 1.49bn last time. The loss per share was 46 cents, against earnings last year of 32 cents. LTV's steel operations reported a first-quarter operating loss of Dollars 48.8m, before restructuring charges, against operating income of Dollars 41.1m in the first quarter of 1990. Shipments declined by 356,000 tons, due to lower demand for cold-rolled sheets, hot-rolled sheets and galvanised products. In February the group reached a preliminary agreement on settlement of along-running pensions liability battle. The deal should eventually pave the wayfor it to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings. LTV said yesterday it intended to file a preliminary plan of reorganisation by May 6. It stressed that negotiations on many key issues would be needed before its creditors could agree ona package.</p>

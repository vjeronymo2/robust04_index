			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / International Company News: Capital adequacy plan under fire in Germany GERMAN banks will suffer serious competitive disadvantages at home and abroad if the government goes ahead with plans to introduce tough new capital adequacy requirements, according to the chairman of the Bundesverband deutscher Banken, the influential Federal Association of German Banks. Mr Eberhard Martini, chief executive of the Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank, yesterday criticised the Bundesbank and the Berlin-based supervisory authorities for pushing the government into promoting measures which he claimed would damage banks' commercial interests and curb their ability to lend, especially to finance eastern German reconstruction. The government is committed to introducing legislation to implement two European Committee capital adequacy directives by the beginning of next year. The finance committee of the Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, met last week and is meeting again next week to debate how the law should be implemented in detail. At issue is the treatment of the banks' hidden reserves, which consist of extensive portfolios of property and securities, and participation in industrial companies. The EC directives envisaged allowing these reserves to count fully towards Tier 2 capital, but the draft law being debated by the finance committee imposes stiff restrictions on their use. Under the draft law, German banks would have to have Tier 1capital (equity and retained earnings) of 5 per cent before being able to count reserves towards the total 8 per cent capital requirement. Even then, the reserves would be limited to the book value of the investment and would only be able to count for 1 per cent of capital. The banks want the directives to be adopted without change: this envisages a requirement of 4 per cent Tier 1 capital and 4 per cent Tier 2.</p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Your money or your vote - The Election and You NEVER BEFORE have British taxpayers been bombarded by two Budgets in successive weeks, writes John Authers. At least one of them will never be fully implemented. But for the time being, both demand close scrutiny. This week's Budget, from Labour's shadow chancellor John Smith, is necessarily less detailed than Norman Lamont's. But it was explicit enough on the central issues of income tax and national insurance to allow families a fair comparison between the two. The main provisions were well-trailed: There will be an additional top-rate band of tax, payable at 50 per cent, which will affect those on annual incomes of Pounds 40,000 or more. The 'ceiling' for national insurance contributions, payable at 9 per cent of income, will be abolished. The new 20 per cent band of tax announced in Mr Lamont's budget will be discontinued. Thresholds will be increased by more than the rate of inflation, to remove many people from the tax system altogether. There was one pleasant surprise, which was the decision not to levy national insurance contributions on 'unearned' income of more than Pounds 3,000 for people below retirement age. This was viewed as a serious disincentive to saving, but Labour have now withdrawn, mainly because it would adversely affect the many people living on income from invested redundancy pay-offs. Last week, the Weekend FT visited five sample households and, with the aid of Michael Bishopp and Clive Mackintosh of the executive &amp; benefit services division of Price Waterhouse, analysed what effect Lamont would have on their household budget. We can now, with Price Waterhouse's aid, revisit the households and see how they will do under John Smith. The results are in the table. Bear in mind that all our basic comparisons are between two Budgets both of which at present are hypothetical. Ted Harker, is in his early 70s and lives on a modest pension, plus income from savings. His total income is Pounds 15,000. He is single, with no mortgage. He loses the benefits from the new 20 per cent band of income tax, which would have saved him, Pounds 100 per year. However, the additional Pounds 5 per week which Labour would put on the standard state retirement pension comes to his rescue. As a result, he ends up better off by Pounds 2.88 per week under Labour than he would be under the Tories' new budget, or Pounds 5.35 better off than he is now. Beverley Williams, is a young, single woman on a salary of Pounds 15,000 a year, and living in a rented flat. She has no commitments, but her financial situation is otherwise almost exactly in line with the national average. It may therefore not be a coincidence that Labour would leave her totally unaffected. As the table shows, she would pay more tax, thanks to the axing of the 20 per cent band, but less in NICs, thanks to increases in threshold. The result: she will be a princely Pounds 2.48 per week better off under Labour than she is now, exactly the same figure as for the Lamont budget. David Wallace and Caroline Campbell live in a house they bought together in 1989. They have a Pounds 50,000 mortgage, of which interest on the first Pounds 30,000 is subject to relief under MIRAS. They both work for a building society, earning Pounds 12,500 a year apiece. This makes them 'DINKY's - they have a double income, with no kids yet. Despite their greater commitments, the maths for David and Caroline work out almost identically to the changes for Beverley Williams. Their tax-efficient loan thanks to MIRAS survives untouched. Both benefit from the increasing thresholds, while both lose out slightly from the axing of the 20 per cent band. Neither of them individually is close to the current ceiling for national insurance contributions, so the net result is exactly the same as for Beverley - a Labour budget would make no difference at all. Either way, they are Pounds 5.58 better off per week than they are now. Fiona and Peter Elsworthy will be less happy about Labour's proposals. They are married, with two children. Fiona is the main breadwinner. She earns Pounds 40,000 a year as a solicitor and has a company Golf GTI which completes the year with a business mileage of under 2,501 miles. Peter, a librarian, earns Pounds 10,000. They have a Pounds 50,000 mortgage, on which interest relief on the first Pounds 30,000 is available under MIRAS. They will be grateful for Labour's rise in child benefits, which will move up from Pounds 907, under the Lamont budget, to Pounds 1,035 under John Smith. But the change to National Insurance contributions hit Fiona's take-home pay. If the ceiling is lifted under Labour, her NIC bill shoots up from Pounds 1,699 to Pounds 3,347. Changes to the Married Couple's Allowance and raised thresholds allow them to avoid any higher Labour taxes, and the couple's total tax bill declines from Pounds 12,076, under the budget, to Pounds 11,856. However, there is another Pounds 307 to be paid on the car. The net result is to leave the couple Pounds 29.83 per week worse off than they would be under Lamont's budget, and Pounds 26.42 worse off than they are now. James and Henrietta Hamilton, who are lucky enough to have a joint annual income of Pounds 100,000, are unlucky enough to take by far the greatest hit under Labour. James is a company director on Pounds 90,000 per year, while Henrietta has an income of Pounds 10,000 per year from investments. Their children have left home. The new 50 per cent tax rate increases James' tax bill from Pounds 30,279 to Pounds 35,135, while his NICs go from Pounds 1,699 to Pounds 7,847. Changes to car benefit put the bill for operating a company car up from Pounds 5,956 to Pounds 7,445. The net result is to leave them Pounds 241 worse off each week under Labour than they would be under the Conservative budget. James and Henrietta were not going to vote Labour anyway.  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Old age pensioner  ------------------------------------------------------------------                                   Con.

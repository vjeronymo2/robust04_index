			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Rush to launch equity funds THE FUND management industry is testing the waters in the wake of the Conservatives' re-election. Managers hope that, with five years of Tory government ahead, investors will feel confident enough to invest in equities. Not all the funds are UK based. The flavour of the month is China. A Dublin-based China Opportunities fund was launched recently by Hafnia Prolific and now Jupiter Tyndall has produced a Luxembourg-based China portfolio. The fund will be the eighth in the umbrella range called the Tyndall Global Fund (others are high yield, British Lion, Wall Street, Japan, International, European and Tiger.) The minimum investment is Pounds 2,500 (or Dollars 5,000); initial charge is 5 per cent; annual fee 1 per cent. Since there are few opportunities for direct investment in China, those who want to gain exposure to the country normally do so via Hong Kong companies which have subsidiaries in the People's Republic. That means exposure to the Hong Kong stock market - currently at an all-time high. But Tyndall fund manager Eric Sandlund says that price-earnings ratios in Hong Kong are still low compared with the rest of the world. Legal &amp; General has produced a range of unit trust Personal Equity Plans to take advantage of the new Pounds 6,000 limit. There are four investment choices: recovery, growth, income and worldwide. The initial charge is 5.5 per cent, and Legal &amp; General says that this is free of VAT, unlike some other companies' charges. The annual management fee is 1.5 per cent. Meanwhile Skandia Life, which linked up with the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust last year, has established a managed investment trust fund with Robert Fleming. The fund will invest in five Fleming-managed trusts - American, Claverhouse, Far Eastern, Japanese and Universal. The fund can be linked to Skandia Life products. Providence Capitol is offering the Balanced Growth fund, a combination of two of its funds - Special Market and UK fixed interest. The fund is available on both life and pension policies. The Unit Trust Industry Review &amp; Directory, a guide to the management groups and trusts in the market, was published this week by Professional and Business Information. At Pounds 245, it will appeal to the financial adviser rather than the private investor.</p>

Dolley, a ULIMO member of Liberia's newly instituted  transitional national assembly, said the fighting was a  political and tribal struggle between Krahns and Mandingos in  the organisation.    The most violent fighting took place in the Bong mining  region 75 kilometres (about 45 miles) north of Monrovia and at  Tubmanburg, the headquarters of the movement 60 kilometres (37  miles) to the north.    The situation remained "chaotic" at Tumbmanburg, he said,  though it had calmed down at Bong.    The crisis began on February 28 when Thomas Ziah, a Krahn  and  one of two ULIMO representatives in the State Council, refused  to support his fellow ULIMO member of the collegiate presidency,  the Mandingo Mohamed Sheriff as candidate to head the  institution.    In reprisal, ULIMO president Alhaji Kromah, a Mandingo,  sacked Ziah on March 3 and ordered that all Krahn fighters in  the movement be disarmed.    ULIMO's military leader, General Roosevelt Johnson, a Krahn,  then declared on March 6 that he had replaced Kromah at the  movement's head.    The row also prevented the investiture of the State Council  on Monday under a peace plan underwritten by the United Nations  and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) last  year to end Liberia's three-year civil war.    The two sides finally compromised by replacing Ziah by  another Krahn, Dexter Tahyor.    Dolley called on ULIMO's political and military leaders to  "settle their differences in a peaceful and orderly manner."    ECOMOG, a multinational African peacekeeping force  despatched  to Liberia by ECOWAS in 1990, has this week made a start in the  disarming of the country's rival factions.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear fall-out BRITAIN's large electricity users have reason to feel aggrieved. Industrial profits are depressed and companies are trying to cut costs. Yet Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generating company that electricity consumers are required to subsidise to the tune of Pounds 1.2bn a year, has turned in profits up 48 per cent on those of last year. The nuclear levy, designed to compensate for the higher cost of generating power from non-fossil fuels, is scheduled to remain until 1998. But these profits, the users' lobby argues, demonstrate that the levy should be abolished. Yet a subsidy of this magnitude is essential if Nuclear Electric is to remain profitable in the short term. Abolishing the levy would have turned a profit of Pounds 482m into a loss of Pounds 783m. Some form of subsidy will remain necessary at least until the government's planned review of the industry is completed in 1994. Government may then decide that the benefits of preserving a nuclear power industry, providing a relatively safe and clean power source while encouraging fuel diversity, justifies longer-term support. Nuclear Electric has until 1994 to show either that it can operate without subsidy or to set out the price of longer-term support. The case for Nuclear Electric will be far stronger if it can credibly demonstrate before then that it can produce electricity efficiently, as well as safely. Recent indications from the electricity regulator, Offer, that it is to examine the nuclear levy are welcome, if only for the contribution it will make to a clearer understanding of the industry's finances in the run-up to the nuclear review. When it conducts that review, the government should also consider whether it would be fairer to meet any subsidy from general taxation rather than from a levy, which has the undesirable side-effect of impairing the competitiveness of many British companies.</p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): East Midlands Electricity - Other companies East Midlands Electricity: The utility has prepared the market for a disappointing pre-tax profit figure for 1993-94. The total will be depressed by Pounds 130m as a result of post-privatisation acquisitions which have performed disappointingly. That will leave pre-tax profit, to be announced today, at around Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m. The dividend should be unaffected at about 22.7p. Manweb, which distributes electricity in north Wales and Cheshire, is expected to announce pre-tax profit of about Pounds 125m to Pounds 130m tomorrow. The dividend should be about 22.5p.</p>

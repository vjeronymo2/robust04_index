			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Arts: News on a heartstring - Television The move towards soft-centred 'human interest' journalism on television is unmistakable and yet the fear, expressed in this column as anxiously as anywhere, that such material would drive out tough, investigative journalism, especially on ITV, has, so far, proved empty. Indeed, if there is any ground left for such qualms it would seem to exist at the BBC more than ITV. True, the realisation that you could exploit 'sexy' stories (which do not have to have anything to do with sex, the word being used in television to mean a cross between appealing and trendy) to attract big audiences in peak time at costs well below those for popular drama or other entertainment, happened to coincide in Britain with the demolition and reconstruction of ITV. The need for the new companies to make huge sums of money to pay for the government's dreadful franchise auction and Treasury levy in addition to dividends, and at the same time satisfy the demands of the Independent Television Commission not to banish all current affairs to the periphery, led to the prompt import of 'infotainment' models from the US. But the BBC was not slow to follow suit; in fact it could be argued that today the BBC sets the pace. Consider the schedules for tomorrow evening. At 8.00 BBC1 begins another batch of Children's Hospital, a series which typifies the fashionable approach, being concerned with individual heartstring-tugging stories. Medicine is a - if not the - major catchment area for infotainment, and children, like animals, are a better bet than adults, being more helpless, more appealing, and less likely to die. At 8.30 ITV screens Blues And Twos, one of several series which literally chase ambulances, in the hope that the cameras will come across a really nasty accident. At 10.00 we are promised that Inside Story on BBC1 will 'lift the lid off cosmetic surgery'. And at 11.05 Channel 4 offers Prostitute in which, we are told, we can meet Monique, mother of seven, who took up prostitution when her lover got into debt, and Agnes who treats the business as an office job. There can surely be no argument that there is far more material of this sort on British television today than there used to be, nor any denying that it represents a shift towards the tabloid. However, on Monday last week, at 8.30, bang in the middle of peak time, ITV provided a classic World In Action report on a 30-year experiment in Britain to inject 2,000 slow-growing children with a hormone extracted from pituitary glands collected from bodies in hospital mortuaries. If it sounds like the plot from a Hammer movie, the outcome was not so very different: though the children did grow faster, they then began to die of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disorder, the human version of 'Mad Cow Disease'. Perhaps this story has already been widely publicised in the medical press or even in consumer magazines or newspapers, but I had certainly not come across it. WIA investigated the way in which the pituitaries were collected, often by mortuary attendants who were paid 12 1/2 p a gland, keeping the parts in a cupboard or on a window ledge until they had enough to send off. It may be asked 'How is this so very different from those other 'soft centred' medical series?' The answer is that although WIA did interview individual sufferers, the programme's chief concern was to reveal the classically British manner in which the whole business has been kept under wraps. One patient said they had been 'treated like morons' with doctors and civil servants being evasive and telling those affected as little as possible. Another said, with admirable moderation, 'I think the whole thing has been very shabbily handled'. It was an appalling story, and yet heartening to find television using its weight and influence in a classic piece of journalistic investigation. The next day brought an edition of Network First, again on ITV, this time at 10.40 (surely not so terribly late for anyone really interested) called 'The Secrets Of Porton Down' which produced even more important revelations. The programme showed how claims that Britain gave up 'offensive' research to stick to the 'defensive' type in the 1950s are, at best, disingenuous. It also showed how servicemen have, over many years, been lured to the centre for chemical and biological warfare research at Porton Down as guinea pigs. The word 'lured' may seem loaded if you have not seen the commercial, shown on this programme, which was used to induce men to volunteer, a commercial which made Porton Down look, quite literally, like a holiday camp with the special attraction of topless women. The programme showed how at least one man died (his inquest was kept secret) and - via personal witness - how others have suffered. Asked why there had been no systematic follow-up to check the after effects of these experiments, the head of Porton Down said there was no evidence of any need for such work . . . but how could there be without any follow up? Programmes of this sort send tendrils of fear curling around your heart as you realise how frighteningly easy it is for even democratic governments to mislead their electors, or simply to lie by omission. How many of us realised that our governments used our money at the Nancekuke biological and chemical warfare centre in Cornwall to extend work on nerve gases begun in Nazi concentration camps? Perhaps we would approve, but how can we decide unless we know what is going on? And is the job of telling us not more important than keeping us up to date on French prostitutes? Thursday brought yet another revealing programme, this time on Channel 4 where Critical Eye presented 'Quick War, Slow Death'. Here was yet another example of the passion among British authorities for keeping the citizen in the dark, wheeling out the Official Secrets Act at every opportunity, ensuring that victims of a single problem cannot make common cause, and withholding fundamental human rights by denying the British a freedom of information act. This programme left you in no doubt, first, that a number of those involved in the Gulf War now suffer some form of long-term illness (the Americans admitted it long ago) and, second, that British military and government authorities will go to startling and embarrassing lengths to avoid any admission of involvement. Three programmes in one week may not be hugely significant, but they do seem to give the lie to my previous suggestions that the disappearance of such series as This Week and First Tuesday could mean a new ITV with no journalistic teeth. On the contrary, however unhealthy the relationship between government and franchise winners, ITV currently looks like much the most fierce champion in British television of the public right to know. And that, surely, makes up for an awful lot of ambulance chasing and cooing over little children.</p>

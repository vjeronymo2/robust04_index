			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall's reconstruction plan for CST Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group which is battling for control of the Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, has announced proposals for the reconstruction of CST Emerging Asia, another of the trusts in its stable. The plan is to issue shareholders with zero coupon convertible unsecured loan stock for nine-tenths of the nominal value of their existing shares. CST would then tender for 60 per cent of the zero culs, allowing investors to liquidate a substantial proportion of their holdings. It is hoped that this plan would narrow the discount to net assets on which CST shares trade. SG Warburg has estimated that a package of one share and 9 culs would have a value equivalent to 90 per cent of the trust's net asset value.</p>

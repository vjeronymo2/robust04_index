			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Controversial shopping centre gets go-ahead CLEARANCE WAS finally given in the High Court yesterday for the controversial Pounds 200m shopping centre at Dumplington on the banks of the Manchester Ship Canal. After eight years of takeover battles, planning inquiries, a dispute between shareholders and legal wrangling eight local authorities failed in a last-ditch attempt to overturn the government's go-ahead for the centre, in Trafford Park, given last March. They had argued the centre would affect town centre trade in Manchester, Bury, Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, Stockport, Tameside and Wigan. The centre - to be developed by the Peel property group - is scheduled to open in 1997. Peel is predicting it will create 6,000 construction and retail jobs. The 300-acre site will house 129 shops, two superstores, a food hall, restaurants, leisure facilities and parking for 2,000 cars. Manchester's metrolink supertram system will be extended through Salford Quays and Trafford Park to the centre, improving the region's public transport infrastructure. The centre's market will be the 7m population of north-west England, north Wales and some of the west Midlands. Because the site is near five motorways and one main trunk road, most people in the region will be able to get there within 50 minutes. The site's potential was the lure for the hostile takeover of Manchester Ship Canal, the landowner, by Mr John Whittaker, Peel's chairman. He won control in 1987 after two years but was then stalled by a series of public inquiries and a dispute with the canal company's minority shareholders over the land's potential value. There were inquiries into three competing schemes for a retail centre in the area. Further delays occurred over traffic forecasts and whether the M63 motorway would have to be widened. A meeting last month approved the scheme for Peel to buy out minority shareholders at Pounds 23 a share, plus a Pounds 7 loan note, redeemable for Pounds 10.50 when the centre opens. Yesterday's decision is expected to enhance the prospects of Peel, which is now fully absorbing the ship canal into its own Stock Exchange quotation. Peel's shares closed up 11p yesterday at 340p.</p>

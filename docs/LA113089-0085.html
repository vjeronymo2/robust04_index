			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA MUST SLOW BARRICK IN BOWL GAME  </P> <P> Excuse Coach Phil Passno if he's somewhat apprehensive about Ventura College's  invitation to the Hall of Fame bowl in San Diego on Saturday.  </P> <P> The seven-year coach is, by all means, excited about the opportunity.  Especially after the Pirates (7-3) lost their last three regular-season games  and looked as if they'd be couch-bound rather than bowl-bound.  </P> <P> Ventura struggled after injuries and a drive-by shooting all but decimated the  squad, but the team got its first break in weeks when the Pirates were selected  over Cerritos (6-3-1), Fullerton (6-4) and Citrus (6-4) for the right to meet  Palomar (6-4).  </P> <P> "Things bounced our way, and I'm real happy for us," Passno said. "It's a  quality bowl. It's an opportunity to make a little money and hopefully put on a  good show."  </P> <P> But Passno isn't jumping up and down about facing Palomar's Scott Barrick, who  led the state in passing with 3,225 yards and broke or tied numerous school  records. A second-team J. C. Grid-Wire All-American, Barrick set a state record  with 248 completions. He attempted 449 passes, which is second only to Darren  Kelderman's national record of 452 in 1984 for Iowa Lake.  </P> <P> So it didn't take Passno long to conclude he doesn't want anything to do with  Barrick (6-foot-2, 200 pounds), who throws out of a shotgun formation most of  the time. To make matters worse, Palomar sends four targets out on almost every  down. "I'm leaving it up to our defensive coaches," Passno said with a laugh.  </P> <P> Which isn't a bad move, considering defensive coordinator Steve Tobias has  directed a unit that ranks 13th in the state, allowing 261 yards per game.  Tobias is impressed with Barrick, as well as receivers Chris Chiarappa (1,282  yards in receptions) and Eric Hanson (1,004 yards).  </P> <P> "Barrick is a talented athlete, but we'll just go at it and see how we match  up," Tobias said. "We'll just try to put some pressure on him. If you let him  stand back there and throw, it'll be a long night."  </P> <P> There have been plenty of long evenings for Palomar opponents. Barrick averages  45 attempts, 25 completions, and 322 yards a game. He has thrown 21 touchdowns  and 16 interceptions.  </P> <P> "We haven't seen anybody like him," Tobias said. "I think it's a great  challenge for us."  </P> <P> Tobias says the best, and perhaps only defense of Barrick's bullets is  Ventura's own ball-control offense. "The best place for him is standing on the  sidelines, watching the game," Tobias said.  </P> <P> Therefore Ventura will attempt to re-establish a once-potent rushing attack  that was slowed by injuries to Ryan Rapoza and John Johnson. Rapoza, who broke  a finger, is limited because of a cast but is expected -- along with Ferando  Green and William Mills -- to provide yardage. Johnson was injured in a  drive-by shooting two weeks ago and won't return.  </P> <P> Quarterback Todd Paffhausen, who has thrown for 1,207 yards and 10 touchdowns,  is healthy again. And, for the first time in weeks, Ventura is able to put a  healthy defensive unit on the field.  </P> <P> "It'll be nice to be able to put our best foot forward," Passno said.  </P> <P> Not everyone is healthy, however. All-American nose guard Eeron Wilson (broken  arm) and defensive lineman Adam Flores (sprained ankle) are doubtful. Rico  Jones, injured along with Johnson in the drive-by shooting, will miss the  contest.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, a host of Pirates return. "The list is long and impressive,"  Passno said.  </P> <P> That also could describe Ventura's string of seven consecutive wins to start  the season. The Pirates struggled their past three games, but are eager for the  second bowl bid under Passno and fourth overall. "It's a great opportunity for  the kids," Passno said.  </P> <P> The Moorpark College players won't be talking about learning experiences when  they play Rancho Santiago College in the Orange County Bowl on Saturday at 1  p.m. in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> The game is a rematch of the 1988 PONY Bowl, which Rancho Santiago won, 17-10,  and the Raiders want revenge. Rancho Santiago (9-1) is ranked sixth in the  state, Moorpark (9-1) is seventh.  </P> <P> Rancho Santiago averages more than 400 yards a game on offense. First-team  All-American Estrus Crayton (6-3, 185) has rushed for 1,340 yards, and  honorable mention quarterback Scott Wood (6-4, 205) has thrown for 2,082.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / French officials jailed for Aids deaths THREE former senior French health officials received prison sentences yesterday after being found guilty of allowing blood carrying the HIV virus to be injected into 1,200 haemophiliacs in the most serious medical scandal to hit France in recent years. A Paris court sent Dr Michel Garretta, former head of the national blood transfusion centre, to prison for four years for fraud and criminal negligence and fined him FFr500,000 (Pounds 60,241), the heaviest sentence available. More than 250 haemophiliacs have died as a result of receiving infected blood seven years ago from the state transfusion service, at the time a monopoly. The trial, which opened in the summer, has been an emotionally charged factor in the declining popularity of the ruling Socialist party. Dr Garetta's colleague, Dr Jean-Pierre Allain, former head of transufusion research at the centre, was given a four-year sentence with two years suspended, on the same charges. He said yesterday he had been made a scapegoat and would appeal. Dr Allain was suspended yesterday from a British post as a director of the East Anglian blood transfusion service. The third official, Mr Jacques Roux, former public health director, received a four-year suspended sentence for criminal negligence, while a fourth, Dr Robert Netter, former director of the health ministry laboratory, was acquitted of the same charge. In addition, the court ordered Mr Garretta and Mr Allain and the national blood transfusion foundation to pay FFr9.2m to the victims, who will also receive compensation from the government. This will run into 'billions of francs' Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said yesterday. Aids sufferers' groups yesterday condemned the sentences as inadequate and renewed calls for for the trial of the politicians responsible for health at the time. Members of Act Up, the leading anti-Aids action group, demonstrated outside the court calling for a 'Nuremberg of Aids.' However, government ministers can only be tried for crimes relating to their jobs if impeached by parliament. The right-wing opposition tried without success earlier this month to impeach Mr Laurent Fabius, prime minister at the time, plus Mrs Georgina Dufoux and Mr Edmond Herve, former ministers of social security and health.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Surgeons face up to a 3-D future The National Engineering Laboratory has developed a three-dimensional computer modelling system which could help surgeons plan facial surgery more accurately. Surgeons carrying out reconstructive or plastic surgery traditionally rely on 2-D information from photographs and X-rays of the patient's face. The limitations of this method can result in operations being repeated. Glasgow-based NEL, working in conjunction with St George's Hospital, London, has designed a system using white light that can capture 3-D data from a patient's face in two seconds. It uses a 'moire fringe' contouring method, which relies on the interference of light patterns to detect the contours of a face. The developers of the system, known as OrthoForm, are now developing software that would allow surgeons to simulate facial surgery on computer. NEL: UK, tel 03552 20222; fax 03552 72946.</p>

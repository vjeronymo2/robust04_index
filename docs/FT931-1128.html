			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Observer: External eyes Sad to see Peter Wood, Barclays' able finance director, jumping ship and joining Standard Chartered, a bank less than a quarter its size. He's the type of veteran that Barclays can ill afford to lose. The internal warfare at the top of Barclays, leading to this week's decision to look outside for a new chief executive, must have been even worse than suspected. Andrew Buxton and Humphrey Norrington, his vice-chairman, have been with the bank for over 30 years. But virtually every one else at the top is a relative new boy. No doubt this results in plenty of fresh ideas but big clearing banks are conservative institutions where there is a premium on continuity. Perhaps Wood felt he had to quit so that he might join the list of external candidates vying for the new chief executive's job.</p>

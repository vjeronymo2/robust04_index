			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: Youth on life STAND BEFORE YOUR GOD: GROWING UP TO BE A WRITER by Paul Watkins Faber Pounds 14.99, 203 pages 'A WRITER of rare and precocious talent': this kind of glowing review and a prize-studded career to date certainly support Paul Watkins' reputation as one of today's most promising young writers. This 29-year-old author has already published four novels. Two have received nominations for the Booker Prize - the last, The Promise of Light, is currently being re-issued in paperback - while his second, based on his experiences deep-sea fishing off the New England coast, won the Encore Prize for the best second novel of the year and is currently being made into a film. The Promise of Light is set in 1921, the story of a young American who sets out for Ireland to track down his family and walks straight into the savagery of the Black-and-Tan war. Accompanying its publication comes Watkins' autobiography, his tale of a homesick New Englander growing up amidst the pillow-fights and puppy loves of an English public school. Why is it that autobiographies seem to be written younger and younger these days? Watkins' self-chronicle, with its lofty title, actually provides few clues as to why he grew up to be a writer. His account of his years, first at the Dragon School, then at Eton, is remembered in such vivid detail that the reader is at first tempted to mistake immediacy for imagination. Watkins loved his Action Man, for instance. He loved him 'saying Brave Things like 'Mission Accomplished - Good Work Men' when you pulled his cord away from his chest.' He is distraught when he foxholes Action Man in the shrubbery and he gets sliced to pieces by the groundman's rotary mower. The trouble is that when his father, a real life Action Man, dies prematurely from cancer, Watkins' growing-up seems to stop in the classroom. Denied the chance to prove himself or to earn his rite of passage, it is as though he is resigned to have to look out on to the grown-up world outside. Watkins never says as much - perhaps he cannot, which is why the book is strangely moving - but we glimpse it in the way the film of Michael Caine's last-ditch stand against the Zulus gives him nightmares, or in the way a First World War documentary leads him to spend a solitary school holiday tramping around the battlefields of Ypres and Passchendaele. Here a ghostly camaraderie envelops this fatherless adventurer, as if, among a league of sleeping knights, he had momentarily earned his spurs: 'I felt a kind of gentleness surround me in the mist. It was a sense of being looked at by kind eyes and protected from harm.' While the book may be psychologically revealing, it is rather one-dimensional to read because Watkins never gets inside the experiences he describes. Indeed, one's overwhelming impression is that he still inhabits the mind-set of these schoolboy dramas of treachery and betrayal. One is reminded, a touch unfairly, of Norman Mailer's remark about JD Salinger: 'the finest mind never to leave prep-school'.</p>

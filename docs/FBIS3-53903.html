Al-Hudaybi was surprised when the Jordanian  authorities banned him from entering without giving any reason.  The Jordanian authorities even prevented him from seeing his  daughter, who was waiting for him at the incoming passengers  gate at the airport. Al- Hudaybi was forced to return to Egypt  on the same plane.    This should have never taken place and should not pass  unnoticed. The Egyptian authorities should have adopted a  position and performed their duty in defense of the dignity of  its nationals, particularly those who are prominent and  well-known symbols. We hope that the Jordanian authorities will  reconsider their position. It is an unacceptable attitude even  if it was in retaliation for the Egyptian authorities'  preventing Muhammad 'Abd-al-Rahman Khalifah, general guide of  the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, from entering Egypt. This is  also unacceptable behavior.</p>

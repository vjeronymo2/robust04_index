			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Moncef Mahroug: "Elections: How the RCD Chose </F> Its Candidates"--first paragraph is REALITES introduction]    [Text] Out of the RCD's [Constituional Democraic Rally] 144  candidates, 105 are new faces. There are reasons for this  profound change.    When the slates of candidates of the Constitutional  Democratic Assembly for the 20 March legislative elections were  made public on Saturday, 26 February, many hopes evaporated and  many plans collapsed. Because the makeup of the slates surprised  more than one person. And there was reason to be surprised and  even to fall over for all those who--and there are probably many  of them--within the RCD had hoped to appear on these slates and  who, why not, already saw themselves as deputies.    Of the many names that public rumor had held were on the  RCD's slates of candidates, there were very few whose hopes were  realized. This is scarcely surprising, at least as it relates to  outgoing deputies, an overwhelming majority of whom will not  have the opportunity to be part of the first multicolor Chamber  of Deputies that will in all likelihood emerge from the  elections on 20 March.    Of the 141 outgoing members of the Chamber, 102 (more than  70  percent) will not run again. In this cohort is a group of  genuine record holders who have spent, often discontinuously,  between 15 and 30 years at the Bardo Palace. The eldest among  them is Mr. Habib Tliba, the only member of the current Chamber  of Deputies to have been a part of the Constituent Council and  subsequently to have served six terms interrupted by one  six-year period (between the fourth and fifth terms).    However, most of the deputies who are not running again have  served only one term (78) or two (12). And close to one-half of  them (50 are between the ages of 40 and 49 and three are between  30 and 39) are still young.    Given such a profound change, it would be difficult to find  an electoral district untouched by this huge movement. In fact  there aren't any. Even the rerun rate again varies from one  district to another. At the two opposite ends there is Nabeul,  half of whose deputies are running for a new term, and a group  of seven electoral districts (Gabes, Sfax (2), Mahdia, Ben  Arous, Tataouine, Kebili, and Tozeur) whose candidates are new  faces.    Only 39 of the RCD's 144 candidates belong to the outgoing  Chamber of Deputies. The breakdown by age of this group is  identical with that of the group of the 102 who are not running  again. Most of them (26) are under the age of 50 (between 40 and  49 years old).    When the composition of the two groups is analyzed, it  becomes clear that the first criterion--but not the most  important one, since the number of affected deputies is not very  large--on the basis of which the selection was made was that of  the number of terms: no deputy (out of a total of 12) who had  served more than two terms was chosen to appear on the RCD's  slates.    Those vying for a slot on the RCD's slates also had very  few--if any-- chances of being reslated if they already have  other duties. Indeed, the closest aides of the head of state and  the RCD chairman were told to avoid wearing too many hats per  individual "so as to expand the exercise of political  responsibilities" and give new men a chance to test themselves.  Besides, that is the main reason for the nonappearance in the  political arena of most of the RCD's big guns and for the  overwhelming majority of members of the government.    Another presidential concern guided the choice of RCD  candidates in the legislative elections: the concern to ensure  balance at the local level, i.e., between delegations. The  allocation of slots among the latter was, in fact, made on the  basis of a detailed study, which determined the degree of  representation of each delegation with respect to the various  categories of political, administrative, and economic staff.  Thus priority was given to the underrepresented delegations even  when their "candidate for the candidacy" has a less solid  profile than someone else's.    So the Chamber of Deputies that will emerge from the 20  March  elections will be quite different from the present Chamber and  in particular from the pre-changeover Chamber. Indeed, out of  the RCD's 144 candidates--105 of whom are new--there are no more  than five deputies[.sup]1[/] who occupied the same position  before 7 November 1987, as against 24 in the outgoing Chamber.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1: Composition of the Outgoing Chamber of Deputies by Profession       |

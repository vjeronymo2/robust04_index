Zoran Vaskovic  reports from the Assembly:    [Vaskovic] Eleven deputies took part in the discussion this  morning. Their speeches, and the speeches by another 50  deputies still to speak, indicate that the debate will be long  and polemic. With one exception, all the speakers were deputies  from the opposition parties. They expressed the objection that  the proposed program is too general and that it does not stand a  chance of being implemented. They also demanded further cuts in  the budget. The deputies from the opposition parties stressed  that the cabinet of Mirko Marjanovic is not a government of  national unity, as he had tried to achieve.    The only member of the ruling party who spoke today was  Zoran  Andjelkovic. The essence of his speech was that the opposition  has not achieved any results in the communes where they won.    Let us repeat: We are facing a long debate, after which the  deputies will vote on the new government. In order to be  elected, the government needs at least 126 votes. Aleksandra  Jankovic is currently addressing the Assembly and some 50 more  deputies are still to speak. That is all from the Serbian  Assembly.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Five arrested in Dublin IRA probe Five people were arrested by police in Dublin yesterday after investigations into IRA racketeering. Swoops were made on 12 addresses in the city by police units from the special branch, fraud and drug squads. The detainees are being held under Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, the republic's anti-terrorist legislation. They can be held for up to 48 hours without being charged. The last such operation was four months ago and resulted in 22 arrests on both sides of the Irish Sea but the 11 arrested in the republic were released without charge.</p>

Savate combines the movement  and gloved punching of boxing with Asian martial arts kicking techniques.  Savate has been selected as a demonstration sport for the 1996 Olympics in  Paris and may be in 1992 in Barcelona.  </P> <P> Tickets cost $45 ringside, $35 for reserved and $25 general admission.

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Bank Governor urges check on corporate abuses: Institute of Directors Convention MR Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, yesterday advocated a cautious, 'plural' approach by the City to ensure that there was no repetition of the recent spate of corporate abuses and failures. He told the Institute of Directors annual convention at the Royal Albert Hall in London: 'You will not find me a supporter of a blockbusting or portmanteau solution to the Maxwell kind of problem, but you will find me encouraging and promoting the plural approach to try to get the right balance between sensible safeguards and freedom to take legitimate risks.' Proper corporate accountability required mechanisms for checks and balances to prevent a concentration and abuse of power, 'for example, separation as a general rule of the role of chief executive and chairman, the appointment of independent directors, the setting up of audit committees'. Although he recognised that not all industrialists agreed with these prescriptions, he said: 'No one could seriously suggest that the current framework and arrangements are ideally suited to the complexities of our current corporate life.' He added: 'In my view, the onus is on the opponents of the tide for change to say what they would do about the abuses and failures.' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said he did not accept the view that the Maxwell case was a failure of self-regulation, and by inference that this should be replaced by a new official bureaucracy. The chain of laws and agencies which dealt with aspects of the Maxwell affair combined a mixture of criminal and civil law, official regulation and self-regulation, and the case did not make a good object lesson one way or another. He said the authorities could create various safeguards, but they would never be able to construct a fail-safe system to prevent fraud. The price of freedom for individuals and for enterprises seeking to be successful was eternal vigilance, not eternal reporting. 'To stifle economic enterprise by too much control would be a disastrous over-reaction,' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said. What had to be done was to make roles clearer. He added: 'We also need to become clearer about precisely what can be expected of regulators and what can be done to safeguard the independence of non-executive directors, accountants and other guardians of proper behaviour, so very powerful individuals face similarly powerful obstacles to attempts to abuse their position.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hemi Shalev] </F>   [Text] A senior official in the Jerusalem Foreign Ministry  this week sent an extraordinary telegram to the Israeli Embassy  in Washington, containing strong criticism of the "hesitant"  foreign policy of the U.S. Administration and negative personal  comments about senior administration officials.    In a comprehensive and secret survey on U.S. foreign policy,  Eytan Bentzur, the deputy director general of the Foreign  Ministry, in charge of North America and Disarmament Affairs  Division, states that "we witness hesitancy with regard to  handling foreign policy, with determined positions being adopted  in crises areas only." Bentzur states that the U.S. foreign  policy "is seen as lacking in vision and determination,"  according to the order of priorities set by President Clinton.    William Perry, the new U.S. defense secretary, is described  by Bentzur as a "second-rate appointment who does not conform  with the level of the first round of appointments by the  administration." As for Anthony Lake, the President's national  security adviser, Bentzur states: "It has been years since the  United States had a leader of the National Security Council who  is such an introverted and withdrawn person hesitating to leave  his mark on anything."    Bentzur also strongly attacks Martin Indyk, National  Security  Council official in charge of Arab-Israeli affairs, following a  briefing Indyk gave to Israeli reporters in Washington this  week, in which he expressed fears about Yasir 'Arafat's power.  "The briefing was bewildering," Bentzur states, since in  addition to expressing concern, Indyk also talked of "the fear  and doubt which has seized large sectors of Israel about the  chances of the success of the Document of Principles."    "The peace team is also giving rise to quite a bit of  concern," Bentzur continues. "The vision, the determination,  the resolve, and the creativity" manifest under the leadership  of the previous secretary of state "is not manifested at this  stage of the process."</p>

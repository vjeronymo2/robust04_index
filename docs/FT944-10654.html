			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (11): Cornerstone of reform programme - Stephen Fidler explains the capitalisation process President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada calls capitalisation the cornerstone of his government's reform programme. It aims to shift companies responsible for 12.5 per cent of Bolivia's gross domestic product to the private sector. But the idea is not to sell the six state companies involved directly to private buyers. It is to entice foreign investors to make investments in them in return for ownership, typically, of half the company. The remaining portion - apart from a small distribution to workers - will be distributed to an estimated 3.8m Bolivians as pensions contributions. This, it is hoped, will prevent opposition to the proposal from Bolivians who - according to opinion polls - associate privatisation with a loss of national sovereignty and corruption. The idea is to stimulate investment and thereby boost growth. The government estimates that these reforms should allow growth to rise steeply to 7 per cent by 1999. Without this, and other reforms, it estimates growth of 4.7 per cent. The proposal to capitalise, rather than privatise, has some disadvantages. In the early years, rather than bolster government finances, it worsens them  -because no revenues are received from the sale of the company. This risks a short-term increase in the government's already heavy debt burden. Some potential investors are also likely to see the mechanism as excessively complicated. The project has many hurdles still to overcome. A raft of legislation is needed following the overall capitalisation law passed this year: laws to establish an overall regulatory system for the capitalised companies, on the electricity, telecommunications and hydrocarbons sectors, a tax reform, adjustments to the mining code and a transportation reform are all required. After this, a law for pension fund reform is needed. Opposition from employees, trade unions and other interest groups must also be surmounted. The government will lastly need to demonstrate financial success. The keys are the first capitalisation, of the electricity company Ende and of the oil company YPFB - alone responsible for 9 per cent of GDP. Officials admit there may be difficulties in capitalising the state airline, the railway and the mining assets. However, the impression that many Bolivians have - that the public sector companies are profitable and contribute to the budget is false, says Mr Fernando Candia, the president of the central bank. Although the companies run an operating surplus of about 0.8 per cent of GDP, debt servicing costs are equal to 2.5 per cent of GDP, producing a net deficit of 1.7 per cent. The one-time costs associated with the capitalisation and other reforms will raise the budget deficit in 1995 and 1996. According to a Dollars 140m three-year loan agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund last month, the deficit will rise to 4.4 per cent of GDP next year, and closer to 5 per cent in 1996, from an expected 3.3 per cent this year. Eventually it is hoped that increased tax revenues from the capitalised companies will more than make up for the initial shortfall. Mr Edgar Saravia, capitalisation secretary, says that the capitalisation programme is about six weeks behind schedule, but believes that by July next year, the first stage of the programme - the handover of the companies to foreign operators - should be complete. The remaining shares will be held in trust until the pension arrangements can be established, to allow them to be distributed among every adult Bolivian. This will not be an easy task, in part because the state has no record of the names of a majority of its citizens. The government agonised over whether to take the time to legislate the reform - as the World Bank was urging - or whether to move more rapidly, as the Argentine government had in its privatisation programme, by presidential decree. 'Bolivia is not a country where people look at the outset to make their investments. To the degree that we can give outside investors more stability - for example through legislation - we think we will be more successful,' said Mr Saravia. Problems in establishing satisfactory regulation of the Argentine companies after privatisation helped to persuade the government that it should first establish regulatory regimes before the companies were moved to the private sector. Capitalisation will not necessarily stop with the sale of existing companies. Mr Saravia says some of the money raised by the flotation of Cochabamba Power and Light, now a subsidiary of the state electricity company, Ende, will be used to start a long-awaited project to drill a tunnel through the mountains to bring water to the parched city of Cochabamba. Foreign government donors were to be asked to consider matching the expected Dollars 19m funding with a similar amount. Then, once the drilling is complete - no private sector investor is likely to take on the drilling risk  -the whole Misicuni project may be capitalised with a private sector investor.</p>

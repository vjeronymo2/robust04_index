			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Lively opening brings a disappointing end-game: It is difficult to see chess as the snooker of the 1990s AS A SPECTATOR sport the world championship chess clash between Gary Kasparov and Nigel Short never appeared fully to catch fire. It is unlikely to become the snooker of the 1990s. It failed to grab the national attention in spite of a controversial start, a British challenger for the first time in living memory, and a London venue. However, at the grassroots the match does appear to have made an impact, although it may take years for that to be felt. To the players, exhausted after 20 games, it probably feels like a lifetime since they founded the breakaway Professional Chess Association and invited bids to stage the match in defiance of Fide, the game's world governing body. A consortium of Times Newspapers and Teleworld Holdings, a telecommunications group with a headquarters in Rotterdam, won the rights to stage the match with a bid of Pounds 1.7m in prize money. The group beat off four rival bids. Channel 4 gained exclusive television rights in the UK for an undisclosed sum. The match was staged in the Savoy Theatre, London, which can seat 1,000, so there was the prospect of 24,000 ticket sales at prices from Pounds 150 to Pounds 45. In the event the television cameras have often as not shown a half-empty theatre. Ticket prices were heavily discounted. Teleworld abandoned its Europe-wide 'Predict-a-move' telephone chess line after three games. The company had envisaged 2,000 armchair players phoning in each game at rates of 36p and 48p a minute. Mr Wytze de Back, vice-president of corporate communications at Teleworld said: 'We were disappointed. We never received more than 500 calls and had to drop the idea in Europe at least.' Both the Times and Channel 4 declared themselves pleased with the tournament. Mr Phil Lawlor, the head of promotion at The Times, said: 'We did not cover our costs, but in sponsorship you do not expect to. That is not the way it works. We received more than 72 hours of television exposure for our brand.' Mr Lawlor dismissed the notion that the matches were badly attended. He said: 'Most days between 600 and 700 tickets were sold, and the theatre was two thirds full. But people did not stay seated all the time.' Channel 4 said the company also regarded the tournament as a success, and added: 'We had cumulative audiences of between 1.75m and 2m on match days for the three programmes.' Mr David Ellender, sales director of Television International which is part of Polygram and syndicated television coverage outside the UK said: 'The tournament sold reasonably well.' Mr Raymond Katz, manager of Hatchards in London's Piccadilly, said the shop saw more interest in chess books because of the tournament, but added: 'There has been a rise of interest for some time, particularly young people.' Someone in no doubt that the tournament made an impact was Mr Richard Feather, a director of Chess and Bridge, which publishes Chess Monthly, as well as books on chess and chess sets. He said: 'There has been a terrific increase in interest. I would say our sales have increased 300 per cent because of the match. Chess Monthly has sold an extra 1,000 copies. We have also seen an increase in City headhunters and job agencies interested in using chess for recruitment.'</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: A better model - The measure of house prices Forecasting house prices can prove an embarrassment. The Household Mortgage Corporation predicted a rise of 15.3 per cent in house prices for 1991/92. The prices went steadily down. Now HMC has asked Loughborough University's Economics department to devise a new model to predict changes up to two years ahead. The first forecast looks realistic - a rise by the end of the year of between 4 1/2 and 7 1/2 per cent. What went wrong with the old model, produced by the Henley Forecasting Centre for HMC in 1987? It worked well in the boom, said Jeff Wagland of HMC, but could not cope during recession, partly because it did not take enough account of the fall off in house building, nor of how the new homes that had been built were clogging the market. The Loughborough team has combined a number of indices, such as housing starts, the unemployment rate and mortgage costs with 34 general economic forecasts to provide its forecast. These predictions do not include long-term demographic trends, such as the growth of households which has been far faster - single mothers included - than the growth of the population. But they can divide the country into regions and predict that in the North West, where prices slumped later than in the rest of the country, they will start to recover only in a year's time. By then, in the South East a forecast average price of around Pounds 79,000 will have risen to a value which will once again equal the average value of the mortgage. They expect a rise of more than 6 per cent in the South East, South West and East Anglia by 1995, and of less than 4 per cent in Wales, the North West and the North. For the Midlands and Scotland they predict 4 to 6 per cent. The HMC forecasts complement the Halifax and Nationwide price indices. Halifax, the largest lender, is predicting that house prices will rise by 5 per cent during the year and Nationwide shares a similar view. All three models measure a statistical mean - not actual bricks and mortar. The two societies' indices take their data from the properties on which they lend each month, breaking them down into basic characteristics (type, size, number of bathrooms, central heating, arrangements for cars, etc) and rating these statistically. These data are recombined to estimate what the statistically average property that was the base in 1983 would cost now. Why do the two indices differ, if both were started at 100 in 1983? Halifax now stands at 201.3, Nationwide at 193.90. The differences are not so great as the numbers suggest. The methodology of both indices is much the same. And, since inception, their long-term trends agree startlingly well. The different numbers reflect partly their different ways of measuring and weighting. Nationwide looks to the South and South East and measures by mortgages approved - many of which will not be completed for a month or two, and some not at all. But approved rather than completed mortgages, makes a useful early indicator of trends. At the end of 1993, Nationwide was showing an annual change of 3.3 per cent; Halifax 1.2 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We proposed that, if HCFA wants to impose a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, it must notify the provider in writing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent to impose a penalty. The notice would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the statutory basis for the penalty, the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the penalty per day of noncompliance, any circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that were considered when determining the amount per day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed penalty, and instructions for responding to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, including a specific statement of the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> right to a hearing and implications of waiving a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the State proposes to impose a civil money penalty,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State would notify the facility in accordance with State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that a penalty amount would be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be imposed within the following ranges:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For deficiencies constituting an immediate and serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat (that is, a severity level of 4, regardless of scope)_$3,050 to $10,000 per day;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For deficiencies constituting nonimmediate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonserious threat above a scope or severity level of 1_$50 to $3,000 per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;For both levels, the amount of the civil money penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be set at $50 increments within these ranges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Removal of the immediate and serious threat, but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the deficiencies, would justify the shift to the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties that are imposed for nonimmediate and nonserious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threat above a scope or severity level of 1. A penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be imposed at the immediate and serious level for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of days the immediate and serious threat is present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We proposed that a provider may, in lieu of contesting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency which led to the imposition of the civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty, waive the right to a hearing within the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframes and procedures in the regulations under &sect;498.40  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Request for hearing) for Medicare and &sect;431.221 (Request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hearing) for Medicaid. If the facility were to waive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to a hearing within 60 days from the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice, HCFA or the State would be required to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty by 35 percent. If the facility were to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waive the right to a hearing after the 60th day, HCFA's or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State's settlement would be discretionary. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction in the civil money penalty would reflect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings to both the government and the provider of costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that would otherwise be incurred to formally adjudicate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dispute. The provider would be free to reject the option to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waive the right to a hearing. We proposed that the daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fine amount of a facility could be increased if the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alleges compliance, but on a revisit by HCFA or the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey agency, the facility is still found to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliant with the same requirements. The purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> giving HCFA or the State discretion to increase the daily  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fine, we believe, would be to deter unfounded allegations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance. The amount of increase, if any, would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective the day following the resurvey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

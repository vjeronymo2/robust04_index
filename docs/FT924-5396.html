			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Polish sell-off slows down Nearly 40,000 private companies have been established in Poland since the fall of communism in 1989 and the private sector generated more than 45.3 per cent of gross domestic product last year, Reuter reports from Warsaw. But latest figures from the Privatisation Ministry show that after the initial rush of privatisation, covering mainly shops and small businesses, the sell-off has slowed. In the first nine months of this year only 45 state companies were transferred into private hands, a figure which reflects the problems the government is having attracting buyers to industry.</p>

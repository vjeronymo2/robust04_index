			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MAISKY OPENS SOUTHLAND VISIT WITH LAGUNA RECITAL  </P> <P> Neither the most style-conscious nor the most immaculate of cellists, Mischa  Maisky, who returns to Southern California this week for appearances with the  Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra (beginning Wednesday), nevertheless brings a  strong musical personality to his playing.  </P> <P> Opening his week's visit here Sunday night with a recital for the Laguna Beach  Chamber Music Society, Maisky asserted that personality boldly. Like his  mentors, Mstislav Rostropovich and the late Gregor Piatigorsky, Maisky makes  music that is a personal statement first of all.  </P> <P> As a result, the second half of Maisky's recital, in which he was assisted by  pianist David Gross, proved the more engrossing portion of the performance in  the unheated auditorium at Laguna Beach High School. Maisky and Gross seemed to  relish all the challenges and facets in Schubert's "Arpeggione" Sonata and in  the Sonata by Debussy, clearly distinguishing their disparate rhetorics.  </P> <P> For once, the genuine lightness of mood and melancholy musical subtext of the  "Arpeggione" were indicated without resort to grandstanding. The cellist and  his solid pianistic partner gave every phrase its due, but overstated nothing.  This reading therefore achieved great charm without great self-consciousness.  </P> <P> The hardy but still crushable Debussy opus also benefited from such a  clarifying approach. And the teamwork between the two players again proved  tight and single-minded.  </P> <P> Less involving and less satisfying, the pre-intermission performances emerged  earthbound, if competent. Maisky's playing of Bach's Suite No. 3 for  unaccompanied cello seemed to specialize in articulate statements not always  connected to each other in thought, regular fragmenting of the longer line and  contrasts sought for their own sake.  </P> <P> And Brahms' familiar E-minor Sonata became more dutiful than passionate, the  piano part in particular remaining in the emotional shadows.DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

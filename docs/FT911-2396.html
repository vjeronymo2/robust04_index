			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Extra funds for Kurdish refugees - Overseas Aid AN extra Pounds 20m of government money to help the Kurdish refugees was announced yesterday by Mr John Major, Alison Smith writes. The prime minister told Mrs Ann Clwyd, the shadow overseas development minister, that the funds would be used to continue the airbridge operation, provide urgently needed supplies and help finance the UK's role in Operation Haven, to set up safe areas in Iraq. The government has given a total of Pounds 62m to the relief effort since the beginning of April, including Pounds 10m announced last week as a contribution to the Kurdish Refugee Appeal. The new money is also intended to allow the Overseas Development Administration to keep up its planned activities, including provision of help for famine relief in Africa. Mrs Clwyd welcomed the extra funds to help the Kurds, the first time since 1979 that the government had increased the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) budget for an emergency. She said, however, that the additional amount would not meet the full cost of the relief effort. The ODA had already spent Pounds 20m on supplies and was spending Pounds 1.5m per week to the ministry of defence and commercial airlines to fly the goods to the region.</p>

The message said:    The nightmarish opening of the rice market in South Korea is  a never-to-be-condoned crime which results from the flunkeyist  treachery of Kim Yong-sam who flatteringly yielded to the  brigandish pressure from U.S. imperialism. It is intolerable  that he claims "there will be more things gained than lost" in  rice market opening.    Due to the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, the six million  farmers of South Korea are deprived of fields and means of  livelihood.    The only way for us to get rid of the miserable lot today is  to cut the colonial noose of the United States through the  anti-U.S. struggle for independence and decisively overthrow Kim  Yong-sam, a pro-U.S. flunkeyist and rare traitor.    The message called on the South Korean farmers to rise up in  struggle and resolutely check the rice market opening ruinous to  the nation, overthrow the Kim Yong-sam "government" and drive  out the United States.</p>

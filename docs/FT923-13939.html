			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hughes Aircraft plans assault on Europe - The ambitions of General Motors' defence and electronics arm FROM its bases on the west coast of the US and in the UK, Hughes Aircraft, the defence and electronics arm of General Motors, is planning its assault on the fragmented markets of Europe. It is hunting for acquisitions and joint ventures in any of its four core businesses: defence, electronics, vehicle technology and telecommunications. The intention is to reduce the company's dependence on US sales by doing business with Europe's governments and its biggest companies. Mr Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive, is undaunted by the prospect of trading with such a patchwork of customers, each with its own standards and needs. 'We're good at dealing with bureaucracy and paperwork - we've been working with government for years,' he says. For Hughes, working with government means being one of the biggest US defence contractors. The Gulf war saw more than 7,000 of its missiles launched and its radar saw service in most fighter aircraft and warships. The company is also involved in satellites and satellite services, aircraft flight simulators and automotive technology. But the military still accounts for 65 per cent of Hughes' Dollars 8bn turnover, and sales within the US are worth 80 per cent of the company's business. At a time of falling defence budgets and a deep domestic US recession, Hughes looks badly exposed. Enter Mr Armstrong. He joined Hughes in March this year after 31 years at IBM, where he had risen from systems engineer to be responsible for IBM's entire operations outside the US. He acknowledges that the combination of international experience with industrial as well as government clients got him the top job at Hughes. It did not take long for his presence to be felt. This month, Hughes said it would cut more than 9,000 jobs, or 15 per cent of its workforce. The restructuring - blamed partly on cuts in defence programmes and partly on the weak economy - will result in an after-tax charge of Dollars 749.4m. Mr Armstrong is quick to reassure that Europe will not see the kind of cuts he is instituting in the US. 'We plan to grow business and staff in Europe.' There are two clear routes to higher sales in Europe. One is the military, where Hughes is the prime contractor for the UK's medium-range surface to air missile (MSAM). Its partners in this Pounds 500m-plus (Dollars 955m-plus) contract are Siemens, Plessey and Norsk Forsvarsteknologi of Norway. The competitors are formidable: one group consists of British Aerospace and Raytheon of the US, the other is a combination of the UK's GEC, Thomson of France and Alenia of Italy. Unfortunately for all three consortia, the decision on which wins the contract has been delayed for at least six months by uncertainty over the European Fighter Aircraft project. Last week, the UK Ministry of Defence wrote to them saying they would have to wait until June 1993 to know which has won the contract. The second area is in automotive technology, which the company was encouraged to enter after the General Motors takeover in 1985. Since then, Hughes has found itself adapting radars into collision avoidance systems and using advanced electronics to make safety air bags and electric cars. Mr Armstrong insists the GM connection will not guarantee sales to Opel and Vauxhall, GM's European subsidiaries and which are not currently Hughes customers. 'GM Europe was set up independently and they were able to build up more effectively as a result. We have come here to compete for the business, but we hope they'll let us in the door,' he says. Going international with satellite services, one of its most successful US operations, is more problematic. Hughes is the biggest seller of satellite time for domestic US telecommunications. But Mr Armstrong winces at the suggestion that the company should internationalise this business. Such a move would bring it into direct competition with its best customers for the satellites it builds, the international telecommunications consortia Intelsat and Inmarsat. He prefers being a satellite service provider through direct broadcasting by satellite. He is even prepared to countenance Hughes becoming involved in television programme acquisition and revenue collection from subscribers to any channels he set up. Such plans are still several years from fruition. In the meantime, the company is keen to tighten its grip on small satellite dishes. It has already met with success in Europe: Alcatel of France this year abandoned its own investment of between Dollars 30m and Dollars 50m in small dishes and now plans to market Hughes-built devices. Such collaborative ventures are central to Hughes' strategy in Europe, especially for the French market. 'This is done knowing that market access is the most important thing,' confesses Mr Armstrong. Hughes also has links in missiles with Thomson of France and Siemens of Germany. It has Japanese joint ventures in satellites and TV displays. Does this emphasis on collaboration mean European acquisitions are ruled out? 'There are none on the table, but they may yet happen,' says Mr Armstrong.</p>

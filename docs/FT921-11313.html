			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Heavyweight bout with no real winners - The anti-climactic ICI/Hanson title fight showed up weaknesses, rather than strengths LORD HANSON and Sir Denys Henderson, the ICI chairman, are stepping down from the ring bloodied and bruised. Retiring to their dressing rooms they can now assess how the battle has left them placed for their next bouts in the corporate ring. Lord Hanson's scorecard shows that his reputation for unrivalled mastery of the acquisition game is in peril. That means that questions about the future of his acquisitive conglomerate will become more pressing. Sir Denys has won the contest on points. ICI is becoming leaner and more agile. But many of the doubts raised about its performance will haunt it long after Hanson has sold its stake. For Lord Hanson, and for investors in his company, much has changed since the daring purchase of 2.8 per cent of ICI's shares in May last year. A fund manager who had attended a recent meeting with Lord Hanson, said: 'The last time we saw Lord Hanson was in 1990, when he was in a triumphant mood. This time he was more sober. He had come to tell us that he had been wrong about ICI and that he was ruling himself out of bidding for the company.' For Lord Hanson to admit that he was wrong has come as a shock not only to institutional shareholders, but also to the City as a whole. Goldman Sachs, which advised ICI during the battle, believes that, by initiating a debate about the quality of Hanson's profits and its style of management, ICI has weakened the conglomerate's ability to make another big takeover. Mr Charles Pick, conglomerate analyst at Nomura, agrees, but says that Hanson could still make a medium-sized acquisition. 'If he wanted to make a bid for a company on the scale of ICI, he would need to issue equity. That is now harder for him because of the revelations about his managerial style and quality of profits. But with credit lines of around Pounds 5bn, Hanson would have no problem in making an all-cash bid for a medium-sized company.' Yet Hanson needs a big takeover to maintain its record of 28 years of earnings growth. Recent large US acquisitions have enabled Hanson to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 1.28bn to Pounds 1.31bn in the year to September 30. But in the UK, where there were no significant deals, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 474m to Pounds 424m. The big investment institutions are still not happy about Hanson's corporate governance. Although Lord Hanson has reassured some of them that the management of the company will become more open, and that there will be increased delegation of responsibility, there are still concerns among fund managers that Hanson has failed to appoint non-executive directors with sufficient power to protect shareholders' interests. As Hanson licks its wounds, one consolation might be the knowledge that it has thrown the solid, stable and occasionally complacent world of ICI into turmoil. Hanson's assault has raised doubts about ICI's strategy, management and financial performance which it has yet to dispel. In particular, the scrutiny provided by Hanson showed that in spite of reshaping in the last decade, ICI still does not have a mix of businesses to insulate it against recession. During the last year, only ICI's pharmaceuticals division has kept the company's results respectable. In the third quarter of 1991, the division generated pre-tax profits of Pounds 147m, compared with Pounds 196m for the whole group. Even here, the weakness exposed by Hanson - the division is small by the standards of the world's leading pharmaceutical companies such as Glaxo and Merck - persists. The bulk chemicals operations - still ICI's troublesome core business - are being restructured so that only the parts that have stayed profitable in this recession will remain. But the success of that plan is yet to be tested. A shadow has also been cast over the success of ICI's move into added-value products such as speciality chemicals and advanced materials. 'ICI has pumped hundreds of millions of pounds and huge management resources into specialities and they have nothing to show for it,' says Mr Stuart Wamsley, editor of Focus on Chemicals, an industry newsletter. A senior ICI executive admits that Hanson has forced the company to change: 'It has made us all much more aware than we were about the importance of assessing how we satisfy shareholders in everything we do.' It has ripped out layers of management as part of an attempt to cut costs by about Pounds 400m a year by the mid-1990s. About Pounds 200m has been taken out so far. Since January 1990, the workforce has been cut by nearly 14,000 and the company has made divestments of between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m. Four of ICI's seven general managers have been changed. Although Sir Denys insisted in November that Lord Hanson's holding was a distraction from the strategic review he started in February last year, the reality is that it was an essential spur to the process. ICI may have emerged from its contest with Lord Hanson determined to get fit, but the ICI corporate body has a tendency to corpulence. The danger is that, without the daily exercise of sparring with Lord Hanson in the takeover ring, ICI will once again lose its shape.</p>

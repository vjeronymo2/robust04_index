			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical difficulties assail Western Platinum WESTERN PLATINUM, the western world's third-largest producer of platinum group metals, has suffered severe difficulties arising from its recent rapid expansion as well as metallurgical problems at its refinery at Brakpan in South Africa. Mr Rob Davies, analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, part of the American Express banking group, suggests the problems will not be resolved completely for several months. Consequently, the full benefits of the expansion - which aims to quadruple base metal output and double that of precious metals - will take until 1993 to work through to shareholders in Lonrho, which owns 75 per cent of WestPlats. At that time, the company expects annual output to be 714,000 troy ounces of platinum group metals. Some of WestPlats' difficulties were caused by surface ore at the Karee mine, where a new shaft is being sunk, and from the newly-developed Eastern Platinum operations. That ore turned out to be heavily oxidised and it disturbed the delicate metallurgy of the WestPlats process plant. The plant was already suffering from 'lock-up'; a serious condition in which the steady flow of material is disrupted and production no longer takes the expected path. It is a constant danger for platinum plants, because the many different metals found in the ore they treat take varying amounts of time to pass through the system. At WestPlats the ore goes to five mills. These produce concentrate, which is treated at a smelter to produce a matte, an intermediate material. The matte first goes to a base metal refinery where copper and nickel are extracted. The residue passes to the precious metal refinery where gold and platinum group metals are finally released. It takes about a week for material to move through the smelter and then about two weeks more for the base metal refinery to produce copper and nickel. At the precious metal refinery, platinum is produced in about three weeks, palladium and gold after seven weeks, and rhodium after six months. Mr Davies says in a special report that, not only did the ore from Karee and Eastern Platinum disturb WestPlats' metallurgy, but that most of the sulphide minerals that contain the nickel with which rhodium is associated had been naturally leached out. Rhodium was selling at Dollars 5,000 a troy ounce at one stage last year (although it has since halved in price), so the shortfall had a serious impact on Lonrho's revenue. Mr Davies says: 'In addition to the technical problems, the whole operation was having to contend with a massive expansion which caused costs everywhere to rise as extra staff were trained and normal staffing ratios got out of kilter.' 'Once throughput has settled down at a steady state, the plant ought to stop retaining metal and, although it will always hold some, what goes in should eventually come out. 'The problem of the oxidised ore disturbing the metallurgy should also resolve itself as mining moves beyond the oxidised zones at Karee and Eastern Platinum into fresh, unweathered ore. This will restore metallurgical conditions to what passes for normal in a platinum plant.' As for timing, Mr Davies points out that it took WestPlats' rival Rustenburg and its technical partner Johnson Matthey of the UK ten months to get their new South African platinum refinery working properly.</p>

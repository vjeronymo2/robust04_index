			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET GETS A CASE OF WAR JITTERS; DOW SINKS 59;  </P> <P> STOCKS: ECONOMIC CONCERNS CONTRIBUTE TO THE ROUT. THE CLOSELY WATCHED MARKET  INDICATOR CLOSED AT ITS LOWEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN A YEAR.  </P> <P> The financial markets were thrown into turmoil Monday as investors reacted to  the combination of increasing tensions in the Middle East and domestic budget  woes.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index dived 59.41 to 2,452.97 -- its lowest close in  more than a year. Bond prices also fell, boosting yields for the benchmark  30-year Treasury bill to 9.17% from 9.12% on Friday. Meanwhile, oil and gold  prices soared.  </P> <P> "There is a feeling that war is imminent," said Michael Metz, market strategist  at Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York. "If you were to lose oil production in  Saudi Arabia, there would not be enough oil to go around at any price."  </P> <P> Consumers would find themselves so financially pinched after paying their  energy bills that they would have little left over for discretionary spending,  Metz added. "And since 60% of the economy is based on consumer spending, that  translates to a very dramatic economic slowdown -- probably a recession -- and  that could happen on a worldwide basis."  </P> <P> The market activity was spurred by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's  announcement over the weekend that he plans to bomb Saudi Arabian oil fields if  the economic blockade has its intended effect and begins to strangle his  nation. Market analysts believe that oil prices could double if Hussein carries  out his threat.  </P> <P> "If you are talking $60-a-barrel oil, all bets are off for the economy. All  bets are off for earnings, and all bets are off for the stock market," said  Hugh A. Johnson, chief investment officer with First Albany Corp.  </P> <P> Moreover, economic problems caused by high oil prices could be worsened by the  apparent inability of Congress to make a significant dent in the budget  deficit.  </P> <P> Unless Congress cuts the deficit, the Federal Reserve will not lower interest  rates. High interest rates coupled with high oil prices could have a  devastating impact on the U.S. economy and the stock market, analysts said.  </P> <P> "You have the worst possible combination of events for stock valuations," said  Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis at Merrill Lynch in New  York. "Interest rates and inflation are rising, earnings are falling and there  is a lot of uncertainty. You couldn't ask for a worse situation."  </P> <P> Added Johnson: "This is partially at the doorstep of the Middle East, but it is  also at the doorstep of Congress and their failure to reach an agreement about  the 1991 budget."  </P> <P> The prognosis for the future is also bleak on Wall Street, industry analysts  said.  </P> <P> "The thing about this market is you don't have to wait long to have some  losses," Johnson said. "You buy a stock on Friday, and it's down two points on  Monday." That serves to depress prices further, he said.  </P> <P> "When investors get beaten over the head enough, they lose the sense of urgency  to buy stocks," he added. "Stocks may look enticingly cheap, but investors  still believe they can buy stocks cheaper tomorrow. It is a totally demoralized  investor environment."  </P> <P> Monday's selloff was broad-based, with 1,414 issues declining, compared to only  237 advancing. The average share on the New York Stock Exchange fell 61 cents.  Volume was moderate, with 162.21 million shares trading hands, compared to  201.05 million shares traded on Friday.  </P> <P> The few winners were primarily gold stocks.  </P> <P> * Newmont Gold rose 3 1/8 to 46 1/2.  </P> <P> * Homestake Mining climbed 1 1/4 to 21 5/8.  </P> <P> * And Placer Dome jumped 1 to close at 18 1/2.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, banks, transportation companies, aluminum firms and blue chip stocks  lodged steep losses.  </P> <P> * Chase Manhattan, which announced a costly corporate restructuring on Friday,  fell 1 5/8 to close at 11 1/8.  </P> <P> * First Chicago closed at 16 7/8, down 1 3/8.  </P> <P> * And Bankers Trust dropped 2 to finish the day at 32 1/4.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, UAL Corp. lost 8 1/2 to close at 92 1/4 as buyout plans for the  carrier appeared to grow more uncertain. Delta Air Lines, which forecast  "significantly worse" earnings for the current quarter, closed down 1 3/4 to 52  7/8.  </P> <P> Boeing was down 2 7/8 to 40 3/8, General Electric fell 1 3/8 to 54 1/2, Philip  Morris was off 7/8 to 43 7/8 and IBM slipped 1 3/4 to close at 105.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all listed common stocks dipped 3.52 to 167.51.  The American Stock Exchange market-value index slipped 3.17 to 312.84. And the  NASDAQ index of over-the-counter stocks fell 10.09 to 352.16. The Standard  &amp; Poor's 500-stock index was down 6.73, closing at 304.59.  </P> <P> Stocks also fell in foreign markets.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 35.2  points, or 1.7%. And Frankfurt, West Germany's, 30-share DAX index dropped  30.52 points to 1,416.05.  </P> <P> The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed Monday for a national holiday.  </P> <P> Futures based on the exchange's widely followed Nikkei 225 stock index will  make their U.S. debut today at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> The dollar-denominated contract will be based on the index of Japanese stocks  that many Western investors look at when they get up in the morning. Traders  will buy and sell futures in the index the same way they now do with other  commodities.  </P> <P> The exchange said it is seeking a "niche" in the increasingly global  marketplace for stocks.  </P> <P> </P> <P> STOCKS TAKE A DIVE  </P> <P> Friday close: 2,512.38  </P> <P> Monday close: 2,452.97, down 59.41  </P></p>

Mr. Hong, also vice chairman of the Jiu San society (one of  the eight democratic parties in China) and in charge of this  project, said that there were three methods for teaching farmers  agricultural technology. The first is to train a contingent of  laborers with technology through popularizing agricultural  science and technology among farmers. The second is to give 160  million farmers who now have middle school education a  qualifying certificate in the "Green Project" after its  implementation, enabling them to take a lead in agricultural  production, and the third is to develop a contingent of  agricultural management cadres and technicians for townships and  villages by giving them technical secondary education.    According to Mr. Hong, the "Green Project" was now being  implemented in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities with more than 300 trial counties and over  200,000 participants taking part while over 60,000 have already  been awarded the certificate of the "Green Project". By the  year 2000, farmers receiving this kind of education will number  8 million to 10 million, enabling every 20 farming households to  have one backbone farmer amongst them with the practical rate of  agricultural scientific and technological results raised to  between 60 percent to 70 percent, up from the present 30 percent  to 40 percent.    In addition to the implementation of this project, another  important measure for the reform of agriculture in the country  is to practice ecological agriculture. Agriculture in China is  now facing a number of problems such as increasing environmental  pollution, the worsening of water quality in coastal areas, the  deteriorating ecological environment, the shortage of resources,  the increasing of population and the increasing of the burden  placed on agriculture. Regarding this situation, seven  ministries and commissions under the State Council will,  together with relevant provinces, autonomous regions and  municipalities, engage in the construction of ecological  agriculture in 50 counties from this year to 1997, in order to  create ecological agriculture with Chinese characteristics in  the country.</p>

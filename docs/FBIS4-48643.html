			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 23 SAPA -- PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] MEC [member Executive Committee] for  safety and security Jessie Duarte on Monday said the police  service would take affirmative action on its racial make-up and  revamp its public image.    Addressing the PWV provincial legislature at Nasrec, near  Soweto, she said all senior officers were white males but this  would be rectified as soon as possible.    Improving the image of the police, which she said had been  the frontline of the National Party for the past 40 years, would  require suggestions from the public. It would never be said  again that policemen had searched a house without a warrant,  sworn at the public or failed to respond to complaints.    An advocate was investigating allegations police had  tortured  detainees in the Vaal Triangle.    Police stations would be equipped to deal with women who had  been sexually abused.</p>

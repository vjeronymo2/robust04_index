			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Strong paper sales help Portals advance 20% Continued strong papermaking sales helped Portals Group, the security and specialist papermaker, lift first half pre-tax profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 16.2m compared with Pounds 13.5m. The advance, which was ahead of market expectations, reflected a 13 per cent increase in paper sales together with a Pounds 568,000 swing from interest payments to receipts. Earnings per share in the six months to June 30 increased to 17.99p (15.04p) and the interim dividend is raised to 5.75p (5.25p). The shares closed 20p higher at 675p. Underlining the group's confidence in the future of specialist paper Mr John Lloyd, managing director, said a new Pounds 35m long fibre paper machine would be built at the JR Crompton facility. The decision comes only six months after the group announced plans for a Pounds 19m paper machine at its Portals Limited banknote paper plant. 'With the two new paper machines costing over Pounds 50m and coming on stream during 1996, we will have the substantial new capacity we need to meet demand in our two main businesses,' said Mr Lloyd. Operating profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 15.5m (Pounds 13.5m) on turnover ahead 10 per cent at Pounds 100.3m (Pounds 91.2m). Security and specialist papermaking led the advance with operating profits up 20 per cent at Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 9.86m) on sales of Pounds 58.2m (Pounds 51.6m). Demand remained strong and all the mills operated at close to capacity. Banknote paper sales were 18 per cent ahead of last year, which had a quiet start. The protection and control division, as expected, reported a more modest 1.4 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 3.67m (Pounds 3.62m) on sales up 6.3 per cent to Pounds 42.1m. Margins slipped to 8.7 per cent (9.1 per cent) partly reflecting the cost of investments in new products including an integrated healthcare software package. Pre-tax profits were also boosted by a Pounds 329,000 (Pounds 221,000) exceptional profit on the sale of surplus property. The group had net cash of Pounds 24.5m at the end of June, up Pounds 8.5m from year-end, despite capital expenditure of Pounds 4.1m.</p>

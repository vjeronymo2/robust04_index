			<p>BFN     [Text] Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has said that the  growing popular Palestinian resistance will wreck the Oslo and  Cairo agreements. He stressed that it is impossible to coexist  with the settlements and that there is no alternative to the  removal of the occupation. Nayif Hawatimah renewed his  criticism of the Palestinian leadership, which, he said, has  ceded all the Palestinian people's demands after the Hebron  massacre.    Meanwhile, the unified central leadership of the Popular  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] and the DFLP  demanded PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and his team resign. It  condemned the occupation authorities' decision to close the  occupied Palestinian territories, deeming it a collective  detention of the Palestinian people.</p>

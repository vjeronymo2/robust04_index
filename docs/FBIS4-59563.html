			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate has expressed appreciation for the U.S.  Senate's call for the lifting of the unjust arms embargo on the  people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In a cable in the name of the Senate to the president of the  U.S. Senate, Senate President Ahmad al-Lawzi expressed hope that  this step will be followed by other steps until the embargo is  lifted and this peace-loving nation can acquire the means for  legitimate self-defense and the liberation of their national  soil, against an all-out war of annihilation in which atrocities  are committed under the gaze of the civilized world.    Al-Lawzi stressed that if the United States plays its  leading  role in deterring aggression and preventing it from making any  regional gains, it will restore confidence in the world order  and international law and the UN Charter. This will spare the  world and future generations wars and disasters motivated by  racial and religious bias and the oppression of the weak by the  strong.</p>

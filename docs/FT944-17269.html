			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: A rare bird in the world of opera - Andrew Clark talks to Herbert Wernicke, a German producer who reads music and designs all his own productions Every work of art contains an enigma, and if there is no enigma, it is kitsch. These words trip off Herbert Wernicke's tongue as if they were the stuff of everyday conversation. Wernicke must be one of the most matter-of-fact personalities on the continental opera scene today - but when he gets to work, he is also one of the most imaginative. Few directors are better able to balance the world of ideas with the demands of practical theatre. Wernicke's production of Wagner's Ring opens at the Frankfurt Opera next Tuesday. First staged at Brussels in 1991, it was widely admired for its clarity, immediacy and magical effects. Using a single set and carefully-selected visual leitmotifs, it has the unity of style which characterises all Wernicke's work. With the same conductor, Sylvain Cambreling, and much the same cast, Frankfurt is lucky to have inherited it. Wernicke, 48, is a rare bird among German opera producers: he can read music and he designs all his own productions. The son of a painter and picture-restorer, he began his career as a stage designer in the early 1970s. After directing a handful of plays, he produced his first opera in 1978, and has never looked back. He spent much of the 1980s earning a reputation for contemporary settings of baroque and romantic operas. The Brussels Ring was his international breakthrough, opening the way for Boris Godunov at this year's Easter and summer festivals at Salzburg. He has also shown a lighter side in his uproarious operetta productions. Forthcoming projects include the world premiere of Theo Loevendie's new opera about the Dutch wartime resistance (at the 1995 Holland Festival), Der Rosenkavalier for Salzburg next summer, Schoenberg's Moses und Aron for the Chatelet in Paris and Les vepres siciliennes at the Vienna State Opera. He would love to direct in Britain, but has never been invited. With his narrow-rimmed spectacles, casual dress and dry humour, Wernicke is the liberal German intellectual par excellence - but where theatre is concerned, he is never less than practical. The walls of his atelier in Basle are plastered with architectural plans giving the exact stage measurements of theatres he will be working in, and his design-models have a draughtsman's precision. 'He's not the kind of director who chooses a concept and tries to make the opera fit', says a long-standing colleague. 'There are no counter-productive ideas. That stems from the fact that he began as a designer. He has a clear idea of how he wants each work to look - and that usually means simple and powerful.' His controversial Munich production of Der fliegende Hollander, for example, was set entirely within the walls of a bourgeois living room, like a nightmare in familiar surroundings. His Basle Cos fan tutte resembled a Club Mediterranean holiday island, where young love was superficial, blind and promiscuous. His Salzburg Boris, in modern dress, used a stark, abstract framework to make a bleak statement about the exercise of power. All Wernicke's work has a political viewpoint - or, in his own words, 'a socially critical message. You have to find new ways of interpreting old pieces, of making them believable and relevant to society today. That doesn't mean a singer should never stand still to sing an aria. Opera is a law unto itself - it exists in a different time. You have to have the courage to say: you, the singer, must sit and think about your situation. That is your reality. As long as you're saying something about people and not about stage conventions, it has its own legitimacy.' Stage conventions are Wernicke's bete noir. Social conventions, on the other hand, are the lifeblood of opera, giving Wernicke the key to works as diverse as Die Fledermaus, Der Rosenkavalier and Carmen. 'You have to show these conventions intelligently. I'm not a Brechtian - I don't believe in pointing the finger. But you must make clear why you're doing the piece. It's a permanent conflict: you want to leave room for entertainment, but at the same time you have to make people think.' So he has no intention of resorting to Spanish cliches when he stages Carmen in Basle next month. There will be no flamenco costumes, no matadors (except for Escamillo) - none of the fictional, folkloric Seville most people have been taught to expect by big-house productions. In Wernicke's eyes, Bizet's masterpiece is a tragic entertainment in the opera-comique tradition, with spoken dialogue and a reduced orchestra. Carmen, he says, is not a pouting sex-bomb, but 'an ideal which can never be reached in bourgeois society - the representation of absolute freedom. That's what fascinates Don Jose. She stands outside society, she is a threat to petit-bourgeois values. She has to be flushed out of the system, because she has something no-one else has. As in Don Giovanni, society learns nothing - it breathes a sigh of relief when the 'evil' non-conformist has been put away.' Wernicke's ideal interpreter is someone who has never sung the role - or at least has no preconceptions. 'I like singers to be curious. It doesn't matter if they are good or bad actors - as long as they are willing to join me on a voyage of discovery. I want to stretch them to their limits, so that they make it as believable as they can. I don't demand the impossible, but if a singer senses he or she can do something which was previously beyond their capabilities, I've achieved something. With some it comes very quickly, with others over a period of weeks, and with a few - never. A beautiful voice on its own is never enough for the theatre.'</p>

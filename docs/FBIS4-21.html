			<p>Europe      Economic Review:  WESTERN EUROPE Vol. III, No. 14, 07  April 1994      Notice To Readers:  FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a series published by  FBIS Europe/Latin America Group featuring brief summaries of foreign  media reports on topical issues, compiled from the most recent  sources available to FBIS.      Europe Economic Review (EER) is a subseries of FOREIGN MEDIA  SURVEY published by the West and East European Divisions of  Europe/Latin America Group with contributions from FBIS overseas  bureaus.  The EER is intended to supplement coverage of European  economic issues by the FBIS Daily Report for West and East Europe,  and other FBIS publications.  Foreign news, feature, and editorial  reports selected for summary in this publication normally do not  appear in other FBIS publications.      The EER is published in two editions, one for Western Europe  (also including media coverage of Canada and Turkey), and the other  for Eastern Europe.  Drawing primarily from domestic media sources  of these countries but also using other foreign media where  appropriate, the EER focuses on national and regional economic  issues, such as economic competitiveness, regional economic  integration, economic reforms and other changes in economic  policies, and foreign trade and investment.      FOREIGN MEDIA SURVEY is a U.S. Government publication.  Its  contents in no way represent the policies, views, or attitudes of  the U.S. Government.  All comment or analysis contained herein is  attributable to the cited media source, unless otherwise indicated.

The media lays the  blame for much of this unrest on the national education system and  entrenched French adherence to "fixed and outdated ideas" of social  fairness.      Economic journalist Delphine Gerard comments in the Paris  business daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on 30 March that following the  turmoil over the CIP (which some opponents dubbed a Youth SMIC), the  government again faces controversy over implementing provisions of  Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Five-Year Employment law.  A  government decree proposal currently being reviewed on changing the  rules for the 40-hour work week has been rejected by the labor  unions and may provoke more social unrest in the weeks to come.  This rejection, combined with the reservations of employers, is a  new "hard blow" for the government, Gerard maintains, and the  government may have to again do an "about face" as it did in the CIP  controversy.  In fact, Labor Minister Michel Giraud has already  indicated that he could not pass the law "by force."  According to  Gerard, labor unions and employers are reticent to support such an  ambitious" bill, which provides companies flexibility in managing  work schedules, for various reasons.  Workers Force (FO) indicated  that "it will fight against the law since it flies in the face of 50  years of the Labor Code."  The General Confederation of Labor (CGT)  denounced the bill for its "destruction and aggravation" of working  and living conditions.      The proposed decree states that companies which work in  "successive teams" will be exempt from current work week rules.  The  exemption will allow service industries such as banking, retail, and  insurance to maintain flexibility in managing work hours.  The law  would allow these companies to remain open six days a week and at  night.  Moreover, the decree stipulates a number of individual  guarantees:      * A minimal daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours.      * A weekly rest period of 35 consecutive hours.      * Maintenance of two consecutive days off, one of which would be  Sunday, in industries where this already exists.      * A 48-hour rest period per week for all workers, replacing the  initial formula of two nonconsecutive days off.      According to the decree, the new guarantees will partially enact  into domestic law the Community directive of 23 November 1993 on the  management of work time.      Editor-in-chief Philippe Labarde, writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES  on 23 March, blames the strong reactions against the CIP on problems  in the national education system, the government's failure to  address them, and French society's refusing to give up its ideas of  social fairness.  The CIP, Labarde states, was simply the "final  straw" which highlighted the unemployment problem French youth face  today.  While it has been largely accepted that unskilled youth must  submit to free market labor laws, it has suddenly become evident to  those with diplomas--those who have completed the national education  courses--that their "good conduct" has led them to an impasse.  Labarde describes this as a rude awakening for this group which  points out the inequities of the national education system.  While  the goals of this system come from laudable sentiments??raising the                                                       ??  level of education in France--the system itself failed to verify  whether there were jobs available which corresponded to the  education received.      For not having done this elementary analysis, France now finds  itself in crisis and its youth suffering and saying so.  Labarde  argues it is useless to point fingers at the guilty, since the guilt  is collective.  In any event, for France to get out of this  profound" economic crisis will be difficult, Labarde concludes.  He  warns that for anyone to use the crisis politically would be  demagoguery or to use it economically in the name of "who knows what  free-market philosophy" would be dangerous.      Labarde continues discussing the crisis over youth unemployment  in the 24 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, claiming that French society  is grid-locked over the issue.  He notes that conservative Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur and Socialist former Prime Minister Michel  Rocard have both said so.  The two also agree with Labarde that the  guilt is collective.  The French, besides believing themselves more  intelligent than others, have a "deranged egoism" which leads them,  in the worst of cases, to always demand more, and in the best of  cases to ferociously defend what they have acquired, whether it is  social or other benefits.  Labarde characterizes the French as "sad  people who merit being condemned for being piggish over their  archaic SMIC (minimum wage), their luxurious lodgings, their  scandalous paid vacations, not to mention their decidedly too  generous social welfare benefits."  He adds that what is worse is  that the moral and economic lessons which "the French do not know  how to discuss" do not change their behavior.  They hunker down on  what they have, even more so in periods of crisis.      Despite this "detestable gridlock," Labarde points out that the  French are an "elite" which the world envies.  The nation may not be  hunkering down over social benefits but over the fixed and out-dated  ideas of social fairness behind them.  It is these same ideas which  have formed policies that had hitherto been successful.  Labarde  concludes that it would be hard to imagine how to explain that the  policies which brought success are now bringing about the opposite.

On the  other hand, 68 percent believe that Europe can maintain its  competitiveness.  Those who are pessimistic on competitiveness say  the greatest challenge comes from the emerging economies such as  Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with their surplus underpaid  workforce and dynamic growth.  The United States and Japan are not  perceived as a threat to European competitiveness.  The poll was  conducted in January-February 1994 among British, French, German,  Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Belgian businessmen and managers.

The private  sector was "hardly capable" of creating new jobs in most of the  countries during the same period.  Although employment increased by  a good 10 million workers, or 8 percent, during the years covered by  the report, nearly 97 percent of that increase was accounted for by  public-sector employment.  Germany, for example, created 2.5 million  jobs but two-thirds of these were in the public sector.  In France,  Belgium, Italy, and especially Spain, the number of public-sector  jobs actually increased more than net overall employment.  These  figures present a sharp contrast to employment developments during  the same period in the United States and Japan, where proportionally  more new jobs were created, most of which were in the private  sector.  The ERT report cautions that "many of these not very  productive jobs in the (EU's) public sector could be lost again in  the medium term under the pressure of empty coffers and high public  debts."  (JS)  (Berlin DIE WELT in German 19 Mar 94 p 16)      FRANCE      REACTION TO U.S. UNFAIR TRADE LIST--According to Georges  Potriquet, writing in the economic section of LE FIGARO, France is  unlikely to refute its inclusion in the list published by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor naming those countries which do not  have open markets.  While Potriquet notes that the importance of the  list should not be ignored, he points out that since France is  currently a partner with the United States in trying to include a  social clause in the final version of the GATT agreement, the  government will most likely allow any counter charges to be handled  at the EU Community level.  Potriquet reports that the EU has  already announced that by the end of the month it will publish "a  report on trade barriers erected by the United States against EU  products." (DiI)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French  2, 3 Apr 94 p I)      EDITORIAL ON BENTSEN, CHANGE IN INTERNATIONAL GOALS--Washington  correspondent Jacqueline Grapin, writing in LE FIGARO, points to  recent speeches by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen as proof  that the United States no longer uses its presence in international  financial organizations as a "means of philanthropy, hiding its  entrepreneurial spirit behind humanitarian rhetoric," but now openly  uses its membership in them to increase its economic influence in  the world.  Members of Congress demand that the administration be  accountable to the electorate, Grapin notes,  and in their view the  future unit of account will be the creation of employment in the  United States.  To respond to this pressure, the U.S. administration  has taken numerous steps to make the most of its large influence in  international financial organizations, such as at the World Bank  where the United States has increased the size of its commercial  section in the office of the Bank's U.S. administrator.  Grapin  notes that it is well known that U.S. companies often are told of  new bids for large projects linked to World Bank programs before the  projects are even reviewed by the Bank's administrative council.  Evidently, Grapin writes, the new goals of the current U.S.  administration are to act for the good of "America Inc." and should  make Europeans "stop and think" and should prod them into  "mobilizing."      Grapin argues that final proof of such a change in U.S. goals can  be found in recent speeches by Bentsen and she quotes these speeches  extensively.  In particular, while she points out that Bentsen is  not responsible for U.S. diplomacy but for defending the financial  interests of the United States, she contends that Bentsen "spoke the  truth" when he requested funds from Congress for multilateral  financial institutions.  Grapin cites Bentsen as saying before the  foreign affairs section of the House budget committee that the  "clear lesson" for the United States is that the money the United  States sends abroad through international financial organizations  comes back to the United States in multiples through exports and new  jobs for Americans.  Furthermore, Grapin quoted Bentsen as stating  that U.S. goals for multilateral banks in 1994 were to increase U.S.  exports, reduce U.S. budgetary costs, and to reinforce U.S.  interests in strategic regions.  Grapin adds that in Honolulu before  the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference, Bentsen  gave further warning to Europeans when he said, "Our most important  trading partners are those in the Pacific region."

The Swedish response was reportedly "cold"  and "gloomy."  The Swedish daily, generally well informed according  to LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, said that the letter pointed out the  industrial advantages of a Mica order, which would allow Matra to  collaborate with two Swedish companies--Saab Missiles and Ericsson  Radar Electronics--to supply the Mica electronic guidance systems.  However, some unnamed Swedish military sources stated that the U.S.  and British Aerospace missiles, competitors for the order, have the  advantage of being "tested" in the Persian Gulf War. (DiI)  (Paris  LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 28 Mar 94 p 10)      SOCIALIST PARTY DETAILS ECONOMIC PLATFORM--The national council  of the Socialist Party (PS) met on 30 March and from that meeting  came details of its economic platform for the European Parliament  elections this summer.  The following are the planks of the  platform:      * Make unemployment a priority.  The PS wants a large EU loan of  1,300 billion francs (Fr) over five years to finance large public  works projects and neighborhood renovations.      * Establish job stimulation policies in industries protected from  competition.  EU member states should collectively reduce work weeks  to avoid competition.      * Review taxes in terms of their effects on employment.  The PS  contends that taxes "should burden capital and not only labor."  The  PS wants minimum tax rates on company and real estate revenues to  avoid the tax competition practiced in the EU.  The PS would like  the principle of Community preference to be maintained for countries  or zones which practice national preference.  The party also wants  aide to EU industry to be encouraged.      * Additionally, the PS wants a large public service sector,  guaranteed norms on minimum wages and maximum work hours, and the  creation of a statute on European rights assuring real participation  of wage earners in decisionmaking.

Three have already departed for Sarajevo: an  engineer from the construction company Spie Batignolles, an official  from the National Railroad Company (SNCF), and another from the  General Directorate of Civilian Aviation.  Additionally, the French  ambassador to Sarajevo is asking for a French economic expansion  office to be quickly established in that city.  These actions are in  response to French fears that they will be at a disadvantage in  relation to Britain and the United States--seen as poised to win  again the lion's share of postwar reconstruction contracts as they  did in the Persian  Gulf War--when it comes time to rebuild  Saraj evo.      Noting the importance of Sarajevo as a starting point for  developing the rest of the country, Calle contends that while the  French were the main UN force in Sarajevo and "have paid with their  blood," it is the "Anglo-Saxons who are the more pragmatic."  The  United States--not content with distributing humanitarian aid--has  sent gas, water, and electricity specialists to the area.  The  French view these specialists as clearing a path for U.S. companies  in the postwar reconstruction.  Despite reassurances from Rob Rowe,  director of projects for the International Rescue Committee, that  "everyone will have their chance" to bid on contracts, the French  believe there is worse Anglo-Saxon influence to come, according to  Calle.  On 4 March, the Security Council of the United Nations  passed a resolution to send a joint committee, made up of U.S. and  British experts, to Sarajevo.  The committee is to evaluate the  financial needs for the reconstruction of that city.  Calle point  out that seeing this joint committee leave for Sarajevo "made French  blood curdle."  However, nobody could explain why France had voted  for the resolution without thinking of calling on its own experts.  "The Americans and the English are evaluating the needs and when  money comes, they will be well placed" to pursue contracts, stated  an unnamed French source in Sarajevo.  Calle adds that although the  French Government is trying to improve France's position in postwar  civilian management, French experience in this field comes from  Algeria and Vietnam and is tarnished by overtones of colonialism.  (DiI)  (Paris LES ECHOS in French 24 Mar 94 p 6)      COFACE TO GO PRIVATE--Jean-Pierre Robin, writing in the economic  supplement of LE FIGARO, reports that the government-owned export  credit insurer Coface will automatically become privatized when the  majority of its stockholders are sold to the private sector.  This  "derivative" type of privatization will take place when the large  government-owned insurance company UAP, which owns 20 percent of  Coface, is sold in May.  Besides UAP, Coface has some of France's  largest companies as shareholders, including the French Foreign  Trade Bank (BFCE) which owns 20 percent and the Societe Generale,  Credit Lyonnais, and BNP banks.  The Council of State, consulted to  see if the 1993 privatization law applied to Coface, has responded  favorably.  However, Robin claims that despite the privatization of  Coface, the company will still have problems because of its  relationship to the government.      Coface President Yves Cosse details three possible problems which  may plague the company.  First, because of its function as guarantor  for government-backed foreign credit, there will always have to be  "transparency" between the government and the company, which will  justify government oversight.  Secondly, government officials will  always be concerned about changes in Co face ownership and may want  to keep a "golden share" of the company to retain some influence.  Finally, the directors of Coface will have the double obligation to  gain the confidence of the shareholders and of the Economy Ministry.  (DiI)  (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 31 Mar 94 p  IV)      BUSINESS CONFIDENT IN RECOVERY--According to a report published  by the National Institute of Economic Statistics (INSEE) on 29  March, business leaders in most industries are "resolutely  optimistic" about the prospects of increased industrial activity.  Queried at the beginning of March, these business leaders' positive  responses were sharply in the majority when asked how they viewed  industrial activity in the months to come.  As for their own  prospects, on which businessmen are traditionally cautious, they too  were more positive.  For the first time in months there was a five-  point positive response compared with the four-point negative  response during the two preceding months.  In times of economic  prosperity there is usually a 20-point positive response.      However, other than the automobile industry, the only industries  right now that are benefitting from a real recovery are intermediate  goods such as steel, chemicals, and plastics.  Other industries are  still having a hard time improving their businesses, especially the  equipment manufacturing industry, which Jean-Louis de Fommervault of  the Mechanical Engineering Industry Federation sees as in a state of  stabilization with investment near zero and production delays of at  least six months per machine.  Fommervault predicts that a recovery  for this industry is "not guaranteed for 1994."

GERMANY      G-7 JOBS SUMMIT VIEWED AS INEFFECTIVE--A commentary by Erwin  Single in the Berlin TAGESZEITUNG criticizes the March G-7 Jobs  Summit in Detroit as unproductive.  According to Single, the  measures discussed at the summit--lower wages, technology promotion,  lower interest rates, social welfare cutbacks, training,  flexibility, and deregulation--are ridiculed by labor market  experts.  Single refutes the U.S. claim to have created five times  more jobs than the Europeans over the last two decades, arguing that  many of these jobs involve unstable, low-paying, part-time work.  He  asserts that the only result of the summit was the confirmation that  "in the future, there will be no common strategy by the industrial  nations against mass unemployment."

Russia wants  to be excused from the required 15-percent down payment and wants to  receive the first three years of credit interest-free.  However,  these same terms applied to business with CIS countries prior to 1  January 1994 and consequently Hermes deficits on business with the  CIS grew to DM4.5 billion.  Berlin-based Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA),  the potential railcar manufacturer, stands to lose some 50 percent  of its sales volume if the contract falls through.  There would also  be severe ramifications for the company's suppliers in Saxony-  Anhalt, which employ some 8,000 workers.  DWA managers, along with  land and regional politicians, are attempting to persuade the  Federal Government to grant the requested exemption.

The Belarus Government has blocked access to foreign currency  accounts--possibly even for firms with partial foreign ownership-  -and has banned foreign ownership of land.  It has also launched a  hotel and convention center project which would compete with a  proposed German-backed trade center in Minsk.  According to the  German delegation, the shaky financial status of Belarus's companies  has further impeded trade, necessitating DM30O million in Hermes  export credit insurance in 1994, in addition to barter arrangements.  Belarus's political instability, its lack of natural resources, and  the nuclear contamination of its agricultural products were cited as  additional disincentives to investment.  On the other hand, the high  skill level of the Belarus workforce has preserved modern optical,  precision measuring, and laser industries while German entrepreneurs  have reported successes in retail trade and the machine tool  industry.

Skoda, with annual sales of DM8O0  million, is among the Czech Republic's largest companies, and is the  first Czech firm to establish activity in eastern Germany.  Upon  Czech Government approval of the purchase, project financing will be  provided by a bank consortium, by investment money, and credit  guarantees from the Thuringian Land government, and through a 5-  percent holding by the newly formed Thuringian Industrial  Participation Company.  Negotiations are under way to bring in  additional investors from the CIS, North America, and the Far East.

The combine's 61 production sites, which  produce harbor cranes, elevators, factory assembly lines, open-cast  mining equipment, and general machinery, presented the Trust Agency  with one of its most difficult privatization problems.  Agency Vice  President Hero Brahms asserts that Takraf "is also a model case of  how a number of competitive, mid-sized units have been created from  the break-up and restructuring of a former GDR combine."  Of the 33  firms belonging to the combine, only three are left without new  owners, and only three had to be shut down.  New owners have  guaranteed investment of about DM256 million, supplementing the  roughly DM100 million raised by the Trust Agency.  In contrast to  other combines, Takraf was essentially solvent and was able to meet  preexisting obligations.

In the talks  between Greek Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis and the Cypriot  leadership it was decided that Greek defense industry experience and  know-how will be fully taken advantage of.  A large number of heavy-  load trucks are being ordered from the Greek Vehicle Industry  (ELVO), which is also interested in selling Cyprus more of its  acclaimed Leonidhas tanks.  Since the new defense agreement  emphasizes air defenses, Greek companies may be able to sell medium-  range missiles in Cyprus as well as being able to convert some  stationary units to mobile units.  They also envision jointly  developing in Greece and in Cyprus the integrated Artemis-30 weapons  system.  Finally, the agreement may allow the Greek Weapons Industry  (EVO) to sell portable weapons there.  The joint defense agreement  forecasts expenditures of 170 million Cypriot liras in the next two  to three years in addition to the 227 million liras in regular 1994  budget defense allocations.

Some 44.9 percent of the companies surveyed do not plan to make any  investments while 32 percent will, 19.8 percent did not know, and  3.3 percent did not answer.  Reduced investments and rates of return  that generally do not exceed the inflation rate will affect  employment.  Of the 250 firms surveyed, only 15 percent expected to  hire more workers, while 64.6 percent said they would maintain the  present number of workers, 13.3 percent envisioned a reduction of  their work force, 3.8 percent did not know, and 3.3 percent did not  answer.

Barucci particularly called for the German Bundesbank to continue to  do so, saying that its monetary policy, which is crucial for Europe,  has up to now been conducted in a flexible way.  Barucci said that  the Bundesbank should not be too concerned about the effects of  lower rates on inflation and exchange rates, especially since  inflation seems to be under control, and added that a limited  devaluation of European currencies should not cause much of a  problem.  He also said that Italy strongly opposes "protectionist  trends," pointing out that they would not solve structural  unemployment in Europe and would instead provoke trade retaliation.  (AB)  (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 15 Mar 94 p 19)      NEW JAPANESE AUTO IMPORT QUOTA CRITICIZED--An article in LA  STAMPA characterizes the Italians as particularly critical of the  new Japanese automobile import quota established during the last  round of negotiations between the EU Commission and the Japanese  Foreign Trade Ministry.  The article notes that Italy will have to  increase its share of Japanese auto imports by 21 percent in 1994-  -from 38,000 to 47,000 automobiles.  Although the total increase for  the whole EU is only 0.4 percent--from 980,000 to 984,000--countries  with lower quotas for automobile imports such as Italy, Spain,  France, and Portugal will have to absorb larger percentages of  overall imports to bring them closer to the 10-percent average for  the EU.  An unnamed EU Commission spokesman explained that Italy's  quota of Japanese imports is currently fixed at a low 4.5 percent,  therefore it must absorb the largest increase.  The article adds  that in February Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta wrote to the  EU Commission asking that Italy's quota remain the same and he is  still waiting for a final decision.

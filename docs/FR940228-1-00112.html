			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that specifies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an institution must establish and maintain, on a current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis, financial and other institutional records necessary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the institutional eligibility, financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility, and administrative capability of the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes it is essential for the Department to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> access to this information when evaluating an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the requirements of the provisions governing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability of the institution. Further, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution needs to maintain this information because, under its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program participation agreement, the institution must agree to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make the information available to appropriate authorities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified there (see the discussion on proposed &sect;668.14).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that all records required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the applicable Title IV, HEA program regulations be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained by the institution for at least five years from the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the record is established unless specific program regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that a record be kept for a period of time longer than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five years. Five years is the standard period of time that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are required to keep most records under the Title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV, HEA programs. The Secretary believes that this is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable period of time to require institutions to maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most records so that the Department is able to evaluate the past  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance of an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.26&blank;End of an Institution's Participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to clarify the purpose of the section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently titled ``Loss of institutional eligibility to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the Title IV, HEA programs'' by changing the title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ``End of an institution's participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs.'' The Secretary proposes to specify the date on which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution's participation ends under a variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances to reflect statutory changes and to make clear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing practice. The Secretary has clarified in these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations the end of participation date currently used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department to be the date that: The institution closes or stops  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing educational programs (the Secretary proposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with provisions proposed to be included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations governing institutional eligibility under the HEA, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that this closure must be for a reason other than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> normal vacation period or a natural disaster that directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affects the institution or the institution's students); the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution loses its institutional eligibility under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 34 CFR part 600; the institution's participation is terminated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the proceedings in subpart G of this part; or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's program participation agreement is terminated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

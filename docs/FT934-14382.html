			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Property: Life amid the vineyards CHATEAU Laborie, at Laborie in the Tarn, is five minutes from Gaillac and 35 minutes from Toulouse international airport. It looks out over a courtyard in which two rows of buildings are being converted into mews-type homes on either side of a rectangle. The chateau was the home of the Gaillac region's principal wine grower when it was built in the 1800s. Eventually, the estate was divided into smaller vineyards, while the chateau and courtyard were bought by a French army captain. He renovated the chateau and this, along with the courtyard buildings, were acquired about three years ago by a businessman who formed Trojan Toulouse, the present development company. All its directors are British and they include Andrew Pugh, a building engineer with a background of restoration work. One of his projects in Surrey has been nominated for a conservation award. His bilingual wife, Michelle, is a former personal assistant to Cartier's managing director in London. There will be 14 homes in the courtyard, ranging from a one-bedroom apartment to three-bedroom houses. Most are being converted from old buildings such as the wine press, cart shed, hay barn and stables. But five are newly-built and, for these, the French architect has devised first-floor terraces cut into the houses, rather like rooms without a roof. They are priced from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 95,000 and seven have been sold, all to British buyers. The four-bedroom chateau is also available, at Pounds 125,000. There is to be a boules area in the courtyard between the properties, and a large swimming pool has been built behind the chateau amid fig, almond, cherry, plum and apple trees. There will also be a tennis court and car parking there. The development, to be finished by March, is surrounded by vineyards. Further information from Andrew Pugh at Laborie (tel. 63 57 21 62).

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pe'erli Shahar] </F>   [Text] The prime minister's bureau yesterday denied that  members of the Fatah Hawks had been recruited by the Palestinian  police. The announcement came in reaction to a complaint  submitted by the "View Toward Peace" [Mabat Leshalom]  organization.    The bureau's announcement came in the wake of an  investigation conducted by Brigadier General Yom-Tov Sami', head  of the Israeli team at the joint security committee.    The communique stated that the Palestinians had said that  the  candidacies of all applicants to join the Palestinian police  were brought before the committee.    The Palestinians also asserted that the Fatah Hawks had not  been recruited but had only been concentrated in one location  pending a decision on their future.

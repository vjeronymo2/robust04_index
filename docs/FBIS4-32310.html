			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 22 Jun (TANJUG) -- Members of the Serbian army  of Krajina returned to positions in the area of the village of  Kakma near Benkovac, along the Croatian-Krajina separation line,  an area that has been designated by the Zagreb agreement as  being within the zone of separation.    This was also confirmed by Lieutenant Colonel Marinko Gajic,  deputy commander of the Serbian army of Krajina, who explained  the move as a measure of precaution against increased Croatian  threats to the effect that they would forcibly capture the water  springs in this village.    The source supplying Benkovac with water has been controlled  by the Serbian army of Krajina until recently, but became part  of the so-called zone of separation in accordance with the  Zagreb agreement. This area is now under the jurisdiction of  the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] Canadian battalion.    Allan Roberts, spokesman for Sector South, told TANJUG's  correspondent that the situation is being assessed "very  carefully," and that consultations are being conducted at the  moment, "so nothing specific can be said."</p>

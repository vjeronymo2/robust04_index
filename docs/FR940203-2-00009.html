			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. We received a written comment from the respondents, the Government of Israel (GOI) and NPL, and a written rebuttal comment from the petitioners, the Monsanto Company and FMC Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondents argue that the cash deposit rate should be reduced by the amount of benefit attributable to the Exchange Rate Risk Insurance Scheme (EIS) because the program was terminated prior to the publication of these final results. The GOI and NPL state that most EIS claims will be paid by the end of 1993 as indicated in the GOI response to the Department's questionnaire. The GOI and NPL also point to the reduction in benefits that exporters received from this program in this review period compared to those received in the prior administrative review. Thus, respondents claim that it is unreasonable to base the deposit rate for future entries on benefits received in 1991, given the program's declining benefits and termination with limited residual benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners point out that the exact timing of NPL's receipt of benefits under the EIS will depend on variables such as the time necessary for shipment of the goods and EIS processing of the claim. According to petitioners, these uncertainties preclude the determination of a fixed date for actual termination of benefits to be received by NPL. As a result, EIS benefits should continue to be reflected in the cash deposit rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Department's Position:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We disagree with the respondents. The Department's regulations require the Department to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties on future entries. The Department normally uses as an estimate of countervailing duties on future entries the assessment rate found in the final results of review (see 19 CFR 355.22(c)(10)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the EIS program was terminated, it is clear that some payments may continue to be received beyond the date of EIS termination by exporters who entered into EIS contracts before termination of the program. In situations in which a government terminates a program but residual benefits may continue to be bestowed under the terminated program, it is the Department's practice not to adjust the deposit rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Cotton Yarn from Brazil; Preliminary Results of Administrative Review  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (56 FR 47456, 47457; September 19, 1991) and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cotton Yarn from Brazil; Final Results of Administrative Review  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (57 FR 1454; January 14, 1992). In order to adjust the cash deposit rate as a result of a program-wide change, the Secretary must be able to measure the change in the level of countervailable subsidies provided under the program in question ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section 355.50(a)(2) and (d)(1) of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Countervailing Duties; Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Request for Public Comments  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (54 FR 23366; May 31, 1989). Therefore, because residual benefits from the EIS program may continue to be provided after the date of our preliminary results and cannot be measured, we have not adjusted the cash deposit rate as a result of the termination of the EIS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Final Results of Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After reviewing all of the comments received, we determine the net subsidy to be 6.98 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for all companies during the period January 1, 1991 through December 31, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing duties of 6.98 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandise exported on or after January 1, 1991 and on or before December 31, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Department will instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of 6.98 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This cash deposit shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 355.22.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

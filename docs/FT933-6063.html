			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Observer: Saint Deng Which world leader watched 50 of the 52 matches televised in the 1990 soccer World Cup, is an avid bridge player and saw his son paralysed by being thrown out of a window by his own guards? Despite his public disapproval of the cult of personality, Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, has allowed the Chinese taboo against publishing an account of the life of someone still alive to be infringed with the publication of his biography. Written by his daughter, Deng Rong, it is now being serialised in mass-circulation Chinese newspapers. But Rong's rose-coloured prose allows for no hint of scandal in her beloved father's life. She provides some details of his student days in France - where he developed decidedly bourgeois tastes for wine, cheese, coffee, bridge and his life-long interest in soccer - and in Moscow. Deng had three wives; the first died in childbirth in 1930, the second left him after a political disagreement in 1933, and the third, whom he married in 1939, produced five children. Rong is the youngest. Having just turned 89, his 'meeting with Karl Marx' cannot be far off; the tone of the book suggests that Deng is moving from the realm of earthly being towards communist sainthood.</p>

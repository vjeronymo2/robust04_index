			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal allows all items listed in C200.1.4 as permissible second-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enclosures to be treated as neither advertising nor nonadvertising, but instead to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be accounted for in the weight of the host publication when determining postage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is a change in the interpretation of current rules that distinguish between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subscription order or requester form and any additional material that promotes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publisher's publications. Allowing these permissible enclosures to be accounted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only in the weight of the host publication will simplify the acceptance review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process without any significant effect on postal revenues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed supplements section in C200.1.5 would change the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning loose supplements to bound publications to eliminate the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that such a supplement contain at least 25 percent nonadvertising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content. If adopted, this change would allow publishers to include loose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements with bound publications that could consist of up to 100 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising. This change is being proposed in response to widespread requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from publishers for an elimination of this provision. These publishers argue that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision is an unnecessary restriction on their ability to choose whether to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place advertising matter in the host publication or in an accompanying loose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement. They argue that competitors of the Postal Service impose no such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions on the nonpostal delivery of publications. They also argue that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses by some publishers to the 25 percent nonadvertising requirement (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of such devices as public service announcements that say such things as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Just Say No To Drugs'') demonstrate the uselessness of the provision as a means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increase the ``editorial'' content of second-class publications. These publishers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argue that the overall requirement that second-class publications contain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial amount of nonadvertising content and the need to provide substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> editorial content to satisfy their subscribers are sufficient safeguards of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity and value of second-class mail. These publishers also correctly state that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all advertising in supplements will be accounted and paid for at the advertising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates because the determination of a publication's advertising/nonadvertising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content is based on the host piece and any supplements. The Postal Service finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these arguments have merit and has determined to propose the elimination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 25 percent nonadvertising content requirement for comment by all interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed supplements section also includes clarifying provisions, based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current standards and on Postal Service rulings, restricting the inclusion of loose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sheets of advertising as a supplement. These provisions describe the permissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of supplements for the four different methods of second-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mailpiece preparation_a bound publication not enclosed in a wrapper, a bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication enclosed in a wrapper, and an unbound publication not enclosed in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrapper, an unbound publication enclosed in a wrapper. Bound and unbound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publications are defined in C200.3.1. The standards proscribing the use of mailing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wrappers are set forth in C200.3.3 and 3.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A bound publication that is not enclosed in a wrapper may not have any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements included loose with it. Only enclosures under C200.1.4 may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included loose in a bound publication. A bound publication with one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements must be enclosed in a wrapper. If a supplement to a bound  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication is made up of more than one printed sheet, all sheets making up the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement must be bound together to form one piece. If not, each loose sheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must separately qualify as a supplement. A supplement to an unbound publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is not enclosed in a wrapper must be combined with, and inserted within, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication. A loose supplement may be included with an unbound publication only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the entire mailpiece is enclosed in a wrapper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed supplements section will retain the requirement that loose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements to bound publications contain the identification ``Supplement to''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed by the name of the publication or the publisher. This requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify a supplement will also apply to any loose supplement mailed with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unbound publication enclosed in a wrapper. The presence of the ``Supplement to''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement is an objective demonstration that the publisher designed the material to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included as a supplement to the host publication. The Postal Service believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the retention of this identification requirement, the retention of the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in C200.4.3 that all advertisements in bound publications must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permanently attached, and the clarification in C200.1.5 that any multisheet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplement to a bound publication must also be bound together will effectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit the inclusion of miscellaneous loose advertising pieces with second-class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publications enclosed in wrappers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The section on attachments (proposed C200.1.8) consolidates the wording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in current 4.3 pertaining to the addition of stickers on covers of second-class publications or on mailing wrappers. Additionally, proposed 1.8 includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information currently contained in 10.1 and 10.4, regarding the required markings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for nonincidental First- and/or third-class enclosures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except for its movement from A200.2.0 to C200.1.10, the provision allowing label  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carriers remains unaltered. Placement in C200 is more appropriate for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards because they will be with the sections governing what may be combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loose in a polybag or plastic wrapper and mailed at the second-class rates (a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mailing practice that commonly uses a label carrier).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

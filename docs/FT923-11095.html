			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (7): They 'need a place in the sun' - The Maoris' Grievances IN A bid to settle grievances that have strained relations with the Maori people since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi with the UK in 1840, the New Zealand government is painstakingly working through hundreds of land claims. The aim is to achieve a 'full and final settlement' by the turn of the century to try to bring about greater harmony. The land issue is the most graphic sign of problems between Maori and other races in New Zealand. But there are other difficulties, such as Maori bitterness at the enormous influx of Polynesians from neighbouring Pacific territories. There are now 20,000 more people from Polynesia living in Auckland than Maoris; Polynesians will also soon outnumber Maoris in Wellington. Largely unskilled, they tend to compete with Maoris for jobs and live in similar state housing areas. Apparently due to peer pressure, Maori children tend to leave school at the earliest opportunity, a point being addressed by the government which raised the leaving age for all races to 16 in the July budget. Maoris form a dispropor- tionate percentage of people in jail: a figure possibly related to their higher than average level of unemployment. Efforts are being made through work schemes to tackle their lack of skills. Their leaders retain confidence that some of the Maoris' economic problems will be settled through the hearing of claims over the Waitangi Treaty. This has already seen the Maoris receive a substantial share of offshore fishing resources, as a direct result of the previous Labour government backdating all claims to 1840. The land issues have been more contentious, especially a controversial claim by the Ngai Tahu tribe for most of South Island. As privately-owned land is outside any claim, in effect this is a claim for all government land, most of which was transferred to state-owned enterprises. The Ngai Tahu people have to date received around NZDollars 35m from their claim through a land bank procedure. It is hoped this could lead to a settlement of all their claims within a year, possibly netting them NZDollars 350m. In such cases the Maoris tend to invest the money, often with the target of creating work for their people. In the North Island protracted delays in reaching settlements have led to isolated incidents such as the burning of a farmer's home recently after he sought higher compensation than the government was prepared to pay over a disputed parcel of land. Mr Doug Graham, minister of justice, hopes the claims will have the effect not only of improving race relations but also of letting Maoris 'out of the dependency mode where they've been for much too long. They need to take their place in the sun like everyone else.' He says durable solutions are being achieved when both sides think a deal is fair. 'In the past the Maoris never had that opportunity. They were just told: This is how much you're going to get, and you're damn lucky to get it. 'What the Maori people want is something that gives them a leg up to where they were before the expropriation took place,' he says.</p>

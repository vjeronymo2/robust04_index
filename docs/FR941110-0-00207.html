			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters urged HCFA to delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for the State to indemnify HCFA for FFP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment until day 90 if a facility is not in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements. Some commenters believed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule eliminates any incentive for State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to recommend alternative remedies by imposing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement to indemnify HCFA for FFP from day one. Others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wanted to modify the regulations so that States would not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to guarantee repayment until day 90. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed that such a policy would be consistent with the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would ensure that facilities have the opportunity to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make corrections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1819(h)(2)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act specify that the Secretary may continue payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over a period of not longer than 6 months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the findings. To read ``the effective date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the findings'' to mean the 90th day would extend the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction period from up to six months and up to nine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months. Moreover, it would greatly distort the intent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear meaning of the phrase ``effective date of the findings''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to designate the 90th day after the findings were first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited as the effective date. Therefore, the period covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the sections 1819(h)(3)(C) and 1919(h)(3)(D) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a maximum of six months, starting with the last day of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey. Sections 1819(h)(3)(C)(iii) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(h)(3)(D)(iii) of the Act provides that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (for Medicare) and the State (for Medicaid) agree to repay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Federal government payments received under these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparagraphs if the corrective action is not taken in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the approved plan and time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, if the facility or the State must agree to repay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money received for the period covered by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(3)(C) or 1919(h)(3)(D), they must agree to repay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money received since the last day of the survey. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the State or a facility enters into a repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement and the facility does not take action in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with its approved plan and timetable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective action or does not achieve substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, the State or facility would be held financially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accountable for the period covered by the repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also disagree with the commenter's assertion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the repayment period should not start until the 90th day in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to give facilities more time to correct deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility is notified of its deficiencies during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey, at the exit conference and then formally through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Statement of Deficiencies shortly after the completion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey. We believe that the beginning of the repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period is irrelevant to the correction period. The facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has up to 6 months to take corrective action in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with its approved plan and timetable for corrective action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or achieve substantial compliance, or both. If the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not meet that goal, the State or the facility will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to pay back the Federal funding for the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the repayment agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters recommended that we delete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesignated &sect;488.450(a)(1)(iii). Their comments included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;It is unrealistic that a State will agree to repay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal government payments received if corrective action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not taken in accordance with a facility's plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correction;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The language does not fit within the concept of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement as envisioned in the Act;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;This provision is a heavy disincentive to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediate remedies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A State should not be monetarily penalized for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's failure to comply with regulations when an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedy is chosen over termination;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To put the State at risk for something that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ultimately out of the State's control does not make for good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public policy; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

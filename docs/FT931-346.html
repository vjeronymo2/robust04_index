			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comex open to any rescue bid approach THE SEARCH by the New York Commodity Exchange (Comex) for a white knight to help shore up its flagging business has taken a new turn. It is now ready to entertain all offers in what appears to be a tactic aimed at forcing the Chicago Board of Trade to sweeten its takeover bid. Executives of the CBOT, the world's largest futures exchange, and the Comex, the largest US metals market, surprised everyone, including most of their members, when they announced merger plans in January. Since then, negotiations have taken a sour turn with some Comex members seeking to oust Ms Donna Redel, their chairman, the plan's main proponent. Comex negotiators are frustrated by the CBOT's staunch refusal to allow Comex members access to the CBOT's popular grain and financial contracts. The CBOT has proposed buying out the metals exchange with the future stream of Comex profits - an essentially riskless transaction - and keeping the two exchanges' product lines and memberships distinct. Last week the committee hammering out the details of the plan waived its exclusivity clause, allowing Comex to address other offers. At nearly the same time, the embattled Ms Redel stepped down as chief negotiator of the CBOT-Comex deal, while retaining her duties as the exchange's chairman. The move may diffuse membership dissent against Ms Redel, while allowing her to step back from the CBOT alliance to weigh other offers.</p>

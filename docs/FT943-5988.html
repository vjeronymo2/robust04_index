			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / BA silent over 'harassment' saga A retired police officer who has alleged he was harassed after making complaints to British Airways was told the airline did not challenge his account of the incidents, although it denied responsibility for them. Mr John Gorman, a retired police officer, has alleged that he was the victim of a series of threatening phone calls, robbery of documents and a beating in his home since he complained of a condom in an in-flight meal in January 1990. It is understood that in a meeting in July between Mr Mervyn Walker, BA's senior lawyer, and Mr Gorman, Mr Walker accepted that criminal incidents had occured. But BA said it had not 'been able to find out who is responsible for what has happened'. Mr Gorman said the abuse escalated after he reported a piece of glass found in his drink during an in-flight meal in January 1993. In May 1993 he was arrested for alleged conspiracy to defraud BA but it was decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute. At least one of the allegedly malicious phone calls made in November 1993 has been traced to the offices of Mr Ian Jackson, then BA head of security. But BA said Mr Jackson was away from his office on the day of the call. It is also believed that some malicious phone calls made to Mr Gorman's home have been traced to the Heathrow police station or to public telephone booths within the station. The Metropolitan Police are continuing inquiries. Last week BA passed on documents concerning its own investigations. The police complaints unit has also prepared a report for the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

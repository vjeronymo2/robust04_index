			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Manushkin: "They Pledge Their Hearts </F> to `Polet'..."]    [Text] Earlier it was forbidden even to mention this  enterprise in the press. The Omsk Polet Production Association,  participating in creating the rocket-space shield of the  country, was off limits for the press. Upon the ending of the  cold war, with the warming of the international climate, the  entire world learned about the association.    From the "K3" dossier. The enterprise was established in  1941  on the basis of aircraft plants evacuated from Moscow and the  Moscow region. In a few months the workers had to master  standard production of the Tu-2 dive bomber. Over the course of  2 1/2 years 3405 Tu-2, Yak-7 and Yak-9 military aircraft were  constructed. During the postwar period the production of the  Il-28 jet bomber was organized and 758 aircraft were produced.    The association also has priority in producing the world's  first jet passenger aircraft, the Tu-104, of which 58 were  constructed.    Beginning in the 1960's, under conditions of the strictest  secrecy, Polet workers made "items" for use in space. It has to  its credit more than forty international cooperation programs  within the framework of the Intercosmos and COSPAS-SARSAT  organizations. The two-stage Cosmos liquid-fuel booster, still  constructed at the association, has put hundreds of Russian and  international satellites into orbit. The Polet Association also  has priority in constructing Energiya assemblies and engines.    The twenty thousand workers of the NPO Polet, like the  entire  country, are now experiencing tough times. The enterprise has  found itself in a very tight "vice" as a result of conversion,  which was not fully thought through, the collapse of economic  relationships among the former union republics and a shortage of  financial resources. But here they not only do not complain of  difficulties and problems, but also are searching for ways out  of the crisis. The most important thing, in the opinion of the  leadership of the association, headed by Valentin Zaytsev, its  general director, is to preserve the scientific production  potential of the Polet aerospace corporation and its unique  production. The association is breaking its way through to the  world aerospace market and is concluding contracts with many  foreign organizations. In order to maintain a high production  level, to conserve the skeleton of the design bureau and the  entire work force, it was necessary, to be sure, also to engage  in the organization of "incidental" production: automatic lines  for the food and petroleum industry, machine building, medical  equipment and instruments, washing machines and other household  appliances.    To be sure, not everything has withstood the hard times.  Some  of the people for different reasons have left the work force.  But most of the people have remained. Over the course of 50 or  more years of its existence entire generations have grown up and  a definite structure of social arrangements and amenities has  taken shape. In short, although it is now difficult for many,  one must go on. After all, the hearts of these people are  attached to the Polet Association; many have passed their entire  life here. The people believe that the Polet Association has a  future.</p>

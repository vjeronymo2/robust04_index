			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> L.A. PUPILS ON SCORE PLATEAU  </P> <P> The latest achievement test scores indicate that Los Angeles schools have not  improved, but that those in the San Francisco Bay Area have, state Schools  Supt. Bill Honig said. At a news conference in advance of Thursday's scheduled  release of the California Assessment Program tests, Honig said the state's  public schools generally are improving, but still do not come up to those in  many other countries. "They smoke us on this," Honig said of other economically  advanced nations. "We aren't going to quit until we are competitive." No test  scores for individual school districts were released.  </P></p>

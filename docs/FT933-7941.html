			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late demand leaves Dow at fresh peak Wall Street US SHARE prices edged higher in busy trading yesterday, with most indices setting new records, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.83 at 3,586.98, just eclipsing the previous all-time peak of 3,583.35 set last week. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.75 higher at 453.13, while the American SE composite gained 1.33 at 442.66 and the Nasdaq composite added 4.12 at 731.01, both new records. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 261m shares. Equity markets opened lower yesterday, a natural reaction to Monday's heavy buying which lifted several key indices to record highs. Although the initial profit-taking depressed prices in the first few minutes of trading, the selling was insufficiently widespread to leave stocks in the red for particularly long. Within an hour of the start the markets were back in positive territory, but they struggled to make much headway for most of the day. The lack of a strong lead from the bond market, where yields rose slightly, and some disappointing economic news (the Commerce Department reported that housing starts fell by 2.7 per cent in July), was to blame for the sluggish nature of trading. A burst of late buying, however, allowed stocks to edge into record territory just before the close. The big news of the day was Hewlett-Packard, which dropped Dollars 5 to Dollars 70 1/4 in heavy trading after reporting fiscal third-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.06 a share, up from 75 cents a share a year ago, but well short of Wall Street expectations - analysts' forecasts had averaged around Dollars 1.20 a share for Hewlett-Packard's latest quarter. The stock staged a strong recovery later, however, and ended just Dollars 1 3/8 down on balance at Dollars 74. Some other technology stocks ended notably firmer. Compaq was ahead Dollars 2 at Dollars 54 1/4 and IBM Dollars 2 higher at Dollars 43. Retail issues were mixed in the wake of the release of second-quarter earnings. Dayton Hudson fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 67 1/4 on news of a 43 per cent drop in profits to 28 cents a share. The company also said it would take a 5 cents a share charge in the third quarter to cover changes in tax rates. JC Penney rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 45 3/4 after the company unveiled a 40 per cent jump in second-quarter earnings to Dollars 112m, or Dollars 42 cents a share. Glaxo ADRs climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16 5/8 in volume of 2.6m after the company received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market in the US its post-operative anti-nausea product Zofran. Canada TORONTO closed modestly higher, led by a strong gas sector and showing little effect from yesterday's rise in the bank rate. The Bank of Canada key rate rose 47 basis points to 4.67 per cent at the weekly Treasury-bill tender. The TSE 300 index was up 12.3 at 4,032.5 as advances narrowly outscored declines by 365 to 359. Volume was a relatively moderate 50.9m shares valued at CDollars 616.5m. Energy stocks posted a 1.44 per cent index rise, while the industrial products group was up 1.05 per cent, but golds lost some ground.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Apr -- President of the Ingush Republic  Ruslan Aushev today told an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the  possibility of his leaving the session of the Federation  Council. He made this statement at the end of a closed session  of the upper chamber of parliament on ratifying the Russian  president's decree extending the state of emergency in part of  the territory of the Republic of North Ossetia and of the Ingush  Republic for another two months.    Ruslan Aushev explained this "disagreement with the approach  to the resolution of the problem of settling the conflict in the  territories of North Ossetia and Ingushetia." In his opinion,  "in drafting the President's decree on extending the emergency,  the opinion of the component parts of the Federation should be  taken into account." "This especially concerns those instances  when questions are being tackled connected with change of the  territories to which the force of the emergency is extended," he  stressed. The Ingush president said the position of his  republic remained as before: "It is necessary to give power to  the interim administration in the conflict zone and disarm all  the military formations."    President of North Ossetia Akhsarbek Galazov refrained from  commenting on the content of the President's decree, and limited  himself only to the statement that "it is necessary to move  towards peace, stop shooting, and start working."</p>

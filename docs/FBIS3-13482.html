The resolution was to be presented at the UN  Human Rights Commission. Intensive debate on the matter was  continuing for the last few days and voting was scheduled on 9  March. Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali told a news  conference at the Foreign Ministry on 9 March evening that China  and Iran had told Pakistan not to press for the adoption of the  resolution or to withdraw it. Both of them are Pakistan's  friends and their request cannot be ignored.    By withdrawing the resolution from the UN Human Rights  Commission, the Government of Pakistan repeated the same blunder  it committed when it withdrew the resolution on the same topic  from the UN General Assembly in December last year. It had then  evoked a strong reaction not only inside the country, but also  among the people of Azad Kashmir, occupied Kashmir and Kashmiris  throughout the world.    In justifying the withdrawal of the resolution from the UN  Human Rights Commission, the foreign minister has said that this  cannot be construed to mean Pakistan's failure. Because 44 of  the 53 members of the commission had decided to abstain from  voting, and there would have been no significance if the  resolution had been adopted by a vote of only eight members  excluding the commission president.    The foreign minister's logic is beyond the comprehension of  the Pakistani people. The people are justified in asking the  foreign minister and the prime minister why the Pakistani  Foreign Ministry could not deduce that 44 members would abstain  from voting and thus make a resolution adopted in such manner  meaningless. The Foreign Office was so unaware that it did not  understand the "importance" of the global perspective of the  resolution and it failed to anticipate that a large number of  commission members would not vote on the resolution. If it was  aware, then why did it keep assuring the people of Pakistan that  "the Pakistani resolution will be adopted with a heavy majority"  and that India would be globally condemned, boosting the cause  of the freedom struggle in Kashmir?    The country's important and patriotic circles will also find  it very hard to agree with the foreign minister's argument that  the countries which decided to abstain in the voting actually  gave India an opportunity to improve the situation in occupied  Kashmir. We would like to remind the foreign minister that when  Pakistan withdrew the resolution against India from the UN  General Assembly, it was then said that the friendly countries  which pressured for the resolution's withdrawal felt that India  would hold talks with Pakistan on the Kashmir dispute. But the  fate of that talk is well- known to the people of Pakistan as  well as the leaders of the present government. It is on record  that the Foreign Office and the rulers have both been regretting  it after they realized that India had requested for talks only  to buy time. The question is, will India really improve the  situation in occupied Kashmir now that the resolution has been  withdrawn from the UN Human Rights Commission. Will India agree  to allow world agencies to freely visit occupied Kashmir, to  assess the situation there, and to withdraw its forces from  occupied Kashmir? These are the questions even a naive person  would answer in the negative. But why did the veteran officials  of our Foreign Office fail to understand them?    The foreign minister has claimed that the practical aspect  of  the resolution was to force India to allow international  missions to visit occupied Kashmir. But, India has already  allowed a delegation of ambassadors into occupied Kashmir.  Perhaps the foreign minister did not notice the news about the  delegation carried by the international media during the last  two days. Pakistani newspapers and radio and television reports  have also noted that the delegation was not allowed to move  freely. On the contrary, the people who tried to meet the  delegation were baton-charged and fired upon.    KHABRAIN has reported the other day that Pakistan's decision  to amend the resolution made it [word indistinct]. Through an  amendment to the resolution on 8 March, Pakistan has omitted the  provision that a UN Human Rights Commission mission be sent to  occupied Kashmir to investigate the human rights situation and  submit a report to the commission. Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan,  chairman of the National Assembly's Kashmir Committee, also  criticized the amendment saying that "the amendment in the  resolution has vindicated my apprehensions." He had also  convened a meeting of the Kashmir Committee on 20 March to  discuss the matter. It remains to be seen how the committee  reacts at the meeting to the Pakistani decision to withdraw the  resolution itself.    The present government has prompted harsh criticism and  confrontation by withdrawing the resolution. We fear the  opposition will react strongly to the Pakistani Government's  decision. The decision will also affect the Kashmir struggle  negatively and Kashmiris will be gripped by a feeling of  frustration. The people and Kashmiri circles will not accept  the justification presented by the government for its decision.</p>

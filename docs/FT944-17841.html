			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Technology: The missing link - German researchers are helping US companies Germany's Fraunhofer institutes, which provide an important research link between universities and companies, are following industry's lead and moving into the export market. The Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft (organisation), the largest applied research body in Germany, has set up a US offshoot to work with universities and help local companies develop advanced industrial technologies. It is also looking at ventures in south-east Asia. Fraunhofer USA is the first foreign unit of the German organisation, which has a research volume of DM1bn (Pounds 420m) and employs nearly 8,000 people in 46 institutes. 'We took this step because economies are becoming more and more interlinked,' says Hans-Jurgen Warnecke, president of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. US technology experts say that despite the country's academic and technological resources, the transfer of technologies from universities for industrial use is limited. As in Germany, much of the efforts of Fraunhofer USA will be directed at smaller companies, with a strong emphasis on manufacturing. 'We want to work with the Fraunhofer model in the US because it has clearly proved to be a great help in promoting innovation in small and medium-sized companies,' says John McTague, vice-president for technical affairs at Ford Motor Company and head of Fraunhofer USA's national advisory council, which met for the first time this week. United Technologies, Du Pont and BMW North America are also represented on the council. Fraunhofer USA has its headquarters in Michigan, near the motor industry, which it expects to be an important client. One Fraunhofer institute, for computer graphics research, set up a laboratory in Rhode Island ahead of the foundation of the new US unit. Fraunhofer USA has been given three years to gather enough contracts to pay its way. Until then, it will be financed by the parent company in Germany, which draws its funds from government, public sector and industrial research contracts.</p>

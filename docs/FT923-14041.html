			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries run out of steam ahead of auction AFTER several consecutive days of strong gains, US Treasury prices weakened yesterday ahead of the afternoon auction of seven-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 104 17/32 , yielding 7.605 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 3/32 at 101 5/32 , to carry a yield of 4.365 per cent. Although prices firmed overnight on foreign markets, when trading opened in New York dealers quickly pushed Treasuries lower as they prepared for the afternoon sale of Dollars 9.75bn in seven-year notes. The five-year note was particularly heavily sold as dealers raised cash for the auction. That cash was put to good use when the auction commenced, and in the wake of solid demand for the new issue, the sale of seven-year notes was closed out at an average yield of 6.44 per cent, with a one-point tail and with 39 per cent of all bids tendered at the high yield. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve intervened with a round of overnight system repurchase agreements in an attempt to counter a firm Fed funds rate by adding reserves to the system. Fed funds had been trading at 3 3/8 per cent, above its new target of 3 1/4 per cent. By late afternoon, however, Fed funds were still trading above their target at 3 1/2 per cent. EUROPEAN bond prices were stable yesterday as a bland G7 communique failed to provide markets with any direction. Gilt prices ended fractionally weaker, when sterling slipped outside the notional narrow band it has been tracking in the Exchange Rate Mechanism. The currency weakness undermined the otherwise bullish tone of the market, dealers said. 'There has been a marked rally over the last week,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Midland Montagu. '(Yesterday's slight weakness) represents a slight retrenchment, rather than a setting in of pessimism.' The market has been slightly soggy, because most of last Friday's Pounds 600m gilts tap is still unplaced. GERMAN bund prices ended unchanged as traders positioned themselves ahead of today's issue of 10-year bunds. The new issue is expected to total DM10bn to DM15bn, and to have an 8 per cent coupon, and to be priced above par, according to traders. IN JAPAN, government bonds reached a two-and-a-half-year high as sentiment was buoyed by the strength of the yen. The benchmark No 129 traded at 5.17 per cent in Japanese trading before the price fell slightly to end at 5.22 per cent in European trading. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, expects the market to 'continue to firm', underpinned by weak economic demand in Japan, as well as a firm currency.</p>

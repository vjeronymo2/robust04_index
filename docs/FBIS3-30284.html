			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Ryszard </F> Malik; place and date not given: "Now the Climate for Romania  Is Better"]    [Text] [Malik] We can see Russia slowly but definitely  returning to its imperial role. The politicians in Moscow are  not going to abandon the influence on the course of events in  Central and East Europe. Characteristic was the fact that  Russia did not agree to Poland's admission to NATO, which,  eventually, ended up in the "Partnership for Peace" initiative  being approved at the NATO summit in Brussels. What is your  evaluation of Boris Yeltsin's policy, of Russia's role, and what  is your opinion on the attitude of Western states toward the  countries liberated from Soviet hegemony?    [Iliescu] We should look at all the transformation processes  under way in our region objectively and without emotions. We  must remember that Russia was established on the ruins of the  Czarist state in 1917 and, even though with other slogans and  with the ideology of internationalism, it pursued the same  imperialist policy of the Czars. It strove to submit the world  to itself. The USSR was nothing but a continuation of Russia as  it looked before 1917. The artificially established republics  were steered centrally; all power was concentrated in the  Kremlin. What has changed now? The Russia of Yeltsin is  reverting back to the old Russian traditions -- traditions going  back to times before 1917: we have the Duma, we have the Czarist  eagle as the emblem of today's Russia, there are also people who  are referring to the past. There are conservative forces, which  demand that the Russian state, in this way or another, control  the neighboring states. I am thinking about our part of Europe  and about our two neighbors.    A return to the past, especially to the past associated with  a given state's strength, could be observed in all fallen  empires: in Great Britain after World War II; in France in the  1960's, when Algeria, which wanted independence, was looked upon  as an overseas part of France. Therefore, I want to emphasize  that what we are observing today in Russia is not really  surprising.    These are forces with which we must reckon; please note,  however, that there are also progressive democratic forces, led  by President Yeltsin. I hope that democracy will win; that new  relations between Russia and its neighbors will develop in line  with accepted rules of international politics, and that they  will be friendly and will serve the interests of both sides.  The historical process that is going on in today's world is  very complex and we cannot really jump to any conclusions. I  believe in the wisdom of politicians and assume that we all want  a stable and peaceful Europe. The "Partnership for Peace"  program seems to be a step in the right direction in this  process.    [Malik] Romania sees, then, a possibility of Russia's  membership in NATO?    [Iliescu] I hope that a certain general formula of  partnership will be established which will in the future allow  the Russian Federation to integrate with political and economic  structures throughout Europe. I hope that Russia will find its  niche in the community based on the rule of respecting the  interests of all states. Today, a new international order is  being constructed; this order is based on cooperation and  understanding between all states and nations. It is a  necessity, however, it is at the same time a guarantee of peace  and stability.    [Malik] You are one of the few politicians in former  socialist countries who is still in power after all the changes  that have taken place. Could you reveal the source of this  success?    [Iliescu] Once again we must go back to history. Romania  was one of the states where the communist regime was very  strict. However, at the time of intervention in Czechoslovakia  and even earlier, Romania proved that it was not going to just  passively follow the orders of the Kremlin. It was only the  policy of the last decade, under the Nicolae Ceausescu regime,  that led to an economic catastrophe, to unprecedented exclusion  of the intellectual elites from political and economic life; in  those years the elites were sentenced to a life of isolation.  Building an autocratic economy and paying off the foreign debt  at any cost were the most important achievements -- in the  negative sense -- of the last communist leader of Romania. This  is why the activities of the opposition were so radical; this is  why we had a revolution that did not occur in any other former  communist country. In the times of President Causescu, I was  isolated for criticizing his policy in public. Because of that,  I became a well-known personality -- one can even say that I  became popular. I did many things that did not exactly fit the  compulsory model. When the revolution broke out, in December  1989, I found myself in the center of all the events and,  perhaps because of my past, the people trusted me. I was  elected chairman of the National Salvation Front. Then in the  1990 elections, I was elected president; finally, two years ago,  the people once again supported my candidacy for the head of  state. It looks like I am still enjoying the trust of the  people.    [Malik] Mr. President, not long ago Romania was depicted  as a country governed by former communists. The situation  changed a little after a former communist leader won the  elections in Lithuania and after a social-democratic party won  the Polish elections. Did you not, at a certain point, get the  impression that Western politicians wanted to force you, as it  were, to leave the political scene?    [Iliescu] I get the impression that not only in the case of  Romania, but in all the states formerly governed by communists,  there is a certain ideological flaw in the way the West  perceives us. The very term ex-communist has in our case  negative connotations. I will ask the following question:  Should over 4 million members of the Romanian communist party  now be isolated, excluded from the political and economic life?  What should happen to the leaders of the opposition, such as  Professor Emil Constantinescu (leader of the oppositional  Democratic Convention comprised of 18 groupings -- R.M.), who  was the [communist] party's ideological secretary in the  university? Former communist party members are in all the  groupings today. Almost the entire intellectual elite in  Romania was in the party. This is not the only criterion for  evaluating people. This is not acceptable; it is a Bolshevik  evaluation. We must build a new Romanian society and evaluate  people according to what they can do. One must see things and  people as they really are, without looking into the dossier at  any cost.    [Malik] In Switzerland, in exile, lives former King Michael  II. Why do you not want him to return to his fatherland?    [Iliescu] We must look at this problem without any emotions.  The problem is whether Romania is supposed to be a monarchy or a  republic. The Romanian people have already expressed their  opinions on this subject in a referendum; they accepted the  republican constitution. Monarchy was a certain stage in the  history of Romania; there is no raison d'etre for its role in a  new society. Indeed, there are various forces and people in our  country that for various reasons want to restore the monarchy.  These people are living with illusions -- they want to return  to the times before World War II. Today, that is simply  impossible. Personally, I have nothing against the king.  However, if he wants to return to Romania as a king, this is  simply out of the question. Now, if he wants to come back here  as an ordinary citizen, then he is welcome. Let me only add  that it is not him that is the cause of all this commotion; he  does not want to be a monarch any longer. Those who have caused  it are people driven by nostalgia.    [Malik] Is it true that Romania is being isolated, that  there are opinions in Bucharest that the state has been  relegated to the sidelines of regional initiatives, and that  entrance into the Council of Europe was delayed?    [Iliescu] Romania does not want to be isolated. It is true  that we are being moved away. We wanted -- fruitlessly -- to  become a member of the Visegrad Group and to join the Central  European Initiative. We want to cooperate with all the states  of Central and East Europe, including Poland. As far as the  issue of admitting us to the Council of Europe is concerned, my  evaluation is that it was the same ideological flaw --  perceiving us as former communists. However, also as a result of  our internal disputes, they are transferred to the international  level. It is one of our weaknesses in the period of change. We  know all about it.    The climate for Romania is now better. Everyone understands  that including our country in the process of European  integration will be in the interest of all Europe.    [Malik] Since I am speaking with you as the Romanian  president, I cannot help asking you a question about the  Republic of Moldova, which was established from the debris of  the USSR. Is it possible, and is it very real, that Romania and  Moldova will become one state? There will be a referendum on  this very soon.    [Iliescu] Well, this is a very difficult issue given the  present international situation. We must look at it  objectively. We must respect international and interstate  agreements that set the present borders in Europe. One cannot  change the present status of borders in one point, because this  would cause an avalanche of corrections; such an avalanche would  be difficult to control and would place the stabilization of the  entire continent in question.    As for the Republic of Moldova, it is one of the many states  that were established after the collapse of the Soviet Union;  processes of political and economic transformations are under  way there. However, it must be remembered that Moldova is a  territory that historically belongs to Romania; that Romanian is  spoken there; and that the country has the same culture. The  Soviet Union's annexation of Moldova was the result of the  Ribbentrop-Molotov pact; however, Nikita Khrushchev was even  smarter than Stalin and divided Moldova; as a result, today part  of it belongs to Ukraine. Thus, now this concerns not only the  Republic of Moldova, but also Ukraine.    We have good relations with Moldova and we will develop them  in all areas. The answer to the question of when the  unification of these states will be possible remains pure  guesswork. No one knows that. If we assume that in the future  united Europe there will be no borders and that there will be  one great European nation, this issue will not be so emotional.    [Malik] Many national minorities live in Romania. Of  these, the Hungarians are the most numerous. This is the cause  of tensions in the relations between Romania and Hungary. What  guarantees does Romania provide minorities?    [Iliescu] In Romania lives a Hungarian minority that  consists of 1.7 million people. Just like all the other  minorities, of which there are 14, the Constitution guarantees  them all rights, it can develop without any hindrances, in  peace, and with the feeling of stability. The minorities have  their own representatives in the parliament. Even the smallest  national groups, in case their representatives are not elected  to parliament, are guaranteed a seat there. The Romanian  Government has acknowledged the rights of the minorities for  free development, in accordance with their needs, in every area.  No matter whether they are Germans or Hungarians, all of them  have the same rights as Romanian citizens. The rule that our  country is applying is that minority members must be loyal  citizens of Romania and observe all binding laws.    Now, as for our relations with Hungary. We have informed  Budapest that we are alarmed at the extreme demonstrations of  some political forces in Hungary which query the status quo in  the region and demand extraordinary rights for the Hungarian  minority in Romania, and not only here. We do not consent to  the idea of territorial autonomy for any minority. For example,  do the Germans living in Alsace-Lorraine in France have  autonomy? We believe that these are issues that each state  regulates in line with international law. Please bear in mind  that one-third of Romanians live outside our borders. We are  not trying to turn it into a problem; we are not bringing this  issue up. We support the contacts of the Hungarians with their  native country; however, we would also like them to be loyal  citizens of Romania and to respect the law just like all the  other citizens.    I believe that our relations with Hungary are good. Our  economic contacts are on a very good level, I would say. I do  believe that if we take a real look at the problems that need to  be resolved and that need cooperation, we will render these  relations normal and friendly. Just like the relations with any  other state.    [Malik] Many economic problems of Romania have their origin  in the war in former Yugoslavia. Does Romania, which has good  relations with the new Yugoslavia, have any influence on this  conflict? Is it doing anything to help end this conflict?    [Iliescu] Romania has never had any conflicts with former  Yugoslavia. On the contrary, our relations are very good. As I  see it, the disintegration of Yugoslavia was a positive event.  After World War I, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was established  which functioned very well; it settled disputes between various  nations and various religions, the Muslims, Catholics, and  Orthodox Church members. In World War II, the nations of  Yugoslavia fought jointly against the German invaders. The  disintegration of Yugoslavia is the result of the ending of the  Cold War; it is the play of the interests of various states,  such as Germany, which contributed to what happened. Romania  today has good relations with the new Yugoslavia, with Slovenia,  and with Croatia. We would like the conflict in Bosnia to be  settled quickly and peacefully. We are trying to help this  cause as much as we can. We have historical, political,  economic, and cultural relations with this region. It is also  in our interest to finally settle this dramatic conflict.    [Malik] Mr. President, Polish-Romanian relations have a long  tradition. They have always been friendly. How do you evaluate  them today?    [Iliescu] I would first of all like to emphasize that we  attach great importance to our relations with Poland and their  development. First, because we cooperated many times in the  past and many times we were on the same side of the barricade.  We were linked by the same problems. Our neighbors were great  empires which attempted to submit us to themselves. Right now  we are facing a great challenge related to the process of  democratic transformation and the introduction of a market  economy. Therefore, it is with sorrow that I speak about the  unfriendly treatment of Romania; you write about our state being  a country of Gypsies; your mass media, including the newspaper  that you represent, present only a negative picture of Romania.  Why is that? Is it because Poland is enjoying great sympathy  in Romania and because the Romanians admire Polish culture?    We are both surprised and alarmed at this reservedness on  the  part of Poland toward Romania.    However, I am an optimist and I hope that in the immediate  future better times for Polish-Romanian relations will come.  Using your newspaper, I would like to inform all your readers  about my optimism and about the great sentiment that the  Romanian people have for Poland and Poles.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Stevan Cordas] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, March 16 (TANJUG) -- Russian president's  special envoy Vitaliy Churkin crowned his unexpected visit to  Belgrade on Wednesday by announcing that Moscow was raising a  new initiative for the resolution of the crisis in the former  Yugoslavia. The initiative is aimed at having an agreement  reached between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serb  Krajina (RSK) on the cessation of hostilities and the restoring  of peace.    Churkin and RSK President Milan Martic agreed in Belgrade on  Wednesday that Krajina-Croatia talks be held at the Russian  Embassy in Zagreb on March 22.    The conflict between Krajina and Croatia broke out in 1991  because of Croatia's forcible secession from the former  Yugoslavia and the attempt of its authorities to reduce the Serb  people to a national minority.    The RSK was proclaimed in 1991 on ethnically and  historically  Serb territories within the administrative borders of the former  Yugoslav republic of Croatia. The RSK was proclaimed a U.N.  protected area (UNPA) in March 1992.    After meeting with Martic, Churkin conferred separately with  Bosnian Serb Leader Radovan Karadzic and President Slobodan  Milosevic of Serbia and left for Zagreb in the afternoon.  Churkin is due to leave from Zagreb for Washington on Thursday  to meet with U.S. President's special envoy Charles Redman.    The new Russian initiative is in a way complementary with  the  U.S. initiative for the creation of a Moslem-Croat federation in  the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  subsequent confederation with Croatia.    The new Russian peace initiative indicates that Moscow has  arrived at the conclusion that no overall political settlement  is possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina without a solution for the  krajina-Croatia issue.    On the other hand, the United States considers the agreement  on a Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina to be of the  utmost importance at this point. However, the agreement has  completed only the first stage of the U.S. peace initiative.  The second stage, that is, the reaching of an overall  settlement for Bosnia- Herzegovina, will not be possible without  the Bosnian Serbs and Russia.    It remains to be seen how Washington intends to clear the  way  for the second stage of the peace initiative. It is aware that  the initiative cannot be successful without the Bosnian Serbs  and it is no doubt seriously counting on Russia to lend a  helping hand.    The announced Churkin-Redman talks should most likely be  viewed in that light, and it would be no surprise if the special  U.S. envoy was soon to visit Belgrade again.</p>

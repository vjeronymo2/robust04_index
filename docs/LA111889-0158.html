			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ACCUSED SURGEON LOSES COURT ROUND TO HIS CREDITORS  </P> <P> Creditors of Thomas A. Gionis, the Pomona surgeon accused of masterminding an  attack on his ex-wife, Aissa Wayne, won a crucial bankruptcy ruling Friday that  forces Gionis to liquidate part of his assets to pay off his debts.  </P> <P> More than 200 creditors, including Wayne, daughter of John Wayne, asked federal  Bankruptcy Judge David N. Naugle in San Bernardino to convert the bankruptcy  for Gionis' medical corporation from a Chapter 11 case to Chapter 7. The change  allows a court-appointed trustee to sell the surgeon's assets for the benefit  of his creditors.  </P> <P> Attorneys said that court documents indicate the corporate assets alone are  worth at least $4 million.  </P> <P> Gionis had blocked access to financial documents and invoked the Fifth  Amendment 67 times when questioned during a deposition, said Richard Marshak, a  Santa Ana attorney and court-sanctioned counsel for a host of unsecured  creditors.Neither Gionis nor his bankruptcy attorney, Fred Cohen, could be  reached for comment.  </P> <P> A criminal trial for Gionis, who is accused of masterminding the attack on  Wayne and her then-boyfriend, financier Roger W. Luby, is scheduled to begin  Nov. 28. However, Gionis' attorneys said Friday that they plan to seek a  continuance next week to at least February. Superior Court Judge Everett W.  Dickey reduced Gionis' bail from $250,000 to $100,000 although Gionis'  attorneys had requested a reduction to $25,000. He has pleaded innocent to the  charges.  </P> <P> Wayne and Luby were attacked on Oct. 3, 1988, at Luby's $3-million Newport  Beach estate. They said two men smashed their faces on a concrete floor and  slashed Luby's right Achilles' tendon.  </P> <P> In August, Gionis filed for protection from his creditors in federal bankruptcy  court. The filing has prevented his ex-wife from collecting a $1.3-million  judgment awarded to her earlier this year as part of their divorce settlement.  </P> <P> Before his legal problems began, Gionis had a flourishing private orthopedic  practice and had five Southland medical clinics. Gionis has also filed personal  bankruptcy and bankruptcy on behalf of a partnership, Multiple Specialty Group  of the Desert.  </P> <P> The surgeon drove a Ferrari and lived with Wayne and the couple's 2-year-old  daughter, Anastasia, in an estate in the Phillips Ranch area of Pomona. Wayne,  after a stormy custody battle, was granted custody of their daughter.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Naugle accused Gionis of "bad management" when he learned  that Gionis had drawn a $4,000-a-week salary from the corporation but had  neglected to take out any withholding tax, said Timothy J. Farris, an attorney  in charge of the U.S. Trustee Office in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Farris said that after an Aug. 25 meeting between Gionis, his attorney and  attorneys for his creditors, it was agreed that Gionis could take out a  $4,000-a-week corporate salary "provided he get medical malpractice insurance."  </P> <P> "Without the insurance, he could not treat patients," Farris said. "We said  that if he was an operating doctor he should be entitled to the salary. He  applied for the insurance but he never got it."  </P> <P> The surgeon's belligerence and uncooperative nature prompted the government to  concur with his creditors and their motion Friday before Judge Naugle, Farris  said.  </P> <P> "For two months, because (Gionis) failed to provide interim financial  statements, I didn't know what was going on with the money for the  corporation," Farris said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Answering a reporter's  question at a news conference this afternoon, a spokesman of the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the report about  China having sent additional troops to the Sino-India border is  a "sheer fabrication" [chun shu nie zao 4783 1466 2250 6644].    A reporter asked: According to a report, China recently sent  additional 30,000 troops into Tibet and deployed them along the  Sino-Indian border areas. Please confirm and comment.    The spokesman said: The report is sheer fabrication. Last  year the Chinese and Indian Governments signed an accord on  maintaining peace and tranquility in areas along the Line of  Actual Control, and the two countries have also started  discussing issues about reducing troops in areas along the line.  Spreading the lie that China has sent an additional 30,000  troops to the Sino-Indian border areas is obviously out of  ulterior motives.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Axe falls on N American forestry  -A big shake-up looms in the battered industry The harsh bite of recession, plus far-reaching changes in the market for wood products, are creating the need for a big shake-up in the North American forestry industry. A spate of acquisitions, mergers, financialrestructurings, mill closures, and product-mix adjustments are among the likelyoutcomes as US and Canadian companies, some of them heavily burdened with debt,ponder their response to the unexpectedly severe turbulence. In a typical comment, Mr Amit Wadhwaney of MJ Whitman &amp; Co, a New York securities firm, said: 'You've seen some excesses and you're going to see some unwinding.' Few sectors other than real estate have been battered harder than the forestryindustry over the past year. Its biggest customers - the publishing and construction industries, for instance - are themselves among the most tightly-squeezed victims of the business slowdown. With the sole exception of Kimberly-Clark, the tissue maker which is as much a consumer products company as a forestry one, the industry leaders suffered steep declines in first-quarter earnings. Several are deep in the red (see table). The Dollars 7m loss posted by Georgia-Pacific, the biggest producer, would have been Dollars 50m were it not for the sale of containerboard and corrugated packaging businesses. Mr Gary Palmero, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, estimates that the shares of forestry companies are nowat their biggest discount to book value - over 50 per cent on average  - in more than 30 years. No improvement is likely in Sigler, chairman of Connecticut-based Champion International, sums up the industry's mood with: 'The second quarter looks tough, and beyond that it's too soon to tell.' The recession has snaked through the forestry industry like a line of falling dominoes, hitting one product after another. Newsprint was the first, followed by lumber, pulp and, most recently, uncoated white papers. The slump in white papers largelyexplains Boise Cascade's slide to a Dollars 16.9m first-quarter loss. The outlook for coated papers is also clouded by over-capacity. Offshore markets, one of the first quarter's few bright spots, will be threatened if the US dollar sustains its recent advance. Wilting demand is pushing down prices for most products. According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, the US consumed 6.2per cent less newsprint in the first two months of this year than during the same period in 1990. A 5.5 per cent price hike which was supposed to take effect on January 1 has been quietly abandoned. Discounts are the order of the day. Equally worrying for the industry is growing spare capacity, caused partly bythe recession but also by the start-up of pulp and paper mills conceived duringthe heady days of the late 1980s. Mr Palmero estimates, for instance, that US newsprint capacity will grow by almost 5 per cent this year and another 2.6 per cent in 1992. Meanwhile, the cost of building new mills, modernising old ones, and of acquisitions has swollen the industry's debt. Georgia-Pacific's long-term debt more than doubled to Dollars 5.2bn last year following its purchase of GreatNorthern Nekoosa. Stone Container of Chicago, which is widely regarded as one of the weakest companies in the US industry, has Dollars 396m in debt maturing this year, and another Dollars 471m in 1992. An example of the highly-leveraged new projects is the Ponderay newsprint mill in Washington state, jointly owned by Canadian Pacific Forest Products and various US publishing companies. More than two thirds of the mill's Dollars 352m cost was financed by debt. Cash flow from the project is earmarked for debt repayment until a target debt-to-equity ratio is reached. Although the industry's fortunes are bound to improve when the economy picks up, producers also face wrenching structural changes. Trees onceregarded as little more than weeds are increasingly being used in timber products, pulp, and some grades of paper. Producers of high-quality timber from the north-west US and western Canada, battling to remain competitive, are moving as fast as possible away from 'commodity' grades to value-added building materials and manufactured paper products. Environmental pressures are also forcingchanges. The growing use of recycled paper is eroding demand for virgin timber. Stricter forest conservation rules threaten to shrink the amount of timber available for cutting, while pushing up transport and logging costs. Some companies have started to face reality. Weyerhaeuser has sold assets worth Dollars 400m inthe past two years, including a hardwood factory and a beauty aids centre. Abitibi-Price, the biggest Canadian newsprint producer, will soon shut down one of its mills. Analysts are dividing the industry's players into the strong and the weak. The latter group, which includes Stone, Boise Cascade and most of the Canadian companies, are likely to undergo the most radical surgery during the looming shake-up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------       FIRST QUARTER 1991 PAPER COMPANY EARNINGS (M DOLLARS)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     Sales    % change   Net Income   % change on year                                                          on year International Paper 3,100.0   -3.1          132.0          -26.7 Georgia Pacific     2,778.0   +4.9           (7.0)            - Weyerhauser         2,062.7 - 10             52.4          -60 Kimberly Clark      1,667.6   +6.0          120.3           +2.6 Scott Paper         1,234.2   -4.7           29.3          -51.2 James River         1,169.5  -18.8           39.4          -21.0 Champion Internt'l  1,164.8   -9.3           14.8          -78.8 Mead                1,097.2   -3.5           13.4          -66.1 Boise Cascade         992.7   -9.1          (16.9)            - Union Camp            722.1   +2.9           41.2          -38.9 Westvaco              573.3   -2.1           16.6          -64.3 Willamette            461.2   -1.9            5.5          -87.0 Louisiania Pacific    362.4  -23.7           (8.6)            - Federal Paper Board   331.8   +4.7           27.9          -28.1 Stone Container     1,336.8   -8.1            1.3          -96.1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company Reports Research Associate: Rivka Nachoma  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

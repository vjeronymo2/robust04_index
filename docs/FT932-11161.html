			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany drifts lower ahead of strike call Among European markets last week there was little reaction to a further easing in interest rates. In fact, Germany drifted lower, with the prospect of a strike by members of IG Metall, the engineering union, which began this Monday, undermining sentiment. However, another strong performance from Finland, counterbalancing an equally poor showing from Mexico, and a year's high in Tokyo, helped to lift the FT-Actuaries World index nearly 2 per cent. Signs of an economic downturn in continental Europe, and particularly Germany, have been evident for some time, with analysts becoming increasingly bearish. Goldman Sachs, in its latest strategy document, commenting on Germany, expects the economy to deteriorate further in the second quarter. 'We feel that the bulk of the market's anticipated strength for 1993 has been seen in the first quarter and that the second and third quarters will be indifferent at best.' At Barclays de Zoete Wedd the view is echoed, while noting that 1994 may show a revival, 'as provisions drop out, the lagged effect of easing shows through and the stronger dollar helps overseas earners . . . but this does not make 1994 immune from further downgrades, due to either cyclical problems or structural overcapacity effects'. The situation in France is scarcely better, with Nikko Europe commenting: 'There is every sign that GDP growth in the first quarter will be negative which, given a 0.6 per cent fall in the fourth quarter of 1992, indicates that the country is entering recession.' Mexico tumbled as doubts persisted over whether or not the Nafta agreement, which would phase out most trade barriers between the US, Canada and Mexico from January 1994, would be approved by the US. This was followed by disappointing results from Telmex, the largest private company in Mexico, which prompted selling in New York.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in                   % change in local currency**   sterling** US Dollars**               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                          1993      1993        1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       -1.84    -1.00  -17.33    -0.65     -2.16         +1.38 Belgium       -2.17    -4.54   +2.58    +9.47     +7.58        +11.48 Denmark       -0.12    +2.23  -10.66   +12.03    +11.07        +15.10 Finland       +7.37   +14.81  +50.39   +45.62    +34.93        +39.84 France        +0.81    -2.58   -3.18    +6.51     +6.09         +9.94 Germany       -2.13    -1.74   -7.42    +6.70     +5.01         +8.81 Ireland       -0.21    +1.80   +5.49   +27.06    +15.77        +19.97 Italy         -0.36   +13.29  +13.67   +23.95    +18.05        +22.33 Netherlands   -2.27    -2.29   +3.17    +8.38     +6.56        +10.44 Norway        +4.45    +4.58   -4.84   +15.48    +14.71        +18.88 Spain         -0.87    +2.74   -0.17   +14.61     +8.99        +12.95 Sweden        -0.35    +1.38  +14.83    +7.58     +0.23         +3.87 Switzerland   -1.16    -2.33  +12.76    +3.93     +2.48         +6.19 UK            -0.87    -1.40   +7.16    +0.32     +0.32         +3.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE        -0.85    -0.82   +3.29    +5.25     +3.92         +7.69  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     -1.85    -1.21   -2.10    +6.94     +6.04         +9.89 Hong Kong     +1.94    +7.52  +23.30   +24.17    +19.99        +24.35 Japan         +5.74    +5.68  +24.30   +23.40    +33.64        +38.49 Malaysia      +3.24   +11.74  +37.10   +20.81    +18.76        +23.07 New Zealand   +0.13    +3.46   +8.30    +7.18     +9.19        +13.15 Singapore     +2.73    +6.27  +11.02   +12.33    +10.10        +14.11 Canada        +3.28    +5.12   +7.24   +10.48     +6.69        +10.57 USA           +0.71    -0.29   +6.28    +0.89     -2.64         +0.89 Mexico        -7.28    -7.91   -9.51    -9.39    -12.49         -9.31 South Africa  +4.67    +5.93   +7.36   +18.42    +21.39        +25.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.86    +1.66  +10.29    +8.88     +9.10        +13.07  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on April 30, 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Copyright, The Financial Times Limited, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co, and NatWest Securities Limited.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Maastricht amendment rejected: Government relief as move to wreck ratification is thrown out THE GOVERNMENT breathed a collective sigh of relief last night when an amendment that threatened to wreck ratification of the Maastricht treaty was ruled out of order. The decision by Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, represents a serious setback for the Conservative Euro-sceptic faction, who saw the amendment as their best chance of sinking the treaty. But it does not halt debate in the near future of another Labour change to the bill that, if passed, could force the government to choose between accepting the social chapter or abandoning the treaty. The amendment thrown out yesterday, tabled by Labour's Mr Calum Macdonald, aimed to remove the entire social protocol from the treaty, including Britain's 'opt-out', thereby implicitly forcing a full renegotiation of the pact. Mr Morris has yet to rule on the Labour leadership's amendment, tabled on Wednesday, which could be heard later this month. Nonetheless, yesterday's ruling has taken the pressure off the government after days of it looking extremely vulnerable to a defeat that would have had disastrous ramifications for its European policy. Additional respite came when a widely anticipated row in the Tory backbench 1922 committee over Maastricht policy failed to materialise. In spite of these developments, ministers remain highly sensitive to opinion among rightwing Euro-sceptic rebels. Mr George Robertson, Labour spokesman on European affairs, said there was a Tory 'chasm' over Maastricht: 'The Conservative party is a shambles, a rabble out of control, without the slightest atom of knowledge of where they are going to go on Europe, or, indeed, anywhere else.' He charged that the government failed at Maastricht to ensure that bodies such as the European parliament had enough powers to counter the strength of 'crude market forces and faceless bureaucrats and bankers'. Mr Robertson faced down complaints from Tory Euro-sceptics that the basic unity between the front benches over Maastricht made the Commons debate 'a sham'. Elsewhere ministers are going on the offensive against their backbench critics on Europe. In a speech to businessmen in Westminster yesterday Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, condemned opponents of the treaty as 'flat-earthers' and told Conservative backbenchers to stop squabbling like children. 'Of course Maastricht is a compromise - every deal one does with one's partners always is - but it is the best on offer and much better than its predecessor, the Single European Act,' the minister said. He was later taken to task over his comments on BBC television by Tory Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor, who told him: 'Abuse doesn't solve anything,' adding that the opponents of the Maastricht treaty are 'reluctant rebels. We want to work together with the party'. Mr Waldegrave's strong comments came on the eve of two further attacks on the governments' backbench critics, expected to be similarly robust. Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke are both due to use the Conservative Central Council meeting in Harrogate today to launch new assaults on the party's dissidents.</p>

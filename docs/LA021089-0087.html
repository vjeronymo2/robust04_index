			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANEL REJECTS MOVE TO HALT NORTH'S TRIAL;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MAY APPEAL SECRETS ISSUE TO HIGH COURT  </P> <P> The Justice Department lost a round in an attempt Thursday to halt former Lt.  Col. Oliver L. North's trial in the Iran-Contra scandal but said that its legal  challenge could be carried to the Supreme Court, an action that might delay  proceedings against the former White House aide at least for several days.  </P> <P> The government, deeply concerned about sensitive national security information  that North's lawyers may seek to introduce during the trial, wants the judge in  the case ordered to impose tighter restrictions over such evidence. But a  three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals here denied the Justice  Department request Thursday.  </P> <P> The decision capped a day of legal maneuvering that resulted in the trial's  being delayed just as prosecutors and defense attorneys were preparing to give  their opening statements to a newly chosen jury. Those statements were  postponed until Monday by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell but may have to  be delayed further.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Walsh Opposed Appeal  </P> <P> The appellate judges, in a brief order, unanimously sided with independent  counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, who opposed the Justice Department's position on  classified information and contended that the department had no legal standing  to intervene in the case at the 11th hour.  </P> <P> Walsh said in papers filed with the appellate judges that he -- and not Atty.  Gen. Dick Thornburgh -- is the court-appointed independent prosecutor and that  he is satisfied with procedures established by Gesell for handling documents  and testimony that bear on national security. Walsh suggested that it is  Thornburgh's duty to withhold certain sensitive information altogether from the  trial if he believes state secrets are in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Thornburgh did just that a month ago, with Walsh's concurrence, in a decision  that forced dismissal of the primary charges of conspiracy and theft against  North. Thornburgh agreed with government security analysts that documents  necessary to try North on those charges are too sensitive to be disclosed at  trial.  </P> <P> Thornburgh, as head of the Justice Department, now is contending that Gesell's  guidelines for the use of classified information are so loose that North may  force disclosure of top-secret matters during his trial on 12 lesser charges,  which allege that North destroyed documents and made false statements to  Congress and a presidential board of inquiry.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wants Explicit Rulings  </P> <P> The department, in its brief, said that Gesell should be forced to make  "explicit rulings concerning the relevance and admissibility of each item of  classified information that the defense intends to introduce."  </P> <P> In expressing dissatisfaction with the broad guidelines that Gesell established  to govern the use of such data, department lawyers said that they might be  powerless to stop North from disclosing secrets.  </P> <P> After the Justice Department had filed its papers Thursday, Gesell proceeded to  select a jury of three men and nine women. Then the appellate judges ordered an  "administrative stay," a ruling that halted the trial while they studied the  national security dispute.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Jurors Sent Home  </P> <P> Gesell promptly told the jurors to go home and return on Monday, when he hoped  the question would be settled.  </P> <P> "What we are going to do is shut down, catch up on our sleep," he said.  </P> <P> Two hours later, the appellate judges rejected the Justice Department's  arguments and lifted the stay. But the jurors already had gone home.  </P> <P> After the appellate ruling, Edward S. G. Dennis Jr., chief of the Justice  Department's criminal division, told reporters that he and his colleagues are  determined to pursue the issue.  </P> <P> He said that the department has the option of asking the three-judge panel to  reconsider its decision or of appealing the issue to the full 11-member Court  of Appeals for the District of Columbia. The department could also appeal  directly to the Supreme Court, he said.  </P> <P> "We are committed to pursuing a stay" in the North trial until the issue can be  decided on its merits, Dennis said. He suggested that the department might  select an option by today.  </P> <P> Dennis was asked repeatedly if Thornburgh were prepared to withhold additional  sensitive material as a last resort, a move that might abort North's trial  altogether. He replied that such a decision was "premature."  </P> <P> "We have not thought that far ahead," he said, "but we're not leaving any  options out of consideration."  </P> <P> Dennis described the present situation as "a crap shoot," declaring that "we  cannot go into this trial knowing we will not have a right to be heard" on the  subject of possible sensitive disclosures by North's lawyers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UNSEALS DOCUMENT LISTING NORTHROP PROBES  </P> <P> When Northrop pleaded guilty in February to 34 counts of defense fraud and paid  a $17-million fine, at least one question was left unanswered: What  investigations against Northrop were dropped as part of its plea agreement with  federal prosecutors?  </P> <P> On Monday, those investigations became public.  </P> <P> U.S. Circuit Judge Pamela Ann Rymer unsealed most of an exhibit listing 11  criminal investigations that were dropped against the Los Angeles aerospace  company.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Los Angeles Times and the Wall Street Journal had sought to  make documents in the case public. The exhibit unsealed Monday, however, does  leave a portion whited out -- one referring to a current investigation or  investigations.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. William F. Fahey, lead prosecutor in the case, said Monday  that "Each and every one of the investigations we chose not to go forward on  criminally had been thoroughly investigated by more than 20 agents as well as  several experienced federal prosecutors who spent upwards of three years  looking at these cases. It was only at that point that we learned in some  respects that many of the cases were beyond the statute of limitations, and  many others had no evidence of criminal fraud."  </P> <P> He said "a number of other cases" are pending against Northrop civilly and  administratively as well as criminal probes.  </P> <P> Specifically, Northrop pleaded guilty to fraud in connection with the cruise  missile and Harrier jet programs.  </P> <P> The investigations prosecutors dropped were:  </P> <P> * Two separate cases arising from allegations made by former Northrop employees  Jeff Kroll and David Peterson in connection with the MX missile system. The  government has sued Northrop over some of Peterson's and Kroll's charges.  </P> <P> * Allegations concerning mischarging in 1983 in the production of the "inertial  measurement unit," a guidance component of the MX missile. Fahey said the  statute of limitations passed when the investigation began in 1988.  </P> <P> * Two investigations of mischarging at the Electronics Division, one involving  alleged failure to properly test the "heat exchanger" of the inertial  measurement unit.  </P> <P> * Allegations that Northrop failed to tell the government about a cost-saving  new process to make parts for the FA-18 fighter. The government has filed a  civil suit.  </P> <P> * Allegations contained in a Defense Contract Audit Agency report from Dec. 18,  1987, regarding two secret programs.  </P> <P> * Allegations concerning pricing misconduct in the production of a research  report by the B-2 Division.  </P> <P> * Allegations of mischarging in the B-2 and Aircraft divisions. The last three  probes were undertaken after the statute of limitations.  </P> <P> * Allegations arising from a "whistle blower suit" brought by six former  Northrop employees in connection with the MX missile program.  </P> <P> * Allegations of fraud in developing a "small ICBM." Fahey cited insufficient  evidence of criminal misconduct.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Sevindzh Abudllayeva and Viktor </F> Shulman]    [Text] Baku June 26 TASS -- It is critical to retain what  has been already achieved in the negotiating process by  concentrating efforts of all interested parties, including  Russia and the CSCE, upon a full-scale agreement on  Azeri-Armenian settlement, according to the Russian president's  special envoy for Nagorno-Karabakh Vladimir Kazimirov.    On Saturday night, Ambassador-at-Large Kazimirov arrived in  the Azeri capital Baku to discuss some political aspects of the  Karabakh settlement.    On Sunday, Russia's special envoy met Azeri President Heydar  Aliyev. During the meeting, he reported, in particular, about  the consultations held in Moscow earlier this week by head of  the CSCE Minsk group for Nagorno-Karabakh Jan Eliasson, who also  met with Vladimir Shumeyko, speaker of the Russian Parliament's  upper house and chairman of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly,  and Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin.  In the course of these meetings, the participants discussed  problems related to the Karabakh settlement.    Kazimirov stressed the need for pooling efforts of all  concerned parties in strenthening the regime of the cease-fire  agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. This issue is to be  considered at the forthcoming meeting in Vienna with the  participation of the conflicting sides and mediators. In  accordance with preliminary agreement with the Misnk group  chief, the meeting is scheduled for early July and thus will  coincide in time with a meeting of the CSCE Interparliamentary  Assembly. The Armenian and Azeri parliament chairmen are likely  to be invited to this meeting.    The Azeri president agreed that the pooling of efforts by  the  conflicting parties, and CSCE, Russian and CIS mediators, as  well as of neighbouring countries was critical to the  peace-making process. He believes that to achieve a durable  peace in the region, it is necessary to liberate the occupied  Azeri lands, to create conditions for refugees to return to  places of their permanent residence, to restore communications  between the two warring republics and to provide security  guarantees for ethnic Armenians living in the Nagorno-Karabakh  enclave.    For this purpose, Aliyev stressed, "we are ready to work in  close contact with the CSCE, Russia and other mediators". He  also assured Kazimirov that "Azerbaijan is not seeking to use  the respite in hostilities for developing muscles, inventing  accusations of the other side, conducting politcal manoeuvres  and fuelling a propaganda campaign".    After his consultations in Baku, Kazimirov is planning to  visit the Armenian capital, according to some sources. He is  expected to leave for Yerevan on Sunday night or on Monday  morning, the same sources reported.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE WON'T MOVE TOSHIMA MURDER TRIAL  </P> <P> The murder trial of the man charged in the Westwood slaying of Karen Toshima  began Monday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Albracht denying a  defense bid to move the trial somewhere else.  </P> <P> After reviewing newspaper clipings and videotaped accounts of television  coverage, Albracht, who is presiding over the case in Santa Monica, ruled  against the defense request for a change of venue, calling news coverage of the  case "most routine." The coverage should not prevent court from finding an  unbiased jury, he said.  </P> <P> There is "nothing unique about this case," Albracht said, citing other  high-profile cases that have been tried in Los Angeles County, including the  Night Stalker and Charles Manson murder trials.  </P> <P> Paul Takakjian, attorney for defendant Durrell D. Collins, 23, had argued that  publicity surrounding this case was so great, long-lasting and divisive --  pitting South-Central Los Angeles residents against the rest of the city --  that jurors might feel compelled to convict Collins to "smooth over" the  problem.  </P> <P> Testimony is expected to begin this week.  </P></p>

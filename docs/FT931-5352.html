			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Lawyer jailed for seven years A LAWYER who used 'a mire of deception' to plunder clients' accounts and cheat financial institutions of Pounds 4.7m was jailed for a total of seven years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday. Mr Mark Wyeth, prosecuting, said Mr Philip Englefield, 49, of Knightsbridge, west London, had joined the 142-year-old west London firm of Boyce, Evans and Sheppard 32 years ago, eventually becoming a senior partner. Mr Wyeth said Mr Englefield had stolen or misappropriated money from clients, lending to fund speculative property ventures. 'He lied to his clients and misled his fellow partners.' Mr Englefield admitted 10 charges involving theft, false accounting and procuring the execution of valuable securities. His activities were uncovered when the firm computerised its clients' accounts. Mr Englefield was now bankrupt and had been struck off by the Law Society, the court heard. The firm's reputation had suffered, said Mr Wyeth, and it had lost a lot of business. It had changed name, moved to cheaper premises and shed three quarters of its staff. He added that as a result of Mr Englefield's criminal activities and alleged separate frauds by another of the firm's partners, claims totalling Pounds 18m had been filed with the Solicitors' Indemnity Fund and Pounds 2m had been paid in settlements.</p>

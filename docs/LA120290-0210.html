			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOW DOWN PAYMENT  </P> <P> Bruss' article with its get-rich-quick overtone is great. However, the eagle  has landed (i.e. nationwide real estate recession).  </P> <P> Whatever happened to the free and clear American dream? Your article and  millions of people who believe in this theory are now the new co-stars of  1990's "American Nightmare."  </P> <P> Bruss states, "home buyers should avoid personal liability on their mortgage,  just in case property values decline." Brilliant! JAMES D. LEUR  </P> <P> Avalon  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARIEL IN LIFE AND DEATH;  </P> <P> BITTER FAME A LIFE OF SYLVIA PLATH BY ANNE STEVENSON (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $19.95;  384 PP.)  </P> <P> To write the life of the poet Sylvia Plath in any form other than a  "pathography," to use Joyce Carol Oates' apt word, may well be impossible. In  the 26 years since her suicide, the circumstances surrounding her death by  carbon monoxide poisoning -- together with the youthful breakdown anatomized in  her autobiographical novel, "The Bell Jar," and the ferocity of her poems,  especially those in "Ariel" -- have fueled the imaginations and sympathies of a  broad readership. She and her fellow poets, Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell, have  formed in the minds of many an unholy trinity whose lives attest to the truth  of the superstition -- at least as old as Plato -- that madness and poetry  cannot be disentangled. For readers who, for a variety of reasons, believe  passionately in this fusion, pathography is apt to slide into patholatry.  </P> <P> To her credit, Anne Stevenson, in "Bitter Fame: A Life of Sylvia Plath," avoids  such slippage. Plainly, she admires Plath's work. Plainly, too, she understands  that mental anguish contributed to Plath's artistic productivity, especially  the "astonishing blaze of creative power" in which she wrote her last poems.  But she does not propose either that Plath's poetry caused her madness or that  her madness created her poetry. Nor does she make the ethically even more  dubious suggestion that the unquestionable brilliance of the poems redeems  their grisly price.  </P> <P> The outlines of Plath's life suggest nothing of the turmoil and torment she  felt in it. The first of two children born to middle-class parents of German  background, she grew up in Massachusetts, was an honor student in high school  and at Smith College, and then attended Cambridge University on a Fulbright  grant. There she met and married another promising poet, Ted Hughes. After a  couple of years in the United States, one of which Plath spent teaching at  Smith, they settled permanently in England, where their two children were born.  The satisfaction these circumstances might have brought, however, was  repeatedly undercut: by her father's death when she was 8; by attempted suicide  and four months of treatment in a mental hospital while she was in college; by  her husband's faithlessness, both imagined and real, which caused her to end  their marriage; and finally by her suicide on Feb. 11, 1963.  </P> <P> In trying to account for an ending one can only perceive as tragic, Stevenson  has chosen to read Plath's life in conventional psychological terms, although  her "diagnosis" remains murky. Repeated references to "divided being" recall R.  D. Laing's work on schizophrenia, but just as often she mentions "depressed"  and "manic" extremes, suggesting bipolar depression, a diagnosis apparently  supported by the doctor who was treating Plath when she ended her life.  Stevenson makes this bipolarity her controlling metaphor. As early as high  school, "Sylvia had a rare, infectious capacity for exultation -- as great a  gift for rapture as she had for misery." Indeed, in Stevenson's view, there  were two Sylvia Plaths: "the outer Sylvia, characterized by Robert Lowell as 'a  brilliant tense presence, embarrassed by restraint,' and the inner woman,  fraught with fears and aggressions." And although at one point Stevenson claims  that "the writer was beginning to identify with the woman, the woman with the  writer; there could be no true distinction between them," her later evaluation  is more sinister: that Plath had projected "the 'desired image' (the required  image) of herself as Eve -- wife, mother, homemaker, protector of the  wholesome, the good, and the holy, an identity that both her upbringing and her  own instinctive physical being had fiercely aspired to. Now her submerged and  subversive self, utterly true to itself, utterly detached, completely the  artist, turned on the Eve scenario and judged it a deception." This second  self, which Stevenson labels "the real one, the poet," is not merely  distinguishable from the woman but actively writing poems "bereft of all normal  'human' feeling."  </P> <P> The portrait that emerges through Stevenson's words -- of a woman driven by  ambition, intolerant of frailties in herself or anyone else, wholly  self-absorbed and equally self-righteous -- is not attractive. But neither is  it unsympathetic or unappreciative. In her able reading of Plath's poems, in  particular, Stevenson -- herself a poet -- reveals her awareness of Plath's  unique and stunning gifts. In places, indeed, she seems willing to permit  Plath's mental fragility to excuse the ethical questionableness of some of her  work, for example, the use of Nazi imagery in her best-known poem, "Daddy."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Stevenson's approach may well incur the reproval of the audience  most instrumental in keeping Plath's work alive. Some feminists, working  largely from Plath's own testimony, have interpreted her experience as a pure  redaction of female victimization: The woman poet immured against her will and  self-interests in marriage and motherhood by the husband who systematically  undermined and overshadowed her. Stevenson's attempts to sketch the strengths  as well as the weaknesses of the relationship -- and especially such statements  as: "It was Ted who persuaded Sylvia to be true to her gift rather than to her  ambition" -- will likely infuriate the Ted-bashers.  </P> <P> I, too, am a feminist, but I am less troubled by this biography's attempts, not  always realized, to be thorough and fair than I am by its conventionality.  Familiarity with feminist and biographical theory might have led Stevenson to a  more sophisticated and nuanced reading of this troubled and troubling life. The  memoirs by three of Plath's friends, which occupy about 50 pages of appendixes,  add little because Stevenson has already quoted their most relevant passages at  length. More accessible notes and a substantial index would have been more  useful. Clearly, however, "Bitter Fame" is not aimed primarily at scholars of  modern poetry. As an introduction to the life and work of a poet of unsurpassed  originality and intensity, it serves the general reader well.  </P></p>

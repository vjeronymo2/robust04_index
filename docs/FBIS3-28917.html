			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of the "Toron" program with </F> Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura; Nobuyuki Sekiyama of  the Social Democratic Party of Japan; Kozo Watanabe of  Shinseito, Japan Renewal Party; Hiroyuki Sonoda of Sakigake,  Harbinger; Masajuro Shiokawa of the Liberal Democratic Party,  LDP; Kabun Muto of the LDP; and Hiroshi Kikunami of the Japan  Communist Party; moderated by NHK commentators Takashi Yamamoto  and Takanobu Fujita]    [Excerpts] [Yamamoto] The Japan-U.S. summit talks ended  with an unusual result of a breakup between the two leaders. I  would like to address my first question to the chief cabinet  secretary on the government's future course of action. Mr.  Takemura, the summit could not work out even a joint communique.  What is your comment on the summit results?    [Takemura] It is true that the result was unusual compared  with those of Japan-U.S. negotiations in the past. While the  result is called a breakup or a failure, the two leaders  sincerely discussed Asian affairs and the North Korean  situation. Also in the framework talks, the two leaders reached  accord on such global topics as population, AIDS, and  environment issues. To be exact, the two nations did not reach  accord in four fields -- government procurement, insurance,  auto, and auto parts. When the prime minister left for  Washington, we confirmed with him that Japan could not accept  the numerical targets, and he told us that he would do his best  on that point. As a result, the United States did not give this  up too, and, as you know, the summit ended like that. In a way,  this was the first time Japan maintained its consistency at the  talks with the United States. But I do not think all Japan has  to do is to say no to the U.S. demand. This is because both  Japan and the United States are responsible for results of  saying no to each other. While it is impossible for Japan to  accept the numerical targets, it is still responsible for  redressing its huge trade surplus through liberalizing and  expanding its own markets. From the standpoint that bilateral  relations with the United States are very important, Japan  should exert sincere efforts on the basis of the summit results.    [Yamamoto] As you noted, the numerical target issue had been  a clear point of contention between the two nations. Did you  expect such results in advance?    [Takemura] Well, Japan has sincerely been explaining its  position to the United States. Unfortunately, however, we could  not agree on that point. In the past, the two nations have  reached many bilateral agreements, including the semiconductor  accord, and we thought we can work out a similar concession  plan. Yet, Japan and the United States are nations of market  economy and enjoy the free market system. So, it seems wrong  for the government to set up detailed target figures for the  private sector and exercise public control over the market.  Since the Hosokawa administration is currently pursuing the  deregulation policy to further liberalize the market, we had to  refuse the U.S. proposal at any rate. [passage omitted on  Yamamoto's question to Muto on how he conducted negotiations  with the United States when he was the minister of international  trade and industry and Muto's response]    [Yamamoto] While you said Japan had to refuse the U.S.  proposal, the U.S. Congress has already begun to demand economic  sanctions against Japan in response to the failure in the  summit. What do you think about it?    [Takemura] I have heard that possibilities of economic  sanctions were not discussed at talks between the prime minister  and Mr. Clinton. But I think it is natural that some quarters  in the Congress and public of the United States would show such  reactions. But the two nations are in accord on the point that  they have to maintain the important relations. I hope the  United States takes prudent and reasonable attitude, and stays  away from unilateral measures.    [Yamamoto] Please excuse me for asking a hypothetical  question. What would the government do if the United States  imposes economic sanctions against Japan over the economic talks?    [Takemura] We hope that will not happen. It is hard to  answer questions based on supposition, but, during the Uruguay  Round last year, GATT decided to provide some sort of mechanism  to handle international trade disputes. I think that is a  possible way Japan may take.    [Fujita] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, don't you think the  breakup will have some negative impact on the friendly  relationship between Japan and the United States? It seems to  me that the United States has some sort of distrust of Japan and  thinks that it is not making progress in liberalizing market  even after discussions. What do you think of this point?    [Takemura] I do not think Japan's demands on the numerical  targets were wrong. To the United States, the huge amount of  deficit, which amounts to over $130 billion, in trade with Japan  is continuing to grow. Actually, it is gradually decreasing.  However, the United States thinks that Japan is not making  concrete efforts to reduce this deficit although more than 30  accords have been signed. Mr. Clinton is also feeling that no  progress has been made at all. It seems that he has a strong  distrust of Japan because the outcome of Japan's efforts in  liberalizing its market and expanding its domestic demands to  the expectation of the United States are still invisible. We  have to understand this point. Deregulation, which will be  linked to import promotion, is also an important issue to the  Hosokawa administration. At the same time, we also need to  narrow the price differences at home and abroad. Also, we have  to voluntarily do our best to expand the market access no matter  whether the United States calls for it or not. By doing that,  we need to make the United States understand that Japan is  seriously thinking about these matters as a whole.    [Fujita] Looking back at the past, I think it was a mistake  that we agreed last July to set up objective criteria. That was  the beginning of the failure. Don't you think we should have  clarified what the objective criteria were at least?    [Takemura] Some people may think that way. However, we have  had a long debate over the issue of what we meant by objective  criteria. Objective criteria can be based on the figures for  the past or figures for future targets. During the debate, we  mixed up these figures and were unable to understand each other.    [Yamamoto] As for the future, both countries agreed to  resume the economic talks after cooling off their heads for a  while. When do you think the economic talks will resume?    [Takemura] We do not have a concrete plan as yet. The  government will discuss this issue after the prime minister and  the foreign minister return. Roughly speaking, however, the  talks will be held for two years at the rate of twice a year.  We already had an interim meeting this year. It is possible  that we may have the second meeting, which will be held when the  next G-7 summit opens in Naples in July, to discuss this issue.  There are about five months between now and then. During this  period, we will cool off our heads. There is no point in merely  thinking about it without any actions. Therefore, I think we  have to take due actions.    [Yamamoto] Prime Minister Hosokawa called the Japan-U.S.  relations a mature adult relationship. However, what do you  think the Japan-U.S. relations will be like in the future?    [Takemura] As the prime minister said, I think the  Japan-U.S. relations will enter into a mature adult  relationship, too. However, it is not an easy matter. Japan  will be expected to demonstrate its independence in the  diplomatic world. It will be entering a severe diplomatic  stage. We have to promote true Japanese diplomacy or diplomacy  in which we can maintain our independence.    [Yamamoto] Indeed, some people are already pointing out that  it is a bit too optimistic to think that we established a mature  adult relationship. We should expect to see a very severe  situation. What do you think?    [Takemura] We need to see things in terms of overall  politics and take the security issue into consideration. It  would be nice if we have a mature adult relationship in every  respect. We need to say things we want to say while having  mutual understanding of each other's position. We just cannot  have a reasonable argument on the basis of a race feeling  [minzoku kanjo] or national awareness.    [Yamamoto] Earlier, we talked about the possibility that the  United States may impose sanctions against Japan. Some people  are worried that the Japan-U.S. relations may become very tense  and suffer setbacks.    [Takemura] I do not think so. We should absolutely not  allow these things to take place. To Japan, the United States  is the most important country in every respect. Japan's  fundamental diplomacy in the postwar era has been to maintain  good relations with the United States. All political parties in  Japan accept that. We should never change this fundamental  diplomacy.    [Fujita] Do you think the Japan-U.S. negotiations will be  resumed in the same style as the current framework talks? Or,  do you think completely new framework talks will start?    [Takemura] This matter was left as a pending issue. Even  though we are going to have a cooling-off period, I think both  sides have to take some kind of actions at certain point.    [Yamamoto] Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary, we have to stop our  discussion here because it is time for you to go to another  place. Thank you very much for being with us.    [Takemura] Thank you very much.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, April 4 -- On Monday [4 April]  oppositionist factions of the parliament proposed to form a  committee to investigate the incident over the second-biggest  Estonian daily RAHVA HAAL that has lasted for two weeks already,  leading to the situation where the former staff of RAHVA HAAL is  denied access to staff rooms.    Rural Party faction and Coalition Party faction bill  prescribes formation of a committee, the members of which would  be appointed by parliament factions and which would have to  clarify how the activities of the board of RAS Rahva Haal, that  issues the daily, have limited freedom of press and how much  financial damage has been caused to the state by this.    The Centrist faction presented another bill according to  which a temporary committee be formed to solve the incident over  RAHVA HAAL. The bill proposes to stop the activities of the  board of RAHVA HAAL till the end of investigation, abolish  contracts with AS Hommikuleht and demand that the latter return  money paid to them by the state.    Turmoil over the daily started already in May last year when  Estonian Privatization Agency decided to privatize the  state-owned newspaper. Head of the Privatization Agency Liia  Hanni has admitted later that in the course of the  privatization, the result of which is, that two applicants, one  of them AS Hommikuleht, to the daily gave the matter to the  court, the Agency acted in disagreement with existing laws. At  present the matter has reached the Supreme Court and the  privatization of the daily has been stopped.    In October last year the board of the daily was changed with  majority given to representatives of the government coalition.  On March 18, the board adopted a decision to change the  statutes of the company, abolishing the institution of  editor-in-chief and creating a new institution of  publisher-in-chief. Majority of the staff of the paper, in  protest to the decision, resigned and decided to join AS RH,  formed by the RAHVA HAAL staff last year to participate at the  privatization. Editor-in-chief Toomas Leito was dismissed by  the board "for loss of trust" and not preserving political  balance of the paper. Toomas Leito told ETA that the decisions  of the board of RAS Rahva Haal had been of "purely political"  nature.    After the staff of RAHVA HAAL had left to AS RH, they  started  to publish their own paper EESTI SONUMID. RAHVA HAAL was  published by RAS Rahva Haal in cooperation with AS HOMMIKULEHT,  another Estonian daily.    On Monday, Estonian Ministry of Culture and Education sent a  letter to the managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja that  administers the Tallinn Press Building where most of the biggest  newspapers are located, demanding that in 24 hours "outsiders"  (meaning the former staff) leave the 5th floor rooms rented to  RAS Rahva Haal.    Managing editor of EESTI SONUMID Tiit Lehiste told ETA that  from Monday morning EESTI SONUMID staff has not been let into  their rooms in the 5th floor, with security guarding the door.  The staff was let into the rooms only in pairs to fetch their  private things. Also phones were switched off and door locks  changed.    Chairman of the board of AS RH Ester Sank told ETA that on  Thursday, before the Easter holidays, AS RH had had an agreement  with the chairman of the board of RAS Rahva Haal Veiko Jurisson  according to which half of the rooms on the 5th floor could be  kept by AS RH till April 21. The decision was for some reason  changed during the holidays, she said.    Monday evening, managing director of AS Ajakirjandusmaja  Juri  Kriisemann told ETA that an agreement has been reached with two  companies that they would temporarily, for about one month, give  up their rooms at the Press Building in favor of AS RH, a  decision that has also been accepted by Ministry of Culture and  Education.    EESTI SONUMID has sent a letter to Riigikogu [parliament]  introducing the situation and asking MPs' position and support  in the matter in order the conflict not to reach an incident  with tragic results. The letters says that in Estonia  "precedent has been created where a civil dispute is solved with  force with the support of the executive authorities", calling it  "states violence with political colouring".    Estonian Press Complaints Board discussed the problems  around  RAHVA HAAL/EESTI SONUMID, on Monday, and made a statement saying  that the state as the owner of RAHVA HAAL "has not acted in  accordance with state of justice norms of the end of 20th  century", and what has taken place in relation to the staff of  the paper was to be considered as "limitation of the freedom of  press".    RAHVA HAAL is the biggest daily distributed all over Estonia  that belongs to the state. Its circulation is 47.6 thousand at  week-days and 50 thousand at Saturdays. EESTI SONUMID,  according to their own data, have reached almost the same.</p>

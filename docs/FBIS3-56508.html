			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Morteza Bank, head of the Eastern Europe and CIS  Department at the Iranian Foreign Ministry, said in a news  conference at the Iranian Embassy on 13 January that the  developments taking place in the region naturally have a serious  affect on the relations between our two countries. The search  for ways to settle the Karabakh problem, which is one of the  important regional problems, is the reason for my visit to  Armenia, Bank said.    Asked by an ARMENPRES correspondent if a new Iranian-Russian  mediation initiative could be expected following his visit that  came in the aftermath of the recent visit to Iran and Azerbaijan  by Russian Special Ambassador Kazimirov, Morteza Bank said:  Naturally, the countries in the region could play a big part in  the solution of that problem. Iran and Russia, which are the  largest countries in the region, could engage in effective  activity both with a separate and a joint initiative. Mr.  Kazimirov's visit pursued such an aim. We have agreed to  cooperate and positive developments have already taken place.  Of course, this does not mean that our activity would not be  coordinated with the efforts of the CSCE. I think that there  are reasons for optimism that the will to attain peace is  gaining ground.    In touching upon Armenian-Iranian economic and cultural  relations, Bank noted that they are underlined by the principles  and traditions of mutual interest, good-neigborliness, and  centuries old friendship between the two countries, and these  ties should develop normally.</p>

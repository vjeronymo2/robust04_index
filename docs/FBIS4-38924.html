			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Karen Baburyan, acting chairman of the </F> Karabakh parliament, by Emmanuil Mkrtchyan, ROSSIYA  correspondent; place and date not given: "Karabakh Needs  Guarantees"]    [Text] [Begin bold]In June of last year, the leadership of  Nagorno-Karabakh confirmed its agreement to participate in the  process of a peaceful settlement of the conflict within the  framework of the Minsk group of the CSCE. The current acting  chairman of the Karabakh parliament, 30-year-old Karen Baburyan,  signed the document. Our correspondent met with him in  Stepanakert the other day.[end bold]    [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, you are one of the leaders of the  Nagorno-Karabakh republic, which is still not recognized by the  world community. Is it possible, in your opinion, to consider  Karabakh an independent state in a full sense.    [Baburyan] You know, by right our republic has come halfway  to being a state, for international organizations are already  taking us into account, and they do not make one decision  without our participation. And we do not intend to depart from  this state of affairs under any conditions. It is important  that Nagorno-Karabakh be recognized by the international  community as a party in the conflict.    You see in my office the main attributes of our independent  statehood. In front of you is the state flag and the seal of  the Nagorno-Karabakh republic. We have our own constitutional  law, democratically elected higher organs of legislative  authority, administrations, and a defense-capable army that  performs as a guarantor of the security of our people.    [Mkrtchyan] The process of a peaceful settlement of the  Karabakh conflict, after the refusal of the Azerbaijani side to  adopt the peaceful plans proposed by the CSCE and Russia, has  come to an impasse. What dictates such an irreconcilable  position of the Azerbaijani leadership?    [Baburyan] The opportunism of the authorities. The  Azerbaijani leaders, succeeding one another, tried to strengthen  their positions and to demonstrate to political opponents their  ability to resolve the Karabakh problem by military means.    The NKR [Nagorno-Karabakh Republic] leadership adheres to  the  opinion concerning the need to bring the Russian settlement plan  and the CSCE plan together. These initiatives differ little  from each other in principle. However, the Russian plan has the  advantage that it contains a mechanism for not renewing military  operations, and it proposes the introduction of peacekeeping  forces into the region.    [Mkrtchyan] But why is Azerbaijan refusing military  disengagement with the help of mediators?    [Baburyan] The leader of that republic who succeeds in  achieving a military preponderance will be guaranteed a high  political rating. In addition, the current leadership of  Azerbaijan needs not only to strengthen its superiority over the  opposition, but also to establish itself in mutual relations  with Turkey, which is not concealing its urge to help Azerbaijan  resolve the question by forceful methods.    Incidentally, I do not understand when it is said that  Armenia is involved in the conflict, but Turkey is not. I think  that if the signatures of representatives of the NKR and Armenia  should appear on some kind of official document, then Turkey's  signature should stand right next to Azerbaijan's signature. We  in Karabakh possess a mass of evidence that citizens of Turkey  are fighting on the side of Azerbaijan.    [Mkrtchyan] How do you assess the position of Russia in the  region, and how pragmatic is it?    [Baburyan] Unfortunately, a clearly formulated Russian  foreign policy has not existed for some time. I think that  without its traditional geopolitical interests Russia will not  be a power. These interests also apply to Nagorno-Karabakh,  which was historically closely tied to Russia by hundreds of  threads. Russia was always present in this zone, and she should  not be indifferent to everything that is happening in the  region. And, therefore, it is quite natural that Russia began  to perform more actively as a peacekeeping force. The plan for  the deployment of disengagement forces proposed by it is fully  supported by the Karabakh leadership. However, the problem of  the deployment of military contingents encounters the need to  resolve a number of tasks; for example, purely financial.  Incidentally, it is for this reason also that the NKR  leadership is coming out in favor of combining the Russian plan  and the CSCE plan, so that Russia would receive an international  mandate to carry out a peacekeeping mission.    [Mkrtchyan] Mr. Baburyan, what do you see as the resolution  of the problem?    [Baburyan] It is necessary to look further for compromise  variants and to stop talking in the form of an ultimatum. We,  the leaders of the NKR, were always for this. We have one  principal condition--we must be assured real guarantees for the  security of our people. The most effective way of achieving  this, as I have already said, is the introduction of  peacekeeping forces into the region.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness active on placing Turnover in spirits group Guinness jumped to a hefty 146m, probably a record but certainly the highest total for a single day's trading in the stock for 7 years, after French luxury products group LVMH carried out its long anticipated move to reduce its 24 per cent stake in Guinness by 4 per cent. The sale carried out in the form of a bought deal was executed by UBS which placed 72m shares at 457p, at a 2.5 per cent discount to the market, with a variety of institutions. The placing was said to have taken around an hour and the securities house is believed to have taken a turn of 4 1/4 p on the deal to earn around Pounds 3m. It was thought to be one of the biggest ever bought deals carried out by a single house. This is the second time this month that UBS has executed a sizeable deal having placed 78m new shares in Forte two weeks earlier. Shares in Guinness relinquished 2 to end at 466p, while a two way pull in hotels group Forte left the shares 1 1/2 lighter at 232 1/2 p.</p>

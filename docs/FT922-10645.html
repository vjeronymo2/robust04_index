			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Electric invests in new-tech phone service YORKSHIRE Electric, the privatised regional electricity group, is one of several new investors in Ionica, a private company planning a new national telephone service. Ionica aims to provide a service by putting telephone aerials on roofs and linking them to the exchange by radio. It hopes to undercut the traditional wire-line service provided by BT, the UK's largest telecommunications group. Mr Nigel Playford, Ionica's managing director, said the equity supplied by new investors was a 'significant' step in the company's establishment, but refused to say how much had been raised. Yorkshire was similarly circumspect, saying simply that it had taken a 'modest' stake. Other investors include Ivory &amp; Sime and Robert Fleming Investment Trust, the financial institutions, and investors introduced by Fox-Pitt, Kelton, the Anglo-American banking specialists. Mr Playford said Yorkshire Electric would co-operate in setting up Ionica's service as well as providing funds. Mr Playford said he expected to announce a second 'industrial' partner in about two months, and that there would be further rounds of financing. Ionica has also been talking to Mercury Communications, BT's main rival, about linking up with Mercury's long-distance network. Ionica has already received telecommunications and radio licences from the government.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (40 U.S.C. chapter 35), the information collection requirements contained in the Plan have previously been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and assigned OMB number 0581&hyph;0093, except for the Board nominee background statement form which is assigned OMB number 0505&hyph;0001. This action adds no additional reporting burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Plan, the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board) administers a nationally coordinated program of research, development, advertising, and promotion designed to strengthen the watermelon's position in the market place and to establish, maintain, and expand markets for domestic watermelons. This program is financed by assessments on all producers, except those persons engaged in the growing of less than five acres of watermelons, and handlers of watermelons. The Plan specifies that handlers are responsible for collecting and submitting both the producer and handler assessments to the Board, reporting their handling of watermelons, and maintaining records necessary to verify their reportings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership on the Board is determined on the basis of two producers and two handlers for each of seven districts established under the Plan. The districts are required to have approximately equal annual production volume. The initial (and current) districts were based on a three-year average production derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Crop Production Annual Summary Reports for 1979, 1980, and 1981.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These districts are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1_South Florida, including all areas south of State Highway 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2_North Florida, including all areas north of State Highway 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3_The States of Alabama and Georgia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4_The States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5_The States of Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6_The State of Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7_The States of Arizona, California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan provides that two years after its effective date (June 8, 1989) and at least every five years thereafter, the Board should review the districts to determine whether realignment of districts is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When making such reviews, the Plan specifies that the Board should consider such factors as the most recent three-year USDA production reports or Board assessment reports, if USDA production reports are unavailable, shifts and trends in quantities of watermelons produced, and any other relevant factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Plan further specifies that, as a result of such reviews, the Board may realign the districts subject to the approval of the Secretary. Any such alignment should be recommended by the Board at least six months prior to the date of the call for nominations and should become effective at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days prior to such date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the Plan, the Board appointed a subcommittee to review production and assessment collections in the current districts. During the review, the subcommittee used USDA and State production and marketing reports, as well as data derived from Board assessment reports and field notes. The subcommittee focused on information collected between 1990 and 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing the available information, the subcommittee recommended that the boundaries of Districts 3 through 7 be changed and that Districts 1 and 2 remain unchanged. In order for each district to represent approximately 3 million hundredweights of annual watermelon production, the subcommittee's recommendation would: move Mississippi from District 5 to District 3; move Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee from District 5 to District 4; move Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and California north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernadino counties from District 7 to District 5; move Arkansas and Louisiana from District 5 to District 6; and move New Mexico from District 5 to District 7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subcommittee's recommendation was approved by the Board's executive committee, and the full Board voted by mail ballot. In the mail ballot, 19 members voted ``yes,'' 4 members voted ``no,'' and 5 members did not return a ballot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this proposal would realign the districts as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1_South Florida, including all areas south of State Highway 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2_North Florida, including all areas north of State Highway 50.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3_The States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4_The States of Connecticut, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, and West Virginia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5_The States of California_north of San Luis Obispo, Kern, and San Bernardino counties, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6_The States of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

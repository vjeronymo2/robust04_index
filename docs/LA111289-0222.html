			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1ST-STAGE SMOG ALERT TARNISHES A SUMMERY DAY  </P> <P> Temperatures rose into the 80s across Orange County on Saturday and many  residents turned the November day into a reprise of summer, but the sunshine  was marred by murky air that prompted authorities to declare a first-stage smog  alert.  </P> <P> As some residents cooled their toes by returning to the beach, the mercury  topped out at 81 degrees in Santa Ana, but weather officials said today and  Monday may be a bit cooler.  </P> <P> Bill Hibbert, a meteorologist with Weather Data Inc., said a bulge of high  pressure over the desert that has sent mild Santa Ana winds whirling into  Orange County in recent days was beginning to break up, ushering in sea breezes  that should cool the region.  </P> <P> Night and morning low clouds will combine with hazy sunshine in the afternoon  today, with temperatures along the coast expected to be between 65 and 75  degrees and into the low 80s inland, Hibbert said.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District declared a first-stage smog  alert Saturday morning for central Orange County after the area's Pollutant  Standards Index level reached 207. The district issues first-stage smog alerts  when PSI levels are from 200 to 275.  </P> <P> Saturday's air quality improved slightly in the afternoon when the alert was  downgraded to "unhealthy" conditions after the PSI went down to 160. The Santa  Ana winds probably contributed to Saturday's air problems, said Thomas  Eichhorn, a district spokesman.  </P> <P> The index measures the amount of carbon monoxide, ozone or nitrogen dioxide in  the air, Eichhorn said, noting that authorities recommend people stay indoors  and refrain from heavy exercise during periods of unhealthful air quality.  </P></p>

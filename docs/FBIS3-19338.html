			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jean Quatremer: "France, Seeming To Pull Back </F> From the Union"]    [Text] Brussels (European Union) -- Is there a pilot at  the controls of France's European policy? Judging by the way in  which it is managing the expansion of the European Union [EU],  there is reason to doubt it. While the Twelve have been in  confrontation for several weeks -- the discussions are resuming  in Brussels today -- on the balance of power within a Union of  15 or 16 states, France has remained strangely withdrawn. It is  only saying that it wants to ensure that the decisionmaking  process within the Council of Ministers is not made more  difficult by the membership of Austria, Finland, and Sweden and,  if the negotiations are successful, Norway. In the context of  expansion, what is at stake is the Union's institutions and  hence "Europe's capacity to make effective decisions and be a  power," as someone close to the Elysee [presidential office]  remarked. However: "We do not know what is desired," the  diplomats responsible for implementing France's European policy  say almost unanimously. Does it want a more federal Europe? A  Europe with variable geometry? A Europe welcoming all the  countries of Eastern Europe? Or a diluted Europe without any  real capacity for initiative?    France which, just a short time ago, set the tone for  European construction together with Germany, seems to have  abdicated in favor of Bonn and London, which have made an  unambiguous choice in favor of expansion even if it is at the  expense of the deepening of the Union. "It is difficult to  discern France's ambition, its grand design," a Benelux diplomat  noted with despair. "We have the impression that it is trying  to reap short-term successes, which are considerable but  isolated, like GATT or the former Yugoslavia."    This French "absence" is due to several factors. First, it  is clear that "these short-term successes were achieved at the  expense of fundamental concessions," a senior French official  asserted. The Germans are now demanding the price of their  support during the monetary crises or in the Uruguay Round  negotiations. Second, "it is as if the ratification of  Maastricht had not been overcome," one diplomat said.    Finally, the 1995 presidential election makes any overly  clear assertion of a European policy potentially explosive both  within the Majority and between the Elysee and the Hotel  Matignon [prime minister's office]. Last fall's episode is  revealing in this respect. Alain Juppe, the head of French  diplomacy, being aware of the dangers of expansion without  deepening, had suggested to his European partners a revival of  the institutional debate. But, without warning anybody,  Francois Mitterrand, on an official visit to Vienna on 7  October, ruled out any reform. "This situation is likely to tip  France into the British camp -- blocking for fear of moving," a  Benelux diplomat said with regret. Here too, virtually the same  situation is found in the vast majority of EU countries  (especially Germany, Britain, and Italy) where politically  weakened governments form a veritable "assembly of cripples," to  cite one diplomat.    The French paralysis also stems from the weakness of the  Franco-German axis. The German Government, in the throes of a  difficult election year, is playing its own game within the  Union: Expansion is one indication of this, but so is the German  ambiguity on Economic and Monetary Union. However, as  Jean-Louis Bourlanges, a French European deputy (European  People's Party-Union for French Democracy), remarks, "there can  be no vision of Europe without a fundamental agreement between  the French and Germans."    In short, this French refusal to make choices, whatever good  reasons are invoked, is bound to accentuate the "swing in the  British direction," in other words the Union's march toward a  simple free trade area without any capacity for action. Unless  of course some people, especially in Paris, find that this  serves their purpose?</p>

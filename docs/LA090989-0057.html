			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTHROP IN MORE TROUBLE IN DISPUTE OVER MX TESTING DEVICE  </P> <P> Northrop is under federal investigation for having built a $1.2-million machine  to test a key component of the MX missile guidance system and for billing the  government for the expense even though the Air Force had not given prior  authorization for the equipment, congressional sources said Friday.  </P> <P> The allegations are the focus of both criminal and civil investigations being  conducted by the Justice Department in connection with a broader probe of  Northrop's activities in the MX missile guidance program, the sources said.  </P> <P> Northrop sought approval from the Air Force to build the machine in September,  1985, well after it had completed and begun to use it, according to documents  obtained by The Times. Northrop billed the government for the machine before  the authorization was sought, sources said.  </P> <P> Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio declined to comment on the investigation but  said the company was "authorized to build (the machine) under our contracts,  and the equipment was built with government knowledge."  </P> <P> The machine, known as a dry integration test station, was intended to assess  all parts of the guidance system component before it was fully assembled. The  guidance device, called an inertial measurement unit, is the size of a  basketball and is designed to float in a special fluid.  </P> <P> Northrop was supposed to be using a more advanced test machine that would  evaluate the guidance device as it floated in a test tank. But the firm had  fallen so far behind schedule in the development of the guidance system that  engineers felt they needed to build the dry integration test station to get the  program moving faster, the sources said.  </P> <P> The allegations under the criminal investigation are also part of a civil fraud  suit in which two former Northrop employees have alleged that the company used  fictitious companies to buy missile parts from unauthorized vendors.  </P> <P> The employees who brought the civil case, Jeff Kroll and Dave Peterson,  testified in congressional hearings in 1987 that Northrop had established a  number of fictitious businesses to buy parts for the MX missile. Northrop  turned to the fictitious businesses when its Pentagon-approved purchasing  system fell behind schedule and could not supply badly needed parts, according  to testimony.  </P> <P> The contract for the guidance system of the missile, which carries 10 nuclear  warheads, requires exact traceability of parts, and purchases of parts must be  made only from government-approved firms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Indictments Expected Soon  </P> <P> The Justice Department agreed Sept. 1 to join the civil case, according to  Herbert Hafif, a Claremont attorney who is handling a number of cases against  Northrop.  </P> <P> Hafif said he could not comment directly on the criminal case, but he issued a  statement that said the criminal investigation corroborates the civil probe  conducted by his firm. Phillip E. Benson, an attorney at the Hafif office, said  the Justice Department is seeking to keep the civil case under court seal. The  case was bought under the federal False Claims Act, which allows individuals to  sue on behalf of the government and permits the government to join such cases.  </P> <P> Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee, has been conducting a broad probe of Northrop's problems in the MX  and B-2 bomber programs.  </P> <P> Northrop and some of its executives could be indicted in the MX guidance system  case within as little as one month, congressional sources and Northrop  employees said.  </P> <P> "It seems like they are preparing employees for an indictment," a Northrop  employee said. "In the staff meetings throughout the company, they are telling  us that we are going to hear about some indictments, but not to worry about it.  They say it is just going to be a nuisance suit because the government has to  have something for all the time it spent on this suit."  </P> <P> Northrop and two executives were indicted earlier this year on criminal fraud  charges alleging that the company improperly tested the guidance system for a  nuclear-armed cruise missile, which was built by a Northrop division not  involved in the MX program.  </P> <P> The company had also been charged with civil fraud on the MX program, but the  Justice Department dropped those charges recently after it agreed to a  settlement with Northrop that provided for monetary restitution to the  government.  </P></p>

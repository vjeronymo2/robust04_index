			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GALA DRAWS ATTENTION TO LUPUS  </P> <P> Lupus sufferers got some much-needed recognition Tuesday night as the Lupus  Foundation of America honored Richard and Jeramie Dreyfuss with the first-ever  Summa award at the Beverly Hilton.  </P> <P> The black-tie gala honored the two for their work in raising awareness of the  disease and campaigning for research funding. Jeramie, who suffers from lupus,  husband Richard and daughter Emily, 6, were the focal point of a reception  preceding the dinner. Nancy Horn, president of the Lupus Foundation of America  and gala co-chairwoman, and gala chairwoman Glenda Kay Amon were on hand, as  were Paul Michael and Elizabeth Glaser, Michele Lee and Fred Rappaport, Theresa  Russell, Richard Donner and Lauren Shuler-Donner, John Lithgow and Alan Ladd  Jr. Amy Irving, who planned to appear, sent regrets; the actress had had a baby  just days before. Among the hundreds of other guests were several doctors  involved in lupus treatment and research, and many lupus patients.  </P> <P> Lupus, an auto-immune disease that has varying symptoms and can be  life-threatening, affects mostly women and can take years to diagnose. While it  affects hundreds of thousands of people, there is little public knowledge of  the disease -- something the Dreyfusses have tried to change.  </P> <P> In accepting the award, Richard Dreyfuss made an impassioned plea for social  responsibility and heaped praise upon his wife, saying: "I am a busy guy, but  I'm not as busy as Jeramie. I am a pretty good and decent guy, but not as good  and decent as Jeramie. But I am a better whiner. I don't live in pain as easily  as she does. I think we need more Jeramie Dreyfusses both in and out of  government."  </P> <P> As she wiped away tears, Jeramie added, "I've heard such incredible stories  tonight, it reminds me why I'm here. My goal is to spread the word about this  silent killer."  </P> <P> Little Richard got the audience literally on its feet as he played a rousing  set, culminating with duet with Elton John. The event, underwritten by two  anonymous donors, raised more than $500,000.  </P></p>

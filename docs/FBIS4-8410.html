			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jelena Dabarcic] </F>   [Excerpt] Muslim forces on the Gorazde front -- supported  by U.S. aircraft, which have not been engaged in fighting up to  the time of sending this report -- are attacking the positions  of the Serbian fighters, and are firing with all available  weapons. These Muslim infantry attacks have been repelled. The  Serbian army fighters are firmly holding their positions on the  right bank of the Drina River and are saying they will launch a  counterattack if the Muslims do not stop their attacks.    The Muslim forces have been noticed carrying out fresh  regrouping on the elevations of Gradina, Olujaca, and Trebecevo.  A high-ranking officer from the command of the Serbian army  told us that they had intercepted a radio message from the  Muslims that U.S. aircraft will attack Serbian territories again  today.    At the same time, the command of the Herzegovina Corps  confirmed that despite the constant lies by Muslim radio  [Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina], the Serbian units are not  in Gorazde, nor are the fighters of the Serbian army attacking  the town.    What was it like during the air attack by the U.S. aircraft?  You can hear this from the following conversation between my  colleague Milenko Draskovic with Ljubisa Borovcanin, deputy  commander of a unit at the front.    [Borovcanin] I must admit that I had the opportunity for the  first time to watch live how the U.S. Air Force supported the  Turks, whose spirits were raised, especially when they saw that  the U.S. aircraft were accurately pinpointing vehicles with Red  Cross markings. I do not know where they trained and whose  orders they were carrying out, but this was (?indeed) a morale  booster for us. We waited for the order from our command, we  were even ready to shoot at these aircraft. However, considering  that the army has its hierarchy, we did not want to act on our  own. I can convey you the feelings of the soldiers -- who were  not frightened, which is shown and confirmed by the fact that we  have retained the newly taken positions -- that next time the  air force is used, it will be met with fire, according to our  capabilities.    [Draskovic] According to what you know, since you are in  visual contact and listen to their radio stations, it appears  that they knew precisely when the attack was going to take place.    [Borovcanin] I can tell you that at the time when the  aircraft were coming, we were observing the town of Gorazde. I  personally was looking at it together with my fighters and my  commander, who was here before me on the front line. At the  time when the aircraft were overflying, a large number of  citizens of Gorazde came out in the streets with binoculars,  which clearly showed that they knew when the aircraft were going  to come. They wanted to watch a great miracle that did not  happen after all.    [Draskovic] You also intercepted a radio message?    [Borovcanin] We heard a conversation. We were threatened.  The Turks threatened us that at 1500 the Phantoms would wreak  havoc. It actually happened at 1445. So, this was a coordinated  attack.    [Draskovic] The moment when they starting shooting, when  they dropped the bombs, must have been horrific. What was it  like?    [Borovcanin] Believe me, it was not horrific. It looked  like a war game that we used to play on computer. We survived  it and so did the attackers, unfortunately. The question is  whether they will survive it next time.</p>

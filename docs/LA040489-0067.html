			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUCCESSFUL HEART TRANSPLANT ENDS PATIENT'S LONG WAIT  </P> <P> An excruciating wait and more than 50 days on a mechanical life-support system  ended for a young Costa Mesa man Sunday when doctors replaced his virus-damaged  heart in a successful transplant.  </P> <P> Raymond Smallcomb, 22, was recuperating Monday after surgery in which Sharp  Memorial Hospital doctors attached a donor heart taken from a Central  California man in his early 20s, according to Judy Coburn, transplant  coordinator at Sharp. Smallcomb's liver and kidneys were functioning normally  with the transplant, doctors said.  </P> <P> The new heart was in place and working by 3 a.m. Sunday, Coburn said. It had  earlier been flown to San Diego, packed in a sterile plastic bag and kept at 5  degrees Celsius in a saline solution in a cooler. It arrived at Lindbergh Field  just after 1 a.m.  </P> <P> A transplant team of doctors, nurses and assistants from Sharp flew to Central  California Saturday night to retrieve the heart with blood type O, Coburn said.  </P> <P> Smallcomb was alert Monday after the surgery that ended at 8:30 a.m. Sunday. He  had been up from his bed twice, said his father, Thomas Smallcomb, adding that  the transplant "was right, and we knew that it would eventually happen."  </P> <P> He said that, although his son was in some pain from the surgery, "he is doing  tremendous."  </P> <P> "The first thing he did is, we have this little sign language and squeezing  each other's hand means I love you. He squeezed my hand the hardest . . . he  has since he's been here."  </P> <P> Sunday's surgery marked the painful end of Smallcomb's dependance on an acute  ventricular assist device that had been pumping oxygen-rich blood in place of  his heart's left side, which had been devastated by an unknown virus. The same  virus has claimed the lives of his mother, a sister and seven other blood  relatives.  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Adams preaches to the unconverted In Northern Ireland megaphone diplomacy has often been blamed for exacerbating tensions between the two communities. Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, yesterday took the art one step further to try to reassure unionists that they have a role to play in the peace process, Speaking to a crowd of republican sympathisers at a rally on Belfast's predominantly Roman Catholic Falls Road, Mr Adams said he was turning up the loudspeakers so 'our people on the Shankill can hear'. Of all the groups mulling over the implications of last week's IRA 'cessation of military operations' the reaction of the people of the Shankill Road and other so-called 'loyalist' strongholds is vital if a political settlement is to be found. In Protestant ghettos such as Blackstaff, where unemployment is as high as 80 per cent according to local community leaders, there is deep scepticism. There is also a resentment that the republicans have not so much seized the opportunity for peace, but won a public relations victory. One man said: 'Why do the republicans have to be so cocky, marching in front of the RUC barracks and writing 'go home' on the wall. This isn't Berlin.' On the first Sunday after the ceasefire the churchgoing community was striving for a reconciliation. Catholics gathering in St Peter's Church near the infamous Divis Flats, one of the most blighted inner-city areas, heard Monsignor Thomas Toner warn that peace is 'not just the cessation of military operations. Peace is a process that only begins with the cessation of military operations'. Before the service he said: 'It's not going to be the catwalk that some people think it is. But if the peace brings jobs there can be a real regeneration. If those hopes are dashed there can be an awful depression.' Last night, amid renewed speculation that the Ulster Volunteer Force, the largest of the loyalist paramilitary organisations, may also be preparing for a ceasefire the mood in the city was one of expectation. Mr Tom Hartley, Sinn Fein general secretary, said as the rally rounded Springfield Road, site of numerous killings: 'There's uncertainty for them, but there's uncertainty for us too.' One Catholic pointed to people waving the Irish flag in front of a police station, a sight which a few years ago would have prompted a security clampdown. He said: 'People sometimes forget what the tricolour actually means. The green is for the republicans, the orange is the Protestants and the white is the open ground between us. We're not going to ram anything down their throats, but we're not going backwards, everything's changed now.'</p>

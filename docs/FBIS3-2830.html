			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Premier Zhu  Rongji today told China's Guizhou Province, a major producer of  cigarettes and liquor, to desist from blindly expanding the  production of cigarettes and liquor.    "Guizhou has two pillar industries, cigarettes and liquor,"  he said. "But we must have a new understanding and adopt new  approaches on this question. Their production should not be  blind. What counts is not large production capacity and a big  volume of output. The important thing is to improve factory  management and raise product quality to make what you produce  suit market demand."    Guizhou Province has its own advantages such as rich natural  resources and military technologies for its economic  development, he said.    Attending a group discussion by Guizhou deputies to the  National People's Congress now in session in the Chinese capital  this morning, Zhu asked Guizhou to proceed from its reality,  readjust its industrial structure according to market demand,  speed up the construction of communications facilities and work  in a down-to- earth manner.    Joining deputies of Jiangxi Province in a group discussion,  Zhu stressed the importance of agriculture, especially grain  production.</p>

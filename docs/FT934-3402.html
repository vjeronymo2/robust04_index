			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Cancer 'not high' in N-test veterans Servicemen who took part in British nuclear weapon tests in the South Pacific during the 1950s are not suffering an excess of cancer, says a study to be published tomorrow. The report by the National Radiological Protection Board and Imperial Cancer Research Fund is a follow-up to a controversial study of 22,000 bomb test veterans, published in 1988. It had found more leukaemia cases among men who had witnessed the open-air explosions than among a control group of servicemen who were not present, although overall death rates in the two groups were similar. The new study, supervised by Sir Richard Doll, concludes that the excess of leukaemia was a statistical artefact.</p>

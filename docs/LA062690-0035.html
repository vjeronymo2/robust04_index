			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> HER MOST IMPOSSIBLE MISSION YET  </P> <P> The newest addition to the local-woman-makes-good category is San Diegan  Rosemary Mariner, who, at 37, is about to become the first female to command a  Navy aviation squadron. Cmdr. Mariner's achievement should be an occasion for  unreserved congratulations and acknowledgement of another step in the progress  of feminism.  </P> <P> But one cannot take note of Mariner's accomplishment without also recognizing  that an anachronistic federal law prevents Mariner from leading that squadron  in defense of her country. The Women's Armed Services Integration Act of 1948  prohibits the Navy, Air Force or Marine Corps from assigning women to duty on  "vessels or aircraft that are engaged in combat missions."  </P> <P> Mariner (call sign: Saber) has logged more than 3,300 military flight hours in  15 different types of aircraft. She will take command next month of a  300-member Tactical Electronic Warfare squadron at the Naval Air Station in  Point Mugu, providing simulated hostile electronic warfare for Atlantic and  Pacific Fleet training exercises.  </P> <P> Conditions for women in the military are much improved from 1973, when Mariner  was one of the first eight women to attend Navy flight school. Women now  compose 10% of the Navy's force, up from 2% in 1972. That year, women could  hold 22 of the 70 Navy job classifications. This year, they are eligible for 88  of 102.  </P> <P> Women guard bases from Okinawa to West Germany. They were fired upon while  flying troops to battle aboard helicopters during the Panama invasion. More  well-known is Army Capt. Linda Bray's role in leading a Military Police company  in an assault on a Panamanian Defense Forces canine unit barracks.  </P> <P> But Congress still has not legitimized women's combat role, perhaps swayed by  the fear of female wartime casualties or the specious contention that women  lack the strength for battle. A bill that would have allowed women in the Army  to participate in all military activities during a trial period is effectively  dead for this session of Congress.  </P> <P> Mariner is convinced that manpower shortages forecast for the 1990s mean it is  only a matter of time before women are allowed into combat.  </P> <P> "When I hit a wall, I am going to get under it, over it or around it," Mariner  said in explaining her climb through the Navy ranks. "Put a wall in front of  me, and my reaction is to knock it down."  </P> <P> We'll cheer loudest when Mariner scales this barrier, or, better yet, when it  comes tumbling down.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Congressmen of the ruling [as heard] Socialist Party  of Chile have asked Chilean President Eduardo Frei to  reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba, which have been  severed for more than 20 years.    Deputy Anibal Perez [as heard], who spoke on behalf of those  Chilean congressmen, referred to the level of development  achieved between the two countries following the resumption of  consular and commercial ties in 1991.    According to the socialist congressmen, over the past three  years and within a climate of rapprochement, Chilean businessmen  have invested more than $20 million in Cuba, while 11,000  Chilean tourists traveled to Cuba last year. The Socialist Party  of Chile is the main ally of President Frei's ruling Christian  Democratic Party.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Well, the first reports are beginning to come in  from Ukraine. Igor Kirpichov, a correspondent from RIA news,  has rung our editorial office and his information is about  Sevastopol. The townspeople have elected the city council;  Viktor Semenov received the most votes. The residents of  Sevastopol also had to answer the question of whether they agree  to Sevastopol being the main base of the Russian Black Sea  fleet. Ninety percent of the voters responded in the  affirmative to this question. I repeat that this was a RIA  report.    Well the situation regarding the candidate for the president  of Ukraine is still not clear.</p>

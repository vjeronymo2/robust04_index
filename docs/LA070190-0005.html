			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYBODY'S A CRITIC  </P> <P> Having been a regular at L'Orangerie for some years now, I couldn't believe  that it wasn't included amongst Los Angeles' finest. I was even more shocked  when Reichl stated: "L'Orangerie offers a gorgeous setting, but the last meal I  had there was so disappointing -- amateur service, high prices and food that  was little more than bistro cooking." I have, to date, never had a bad meal or  bad service at the restaurant.  </P> <P> MICHAEL CAINE  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

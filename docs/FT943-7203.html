			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow climbs on bonds and progress at Deere Wall Street US stocks rallied yesterday on news of a strong quarterly performance by Deere, the farm equipment manufacturer, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 24.61 higher at 3,775.83, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 2.20 ahead at 464.51. Activity on the Big Board was brisk, with 307m shares traded by the close. Advancing issues led declines by nearly a two-to-one margin. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 0.51 at 446.28, and the Nasdaq composite gained 5.69 to 747.97. After several days of weakness, stocks opened higher and advanced steadily until the late afternoon. The improvement came as investors suspended nagging concerns over the impact of higher interest rates on corporate profitability. The change in tone was partly explained by a firming trend in bonds, which had dragged down share prices since the day after last week's move to tighter credit conditions. Treasuries posted modest gains as the dollar ended the day slightly stronger against other leading currencies. The session's most influential development was the release of a surprisingly robust earnings report by Deere. In addition to revealing impressive gains in third-quarter revenue and net income, the company said that it was boosting its North American production schedule in view of an expanding economy and the improved outlook for US farm incomes. The announcement triggered fresh enthusiasm for many stocks whose performances are closely linked to broad economic trends. The rebound by such cyclical issues suggested investors were hedging their bets on the direction of the economy in the coming months. At the very least, the company's results encouraged some bargain-hunting. Deere was the greatest beneficiary of the mood swing, its share price jumping 5 per cent or Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 69 1/2 . Agco, a Deere competitor, gained Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 45 1/4 . Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar set the pace with a gain of Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 111 5/8 , while Allied Signal climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 35 3/4 . Elsewhere, Cummins Engine improved Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 7/8 and Clark Equipment was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 68 1/2 . In the consumer non-durable sector, Philip Morris was Dollars 1 1/4 better at Dollars 56 1/2 . Investors were anticipating the company would raise its dividend or announce a share repurchase program at next week's annual meeting. Canada Toronto stocks closed higher with a solid gain. The TSE-300 composite index was up 25.26 points, or 0.60 per cent, to 4,211.68. Losing issues, however, held a slight lead over winners by 378 to 373. Volume rose to 73.69m shares worth CDollars 979.5m from Monday's 46.26m valued at CDollars 532.6m. Mexico Equities surrendered early gains to show a slight loss on profit-taking and unconfirmed market rumours of post-electoral trouble in the southern state of Chiapas. The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 3.44 points, or 0.12 per cent, lower at 2,755.33 after earlier soaring to 2,800.86 in heavy volume trading. After peeping above the psychological 2,800-point level, the market began falling back on profit-taking and the rumours accelerated the decline. Of the 127 issues traded, 80 were still higher and 30 were down with 17 unchanged. Telmex L shares were down 0.18 percent although its A shares were up 0.18 percent. Telmex ADRs were down  5/8 to 65 7/8 in New York. Brazil Mild profit-taking cut stock prices in Sao Paulo market by 1.5 per cent at the close as the market staged a small correction to a 28 per cent rise in the first three weeks of August.

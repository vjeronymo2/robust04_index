			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Some 30 dissidents  staged a demonstration in front of the American Embassy in Seoul  today in protest against U.S Defense Secretary William Perry's  visit to South Korea.    Perry, who delayed his visit due to last week's downing of  U.S. Army helicopters by friendly fire, will arrive here late  tonight to hold talks with his South Korean counterpart Kwon  Yong-hae on Pyongyang's nuclear issue.    The demonstrators, believed to belong to "Chongukyonhap," an  alliance of dissident activists for "democracy and national  unification," delivered to the U.S. Embassy a letter addressing  Perry.    The letter accused Washington of "intentionally aggravating"  tension on the Korean Peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense  industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military  power even though the Cold War is over.    It called on Perry to drop his earlier remarks warning of a  war against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).  It also urged the United States to withdraw immediately all  Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the  Seoul-Washington joint military exercise "Team Spirit"  permanently.    South korea and the U.S. will find ways during Perry's visit  here to break the stalemate of the nuclear issue, including the  timing of the "Team Spirit" joint military drill.    The first shipment of patriot missiles and their launchers  arrived in South Korea Monday [18 April] aboard two U.S.  military transport ships. The number of launchers amounted to  24, but the number of missiles was not known.    South Korea and the U.S. claimed that the Patriots are  purely  defensive missiles designed to counter the DPRK's air strikes  and Scud missiles.    However, the DPRK strongly opposes the deployment of the  Patriots in South Korea, saying that the missiles are designed  for offensive purposes.</p>

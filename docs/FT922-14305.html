			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Satellite paging services opened HUTCHISON Paging and Mercury Paging are launching rival satellite-based UK paging networks which they claim are a substantial improvement on the present landline-based services. Mercury Paging, a joint venture between Mercury Communications and Motorola of the US, launched its satellite paging service at midnight on Sunday. Hutchison's satellite service will begin tomorrow with an inaugural message by Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of Oftel, the telecommunications industry watchdog. Hutchison Paging is part of Hutchison Telecom UK. The companies are launching the world's first satellite paging services, which they say are faster and much more reliable than existing cable services. Satellite networks can avoid the corruption of messages resulting from traffic congestion. Corrupt messages are a source of frequent complaints from users of paging services. Users of Mercury's service will automatically be switched to the satellite service at no extra cost. Those using Hutchison's service will have to switch over, but the cost of the new service is no more than that of the present service. The UK paging market has stagnated since reaching a plateau of about 670,000 users since 1990. Hutchison said that improved service and greater reliability would change consumers' perception of paging services. It said: 'We aim to break the market open to a far wider audience, which in turn will bring the price down.' Hutchison added that independent research forecasts show the number of users rising to nearly 1n by 1995.</p>

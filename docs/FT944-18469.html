			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / US indicator points to strong growth Evidence that the US economy is still expanding strongly came yesterday when the National Association of Purchasing Managers said that its index had risen from 56.2 per cent in August to 58.2 per cent in September. Mr Ralph Kauffman, head of procurement and materials management at Oryx Energy and chairman of the association's survey committee, said that on past experience an index level of 58.2 per cent, if it were sustained, would be consistent with an overall growth rate of around 4.9 per cent. The survey of purchasing managers also showed that almost all sectors of manufacturing industry were having to pay higher prices for their raw materials. Release of the economic indicator fuelled fears that the US economy was still growing faster than it could sustain without provoking a surge in inflation. Treasury bonds fell quickly. The dollar also slid against most major currencies before recovering to close slightly higher on the day. Mr Kauffman said the NAPM's production index improved from 58.1 per cent in August to 61.2 per cent in September. The new orders index rose from 60.7 per cent to 61.6 per cent. The NAPM's price index rose from 74.5 per cent in August to 77.1 per cent in September, its highest level for six years.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> 5 MILLION CHILDREN BELOW POVERTY LINE  </P> <P> Five million American children under the age of 6 -- almost one out of every  four in the nation -- recently have been in families living below the poverty  line, according to a report by the National Center for Children in Poverty,  which is affiliated with Columbia University in New York.  </P> <P> This makes young children the poorest of any age group in American society,  with 23% -- more than double the number of adults -- living in poverty, the  report said. The study, based on 1987 data, found that while 42% of all U.S.  children living in poverty were white, the percentage of poor among whites  overall was 13%. That compares to 48% for blacks and 42% for Latinos.  </P></p>

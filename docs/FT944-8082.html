			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / MPs question building society accountability MPs yesterday questioned how far building societies were accountable to their millions of members as a cross-party Commons committee resumed its inquiry into financial regulation. Against the background of the government review of societies' powers and duties to their members, MPs on the Treasury committee expressed concern that if societies were given more powers they could move into higher risk areas of without members being able to exercise effective control. Mr Geoffrey Lister, chief executive of Bradford &amp; Bingley Building Society, admitted to the MPs that societies should do more to ensure that customers who were members were aware of their membership rights. He said, however, that there was no need for either consultative committees or places on the board reserved for 'member directors', as the Treasury's discussion paper had suggested. Mr Lister called these 'solutions in search of a problem'. He and his colleagues insisted that societies needed a more permissive regulatory regime in which to operate as the personal financial services sector became ever more competitive. Mr John Wriglesworth, strategy and marketing general manager, said societies had to be able to provide the services their customers wanted. 'If you don't offer them a variety of products, you go out of business,' he said. This analysis was challenged by Mr Peter Birch, chief executive of Abbey National, who told the committee that not all societies wanted wider powers or should be subjected to them. Abbey National, the home loans and banking group, is a former society. Mr Birch said societies' customers, both members and non-members, should receive annual statements reminding them of their status and, where applicable, their rights. The pressure on societies over accountability was heightened by the British Bankers' Association, which told the Treasury review there was an 'accountability gap' in the governance of societies. Until this was filled societies should not be given open-ended powers, it said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jerusalem -- The Palestinian popular federations  have issued a statement about the massacre of the worshipers at  the Ibrahimi Mosque. The statement places direct responsibility  for the massacre on the Israeli Government because it is  responsible for the safety of the Palestinian people under  occupation. The statement says that the Ibrahimi Mosque  compound is more akin to a military barracks in view of the  presence of a large number of Israeli forces there who allow  groups of settlers to perpetrate their crimes.    The statement continues: While condemning this repugnant  crime, the Palestinian popular organizations call on our  Palestinian people to consolidate their national unity, escalate  their brave intifadah, and respond to the settler herds by all  means in retaliation for the innocent souls of the massacre's  martyrs. The statement adds: We also call on our people in the  diaspora to embark on every initiative in support of the  steadfastness of our people under occupation. Furthermore, we  call on the Arab nation to bear its pan-Arab and historic  responsibility toward our people under occupation and provide  all forms of assistance to enhance their steadfastness and their  adherence to their land and sanctities. In addition, we call on  Arab governments to lift the boycott from our people's  leadership, the PLO, the Palestinian people's legitimate sole  representative.    The statement says: In the face of this repugnant crime, the  Palestinian popular organizations call on the PLO Executive  Committee to halt the talks at once and to insist on the removal  of settlements from all the occupied Palestinian territories,  including Jerusalem, before returning to the negotiating table.  What sort of talks and what peace can there be in the shadow of  massacres, killings, and destruction?    The popular organizations have noted the international  reaction to this disgusting crime and the fact that this  reaction has been week and limited only to condemnation and  denunciation. No practical measures and steps to provide  protection for our people under occupation have been adopted,  nor have the Israeli authorities been forced to implement the  resolutions of international legitimacy.    The popular organizations call on the United States and its  president, Bill Clinton, as a cosponsor of the peace conference  and in view of its international responsibility during this  stage to cease its unlimited aid to the Israeli Government and  to force it to implement the Security Council resolutions  relating to the Palestinian people's rights, especially  withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Palestinian  Arab territories.    Moreover, we call on the UN Security Council to adopt  immediate and practical measures and send international forces  to protect our Palestinian people from the attacks of  aggressors, just as in other parts of the world.    The Palestinian popular organizations appeal to all parties,  international organizations, and human rights committees to  condemn the perpetrators of this horrible crime and to pressure  their governments and their international agencies to press  Rabin's government to withdraw its forces and end the occupation.    In view of their faith in a just and comprehensive peace,  the  Palestinian popular organizations believe that there will be no  peace in the shadow of occupation and settlements. They also  believe that this peace will not be achieved unless our people  attain their inalienable rights -- the right of return, self-  determination, and establishment of their independent  Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital -- under  the leadership of the PLO, our legitimate sole representative.</p>

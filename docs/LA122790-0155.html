			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALL FACE LIFTS SEEN AS KEY TO KEEPING RETAIL SALES UP;  </P> <P> SHOPPING: THE SOUTHEAST MARKETING AREA ALREADY HAS 10 MAJOR MALLS FROM LONG  BEACH TO MONTEBELLO. RATHER THAN BUILD MORE, CITIES ARE LOOKING TO UPDATE  EXISTING ONES TO STAY COMPETITIVE.  </P> <P> Three years ago, Downey city officials took a hard look at their largest retail  area, the Stonewood Shopping Center, and concluded that it was sliding  dangerously close to economic senility. Downey residents were leaving town to  do their shopping.  </P> <P> "What we saw was that Stonewood would continue to decline unless we did  something to reverse the trend," said Kenneth Farfsing, assistant city manager  in charge of redevelopment. "We felt we needed to do something dramatic."  </P> <P> With a new owner already talking of renovation, the city decided to nudge him  into action with a deal: For 12 years after the remodeling, the city would  split its share of increased sales tax revenue with the developer. The city  also agreed to improve surrounding streets.  </P> <P> Today, Stonewood is like a new mall. Completely enclosed, the once open-air  shopping center has a new anchor, the May Co., and a host of new restaurants  edging its parking lot. When the remodeling is completed, the mall will have  161 new stores, more than double its original number.  </P> <P> Southeast-area shoppers are bound to see more of such reincarnations. In an  area that already has 10 major shopping centers from Long Beach to Montebello  and relatively little open space for new malls, the renovation of existing  shopping complexes is the likely look of things to come.  </P> <P> "In my opinion, the area is saturated with malls and really couldn't support  another one," said Skip Keyzers, senior vice president of MaceRich Corp., which  owns the highly successful Lakewood Center Mall.  </P> <P> Larry Norton, Stonewood's general manager, commented, "There are only so many  people within a market. You can only split the market so many times."  </P> <P> Of the county's major shopping centers, some of the most and least successful  are in the Southeast. Yet at both extremes, refurbishment is being discussed --  either to invigorate sales at such aging, badly designed centers as Paddison  Square in Norwalk, or to maintain the cash flow at such well-established malls  as Los Cerritos Center.  </P> <P> "I would like to see us really consider some revitalization," said Cerritos  Mayor Ann B. Joynt, who thinks the 20-year-old regional mall could use a  trendier look, a new parking structure, and perhaps a second story of shops.  </P> <P> As Southeast malls get their midlife face lifts, Westside swank is still not  for them.  </P> <P> Cerritos officials were thinking of further bolstering their already  substantial sales tax base with construction of an upscale mall in Towne  Center, the last major vacant tract in the city. But after studying the  demographics and income level of the area, a private consultant concluded that  there simply was not a market for such high-end stores as Saks Fifth Avenue and  Neiman Marcus.  </P> <P> Largely working class and middle class, Southeast is the land of Mervyn's,  Broadway and May Co.  </P> <P> If there is an empty shopping niche waiting to be filled, it is for membership  warehouse stores such as Price Club and so-called "power centers," which are  devoted to anchors selling a single category of goods, such as Home Depot, the  building supply store.  </P> <P> Recognizing that, Long Beach city officials are now courting developers to  build a power center on a former oil drilling tract near the San Diego Freeway  where the city had once envisioned an auto mall.  </P> <P> In the era of sluggish property tax growth that followed Proposition 13's  restrictions on increasing property levies, city officials have viewed shopping  malls with the same covetous eyes as auto malls. They wooed shopping center  developers with redevelopment deals, discounting the price of land for them and  building roads. And officials watch sales as if they were shopkeepers.  </P> <P> Without a really successful major mall in the city, Long Beach has long fretted  over the way its shoppers go out of town to Lakewood and Cerritos to spend  their money. Redevelopment officials are talking of helping Los Altos owners  spruce up their drab, 25-year-old shopping center in eastern Long Beach, and  the city is also talking to potential buyers of the downtown Long Beach Plaza,  again hoping for a remodeling to boost sales.  </P> <P> As the area's big shopping areas struggle to improve their market share or  maintain it, they may well face hard times.  </P> <P> "All forecasts -- and I'm totally in agreement -- are that in the next 10-year  period there will be a great shake-out in retailing all over the country,"  observed Tracey Hall, president of The Hall Olson Marketing Group in Newport  Beach. "California is no exception."  </P> <P> Too much retail development, not all of it wise, has left the nation with more  than it can handle, say national analysts, some of whom have predicted that as  many as half the country's retailers will fail over the next decade.  </P> <P> Pointing to the recent conversion of Old Towne Mall in Torrance to a smaller  strip center, Hall said some malls may actually decrease their size to make  more profitable use of their space. Indeed, developers are shrinking the  15-year-old La Mirada Mall from an unwieldy 135-store complex that covered 75  acres to a 35-store shopping center covering about half the area.  </P> <P> RETAIL SALES  </P> <P> Taxable retail sales reported in 1989 by each of the major shopping centers in  Long Beach and Southeastern Los Angeles, and how that figure ranked among the  county's 45 largest malls:  </P> <P> </P> <TABLE CWL="3.87IN:2.44IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Mall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Rank*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Lakewood Center Mall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $324,193,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Cerritos Center  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $275,554,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Montebello Town Center  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $144,430,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Stonewood Shopping Center  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $112,436,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 19  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Whitwood Mall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $104,926,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Altos Shopping Center  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $87,450,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 26  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Long Beach Plaza  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $68,230,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 30  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Santa Fe Springs Mall  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $56,803,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 35  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Pico Rivera Plaza  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $30,828,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 42  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Paddison Square  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $21,195,000  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 44  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance ranked No. 1 in the county, with taxable  retail sales of $444,658,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RETAIL SALES  </P> <P> Average sales per square foot for each mall, derived by dividing taxable retail  sales by total retail area:  </P> <P> Montebello Center: $224  </P> <P> Los Cerritos Center: $212  </P> <P> Los Altos Center: $152  </P> <P> Lakewood Center Mall: $135  </P> <P> Santa Fe Springs Mall: $126  </P> <P> Whitwood Mall: $121  </P> <P> Stonewood Shopping Center: $119  </P> <P> Pico Rivera Plaza: $108  </P> <P> Long Beach Plaza: $101  </P> <P> Paddison Square: $67  </P> <P> </P> <P> Source: State Board of Equalization and individual shopping centers  </P></p>

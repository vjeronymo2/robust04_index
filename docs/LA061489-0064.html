			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Philippine military has deployed more than 1,000 troops and police in towns  around a U.S. air base to thwart Communist rebel attacks on American service  personnel, the state-run Philippine News Agency said. The agency said  paramilitary commander Maj. Julius Yarcia has ordered intensified patrols in  rebel-influenced districts in Angeles city, where Clark Air Base is located,  and nearby towns. It quoted Yarcia as saying he ordered the deployment after  the military seized rebel documents listing eight American soldiers as possible  targets for Communist hit-squads operating around Angeles, 50 miles north of  Manila.  </P></p>

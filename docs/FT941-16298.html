			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Shrinking the Fed The case for granting central bankers the exclusive right to run an independent monetary policy is gathering momentum across the world. Yet in the US, where the recent conduct of monetary policy has been notably impressive, the movement is all in the other direction. Indeed, the Federal Reserve is under siege. Mr Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House banking committee, wants to turn regional Fed presidents into political appointees and to force more disclosure on the Fed's policy-making open market committee. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen is anxious to relieve the Fed of its role in banking supervision. Can it really make sense to politicise and shrink the Fed in this way? Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan clearly thinks not. And a robust defence may yet keep the hawks on the House banking committee at bay. Trench warfare between Congress and the Fed is normal at the point in the cycle where politicians fear a rise in interest rates. While there may be a case for modest changes to the way in which the open market committee discloses its deliberations, there is no case at all for further politicising an institution which is already subject to political pressure. The more serious challenge comes from Mr Bentsen. For while the Treasury Secretary's urge to put the supervisory activities of the Fed, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of Thrift Supervision under one roof may look ambitious, it is arguably a logical response to market reality. Mr Bentsen also has a greater head of steam behind his reform proposals than his predecessor Mr Nicholas Brady enjoyed when he sought in vain to tidy up the same regulatory mess. Regulatory legacy The demarcation lines in US financial services are a hangover from the financial crises of the 1930s. They are largely irrelevant to an age in which banks, thrifts and industrial or commercial companies all have the skills and technology to provide financial products to consumers and companies across the nation. Nor is the regulatory legacy of the 1930s appropriate to deal with the proliferation of new products that are growing rapidly at the expense of traditional deposit taking and lending. The financial crises of the 1980s exposed the present structure as an anachronistic hotch-potch involving extensive overlaps and inconsistencies. The snag with Mr Bentsen's proposal is that it opens up an old debate about central banking, as well as precipitating a turf war and prompting worries about a regulatory monolith. Mr Greenspan, along with many other central bankers, argues that the Fed needs to supervise the banks because monetary policy works better when the monetary authorities know what is going on in the institutions that create money and advance credit. And he argues that the Fed could not have pre-empted a credit crunch without early intelligence from the Fed's own bank examinations. Systemic crises Since the 19th century central bankers have acted as lenders of last resort in order to prevent systemic crises. Then, when bank balance sheets contained a high proportion of marketable paper, it was not necessary for the authorities to know much about the banks' operations. Last resort lending was about providing a market for the banks' paper, so that solvent banks could restore their liquidity without infecting the rest of the system. The growth of illiquid loans in bank balance sheets in the 20th century, together with the increasing sophisication of the payments system, makes it more important for central banks to understand the plumbing. The recent temporary surge in the amount of government paper in US bank balance sheets cannot detract from that point. It is noteworthy, too, that those countries where supervision is conducted in a separate agency have not been immune to disaster - witness the huge losses and consequent nationalisations that occurred recently in the Scandinavian banking system. And combining the thankless task of supervision with monetary policy has the advantage that higher-quality recruits come into supervision. The administration is right to attach priority to regulatory reform. But it should not be necessary to part the Fed from its information sources to bring it about.</p>

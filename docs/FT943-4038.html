			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Property: Mackintosh lives again - Cadogan's Place An extraordinary house is for sale near Inverness. The Artist's Cottage at Farr was built in 1992 from plans and elevations prepared by Charles Rennie Mackintosh in 1900 for an artist's cottage and studio that never went ahead. Architect Robert Hamilton Macintyre, of Keppie, Henderson &amp; Partners, adapted the Mackintosh plans (kept in the Hunterian Gallery in Glasgow) to modern technology. The result is a stunning, white-rendered piece of the Mediterranean - almost mud-brick architecture in its rounded parapets - set in the heart of Scotland. But I am not sure Mackintosh would have approved of so much fitted carpeting or of five showers and only one bath. The leaded glass windows use Mackintosh designs, and the wing which he intended for servants will now take children or visitors. Bidwells in Perth (0738-630666) seeks offers over Pounds 250,000. Average rents have risen 67 per cent between 1991 and 1994, according to a new survey by Strutt &amp; Parker, while inflation between May 1991 and May 1994 was only 8.38 per cent. This is certainly a very large increase but Ann Sugden of the Newbury office, who compiled the survey, points out it is based on S&amp;P properties outside London - mostly houses of farmhouse/old rectory size, cottages on estates or farms, or executive homes. The prime reason for the increase is assured shorthold tenancies (ASTs), which form 94 per cent of these lettings. Although ASTs began in 1989, it took time for owners to understand that they really could regain possession when the terms ended. So, rents in 1991 were lower than they might have been, reflecting the uncertainty of the landlords as well as the recession. The survey shows that rents now are highest for detached houses in East Anglia (averaging Pounds 700 a month) and the west country (Pounds 768), and for semi-detached houses and flats in the south-east (Pounds 432 and Pounds 450). Rents for pre-1700 properties are almost twice as high as for post-1950. Detached houses rose the most (72 per cent) since 1991 and flats the least (22 per cent). At Warham, on the Holkham estate in Norfolk, Savills in Norwich (0603-612211) is offering two solid, late-Georgian box houses on five-year ASTs for Pounds 12,000 a year: the old rectory and Chalk Hill farmhouse. In Staffordshire, the West Midlands office (0902-851347) has Somerford Grange for Pounds 150 week. This is a farmhouse given a castellated Georgian-Gothic facade around 1770 to improve the view across the park of Somerford Hall. Nettleden House, built in 1856 on the Ashridge estate in Hertfordshire, is available furnished for Pounds 3,950 a month from Hamptons (071-493 8222). The house has 11 acres, stables and tennis court - and the gardener's wages are included. Pay more to use the owner's Rolls-Royce or his cellar (charged by the bottle). Slightly cheaper, at around Pounds 3,500 furnished, is Tilbury Hall at Tilbury-juxta-Clare in east Suffolk. This is a Tudor house owned by Edward de Vere, an earl of Oxford and favourite of Queen Elizabeth. It, too, comes with a gardener and 80 acres (from Bidwells in Cambridge: 0223-841841). Edwin Lutyens designed the red-brick Beacon House at Knebworth, Hertfordshire. Bryan Bishop in Welwyn (0438-718877) is asking Pounds 475,000 (down from Pounds 497,000). A Norman Shaw house is for sale at Groombridge, Kent, where he designed several properties. Set in three acres near Tunbridge Wells, Hillside respects the Wealden tradition of building with half-timbered gables and tile-hung upper walls. Savills in Sevenoaks (0732-455551) seeks Pounds 750,000 for it.</p>

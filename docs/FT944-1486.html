			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Freud among the big boys - William Packer admires the brave juxtaposition of old and new at the Dulwich Gallery The Dulwich Picture Gallery holds one of London's more remarkable smaller collections of old masters. For its size it is extraordinarily rich not merely in the nominal range of the masters it represents, but in the prime quality of the works by which it represents them. Furthermore, it is kept and shown in the most perfect of galleries, built to the purpose by John Soane and a masterpiece in itself. Needless to say, being so special a national treasure, it has been kept on short commons for decades, sometimes even under threat of closure. That said, it seems at present in fairly rude health, largely by virtue of the energetic fund-raising policies of its present director, Giles Waterfield, and his imaginative programme of temporary exhibitions, which from time to time brings in the work of modern and contemporary artists such as Lucian Freud, whose work is currently on show. But then although many old-master galleries put on shows of modern art from time to time, even though not always by artists so celebrated as Lucian Freud, nor necessarily with the work of Velasquez, Poussin, Gainsborough, Tiepolo, Watteau, Canaletto and Van Dyck on the wall next door. Such a show, we would assume, would be set aside in a room to itself, a special case with critical values of its own by which to respond to it. What makes all the difference here, however, is that Waterfield 'thought it would be interesting to hang the (Freuds) among the many mainly 17th century Flemish paintings in one of Soane's main galleries.' And he knew very well, for all his mock-innocence, that by so doing he would be taking a most radical curatorial step. He had four new Freuds at his disposal, three nudes of which two were very large, and a small study of a woman's head. And the wall he chose for them, in the first gallery on the left on the main axis of the gallery, is not full of any old things. It is commanded by the great Rubens, lately restored, of 'Venus, Mars and Cupid', with Lely's 'Nymphs at a fountain' and a Van Huysum flower piece alongside, and Van Dyck and Hobbema, among others, across the room. One of the heresies of modernism, and one of the most pernicious, is that it represents a break with the great humanist tradition of Western Europe that goes back through the renaissance to classical times. Yet it has remained an evident truth, at least to those collectors with the wit and confidence to trust their eyes, that no hermetic seal ever came down to cut us off from the past. We may know a work of art, of whatever kind, by the company it keeps; and if it is good enough it will hold its place in the grandest company, by uality alone. But it is a stiff test, and to set up Lucian Freud against Rubens of all people, could all too easily be written off as mere curatorial affectation and no contest at all. But Freud at least has never felt himself to be cut off from the great tradition  - artists by and large don't  - and for the last 20 years or so has openly set himself by its standards, not just in the intensity of his scrutiny of the visible world, but in the physical scale of his pictorial ambition, and his prodigious output. He is now 72, and on this present evidence is working with as much physical control and energy as ever, if not more. The huge standing male nude, 'Leigh under the skylight', seen full frontal and foreshortened from below, is an astonishing practical achievement in itself. That it should also declare itself as a great work of art is something else again. Many still find Freud's bleak vision of humanity unnerving and objectionable, but then the manifest fleshiness of Rubens' women is notoriously not to everyone's taste. The direct comparison here between Freud and Rubens is uncanny and revealing. Of course there must be differences  - the history of art cannot be undone, and in Freud the legacy of expressionism is clear enough. But yet these two artists speak to each other across the centuries on equal terms, on the same scale, even in the same way  - the crossed feet of Freud's Leigh and Rubens' Venus is the nicest coincidence. But then how closely similar is the drawing of those feet, in the working of the pigment on the surface, the openness and directness of the statement. The innate naturalism of each image bespeaks a deep and natural sympathy, for all that one is an allegory, the other supposedly an objective response to the natural world. But then all art is allegory, in the sense that all art is art, and removed from the world through the sensibility and imagination of the artist. Here are two great artists seen for once side by side, with other great artists looking on. We can do no more than pay Lucian Freud the compliment of saying that his work looks as though it has lived in such company all along.

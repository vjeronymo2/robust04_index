			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Battersea power station awaits next stage in redevelopment Battersea power station, with its inside gutted, stands forlorn awaiting the next stage in its redevelopment. The Hwang family, Hong Kong property developers, earlier this year acquired an option to bid for the power station from banks which had previously financed an ill-fated attempt by Mr John Broome, the property developer and theme-park owner, to develop the 31-acre site. The site on the Thames in London was collateral for a debt thought to total more than Pounds 100m, including interest and penalty fees. The deal has left the Hwang family studying options for acquiring the site from its owner, Battersea Leisure, whose plans to transform the site ran into financial difficulties.</p>

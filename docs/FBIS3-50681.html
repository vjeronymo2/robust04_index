			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 4 Jan (EFE) -- Bolivian Vice President  Victor Hugo Cardenas, of Aymara descent, today lamented the fact  that indigenous peoples in Mexico had chosen the path of armed  struggle, emphasizing that in Bolivia there will not be a  similar situation because the government has begun to resolve  the problems of indigenous peoples.    Of Bolivia's population of 6.4 million, 70 percent are of  Aymara, Quechua, and Guarani descent, in addition to some 20  Amazon tribes. Most of them live in poverty or in extreme  poverty.    In 1993, international organizations considered that  Bolivian  peasants were the planet's poorest people.    "I lament the fact that in Mexico they decided to take up  arms, but in Bolivia there will be no such movements because the  demands from those sectors are being met, despite the fact that  for many years they had been sidelined," the vice president said.    Cardenas added that "the exclusion of indigenous peoples is  being overcome in Bolivia within the framework of the democratic  system," noting that the government has taken major steps "to  tackle indigenous people's problems," though he admitted that  such steps "are not enough -- but it is important to begin, in  order to find answers within the next few years."    The government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada has  announced that as of this year it will implement the "people's  participation" program, which will be based on traditional  institutions: the "ayllu" (indigenous community) and the "ayni"  (mutual cooperative work, "today for you, tomorrow for me") in  the areas of education and health.    The vice president emphasized that the work by the  government  "will leave them with no justification for violent action,"  adding that Bolivian democracy will also contribute to "avoiding  the creation of radical indigenous movements."    Some movements of apparent indigenous origin have appeared  in  Bolivia over the past eight years, movements that have tried to  vindicate -- through terrorism and attacks -- objectives such as  social justice for indigenous people, but they were not  supported by the people and were dismantled by the security  organs of the state.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Neriman Gasymoghlu: "Some Goals and Duties of </F> the Democratic Opposition"]    [Text] It can be accepted by everyone that an organized  democratic opposition with clear political goals is a national  and state resource. In my opinion, there are enough clear ideas  about the place, role and weight of a democratic opposition  because this resource is exploited in global, strategic issues  such as national state-building. Unfortunately, recent events  have not helped to embody these ideas in practice so they have  remained more on the theoretical level.    In Azerbaijan the basic political contradictions that still  remain in the nature of relations between the opposition and  those in power consist of reasons which characterize the  standoff between empire and national liberation. Other reasons  often seem to be of secondary importance. In general, because  the movement we have described as a national liberation struggle  is democratic in nature, we evaluate it as a democratic  movement. It is only natural that if our movement is connected  with leading democratic processes in the world, another reason  is that it is based in the national characteristics of  Azerbaijani society itself.    The basic political goal of democratic opposition forces in  Azerbaijan is to achieve representation through the realization  of the basic goals of their program in the government. It is  completely natural that this issue is distorted in official  propaganda channels so that in the public mind it appears as an  ugly, immoral concept. Through television and the press, it is  interpreted to mean that coming into the government is in the  interests of certain individuals or groups, but this is not a  step forward for the people, etc. It is clear that official  information policy is directed at disarmament and away from  national democratic values. Independent polls confirm that the  influence of the government among the population continues to  fall. The reasons for this are published frequently in the  opposition newspapers. It suffices to say that it is difficult  to speak of future directions in any sector. Coming to the  consistently stressed issue of the unique role of the government  in safeguarding stability within the society, this is  exaggerated, and the value of the intelligent, calm comportment  of the democratic opposition is reduced to nothing under wartime  conditions. As for all kinds of problems, blaming them on the  conflict with Armenia and justifying the slowdown in needed  reforms seems meaningless. Incompetence, bribery and corruption  have led to a national catastrophe which has reached to the  level of a national tragedy.    Superficially, it appears that the opposition which has  changed to more passive activity, should dwell more on internal  organizational questions so that when the present powerholders  who, under the new conditions, lack administrative ability and  the democratic habits brought about by this are defeated, they  can come into the government without difficulty. We have to  mention that among some opposition forces the habit of lying in  ambush exists. I want to mention two dangerous aspects of this.  The first demands the creation of extreme conditions and is  connected to the hope that the question of a change in  government will be resolved through external influences, and  that the passiveness of the society and the population will  help. For example, the period of the events of last summer were  like this. The population was not on the side of the rebels, it  was occupied with their traveling to Baku, etc. It is clear that  extreme conditions are not in the interest of the nation. The  second dangerous aspect is that public opinion is created  counter to the national interest as the result of a policy of  waiting. For democrats engaged in political activity, this is  unforgivable. One is in the position that there can be a sudden  social explosion of a people whose way of life is becoming  gradually worse. Under such conditions, saboteur circles managed  from Moscow will fertilize the field, and the probability of a  catastrophe increases. All this gives opposition forces cause to  think. We do not claim to teach intelligence to the powers that  be. But they have to understand that their level of  responsibility for any kind of national catastrophe is all the  greater.    Very serious, troublesome work which requires courage stands  before us. This is essentially connected to the war. The hopes  of the government and the democratic opposition, who have  sacrificed thousands from its ranks for the Fatherland since the  Armenia-Azerbaijan war began, are the same. And generally, the  war which drew the democratic opposition into relative passivity  is also a factor. It is natural that such passivity is  spiritually justifiable. But there is a question put forward by  the national interest that the democratic opposition must think  about carefully in their work. Their political habits should not  be such that stability is violated in the name of covering up  their lack of capability in their work style which would give  those in government the needed excuses to undermine the  democratic opposition. Since a change in government is an  historical and natural process (the discussion is on a legal  change of government), they have to discuss strategic questions  and they must make their move to come into the government in an  only partially known environment. It is also necessary to  consider every kind of environment which could be created.    The primary duty of the democratic opposition is to  organize,  and this work occurs at various levels. This question means  purifying and strengthening their ranks, and a change in  quality. There are not a few individuals in whom representatives  of democratic forces have lost confidence who served at various  levels of the former government, and who have been forgotten by  the people; it is not desirable that they return to political  activity in the ranks of the democratic opposition. They could  be obstacles in the struggle for public opinion. It is clear  that this is a psychological question and democratic  organizations must cross this psychological barrier without  falling into internal fragmentation!    Many articles in the opposition press have been devoted to  analysis of the democrats' fall from government last June. While  most of these were both objective and subjective, basically, the  objective reasons were more discussed. Only one must not forget  the subjective because the speculations on the mechanism by  which the ranking oppositionists were overthrown are narrow.  There is basis to think that the subjective anatomy of the  government change which took place following the July events  have not been revealed. In my opinion, leaders of the democratic  opposition, including the renewed leadership of the APF  [Azerbaijan People's Front], must pay attention to this question.    They were damaged because of the shrinking social basis of  the democrats. The most difficult and troublesome work will be  to revive this basis; this includes the activity on the  direction of building a correct idea among the population about  national-democratic values which have been exposed to a certain  amount of deformation. Propaganda should not be conducted in the  framework of traditional government-opposition contradictions,  but in the sector of explaining the nature of the freedoms and  values we have mentioned. In other words, not propaganda  creating a sense of primitive confrontation, and imbued with a  sense of psychological superiority.    The question of the transition to a market economy still  conveys a declarative character. It appears that those in the  government do not have too much interest in this. The stalling  of reforms and the widespread bribery and corruption has impeded  business structures which had just begun to be formed by  businessmen, and a natural flow of capital in the republic  abroad is taking place. The democratic opposition must be turned  into the spokesman of the representatives of free economic  striving. Those leading the way in this expression will be  found. But if we wish to make the transition to a market  economy, if we wish to understand the advantage of this to the  state, create the economic grounds for social guarantees for the  poor, and the importance of economic freedom in society, we must  not stint on every kind of political-spiritual and intellectual  aid for the development of free business. And the reasons  impeding this development must be explained clearly to the  people. If every opposition organization were to prepare  concrete programs of economic reform and turn these over for  discussion among business circles, then it would be an excellent  proof of the seriousness of an opposing force.    There is much talk about shortcomings in the constitution.  If  a constitutional commission were to be organized by the  opposition to discuss alternatives (despite the presence of  opposition representatives on the state commission), and if they  were to prepare an alternate draft, it would not be bad. One  could hold a campaign of constitutional discussions by the  opposition.    The democratic opposition must reach conclusions and  actively  publicize clear directions of needed reforms connected with the  question of building the country. Because this question has been  moribund, state institutions are not operating. The democrats  must clarify for themselves how they want to view an independent  state at the upper, middle and lower echelons, and conduct  reforms for the sake of the nation's interests. The last  government stalled on this issue and was compelled to work in  structures inherited from the empire.    A more important question consists of the democratic  opposition's bringing dynamism into foreign policy. Concepts in  public opinion about foreign contacts guaranteeing that they  will not cease to back our independence are weak. Some steps  taken by the present government in foreign policy and the policy  followed during the democrats' government are manifestations of  this. In other words, the present government understands that  only pro-Russian contacts increase the possibility of Moscow's  breaking up our independent state and, as a consequence, would  drive them from the government.    The idea has been widely spread that processes in Russia  influence the real situation in Azerbaijan. Setting aside the  correctness of this idea, the channels of such influence have  still not been clarified. Efforts by Moscow to tie Azerbaijan to  itself through militarily siding with Armenia and to preserve  its geopolitical influences in the Caucasus region raise the  obvious question as to whether this is the Russian strategy and  a visible side of its policy. The ways to fight against this are  also clear. The invisible side is no less dangerous; it serves  to shake our national security from within and serves the  obstructions in building the state. There is a need for more  clarification here. In higher and middle-level state structures,  Moscow's seen and unseen cadres are in action. The leadership,  by keeping the former in their positions, demonstrates that it  is following a competent policy with regard to Moscow. As for  Moscow, it uses them to put pressure on the leadership and to  implement concrete sabotage scenarios if they do not bow to  this. This is a mechanism which preserves the republic under  Moscow's control while at the same time preventing the  development of healthy political relations within the republic.  We have to say that this mechanism also functioned in the time  of the preceding government. In March, April and May of last  year the future of this mechanism came into question through the  activity of Western diplomacy. From this standpoint, the  clarification of the subjective anatomy of the June events is  rather important. One question that cannot be forgotten is that  the West can increase its own activism in Caucasian politics  after the restoration of democratic laws in Azerbaijan.  Realization of this would coincide with the neutralization of  imperial influences in the region.    One can say that ideological differences between  organizations of the democratic opposition are slight. There is  objective room for cooperation. The question of  interorganizational liaison must, in general, be turned into  norms of political behavior, and, from the spiritual standpoint,  this is also useful for public opinion. It is natural that no  individual or organization can take responsibility for pulling  Azerbaijan out of the crisis alone. A coalition must be built  among the opposition organizations. Perhaps the former power of  the APF was a coalition by its nature. This was justified by the  times. The content of the APF is changing according to  conditions and, having broken up its organization, we are now  preserving an internal sense of definition which knows its  limits.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Winfried Muenster: "No New Division of </F> Europe"]    [Text] Europe is getting wider, not deeper. The partner  states of the European Union [EU] adopted the Maastricht Treaty  with great noise and much ado. The treaty continues to create  controversy to this day. Yet in the next few weeks, the  Community of Twelve is preparing to change its face even more:  almost beyond recognition, some fear. Nevertheless, this is  taking place without much fuss.    By the end of the month the enlargement negotiations with  Finland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden should -- or have to -- be  concluded, so that these four EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] countries can join the EU at the beginning of next  year. The Community will thus not only grow to 16 members but  rather follow a guiding star into the future. The Community of  the six founding states was still characterized by the war,  which taught them that political thinking free of illusions must  lead to integration, the common base for national sovereignty if  the danger of war is to be banned once and for all. The current  Club of Twelve is dominated by romantic solidarity thinking:  All for one, especially the North for the South. It is France  and the Mediterranean countries that are keeping up the flag of  integration, and it would be unfair to surmise that they were  only interested in political or economic net balances.  "Deepening (the Community) before (its) enlargement," is the  motto, with which Commission President Jacques Delors wanted to  prevent new members from throttling the pace on the path "toward  an ever closer union."    Yet, this is exactly what cannot be avoided. In theory, the  character of the Community must not be significantly changed by  the fact that it becomes larger. Apart from a few restrictions,  the governments of the four membership candidates have readily  accepted the treaty, on the basis of which the Community  functions, even including the future project of joint foreign,  security, and defense policy. It would be naive, however, to  assume that the mentality of the current Twelve would remain  unaffected by the arrival of such self-willed nations as the  Nordic ones. The Swedes and Norwegians are more than capable of  doing what the Danes could, who initially rejected the  Maastricht Treaty. In a union of 15 or 16, a new -- at least  relative -- majority will emerge, which, despite all loyalty to  the Community, will instinctively try to prevent any more powers  being shifted to Brussels.  <H5>  Minimum of Consensus </H5>   In doing so, it will not even have to try very hard,  because,  one thing is, that the enlargement of the Union is providing the  ground for its extension to the East. One can bet that the  Poles, Hungary, and the two successor states to Czechoslovakia  will join the Union earlier than the Germans are hoping and the  French would like. In a Community of 20 or even more highly  differing sovereign states, the federalists will probably have  to forget their ideas of a European federal state for another  generation. Edmund Stoiber does not even have to try so hard.  Even in the Community of the Twelve the minimum consensus is  hardly ever achieved.    The other thing is that one must not forget that all has  gotten into a phase of economic decline. The times in which a  generous America provided security cheaply and the standard of  living increased as if by a natural law are over for the moment.  In such times, loyalty to the European idea quickly changes  into concern for one's pocket. From the negotiators of the  Nordic entry candidates one can easily gather anyway that what  makes the Union attractive for them is the single market, while  they accept the remaining "achievements" of the work of European  unification, specifically its agricultural policy and the  subsidy fund, rather as ballast. After all, Finland has lost  parts of its vital markets in the East.  <H5>  Unworthy Game </H5>   The four membership candidates thus, consistently argue that  the difference between membership in the Union and the "European  Economic Area" (EEA), to which they already belong, is that it  is not important to have the single market but to sit at the  table of the Council of Ministers in Brussels and to have a say  in how this market is created and shaped. Only Norway --  because of its rich fishing grounds and energy resources -- does  not really need it, which makes Union immediately look less  attractive. Even the Austrians might be deterred if they have  to vote on it in a referendum in June, perhaps tired of the  really unworthy game to which it has been subjected by Brussels?  Its application for membership reached Brussels five years ago,  when it was denigrated as an attempt at a new "Anschluss" via  Europe's front door.    Because of this long waiting time alone, which is a  disgrace for the EU, it is necessary to conclude the entry  negotiations in the next few rounds. Failure to do so would not  be proof of big problems of substance but of the fact that a  strong faction within the Twelve continues to believe that it  can preserve a Europe as deeply integrated as possible, in which  the center of gravity would still lie in Paris and Germany would  remain a border country. So one has to say that 28 February  will necessarily have to be the deadline, since some candidates  will otherwise be unable to ratify their accession in time. In  Sweden, for example, Parliament must hold two votes, with the  second one having to take place at least six months after the  first and with a new election of Parliament in the meantime.  Not forgetting the European Parliament, which should be asked  for support before it is dissolved in late spring for  reelection. The candidates are pressing for accession on 1  January 1995, when the process of revising the Maastricht Treaty  will start, in which they quite rightly want to participate.    Such pressure of time is, of course, enticing for the  opponents of enlargement, which is why they are tightening this  screw. Asking the four candidates to reduce the prices for  their agricultural prices overnight to Community level, that is  to say by up to 40 percent, instead of granting them the  traditional transition periods looks like a nasty trick. This  is how one can paralyze the talks and nourish the hope that, in  the referendum, the scales will here and there tend toward a no.    Yet, these obstructionists will ultimately not gain the  upper  hand. The Community needs the economically strong EFTA  countries if it wants to shoulder the burden that is approaching  from the East. This is, at the same time, Germany's special  cause, and France knows that it has to put aside its idea of an  integrated Europe for the time being and give priority to these  interests to prevent Germany from feeling left in the lurch.  After all, the partners in Bonn and Paris are in agreement that  Europe must not be divided again on the fine-selection for EU  membership. A lot can be achieved on the basis of this  agreement.</p>

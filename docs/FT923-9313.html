			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Fraud on trial THE BLUE ARROW fraud trial was rightly labelled a costly disaster by the Appeal Court. The blame for its inordinate length and ultimate unmanageability was apportioned between the trial judge, Mr Justice McKinnon, and the prosecution. The Court said if such trials were to be avoided in future, trial judges would have to take a firmer grasp on proceedings and the prosecution would have to show restraint in framing indictments. Fear of losing on a few counts was not a reason for throwing the book at defendants. The Serious Fraud Office should present only essential evidence. Trial judges should not be afraid to use their power to split trials in order to reduce cases to manageable proportions. In addition, Mr Justice Brooke formally acquitting the remaining four defendants in the Blue Arrow case spoke of the need for judges to make greater use of new technology in the court and to undertake training in trial management. Is this enough to ensure fraud trials stay within manageable limits in future? The judges have clearly indicated that they intend to do all they can within the constraints of the present system to rectify the problems of long fraud trials. Other changes such as time limits on fraud trials, greater powers for trial judges in preliminary hearings, and the introduction of a simple fraud offence would require legislation. Much therefore depends on the attitude of the SFO. It maintains it is bound by the code of prosecutors not to overload the indictment or charge people on the fringes of a case. It rejects the suggestion that it includes too many charges in big fraud cases but says it can not be placed in a straitjacket. The trial of Mr Asil Nadir will provide the first test of its resolve. The former Polly Peck chairman still faces more than 60 charges, but the SFO says that he will only face 16 specimen charges of theft by the time his case comes to trial next March. If the SFO is able in the coming months to produce manageable charge sheets in this and other cases, it may be unnecessary for the government to legislate. If not, then the government will need to use this autumn's planned consultation process on the practice and procedure of fraud trials as a launching pad for legislation.</p>

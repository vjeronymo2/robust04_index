			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Tank trucks alternated loads of chemicals with shipments of juices, wine and  edible oils, truckers told a House panel as it continued a probe into  food-hauling practices. Two months ago, the same Public Works and  Transportation investigations subcommittee was told by several truckers that  they sometimes carried garbage in the same refrigerated trucks used to haul  food. The recent testimony concerned a related practice: the hauling of  chemicals and liquid foods back to back. Trucker David Helzer of Hermiston,  Ore., said the practice appeared widespread. "On June 9, 1988, I loaded  ammonium phosphate, washed out, and reloaded apple juice. I then loaded  monethanolamine 100%, washed out, and reloaded apple juice," Helzer said.  </P></p>

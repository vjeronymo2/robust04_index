			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata will visit Russia  for two days from 20 to 21 March taking advantage of consecutive  holidays. It was confirmed on 14 March, however, that Hata will  not meet with President Yeltsin because he will take a two-week  leave and will not stay in Moscow during Hata's visit to Moscow.  The primary objective of the foreign minister's visit to Russia  is to ask the president to reaffirm the "Tokyo Declaration" on  which both Japan and Russia agreed last October and to express  Japan's intention to continue its assistance for Russia's  reforms. The foreign minister is not hiding his embarrassment at  this development.</p>

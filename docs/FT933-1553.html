			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Smith to appeal to delegates over vote reforms MR JOHN SMITH will next week raise the stakes in his battle to democratise Labour's selection of parliamentary candidates by making a personal appeal to delegates at the party's annual conference to back his plans. In a highly unusual move, the Labour leader will open next Wednesday's crucial debate on the proposed reforms less than 24 hours after delivering his set-piece address. The decision underlines the degree to which Mr Smith's personal authority is riding on the party's acceptance of the proposals, which are opposed by some large Labour-affiliated unions. Mr Smith explained the move by saying: 'I have played a leading part in constructing these changes . . . I therefore think it is right that I should put the case to conference.' The outcome of next week's vote looks too close to call, with Mr Smith having seemingly improved his chances of winning with his staunchly pro-union speech to the TUC conference earlier this month. The issue is set to dominate the Labour conference, which begins in Brighton on Sunday. Mr Smith's plan, watered down to overcome union resistance, is for candidates to be elected by constituency members on the basis of one-member-one-vote. The unions would lose their right to influence selection, but union members would be able to vote as individuals by paying a reduced party membership fee in the constituency where they live. Mr Larry Whitty, the party's general secretary, hinted yesterday that the ruling national executive committee might move to impose Mr Smith's plan - which it has approved - if delegates rejected it along with amendments proposed by critics. Questioned on what would happen if the proposals failed to attract a majority vote, he replied: 'As you will know, the NEC has extensive powers. We are assuming the NEC's proposals will go through,' he said. Imposing the plan in this way would allow Mr Smith to claim only a hollow victory, since it would cast doubt on his ability to exercise effective control. The NEC also drew up a statement yesterday which - if approved by conference  -would commit the next Labour government to holding a referendum on electoral reform after an initial consultation period. Senior officials yesterday denied Mr Smith was taking a risk by making such a personal appeal. Officials said 60 to 70 per cent of constituency parties questioned had indicated support for Mr Smith's position. Liberal Democrat conference, Page 11</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The outline of a report on the government's basic  policy on atomic energy use in the 21st century has been  revealed. The report is to be compiled on 27 May by a working  panel on atomic energy under the Advisory Committee for Energy  [ACE], an advisory body to the Agency of Natural Resources and  Energy under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  In the report, the panel recommends that a study be made on  developing a next- generation light water reactor which is safer  than existing models and requires fewer operators and workers;  the report suggests such a reactor would need to be ready for  use by the year 2010.    As some nuclear reactors are expected to have reached the  end  of their useful life by the beginning of the 21st century, the  panel also urges a prompt start to studies on developing  technology to handle the disposal of nuclear waste that arises  with the dismantling of reactors and on drawing up adequate  safety standards.    On the issue of plutonium use, the panel's report is in line  with the Long-Range Plan on the Development and Use of Atomic  Energy, the outline of which was announced earlier by the Atomic  Energy Commission.    Light water reactors account for about 90 percent of the  world's nuclear reactors used for generating electricity.  However, a great deal of trouble is involved in their  maintenance and repair.    The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, manufacturers of  nuclear reactors, and power companies plan to jointly compile a  report on the results of their research over the next three  years on next generation nuclear reactors. Such reactors, it is  felt, must have "a high degree of safety, dependability, low  impact on the environment, and low personnel costs." On the  basis of such efforts, work will begin on making next generation  nuclear reactor technology practical.    Japan is to start work on finalizing specific safety  measures  for its next generation nuclear reactor. However, the United  States, which has already developed its next generation nuclear  reactor, plans to reduce its scale and simplify it by making  further improvements to a safety device that cools the reactor  core in case of emergencies.    Meanwhile, nuclear reactors which began operating in the  1970's will be getting too old by the 21st century. The ACE  working panel, in its report, stresses that in dismantling old  reactors "it will be necessary to gain the understanding of  local residents for dismantling procedures, the disposal of  waste materials, and land use after dismantling."    The panel, therefore, urges that detailed procedures and  standards first be drawn up.</p>

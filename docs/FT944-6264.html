			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Capital allowance argument rejected - Investment measures Big industrial associations last night pledged to continue the battle for increased capital allowances for plant and machinery in spite of the chancellor's rejection of measures supported widely by manufacturing industry. Manufacturing industry had made its views explicit. It was hoping for a Budget to stimulate permanently higher levels of investment and to improve the UK's competitiveness. In October, leaders of seven big industry associations wrote an open letter to Mr Clarke urging measures to prevent 'boom and bust cycles'. They wanted the chancellor to introduce full first-year capital allowances for at least the first Pounds 200,000 of plant and machinery, to benefit smaller companies. They asked for existing capital allowances for plant and machinery to be index-linked against inflation. And they wanted capital gains tax for holdings of corporate equity to be reformed, introducing 'tapered rates' to encourage investors to take a longer-term view. But the government views a modification of allowances for plant and machinery as a distortion of the tax structure. The argument for increased capital allowances had a 'simplistic appeal', he said, but would distort investment decisions and not encourage the high-quality investment needed to improve economic performance. The Machine Tool Technologies Association, while disappointed, said it would continue to ask for increased capital allowances next year. It said: 'So many other countries think it is the right way to go to stimulate investment.' Mr Graham Mackenzie, director-general of the Engineering Employers Federation, said that the problem of relatively poor investment in the UK had not gone away. He noted that the Pounds 200,000 limit in the associations' plea was aimed particularly at helping small companies - at which some of the Budget measures were directed. The EEF had warned in its Budget submission of the danger that recovery from recession would be seen as evidence that no further policy changes were needed. But Mr Kevin Paterson of accountants Ernst &amp; Young said it looked as if the chancellor had decided that, with the economy coming out of recession, he did not need to encourage investment. Measures to encourage investment would have been important for manufacturers, he said, but also to the leasing industry.</p>

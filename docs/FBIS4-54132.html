			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 25 KYODO -- Japan is convinced that the  United States will not resort to punitive actions in dealing  with bilateral trade problems now that it has dropped demands  for the use of numerical targets in assessing foreign access to  Japanese markets, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said Tuesday  [24 May] night.    Kakizawa told a press conference that Japan and the U.S.  basically agreed to resume the stalled trade framework talks and  not to use numerical targets as "objective criteria" for  measuring foreign market access.    "Both sides also agreed to introduce `qualitative and  quantitative' criteria (to measure the progress of imports in  penetrating Japanese markets) and not to use a single criterion  to judge (the openness of Japan's markets), so we're convinced  that sanctions will not be implemented," Kakizawa said.    The trade talks collapsed in February because of differences  over the definition of "objective criteria." Tokyo rejected  U.S. demands for what Japanese officials criticized as  "numerical targets" for specifying market shares of U.S.  products in the Japanese market.    Kakizawa said Tuesday's accord on resumption of the  framework  talks brought Tokyo and Washington to the "starting line, not  the goal."    The schedules for negotiations over specific areas are to be  worked out in later consultations with the U.S., Kakizawa said,  adding he hopes negotiations for each working group will be  carried out simultaneously.    Japan will compile a second package of market-opening  measures by the end of June or early July.    Kakizawa said he will study whether or not to visit the U.S.  when Deputy Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi returns to Japan,  taking into account Diet schedules.    Kakizawa also told reporters he held talks with U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor on the phone prior to the news  conference.    In the talks, the two sides agreed to maintain close contact  in the course of the resumed framework negotiations, Kakizawa  said.    They agreed that it was good for both sides that they were  able to reach agreement on resuming the talks and were able to  deepen mutual understandings and create common understanding, he  said.    He said Japan and the U.S. were able to reach the accord to  resume the talks because both sides took a "realistic approach"  by putting an end to "theological" discussions.    Both Tokyo and Washington were also concerned that the  unstable economic relations between the two nations would have a  negative influence on overall bilateral relations, he said.</p>

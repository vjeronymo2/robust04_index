			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Prudence redefined The uncomfortable condition known to economists as structural adjustment is, it seems, to be visited on the hapless man from the Pru. From next January, the giant of the British life assurance business will cease to sell new 'industrial branch' policies - the technical description for door-to-door home sales of life assurance. Since industrial life policies are an expensive and largely anachronistic form of saving in the world of fax, phone and direct debit, the change is overdue. But it is a piece or social history for all that. The step also raises the question of why savings habits have responded so slowly to a changing economic environment. Industrial life assurance has always been open to the criticism that the man from the Pru and his ilk took a disproportionate bite out of the individual's savings before any money was actually invested. In the days of Victorian paternalism, this financial penalty arising from the need to remunerate the sales force was perceived as an antidote to working class fecklessness. Money ill-spent on a poor form of insurance was at least better spent than money in the pub. The man from the Pru was, in effect, selling the financial equivalent of cocoa. The fact that this technically inefficient - and latterly tax inefficient - practice survived into the prosperous 1990s must owe a great deal to the lack of transparency in the life assurance business itself. In the absence of adequate disclosure about the costs of a given policy - a deficiency now being addressed under the new financial services regime - less sophisticated savers had no reason to believe that they were substantially worse off than if they had invested elsewhere. Inflation, meantime, made the returns sound generous in relation to the money outlays over a lifetime of saving. In fairness to the insurers, it should also be said that the high level of investment returns in the postwar period helped mitigate the pain arising from the insurance companies' costs. Financial penalties Industrial branch business is now so small that if the whole of the insurance industry were to abandon it tomorrow, it would make little difference to the aggregate savings behaviour of the nation. But that does not mean that the less well off in the late 20th century are not subject to comparable financial penalties. As a recent paper on the distribution of wealth from the Institute for Fiscal Studies confirmed, less well-off households have invested disproportionately in interest-bearing accounts with banks and building societies. Since these are the most heavily-taxed forms of wealth, it is the state rather than the insurance companies that now fills the role of predator. This is just one indication of how strangely the taxation of savings fits with wider priorities. Another is the way that the savings of the better off have been biased by fiscal incentives towards illiquid, longer-term forms of investment such as home ownership and pensions. Despite growing labour market insecurity and disinflation in the housing market, the retreat from liquidity in savings remains pronounced. Savings behaviour Do such apparent imbalances matter? Perhaps not as much as they used to, in a macro-economic context, since surpluses and shortfalls of savings can now be readily made good in a world of global capital flows. Yet governments inevitably worry about the impact on their finances of underprovision by individuals for retirement and misfortune. And there are political arguments in favour of increasing people's stake in the productive assets of the economy. For private individuals, the balance between the precautionary motive for saving and the need to smooth out income to meet different consumption requirements over the course of a lifetime clearly does matter considerably. The case for tax neutrality between spending today and spending tomorrow is thus very powerful. Yet economic shocks are quite as important as fiscal sticks and carrots in changing savings behaviour. It was the great inflation of the post-war period that drove the British into one of the highest levels of home ownership in the developed world and into taking on what is now the highest level of mortgage debt to housing equity in living memory. And while fiscal incentives contributed greatly to the growth of the life assurance industry, it is the regulatory shock of disclosure that now seems likely to put an end to the industrial life assurance business, while causing an important if less dramatic upheaval in the forms of other of savings on which insurers rely for their revenues. The Prudential salesmen will not, admittedly, hang up their hats quite yet. There is an existing portfolio of policyholders to be serviced. And there are other jobs for these salesmen to do within the Pru itself. To that extent, the blow of structural adjustment is cushioned. But what of pride? As of yesterday the man from the Pru has been reduced to the status of an inefficient delivery system. That's the 20th century for you.</p>

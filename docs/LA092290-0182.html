			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JAPANESE LOOK TO EUROPE, STEP UP REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS IN LONDON  </P> <P> After gobbling up Hawaiian golf courses and Manhattan office towers, the  Japanese now have a craving for something European.  </P> <P> The investment opportunities are plentiful with European trade barriers  dissolving in 1992 and potential new markets opening up with the death of  communism in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The Japanese already have been stepping up their investments in Europe, with  development and construction groups, investment firms and life insurance  companies leading the way.  </P> <P> In European real estate alone, Japanese investments totaled $5.5 billion last  year, up from $3.1 billion in 1988, according to the Clark Whitehill accounting  firm in London. For all the years up to 1985, the total investment was only  $425 million, the firm said.  </P> <P> The Japanese are particularly keen on London, where investments topped $3  billion during 1989, the firm said. That compared with $2.8 billion spent in  New York and $2.6 billion in Los Angeles last year, according to data from  Clark Whitehill and the Kenneth Leventhal accounting firm in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Paris, Frankfurt, Madrid and Barcelona also had heavy levels of Japanese  investments.  </P> <P> Has the United States lost its allure to the Japanese? No way, experts say.  </P> <P> "A lot of the older players are now looking at Europe," said Daniel Schwartz,  managing director of the New York-based Ulmer Brothers investment bank.  </P> <P> "But they're being replaced by newer investors who are looking at the United  States for the first time."  </P></p>

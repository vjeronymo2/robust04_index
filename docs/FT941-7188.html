			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Iscor 74% ahead at half time Iscor, South Africa's iron, steel and coal producer, yesterday reported a 74 per cent rise in pre-tax profit for the half-year ended December. Pre-tax profit surged to R223m (Dollars 63m) from R128m. Higher sales, up at R4.77bn from R4.29bn, good cost containment which pushed operating margins to 7.7 per cent from 6.1 per cent, and a decline in finance charges to R157m from R179m were responsible for the improvement. Distributable profit rose to R215m from R125m, equivalent to earnings of 11.5 cents against 6.7 cents a share. The company is paying its dividend in shares, compared with a 2 cents cash interim dividend last year. Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said the group's main achievement was to show positive cash-flow for the first time in four years. Net borrowings were reduced to R1.93bn at December 31 from R2.06bn six months earlier. Iscor planned to cut debt by nearly 50 per cent by year-end.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Yang Qing (2799 7230) and Zhang Jinsheng (1728 </F> 6930 0524)]    [Text] Beijing, 4 Apr (XINHUA) -- The State Economic  Restructuring Commission today convened a meeting to exchange  experiences in coordinated reform gained by the Beijing First  Light Industry Corporation. Speaking at the meeting, Commission  Vice Minister Liu Zhifeng said: In light of their actual  conditions, all localities should learn from the corporation's  experiences and expand on them by conducting bold explorations  and constantly making innovations. In conjunction with the  experiment in setting up modern enterprises, the economic  restructuring commissions of provinces and cities should  concentrate on the experiment in conducting reform in a  coordinated way.    The meeting -- in which directors of the provincial and  autonomous regional economic restructuring commissions  throughout the country, the leaders of the relevant central  departments, and the principal leaders of cities directly under  the central government participated -- was held to study ways to  upgrade the state-owned sector of the economy, to advance reform  of state-owned enterprises in a coordinated way, to increase the  value of state-owned assets, to optimize the industrial  structure, to transform the functions of government departments,  to change the operating mechanisms of enterprises, and to train  and distribute surplus workers and staff members so as to  promote the establishment of a modern enterprise system. At the  meeting, Cui Zhian, chairman of the board of directors of the  corporation, briefed the participants on its experiences by  delivering a report entitled "Actively Push Ahead Coordinated  Reform To Explore New Ways for Invigorating State-Owned  Enterprises." The meeting was presided over by Huo Guanghui,  vice minister of the State Economic Restructuring Commission.  Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan also spoke at the meeting.    Cui Zhian said: Confronted with three problems -- a shortage  of funds, too many employees, and difficulties in taking an  inventory of assets -- the Beijing First Light Industry  Corporation explored many new paths in the course of deepening  enterprise reform: It developed high-grade light industrial  products; it shifted from developing secondary industries to  developing tertiary industries by building the China Glass  Center; it changed its operating mechanism by allowing a  state-owned company to be run by private manager on a trial  basis; it readjusted its structure by developing marketable  products; it changed its business operations in accordance with  the demands of a market economy. The explorations have yielded  preliminary results, which have promoted its expansion and its  economic performance. Last year, while a large number of  state-owned light industrial enterprises were having  difficulties, the corporation's output value was 2.98 billion  yuan, up 6.8 percent over the previous year; its sales income  was 3.49 billion yuan, up 24.2 percent over the previous year;  it paid 236 million yuan in taxes to the state, an increase of  16.3 percent; it made 167 million yuan in profit, up 61.7  percent, ranking first in profit growth rate among light  industrial enterprises in Beijing and the rest of the country.    Cui Zhian said: We have gained a five-point experience from  our reform in the past year: First, to solve the deep-seated  problems in state-owned enterprises, it is necessary to conduct  reform in a coordinated way. Second, the nucleus of building a  market economic system is the optimization of resource  allocation. Third, once a reform program is drawn up, it must  be implemented in a down-to-earth way. Fourth, good  ideological-political work is the guarantee of coordinated  reform. Fifth, coordinated reform must be supported in a  coordinated way.    Expounding on the basic reform experience of the Beijing  First Light Industry Corporation, Liu Zhifeng, vice minister of  the State Economic Restructuring Commission, said: Viewed from  the overall effort of deepening the reform of the economic  structure, the corporation's basic reform experience has three  outstanding features: First, in line with the requirements for  establishing a socialist market economic structure, the  corporation has given full play to the basic role of the market  in allocating resources under state macroeconomic regulation and  control. Second, it has organically integrated reform with  development and stability. In the course of deepening reform,  the corporation made vigorous efforts to resolve the  contradictions brought about by the readjustment of power and  interests, thus preserving social stability. Third, proceeding  from the deep-seated problems in state-owned enterprises, the  corporation carried out a systematic and coordinated reform  while at the same time solving problems in other areas, thus  achieving good results and pushing reform to a new level.    On how to learn from and apply the corporation's reform  experiences, Liu Zhifeng said: We should thoroughly understand  and master the corporation's basic experience and decide on a  specific program for readjusting economic structures and  transforming enterprises' operating mechanisms in light of the  local conditions; we should draw up a plan and implement it step  by step. In carrying out coordinated reform, local authorities  should draw up a unified plan and implement it in a unified way  under the unified leadership of city governments, and must guard  against rushing into mass action. In authorizing the management  of state-owned assets, it is necessary to proceed from reality  and to separate government functions from enterprise management.  We should do our best to innovate and transform operating  mechanisms. We should support coordinated reform in a  coordinated way. The principal leaders of governments and  economic restructuring departments, as well as other relevant  departments, should coordinate in advancing the reform.</p>

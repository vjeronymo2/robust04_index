			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Wesfarmers offers ADollars 275m for Bunnings Wesfarmers, the Australian diversified rural products and services group, yesterday announced a ADollars 275m-plus bid for the outstanding 51.9 per cent which it does not already own of Bunnings, the Perth-based forest products, manufacturing and merchandising company. The offer, which comprises a mixture of cash, shares and options, values the whole of Bunnings at more than ADollars 535m (USDollars 394m). Under the terms of the bid, Wesfarmers is proposing to offer ADollars 22.60 in cash plus two of its own shares and an option to subscribe for one Wesfarmers share at ADollars 12.50 by end-December 1997, in exchange for every four Bunnings shares held. It noted that this represented a premium over the average Bunnings market price of ADollars 9.53 during the past month, and a 'substantial increase' over the ADollars 3.55 a share offer which Wesfarmers made for Bunnings back in February 1992. The news came after the stock market closed yesterday; Wesfarmers shares were down 6 cents at ADollars 9.34, while Bunnings were 4 cents lower at ADollars 10.16. Wesfarmers, which first acquired an interest in Bunnings in 1987 and has had three board representatives since it raised its stake significantly in 1992, said it believed that Bunnings' future would 'be enhanced by being a wholly-owned member of the Wesfarmers' group', although it would continue to treat Bunnings as 'an independent business unit' with its own corporate identity. Wesfarmers' earlier offer for Bunnings, in 1992, was rejected by the target company. Last night, Bunnings reacted cautiously to the new bid, saying that the offer would be discussed at a board meeting today.</p>

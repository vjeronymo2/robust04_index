The special envoy  of Russia's president, Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin,  said so in an interview with INTERFAX before his departure for  Geneva.    According to him, "very intensive" consultations were  conducted in the past few days in the framework of preparations  for the Geneva round of talks. This issue was discussed at the  meeting between the Russian and American Presidents in Moscow,  and at the parallel negotiations between Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and the head of Russian diplomacy, Andrey  Kozyrev.    According to the diplomat, progress reached in the talks on  territorial concessions is the principal positive factor in the  efforts to resolve the crisis. Some 33.5 percent of the  territory in Bosnia-Herzegovina claimed by the Muslims have been  guaranteed to them at last. It was a key demand of the European  Union, and a top- priority issue at the talks, Churkin said.</p>

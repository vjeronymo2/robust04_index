The anti-Hungarian and anti-Jewish statements by the new  chairman of the Slovak National Party (SNS) Jan Slota, his talk  about the superiority of the state-forming Slovak nation, but  primarily the effort to "base the politics on the army" are  dangerous signals that the country "has tremendous problems with  democracy," Duray, a former dissident and chief leader of ethnic  Hungarians, said.    Duray accused the two strongest opposition parties -- the  Democratic Left Party (SDL) and the Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH) -- that they had lost interest in passing a  no-confidence vote in Meciar's government since they do not want  to assume the burden of the unpopular measures which must be  taken in the nearest future.    "The reluctance of the SDL and KDH and their maneuvering  create space for politicians of Slota's sort," Duray warned.    Duray voiced discontent with statements by KDH Deputy  Chairman Frantisek Miklosko on the "suicidal claims" on which  Hungarian ethnic parties make their parliamentary support of the  Slovak opposition conditional. Duray did not specify the claims.</p>

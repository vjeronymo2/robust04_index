			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] What is being planned for the Yemen of unity and  democracy, and what are the stands of its sons? We can  ascertain that the conspiratorial plans against the Yemeni  people and their unity are formidable. However, the united  Yemeni people know very well that the objective is not only to  fragment their unity but to ensure that the present and future  generations remain preoccupied with fighting and disputes to  keep Yemen engaged in futile conflicts.    One understands from the Arab and international moves on the  current events in our country that there is more to the  situation than meets the eye. There are those who support our  unity and our people's aspirations. There are those who,  surprisingly, adopt ambiguous stands. What is amazing, however,  are the underhanded stands adopted by some sides. In spite of  all this, our confidence in Almighty God will enable us to  settle what is taking place in our country. Our asset and  source of sustenance are our faith and our our people's abidance  by unity and their eagerness to defend constitutional  legitimacy. We also stress that our cause is purely a domestic  affair, something which the brothers and friends should  understand. Our acceptance of the proposals made by others is  not an acceptance of interferences which conflict with the UN  Charter and international laws, or harm our right to sovereignty  and independence.    From this premise, we say that the gang of rebellion and  treason, which has sold itself to the devil and sought to  destroy the homeland and people's means, and undermine their  unity will not succeed in attaining its designs and will not be  able to salvage its base goals. Irrespective of the magnitude  of the conspiracies and means available to the conspirators, our  people will not yield. It goes without saying that thanks to  our faith in our unity and respect for constitutional  legitimacy, which embodies our will and our insistence to defend  it, we will be capable of foiling all the attempts by those who  conspire against our unity and who wager on the dirty  secessionist clique which was discarded by the entire Yemeni  people.    It should be understood that our respect for the endeavors  that are made by international legitimacy comes from our belief  that they stem from sympathy for our causes. This is because we  are certain that the entire international community supports  Yemeni unity and constitutional legitimacy. There is no excuse  for any member of the international community to act otherwise  because the entire world, under the new world order, should  stand together to support peoples unity and democracy, and  protect human rights and freedom. We believe that the entire  international community supports Yemeni unity in line with the  stands of the UN Security Council permanent members which  support Yemeni unity, our democractic course, and our country's  approach to a free market economy.    While emphasizing the importance for the members of the  international community to support Yemeni unity and  constitutional legitimacy, we must also remind of the need to  respect the bases on which the new international order is being  established. We should all work to entrench its concepts and  enhance its traditions, far from motives stemming from interests  or hegemony.    There is no doubt that the international community members,  including the brothers, understand that what is taking place in  the Republic of Yemen, the internationally recognized united  political entity, is a domestic affair, and that the  constitutional legitimacy government acts in a reasonable manner  and in accordance with what its duties dictate and its sovereign  rights, which authorize it to combat rebellion and the  secessionist course of a treacherous and agent clique led by the  so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, who will be arrested and brought to  trial soon, God willing, so that he and his clique will receive  severe punishment for their crimes against the people and  homeland. God supports our people's decision and will make them  triumph in their struggle to protect their unity and safeguard  their dignity, democracy, and rights.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: Hong Kong - Other Markets The market looks set to fall further this week as fund managers continue to wind down their positions in Asian markets ahead of the year end, writes Louise Lucas. Brokers tentatively put the next resistance point for the Hang Seng index at 7,500, after a week that saw some 5.3 per cent sliced off its value, taking cumulative declines since the January peak to some 36 per cent. On Friday alone, the index lost 279.24 or 3.5 per cent, to 7,789.07. The downward plunge is attributed largely to redemption pressure on US funds, with portfolios worldwide dumping Asian stocks as desperately as they were buying them at this time last year. Asian markets are no longer repositories of the world's only growth story, and funds are being freed to plough into other equities and fixed income instruments. Fears of rising interest rates, exacerbated by Mr Alan Greenspan's comments last week, also continue to plague sentiment. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

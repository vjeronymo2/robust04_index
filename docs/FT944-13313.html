			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Zimbabwe may tell Oxfam to leave Oxfam, the UK charity, faces possible expulsion from Zimbabwe after an angry government response to its criticisms of the country's health policy. In a report* out this month, Oxfam accused the government of being partly to blame for a reversal of post-independence improvements in health, by cutting spending and imposing user fees. In parliament, Mr John Nkomo, social welfare minister, condemned the study as 'misleading, unscientific, and deliberately mischievous'. Its 'insinuations, distortions and deliberate falsification of figures are not acceptable.' Oxfam officials said last night they will be meeting the government in Harare next week, but declined to comment on Mr Nkomo's apparent expulsion threat. The report queries government claims that the country's structural adjustment programme makes adequate provision for protecting the health of the poor. 'Despite the mounting body of evidence showing a clear correlation between user fees and worsening health indicators, the government of Zimbabwe increased these fees and imposed more stringent conditions for their collection in January 1994,' the study says. Spending on health as a percentage of GDP has fallen to 2.7 per cent, according to Oxfam, the lowest since independence in 1980. 'Under pressure from the World Bank, the Zimbabwe government has increased expenditure since 1992,' says the report, noting 'a nominal increase in the 1992-93 budget amounted to a decline in real terms of around 20 per cent.' Government officials said Oxfam's local representatives had earlier been summoned by Dr Timothy Stamps, health minister; he is understood to have called for an apology and retraction. There is an overwhelming case for withdrawing user fees, says Oxfam: 'Unfortunately, the Zimbabwe government's policy is pulling in precisely the opposite direction, as witnessed by the sharp increase in user fees in January 1994.' Oxfam last night said it stood by the report. 'Our primary concern is relief from poverty; we cannot be expected to turn a blind eye to policies which result in the poor carrying the cost of macro-economic adjustments, however necessary they may be,' Mr Stewart Wallis, overseas director, said. Ironically, many of the findings are borne out by the government's own research. *Paying for health: Poverty and Structural Adjustment in Zimbabwe, by Jean Lennock.

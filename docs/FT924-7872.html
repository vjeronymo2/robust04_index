			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Retailers feature as Dow loses early gain Wall Street US SHARE prices failed to find their footing as the market gave up its early gains and ended the day virtually unchanged, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally off 0.54 at 3,239.79. New York SE volume was fairly heavy at 226m shares, while rises retained a small lead over declines by 901 to 862. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was just 0.67 up on balance at 422.87 and the Nasdaq composite, which has outpaced the wider market in recent sessions, lost 0.55 at 634.37. The day's economic news proved unexceptional for both stocks and bonds. Jobless claims for the week ended October 31 fell 5,000 to 355,000. Investors had been looking for an increase of about 10,000. The figures initially boosted stocks and depressed bonds, lifting long-term market interest rates, but they failed to make a lasting impression on either, and by midsession prices were narrowly mixed in both markets. Bond prices moved higher in late trading following a successful refunding auction. Third-quarter results lifted The Gap Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 33 5/8 after the clothing chain posted net income in line with analysts' expectations. The Limited, which reported slightly higher net income earlier this week, slipped Dollars 1/4 to Dollars 23 3/4 . Land's End fell Dollars 5 5/8 to a 52-week low of Dollars 24 1/4 on flat third-quarter profits after expectations of a substantial improvement. Federated Department Stores, which announced greatly improved third-quarter results on Wednesday, ended Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 17 3/8 after active trading. Vons, a West Coast supermarket chain, advanced Dollars 1 to Dollars 24 1/8 after revealing third-quarter net income of 51 cents a share. A year ago the company had earnings of 42 cents that included extraordinary gains of 10 cents. Union Texas Petroleum was the most active issue on the big board after Allied-Signal said it would sell 30m shares of the company for Dollars 18 1/4 apiece. The stock closed at Dollars 18 1/2 , up Dollars  1/8 on the day. Pharmaceutical issues continued to rally as the sector recovered from earlier fears that a Clinton administration would immediately curb drug prices. Merck, the biggest US drug company, led NYSE trading and put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 3/4 , Abbott Laboratories rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 29 3/4 and Pfizer firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 77 1/4 . Glaxo Holdings, however, dipped Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 24 3/4 . Canada TORONTO stocks ended mixed after moderately active dealings. The TSE 300 index shed 2.6 to 3,283.8 and volume amounted to 28.8m shares valued at CDollars 317.4m. Advances led declines by 283 to 268. The real estate sector index showed the biggest swing among the sub-groups, falling 2.98 per cent. Conglomerates were down 2.38 per cent and mining lost 1.38 per cent.</p>

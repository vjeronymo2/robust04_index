			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 7 (A.A.) -- Foreign Minister Hikmet  Cetin on Thursday [7 April] expressed support for Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) President Rauf Denktas.  Cetin said that Denktas' attitude toward the UN  confidence-building measures [CBM's] is justified and positive.  Cetin said that the TRNC is rightly reacting to additional  elements of the confidence-building measures and that this is  from whence the problem stems.    The confidence-building measures involve the opening of the  Lefkose [Nicosia] Airport to international traffic and the  inhabited Maras [Varosha] section to UN monitoring.    UN-sponsored intercommunal talks on Cyprus were interrupted  last July.    Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey conducted a  peace operation to the island following a Greek-backed coup  which attempted to annex the island to Greece and to annihilate  its Turkish Cypriot population.    The TRNC came to existence in 1983.</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House If institutional shareholder soundings are right - and no one last night was claiming otherwise - Hongkong Land's tender offer for Trafalgar House has been something of a damp squib. The expectation in the market is that, combined with Land's existing 14.99 per cent stake, the Far Eastern raiders may end up with little more than 15 per cent when the result is formally announced on Monday morning. It would be wrong, however, to see this as a ringing endorsement either of Trafalgar's existing management or their strategy. Long-term holders have suffered a series of disappointments in the past couple of years, but they appear to have taken the not unreasonable view that they would have been short-changed if they had sold out for 85p per share. Asset values are a highly unreliable guide in current markets, but there seems every chance that the events of the past few days can act as a catalyst for change. It could be that the top team at Trafalgar has the last laugh by announcing a Hanson-style extension of their contracts well into the next millennium. The issue, though, is more whether the reshuffle when it comes is cosmetic, or whether it will satisfy shareholders that the board has the vision to manage an international construction and engineering group with an increasing technological orientation. Investors will have to be patient but they cannot afford to be passive. At some point, for example, they may have to be prepared to support Land's nominations for directors.</p>

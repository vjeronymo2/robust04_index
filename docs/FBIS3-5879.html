			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 11 KYODO -- Japan's Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry has rejected a petition filed by  Japanese international telephone operators against discount-rate  services offered in Japan by U.S.-affiliated firms, an industry  official said Friday [11 March]. "The ministry saw no problems  under the current telecom rules after investigations based on  the complaint, virtually dismissing it," the official told KYODO  NEWS SERVICE.    The information was offered by "reliable government  sources,"  said Toshio Kawakami, president of USF Pacific Inc., a  Tokyo-based agent for us Fibercom Network Inc. in New York.    Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, a former  international phone monopoly, lodged the petition in January,  requesting the ministry conduct a probe into the "call-back"  discount services which they claimed use their lines unfairly,  free of charge.    A KDD spokesman said his company has not heard of the  decision from the ministry, and noted that the complaint filed  in January did not involve any requests for concrete measures.    "Its nature was to explain the problems and not something  that the ministry would reject."    The other Japanese concerns involved in the petition were  International Digital Communications Inc. and International  Telecom Japan Inc.    Under the call-back system, users call a switching center in  the United States and hang up after two rings. After a few  seconds, the center calls back and the users dial the actual  number they want to call, the country of "origin" of the call  now being the United States, where rates are lower.    Stressing that the services are not illegal, either  domestically or internationally, Kawakami said, "imposing  restrictions was from the outset impossible because the  Telecommunications Law would have to be revised to do so."    He added that the ministry would not want to create new  regulations now that Japan is pushing ahead with deregulation to  allow better access by foreign firms, in an attempt to address  trade disputes with the U.S.    After the complaint was filed, USF Pacific and some other  Japanese agents of U.S. discount operators issued a statement  in January, saying they were ready to talk if the Japanese  operators offered a "reasonable" line-usage charge.    They also warned that they were prepared to file a counter  petition with the U.S. Government if their services were  blocked.    The KDD spokesman said the discount service is becoming an  international problem, and "we just wanted the ministry to  recognize this."    He noted, "We also want to solve the problem through talks,  and if they fail, actual actions will be taken such as filing a  petition with the ministry to allow changing our rules  stipulated in contracts with users."    There still are no plans to start talks with the discount  service operators, the spokesman said, adding that KDD is now  consulting with U.S. common carriers including American  Telephone and Telegraph Co.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Arts: Antony and Cleopatra - Birmingham Rep/Shaw Theatre, NW1 Shakespeare's Antony and Cleopatra know their place in history. Like Virgil's earlier Dido and Aeneas and Racine's later Titus and Berenice, they know their deeds tip whole realms. That sense of consequence and scale is what I miss in these dissimilar stagings of this intoxicating play. The greatest flaw in the Birmingham Rep Antony is its most famous asset  - Sylvia Syms's Cleopatra. She brings to the great role a bourgeois self-importance, some four or five different moods, a transparently practised species of charm, a grande dame flamboyance, a heavy humour and some blurry consonants. Little chemistry between her and Malcolm Tierney is evident. Only when this Antony is dead and gone, in 'I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony,' does she at last - though, alas, not lastingly - discover stillness, lyricism and majesty. Tierney never lacks stillness; and his voice is impressively experienced and varied. He builds, from too understated a beginning, to a powerful and humane account of Antony's fluctuations. Like Syms, however, he does not always project fully into the Rep (so acoustically tricky). And his eyes - unlike his eyebrows - make almost no effect. John Adams has updated his Birmingham production to Napoleonic times. Roman classicism is replaced by French neoclassicism. By contrast, Egypt is more natural and timeless. Though this works better than a clever-clever programme essay led me to expect, it inevitably diminishes the play's resonance in our imagination and clutters our heads with superfluous ideas. In that respect, Roger Butlin's elegant Birmingham designs are no more effective than the tatty, minimal designs for Tim Hegarty's Commonweal production, at the Shaw. Cleopatra is where Commonweal is strongest. Granted, Susan Curnow does not have infinite variety; she lacks 'a tawny front'; I cannot imagine her hopping 'forty paces through the public street.' But, from her first appearance, it is plain that this Cleopatra is an Egyptian queen, that she and Antony are physically intimate, and that she knows she controls lives. I was fascinated by how she uses her supple neck and waist to hint occasionally at the flattened 2-D profiled positions of Egyptian bas-reliefs. She has clarity, spontaneity, bite and wit. Though the production is visually too shabby and could be more imaginative in its use of its few simple props, it keeps up a constant contrast between Rome and Egypt and builds up to a properly transcendent Liebestod glow. Not much else is memorable. Andrew McDonald is a tough, intelligent but unheroic Antony. Max Haffler's Enobarbus is an ordinary Northerner who recognises the wonder of the great people with whom he deals - more 'right' but also more dull than the harsh, bitter account at Birmingham by Eric Richard. Only one actor in either version has the complete measure of his role and Shakespeare's verse. This is, at Birmingham, Simon Dormandy as Caesar. He is by turns cold, compassionate, cerebral, self-righteous, forceful, appreciative, grand. Ambition gleams in his eye and voice. Destiny, too.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Videotron seeks partner to aid British cable TV expansion VIDEOTRON of Canada is seeking a third partner to help carry the growing cost of its aggressive entry into the British cable TV market. Mr Andre Chagnon, chairman of Videotron, who moved his communications group into British cable TV three years ago, said France's Cie Generale des Eaux was one of the potential investors, though he would give preference to a British company. Videotron, under pressure from the recession in its Canadian broadcasting and cable TV business, owns 63 per cent of the British venture and wants to reduce its stake to 51 per cent. BCE, which controls Bell Canada and Northern Telecom, owns 30 per cent. The British subsidiary, as an initial step, is investing about USDollars 150m in two licence areas in southern England. It will not become self-supporting for at least another two years, said Mr Chagnon. Though the investment per subscriber is higher than North America, cable rates are more generous and British cable companies have the right to sell telephone services and increase returns in the future. The UK operation has about 50,000 cable subscribers and the market potential is estimated at 1m. But to approach such a figure would require several hundred million dollars more in investment. National Sea Products, Canada's biggest fisheries company, posted a 1991 loss of CDollars 35.9m (USDollars 30m), or CDollars 1.70 a share, on sales of CDollars 439m because of poor catches and lower processing volume. It lost CDollars 2.2m, or 22 cents, on sales of CDollars 461m in 1990. The company said the outlook for 1992 was uncertain because of the federal government's plan to cut the northern cod quota from 185,000 tonnes to 120,000 tonnes to protect stocks. Northern cod makes up about one-quarter of National Sea's annual landings.</p>

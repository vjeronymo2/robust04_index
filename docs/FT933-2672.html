			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Indy chief Patrick Morrissey, the newly appointed chief executive of Newspaper Publishing group, currently engaged in a bitter cover-price battle with Rupert Murdoch's News International, was feeling rather circumspect yesterday. Andreas Whittam Smith's decision earlier this year to step aside as chief executive and devote more time to the task of editing The Independent, the daily newspaper he and two former Daily Telegraph colleagues launched in 1986, surprised some media-watchers. For one thing, there were no immediately obvious candidates to follow in his footsteps. The headhunters got to work. One firm, Tyzack and partners, had already approached some younger candidates before Morrissey, who is 52, was finally selected. Tyzack conversed with one budding newspaper tycoon, who was rather piqued to be informed that the salary was in the region of Pounds 85,000 - a sum he considered rather paltry for the job. Morrissey yesterday told Observer he did not wish to discuss the terms agreed between himself and Newspaper Publishing. Nor would he be drawn on how he plans to combat Murdoch's soaraway price-slashing Times, now only 30p against The Independent's 45p. 'I think it's a very interesting new tactic in the market,' he said - quite an independent view, given Whittam Smith's recent tirades against Murdoch's marketing.</p>

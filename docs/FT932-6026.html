			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Independent board for S African Broadcasting PRESIDENT FW de Klerk yesterday announced the appointment of the first independent board of governors for the state-owned South African Broadcasting Corporation, for decades the mouthpiece of the ruling National party. The new 25-member board, chosen on recommendations by an independent multi-racial panel of jurists, is to be chaired by Professor Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, a respected academic and former liberal politician. The board is charged with ensuring the impartiality of the SABC before the country's first multi-racial elections, due by April next. Constitutional negotiators plan to announce an election date on Thursday. Yesterday, Mr de Klerk met Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, to discuss the board appointments before the final announcement. This underlined increasing co-operation by the government and the ANC on such issues of state. The new board includes Mr Christo Viljoen, the outgoing chairman, Prof Pieter Potgieter, Dutch Reformed Church moderator, Mr Enos Mabuza, a black businessman, and Ms Brigalia Bam, an official of the ANC-aligned South African Council of Churches. They were chosen on recommendations by an independent panel accepted by political parties across the range. The panel held public hearings to screen candidates short-listed from 400 nominations. Controversy arose after the president had rejected the panel's first recommendations, which included left-wing nominees with a high political profile, such as Mr Jakes Gerwel, radical rector of the University of the Western Cape, left-wing journalists Mr Moeletsi Mbeki and Mr Khaba Mkhize, and Mr Allister Sparks, a former Rand Daily Mail editor. Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela also discussed progress at the constitutional talks, due to end on Thursday with announcement of a package including an election date and the outline of an interim constitution.</p>

			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Tax shelters on offer A WELTER of tax shelters hit the market this week. Full tax relief at the top marginal rate is available on investments in Enterprise Zone properties, and in Business Expansion Scheme companies. If you have a large tax bill and wish to reduce it, these are the most effective, and in many cases the safest, ways to do so. However, few of them make much sense as investments in their own right - you should think of them solely as tax-planning tools. The BES is the more accessible. The maximum you can invest in BES companies during any tax year is Pounds 40,000, and you have to maintain that investment for five years to gain the tax benefits. For many people, 'buy back' companies make most sense, because they limit risk. A BES company buys accommodation on behalf of a third party  - usually a college or a housing association - and receives in return a covenant to buy back the property at a fixed price after five years. Provided the third party does not go bankrupt in the meantime, and can raise the money, risk is minimised. However, housing associations and colleges are not big financial institutions, and sponsors are now attempting to arrange financing for the 'buy-back' in advance. The latest BES offers are: BESSA UKC (II), sponsored by Close Brothers, will buy property for the University of Kent at Canterbury. The buy-back price will be Pounds 1.35 for every Pounds 1 spent now. BESSA LSE, to be launched next week, will buy property for the London School of Economics. Govett BES Assetbuilder 2 is one of the most ingenious schemes. Sponsored by John Govett, it will buy accommodation for the Shaftesbury Housing Association, which will buy the properties back in five years at a price of Pounds 1.34 for every Pounds 1 spent now. A guarantee from NatWest effectively ensures that Shaftesbury will meet its obligation. The deal should only fail if Shaftesbury collapses completely. Great Western Assured Growth, sponsored by Dartington, has a buy-back agreement from Knightstone housing association at Pounds 1.40 for every Pounds 1 spent now, for accommodation in Somerset. It is already trading as a BES company, so tax relief should be claimable more quickly, effectively raising the return. There is no additional banking guarantee. The Enterprise Zone market is still confused. Supply is constricted because several EZs have lost their status, the ten-year term for tax exemption having finished. Also, there are more sponsors seeking to launch syndicated 'trusts' - which allow small investors to buy a share of a large building, rather than buy a smaller building outright. With more sponsors looking to make deals over smaller numbers of properties, final offers have been delayed. Four EZTs are on the market at present: Concept Britannia Teesside is the first EZ trust from Neill Clerk, a Scottish solicitor which previously specialised in the BES. It will buy eight office units in the Middlesbrough Enterprise Zone. EZT2, from Collective Investments, has bought seven warehouses in the North West Kent zone. Its trustees will be based offshore, in Guernsey. Laser Richmount Telford, a trust seeking to invest Pounds 30m in two large office buildings in Telford, this week announced that it had arranged a fixed rate loan facility with the Bank of Scotland. This means that the investment can be effectively self-financing for those investors who do not need income. About Pounds 17m has been invested so far. PET 17, managed by Property Enterprise Managers, will buy an office block in Salford, in a deal worth Pounds 3.404m. There is a 25-year lease to the developer, Quorum Estates, and a five-year bank guarantee from County NatWest. It is not safe to wander into the world of specialised tax loopholes without professional guidance. Guides to EZ investment are available from the Allenbridge Group (071-409-1111) and from John Harrison of Investment and Tax Publishing Services (0234-218740). But if you do want to take action, do so before the end of the tax year.</p>

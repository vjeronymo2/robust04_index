			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yen Tz'u (6056 5417): "Shanghai Speeds Up </F> Transition Toward Its Goal of Becoming an International  Financial Center'"]    [Text] Editor's note: In early 1992, Shanghai  clearly set forth its strategic goal of developing into "an  international financial center" by the year 2010, including this  in its urban development plans. In a short two years, Shanghai  has first achieved spectacular breakthrough advances in  expanding its money market scale.  <H5>  Shanghai Makes Plans in 1992 for Developing Into a </H5> "Financial Center"    Financial reform had become imperative for China as to  needs,  such as marketizing the Chinese economy, spurring the economy  "onto an international track," and taking better part in world  economic circulation. The choice of a location with geograpahic  advantages and a sizeable industrial base, in which to carry out  this reform first, by developing a standardized money market,  had become an especially important "contact" linking China to  the outside world. The Chinese economy's decade-plus of  developments and realities had determined this choice to be  Shanghai.    Deng Xiaoping, who had celebrated the Spring Festival in  Shanghai for seven or eight years in a row, has always paid  attention to Shanghai's reform and economic development. He  pointed out in 1991 that: "Finance is very important, being the  crux of a modern economy. Just as Shanghai used to be a  financial center, a place of currency convertibility, it will be  so again in the future. If China is to acquire international  standing in finance, it will have to rely first on Shanghai."  He went on to say that "we must begin now." In fact, while  Shanghai was fully capable of undertaking this important  mission, having conducted certain financial reforms earlier than  the rest of China, it has taken genuinly bold reform steps only  in the last two or three years. In early 1992, Shanghai  clearly set forth its strategic goal of developing into "an  international financial center" by the year 2010, including this  in its urban development plans.    Through a burst of effort, Shanghai has first achieved  spectacular breakthrough advances in expanding its money market  scale.    The signs show that a long- and short-term money market  system in mostly areas, such as securities, lending, and foreign  exchange conversion, has begun to take shape in Shanghai. The  Shanghai Stock Exchange has over 420 member companies everywhere  throughout China. It has nearly 200 listed securities, of which  140 are listed stocks, almost one-third of which are in outside  companies that were sold to foreigners. In 1993, its stock  trading value topped 500 billion yuan, up seven times from 1992.  On 11 March 1994, its stock trading value set a one-day record  of 3.9 billion yuan, RMB and similarly hereinafter).  Shanghai's stock market has become a veritable national  market. Some hold that it is already showing signs of becoming  a large Far Eastern and world-class market.  <H5>  Foreign Banks Swarm to Shanghai's Bund </H5>   In 1993, Shanghai loaned over 232.9 billion RMB, while  discounitng and rediscounting by Shanghai financial institutions  amounted to more than 22 billion RMB. Its lending net has spread  from the eastern zone to all of China.    The most recent figures show that Shanghai's foreign  exchange  conversion center conducted transactions in 1993 worth $5.294  billion, making 1993 its biggest year since its opening in 1988.  In the first seven trading days of 1994, its foreign exchange  conversion transactions reached $126 million, making for a brisk  and stable foreign exchange market. To help Sino-foreign joint  ventures avoid risks, Shanghai also began foreign exchange  futures services in 1993, with the Shanghai branch of the Bank  of China recently establishing a "foreign exchange treasure"  service with a more than 10-percent discount for individual  foreign exchange transactions, immediately invigorating  individual foreign currency trading, with the first 10 days of  1994 bringing a transaction value of nearly $2 million. This  conversion center has also completed its linkup with six key  domestic cities. The first national foreign exchange market  established on these grounds will open soon.    In the near future, Shanghai's decisive money market  standing  and role in China and even the Far East will be emphasized  similarly by the international business world. Foreign banks and  financial institutions have competed to swarm into Shanghai in  recent years, becoming a large part of Shanghai's landscape.    Since financial institutions, such as Japan's Sanwa Bank and  Societe Generale, the U.S. Huaqi [5363 2475] Bank, France's  Oriental Exchange Bank, Britain's Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking  Corp, and the Sino-foreign joint ventures of the Shanghai-Paris  International Bank and the Shanghai International Financial  Corp, were allowed to set up branches in Shanghai in 1991,  foreign financial institutions have come one after another to  set up on Shanghai's Bund. By now, 26 foreign banks have  opened branches in Shanghai, with 56 others from throughout the  world having set up representative offices in Shanghai, waiting  for permission to "upgrade." Shanghai has become mainland  China's province or municipality with the most foreign and  domestic financial institutions, with statistics showing that by  the end of 1993, foreign financial institutions had assets in  Shanghai totaling $3.2 billion, or three times that of 1992.  Shanghai had by the end of 1993 a foreign exchange deposit  balance of $470 million, and a foreign exchange loan balance of  $1.296 billion, both of which figures were up 150 percent from  1992.  <H5>  Shanghai's "Bund" Regains Its Significance </H5>   Shanghai's existing over 6,600 foreign-funded enterprises  undoubtedly provide forceful business support for foreign  financial institutions. Foreign banks act as intermediaries in  attracting foreign investment to Shanghai, as well as providing  services for the Shanghai region in areas, such as export  settlement and import accounting. In the last one or two years,  foreign financial institutions have used their respective  advantages to participate enthusiastically with international or  Chinese banking consortiums in lending, in support of Shanghai's  large and mid-sized state enterprise production. For  instance, 10 Sino-foreign financial institutions, such as the  Netherlands Trading Bank, leading the way, the Shanghai Pudong  Development Bank, and the Lyons Credit Bank, have participated  in financing, providing $50 million in seven-year commercial  loans to Pudong's Waigaoqiao power plant; the Shanghai branch of  the BOC has taken the lead in foreign bank participation in  providing loans to projects, such as $60 million to Shanghai's  Yongxin Color Display Imaging Corp Ltd. Since the U.S.  Friendship Insurance Company began operation in Shanghai, its  business has become ever brisker, making it a strong competitive  adversary to Shanghai's existing state-owned insurance  companies. In early 1994, the U.S. Huaqi Bank was the first to  move its Chinese head office from Hong Kong to Shanghai. While  the French Lyons Credit Bank has just been officially named, its  first action involved its Chinese head office. All of this  shows that Shanghai is actually already demonstrating the  standing and role of a regional financial center.    In order to step up to its goal of becoming an  "international  financial center," Shanghai is now taking a series of steps to  speed up this process.    The "Bund" is a symbol of the international significance of  the metropolis of Shanghai. Its cluster of tall buildings in  grand style towering along the banks of the Huangpu Jiang  [River] has played roles varying with the changing times. At  one time, it was seen as a symbol of "imperalist aggression."  Later, its fine regional environment made it a tourist  destination. However, its genuine role in setting off  Shanghai's march toward achieving its goal of becoming a modern  international metropolis needs reacknowledged.  <H5>  A Financial District Rebuilds on the Banks of the Huangpu </H5> Jiang    Records show that of the tall buildings towering along the  Bund, 113 were originally bank buildings, making the Bund the  site of old Shanghai's most concentrated financial institutions.  Since Shanghai set its goal of developing into an  "international financial center," the Bund has been included in  its development plans, to be developed along with the "small  Lujiazui" district across the river into Shanghai's "central  business district." Its row of tall buildings is being returned  to their true "financial" colors. So at the end of 1993,  Shanghai set up the "Shanghai Municipal Building Replacement  Corporation." This company will sell these large buildings in  forms, such as invitation of bids, auctions, and agreements.  Once this news was released, domestic financial institutions  rushed to get in on it first, with the former "Central Bank"  that later became the location of the "Spaceflight Tower" now  becoming the "China Foreign Exchange Trading Center," and the  Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China  occupying a key location. The Shanghai Municipal Government  has now built a tower in People's Square, and is expected to  move its offices there within the year from their current  location (the former Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp tower).  When Shanghai's foreign financial institutions heard the news,  they also came in streams to make arrangements. Banks such as  the U.S. Morgan Bank and Huaqi Bank, the Swiss National Bank,  the French Lyons Bank, and the Oriental Exchange Bank, were the  first to take action. It is understood that Shanghai is drawing  up the first draft of a legal document concerning the many  problems involved in the Bund's building replacement, to help to  standardize the work.    Speeding up the computerization of its banking industry is  also an effective step being taken by the Shanghai Municipal  Government. Since the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China put  out Mainland China's first credit card, the "Great Wall Card,"  in 1987, five credit cards from various banks are now in  circulation, with cardholder consumption topping 1 billion RMB a  year. But as cardholding by special business firms and  available ATMs were still too small-scale, the Shanghai branch  of the People's Bank of China set up and organized in 1993 the  Shanghai Credit Card Network Corp Ltd, to issue "Gold Cards." By  the end of 1993, it had begun to complete the establishment of  an ATM/POS joint-network information system. Once all credit  cards throughout Shanghai are linked to this network, there will  be a new market order. In addition, the various categories of  services available to Shanghai banking circles over the  long-distance satellite communications system are growing  steadily. The Shanghai Stock Exchange's long-distance  communications network has now linked up all provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions except for the Taiwan  region, with its transaction and settlement accuracy and speed  already up to the most advanced world stock market level of T +  0 [formula as published].    Moreover, Shanghai's promotion of reform to convert  specialized banks to commercial ones is also now in intense  progress. In the new Pudong zone, the operating style of the  11 biggest Chinese-owned financial institutions througout China  is already quite flexible, with the Shanghai, Pudong Development  Bank, operating completely according to international banking  standards, being China's first local shareholding bank. In less  than a year after its establishment, its assets have reached 6  billion RMB, drawing increased public respect.    Driven by rapid money market development, Shanghai's related  intermediary service agencies, such as stock companies,  accounting, auditing, and legal offices, credit evaluators,  notaries, arbitrators, and information advisors, are also  developing very quickly, ranking first in China as to numbers,  thus forming a quite complete service system.</p>

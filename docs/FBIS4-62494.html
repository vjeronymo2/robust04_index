			<p>BFN     [Text] Residential housing construction is a complicated  matter, not only for a newly independent republic, but for any  other developed nation. For this particular reason, measures  envisaged by the president's decree and the law on residential  housing are targeted at both creating a national housing market  and promoting construction. One of the specific steps in this  direction is setting up a housing banks network which will make  low rate mortgages available for building detached houses and  blocks of apartments. These banks will give priority in  granting mortgages to people in great need of housing.    For the first time ever, mortgages will be given if secured  against property collaterals. The state-owned housing will be  built only for the socially unprotected groups of the  population. Currently six housing banks are being set up in the  Republic. One of them is located in Kokshetau. Now its  leadership, together with the oblast administration and national  bank's directorate, is training personnel and looking for  finance. The oblast will now have 15 banks.</p>

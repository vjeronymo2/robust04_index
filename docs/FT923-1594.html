			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Once again Opec shoots itself in the foot - Neil Buckley examines the tensions now surfacing in the oil producers cartel OIL PRICES continued to drift lower yesterday, on uncertainty following Iran's refusal to sign the agreement reached by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last week and Ecuador's announcement that it intended to leave the cartel. Brent crude for October delivery fell 15 cents on the day to Dollars 20.20 - leaving it about 30 cents lower than before Opec's ministerial monitoring meeting in Geneva. The markets' uncertainty is understandable. Last week's meeting again demonstrated Opec's capacity for shooting itself in the foot. Even pessimistic Opec-watchers had forecast an easy meeting. In theory, all members had to do was quickly agree to hold production at current levels of around 24.3m barrels a day - allowing a little more for Kuwait - and then either roll over their February/May production ceiling of 22.98m b/d and continue to ignore it, or formally raise the ceiling to a more realistic level of, say, 24.5m b/d. That, analysts believed, would have given oil prices an upwards shove of up to Dollars 1 a barrel in the face of expected higher demand in the fourth quarter. Opec members could have gone home ready to fight another day - namely in November, when thornier issues such as members' market shares, and how to deal with the eventual return of Iraq to the export market are expected to be discussed. Instead, Opec wrangled for two days, emerging with a somewhat wishy-washy communique which one member refused to endorse, and with another member threatening to pull out of the organisation. The final irony was that Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the Iranian oil minister and Opec's fiercest price hawk, actually managed to talk oil prices down 40 cents through his comments after the meeting. The markets may yet change their mind, however. As one analyst in Geneva put it: 'This was actually a good deal, poorly packaged.' Analysts and traders both believe that while oil prices did not get an immediate boost from the Opec meeting, they will start to rise on strong market fundamentals in the next few weeks. Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said he saw Brent crude reaching Dollars 22 before Opec's next meeting in November. Opec's communique pledged its fourth-quarter 'market share' should be 24.2m b/d, with Kuwait allowed to continue to increase output. The aim was 'to attain the minimum reference price of Dollars 21 a barrel' for the Opec basket of crudes (equivalent to more than Dollars 22 for Brent crude). With estimates of fourth-quarter demand for Opec oil, including production and stocks, at more than 25m b/d, this should produce a tight market. Oil stocks, moreover, are at a four-year low. The big question is whether Opec will stick to the agreement. Traders were, for example, concerned about the use of the vague phrase 'market share' instead of 'production ceiling' in the communique. Opec ministers were anxious to play down the significance of this. Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, suggested it was simply a term 'that comes at the end of the day when most people are very tired. 'It is a ceiling,' he added. A more serious concern is possible 'leakage'. But those countries who have surplus capacity - apart from Kuwait, which will increase production by up to 300,000 b/d as it rebuilds its oil industry - are seen by analysts as unlikely to lift production significantly. Iran's Mr Aghazadeh said he had 'no intention' of doing anything to disrupt the market, in spite of his criticisms of the agreement. He said Iran would adjust production according to world demand. Analysts suggest Iran is likely to continue to produce at between 3.2m and 3.4m b/d, and are sceptical of its claims that it already has capacity of 4m b/d. Mr Nazer of Saudi Arabia refused to comment on production plans, but the kingdom is not seen increasing production much above the 8.4m b/d it claimed in August. The sting in the tail at last week's meeting was, however, Ecuador's announcement that it intended to give up full membership of Opec and seek to become only an associate member - the first country to do so since Opec was formed in 1960. Mr Andres Barreiro Vivas, Ecuador's energy minister, said the matter would be discussed at Opec's next meeting in Vienna. Ecuador's ostensible reason for leaving is that it is unhappy with its quota and wants to increase oil revenues to help pay off its Dollars 13bn foreign debt. Paris-based consultants Cambridge Energy Research Associates suggests Ecuador may be wondering if its hopes for economic improvement would be better served by other organisations such as the International Monetary Fund, where not being an Opec member could strengthen its negotiating position. In itself, Ecuador's withdrawal would be unlikely to have more than a symbolic impact on Opec. It is the second-smallest producer, with only 1.3 per cent of total output. The danger, however, is that other members suffer from the same revenue constraints and frustration about Opec's failure to raise prices. Gabon and Qatar are seen as most likely to be tempted to follow Ecuador's lead, but Mr Peter Bogin of CERA says even this would not cause serious harm to Opec. 'The only people that really matter in Opec are the big producers. It has been an organisation of six members and not 13 for some time now.' However, Mr Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, suggests larger producers such as Nigeria or Venezuela might also be tempted to follow Ecuador, which could pose a serious threat to Opec. 'These countries see themselves as weak and uninfluential members who just turn up, take a lot of abuse from the Gulf countries and go home. They may start to think hard about what's in it for them.'</p>

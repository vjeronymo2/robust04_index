			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 13 -- The Ukrainian Embassy in Warsaw  has sent a note to the Polish Foreign Ministry concerning the  film entitled "Za Polske Trzeba Walczyc" (One Has to Fight for  Poland) broadcast by the Polish Television on March 31.  According to Ukrainian authorities the film carries  anti-Ukrainian overtones.    "We would not want this to be repeated, we do not want a  propaganda war," Ukrainian Embassy attache Teodozij Starak told  PAP Wednesday. Starak directed attention to press comments  preceding the film which spoke of "battles with the German,  Ukrainian and Soviet occupiers." "We have not reacted to any  other articles in the press, but this film was shown on state  television," Starak added.    According to the embassy, such films do not serve the  development of positive relations between Ukraine and Poland.    "Its not state television, its public television," Foreign  Ministry Press Secretary Grzegorz Dziemidowicz commented. The  Polish Foreign Ministry will take up a position on the matter in  a few days, after having viewed the film, and listened to expert  opinions.</p>

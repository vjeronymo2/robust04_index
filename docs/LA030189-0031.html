			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Boeing 747 cargo door suspected of popping open during a United Airlines  flight and hurling nine passengers to their deaths had a recent history of  problems, investigators say. The forward cargo door on the 18-year-old 747 that  ripped open at 22,000 feet Friday after leaving Honolulu for Auckland, New  Zealand, had electrical problems more than once in December and had to be  closed manually, Lee V. Dickinson, investigator for the National Transportation  Safety Board, said at a news briefing in Honolulu. A seal on the same door was  repaired in January, he said. United spokesman Rob Doughty said the electrical  problems are not considered serious and were on a list of deferred items that  do not affect the airworthiness of the plane.  </P></p>

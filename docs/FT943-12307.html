			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / People: Fresh partners for new strategic consultancy Some small but significant ripples in the world of London-based management consultancies. The Strategic Partnership, in operation only since the beginning of this year, under Peter Smith, 56, as its chief executive, has appointed two big guns to its advisory board. They are Thomas Frost, 61, former group chief executive of National Westminster Bank, now chairman of The London Clearing House, and John Stopford, 54, who holds the chair of international business at the London Business School. Besides a love of orchids, Frost carries with him a wealth of banking experience, having first joined Westminster bank (as it then was) in 1950. Among his many business activities, Frost was also a member of the advisory board of the British-American chamber of commerce, between 1987-1993. A trained engineer, Stopford first started on an academic career in 1968, with posts at the Manchester and then Harvard business schools. He was a non-executive director of Shell (UK) between 1973-77, but before that had gained early hands-on business experience by managing a Booker-McConnell subsidiary in Guyana. He has also worked for the United Nations, and still works as a government adviser in developing countries such as Mongolia and Thailand. Before establishing his new consultancy, Smith was a communications consultant with Burson-Marsteller's City and Corporate Communications branch. Meanwhile, Paul Thornton has left PA Consulting group and Chris French departed Proudfoot, to found a new management consultancy, the French Thornton Partnership. They intend focusing on companies attempting to make greater use of information technology.</p>

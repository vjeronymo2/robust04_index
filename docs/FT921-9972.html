			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Books: Bewilderment in eastern Europe THE RELUCTANT PRESIDENT: A POLITICAL LIFE OF VACLAV HAVEL by Michael Simmons Methuen Pounds 16.99, 229 pages ALBANIA'S NATIONAL LIBERATION STRUGGLE: THE BITTER VICTORY by Reginald Hibbert Pinter Publishers Pounds 30, 269 pages VANISHING BORDERS by Michael Farr Viking Pounds 15.99 AS THE republics of the former Soviet Union attempt to shake off three quarters of a century of communist rule, the governments of eastern Europe are trying to create stable democratic institutions. The task is not only difficult. For those who rule, it is often lonely. Most of the presidents or prime ministers of these countries have had no political experience. Moreover, they are presiding over societies which are trying to reconstitute politics based on checks and balances, on accountability, on the rule of law, and on a free press. But as Michael Simmons shows in his biography of President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, attempts at reconciling democratic practices with political inexperience and opportunism are easily manipulated. Havel, perhaps all too slowly, is discovering that morality and integrity, the underlying themes of many of his plays, are not virtues shared by politicians. Since becoming president in the summer of 1990, the former playwright/philosopher has seen how the Velvet Revolution which toppled the communists from power in November 1989 has been replaced with a political creed tainted by nationalism, populism and revenge for the past. Slovakia, which Havel has tried very hard to feel wanted by Prague, the capital of the Czech Lands, remains fertile ground for authoritarian nationalists/separatists, particularly Vladimir Meciar, the republic's former prime minister. In Prague, the rise of the right, which sees itself as the national guarantor of the new moralism, wants all those who signed any police document since 1968 to be excluded from the civil service. This could polarise Czech and Slovak society and hinder the country's road to stable democracy. Throughout this biography, Simmons gives the impression that Havel does not really enjoy trying to bring Czechoslovakia along that road. I wonder what kind of plays and essays the reluctant president will write when he retires. Whoever can bring Albania out of its current state of anarchy will deserve more than financial assistance from the G7 group of industrial nations. Albania is now a country beset by bandits, looters and instability. Many aid workers have recounted how their medicine trucks have been ransacked by people who are either clearly starving, or else, pace Harry Lime, are requisitioning these vital supplies to support themselves on the black market. Albania, one of Europe's oldest peoples, was not always a den of thieves; nor, for that matter, was it a traditionally stable region in the Balkans, subject as it was to constant interference by the European powers, as Reginald Hibbert shows in this fascinating, if densely written, account of his months in Albania in late 1943. Parachuted in by the Special Operations Executive (SOE) Hibbert and his colleagues, including Alan Hare, Peter Kemp, David Smiley, were supposed to continue earlier SOE missions, which started in 1941 with the aim of fermenting rebellion against Italian rule in Albania. The British assisted the Partisans, grouped under the late Enver Hoxha, just as they supported Tito's Yugoslav Partisans. But towards the end of the war British policy towards Albania became inconsistent and in the end fatal for the Albanian people. By the end of 1944, Whitehall policy was torn between the needs of the military and SOE establishment, which was committed to defeating Germany and therefore to supporting Hoxha's Partisans, and the Foreign Office, which was then preparing to check the communist advance in eastern Europe before Nazism had been defeated. Hibbert shows how Hoxha capitalised on this dualist approach. ' Vanishing Borders is a lovely guide through parts of central Europe. Farr is at his best in eastern Germany, where the shock of the vanished Wall has left, if not quite nostalgia, then a certain bewilderment about how the east Germans should deal with their history and identity, as the new united Germany approaches the millennium.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Impeachment under way for Argentine court ARGENTINA'S Congress is to begin impeachment proceedings against the Supreme Court a week after Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, publicly accused two of the nine-member justices of theft and corruption. The impeachment committee of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of Congress, voted unanimously on Wednesday to investigate Mr Cavallo's allegations as a preliminary step to possible impeachment. The political offensive against the Supreme Court is taking place against the background of President Carlos Menem's battle to win the backing of two-thirds of Congress to lift the constitution's ban on successive presidential terms. Mr Menem wants to continue in office after his six-year term ends in July 1995. However, talks yesterday with the opposition Radical party broke down, making it more likely that Mr Menem will call a plebiscite next month on the issue. The government has denied charges that the court has become a bargaining chip in negotiations with the Radicals. Opposition members of the impeachment committee want all nine justices impeached for lack of independence from the government. The Peronists only want to impeach Mr Enrique Petracchi and Mr Augusto Belluscio, the two justices accused by Mr Cavallo. He alleges they have benefited directly from Supreme Court rulings, notably those in which the state was ordered to pay large fees to lawyers acting on its behalf. He says fees due to lawyers in pending cases could exceed Dollars 4bn. Both judges - who last month said pro-government Supreme Court colleagues had 'stolen' a ruling against the central bank and tried to replace it with a favourable one - have issued writs against Mr Cavallo, accusing him of slander, a crime which carries jail terms of six months to three years.</p>

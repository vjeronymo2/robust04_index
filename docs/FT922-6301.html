			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: When gentlemen prefer bonds No, this isn't another expression of support for Norwich Union. It is an examination of the Cobbold project to merge the pound and the French franc. It is not very likely to happen, but it does raise some interesting questions (one of them which concerns gentlemen and bonds). The Cobbold of the project is not the former Governor of the Bank of England, who would surely have hated it; in 1955, when another European monetary venture was being floated, he warned R. A. Butler against getting 'tied up to something very like Gold Standard practice'. It comes from his son David, the present Lord Cobbold, who runs his own currency specialist firm. The idea is ostensibly to start monetary union somewhere, now, and no doubt to dish the Bundesbank too. There is a suspicious numerical neatness to the thing: with a minimal effort, as Cobbold likes to point out, we could merge at Fr10 to the pound; we could call our florin a franc, and they could call Fr10 un livre. Well, yes; and the number of my house is a perfect square, as it happens. But the idea does have some serious merits. It's politically neat: both our prime ministers are strong currency men, and impatient with German constraints on recovery. It would involve an independent central bank which would have appealed strongly to the first Lord Cobbold, and would be good for credibility. Above all, our pooled currencies and pooled reserves would be impressively large, and might free us from the need to follow monetary policies devised in Frankfurt. In short, we could cut interest rates (if we could persuade our newly liberated central bankers to agree). It may be a sidetrack on the road to a European money, if you happen to believe that we will ever arrive there; but it could still be, as Senator Warren Rudman claimed for his US budget-balancing bill, 'a bad idea whose time has come'. But would it work? Not if you accept the fashionable theory that short-term interest rates are simply a function of exchange rate expectations; but this theory, again, seems to me a good deal too neat for its own good. It overlooks a couple of significant facts. First, there wasn't a sterling crisis in the weeks before the British general election. This must effect expectations; according to the theory, interest rates should have moved sharply. They didn't. And this is not just a special case. European money rates, having converged strongly, are now becoming de-coupled, as some alert brokers have remarked. This could, of course, reflect nothing but growing doubts about the EMU project; but in my experience, dealers give little thought to such distant matters. In any case, the drift can be explained purely from market facts. Consider the dollar: US short rates, thanks to the Fed, are absurdly out of line, but bond rates are quite comparable with ours. Then note the recent behaviour of the currency markets. They used to defy the central banks to resist market forces; now they respond tamely to any official hint. Dealers behave differently because their orders have changed. The banks used to employ them to play the markets; now they are risk-averse, and insist that exposures must be cleared by closing time. This reduces liquidity, and so enables short-term rates to decouple. The gentlemen who run pension funds, investment trusts and the like are by contrast immune to this epidemic of fright. On the contrary, they buy foreign securities in the name of safety, to spread their risks; and what they like, when equities look a bit too demanding, as on Wall Street, or accident-prone, as in Tokyo, is bonds, which have a predictable return and huge liquidity. So though hot money has cooled, investment funds continue to flow. Bond rates are likely to stay in step - to the distress of the Fed, which cannot get investment going despite ever lower money rates. So Cobbold's Franc Sterling might well float quite securely to lower short rates. We might even be able to go it alone. Pity it won't happen.</p>

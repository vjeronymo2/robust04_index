			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Aggressive Kwik Save rewarded with 6% rise: 'Shrinkage' equates to about 1% of turnover PRICE CUTTING, higher advertising costs and increased theft depressed operating margins at Kwik Save, but the discount food retailer still managed to increase interim pre-tax profits by 6 per cent. They came to Pounds 51.2m in the 28 weeks to March 14, against Pounds 48.1m. The shares closed 19p higher at 600p. Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, said Kwik Save had made a conscious decision to respond aggressively to the intensified competition from Sunday opening and the launch of new discounting fascias. The group had increased promotional activity and cut prices - even to the point of selling some lines below cost - to win additional sales and increase the pressure on rivals, such as Aldi, Netto, Food Giant and the Co-operative discount stores. 'Our policy for the past 25 years has been that attack is the best form of defence,' Mr Seabrook said, pointing out that the group was continuing to open stores at a rate of one a week addding to its existing portfolio of 760 Sales, excluding VAT, swept ahead by 41 per cent to Pounds 1.22bn (Pounds 865.9m). The figure was swollen by the inclusion of sales from Liquorsave, an off-licence concession bought last June. However, grocery sales (including VAT) still advanced by 26 per cent with sales volumes (including liquor) ahead by almost 15 per cent. Price inflation fell from 5.5 per cent in the second half of last year to 2.1 per cent as the group sharpened prices. Operating margins fell from 5.3 per cent to 4.3 per cent - although this partly reflected the inclusion of lower-margin liquor sales. Increased theft also had an impact; 'shrinkage' equated to about 1 per cent of turnover. The group expected cost pressures to ease in the second half and new store acquisitions to contribute more positively. 'But we are not seeing any signs of the end of the recession. I suspect it is still a little way away,' Mr Seabrook said. Earnings per share climbed to 22.29p (20.72p). The interim dividend is lifted to 4.7p (4.3p). Mr Seabrook deflected questions concerning his much-rumoured return to Dairy Farm International, the Hong Kong-based group which is Kwik Save's biggest shareholder. 'I plan on being here for at least another 12 months and the board is very relaxed about our succession plans,' he said. Mr Peter Hughes, who is responsible for stores operations and distribution, has been elevated to the board. The company is still searching for a replacement for the finance director, Mr Simon Moffat, who is leaving to join Hillsdown Holdings. See Lex</p>

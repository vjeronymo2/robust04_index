			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BAe dividend pay-out surprises City - Exceptional charge of Pounds 1bn pushes pre-tax deficit to more than Pounds 1.2bn BRITISH Aerospace's decision to pay a larger than expected dividend meant the company was feeling much more confident about the future, Mr John Cahill, chairman, said yesterday. 'We have reduced our break-even point, and it's going down further,' he said. 'We also have spare capacity to take up slack when the recovery takes place.' Getting costs down was 'a religion' in BAe, he added. In spite of making a net loss of Pounds 888m, the company declared dividends worth Pounds 35m gross on top of Pounds 28m of preference dividends. That left distributable reserves of Pounds 87m. Mr Richard Lapthorne, finance director, said the policy was to have the gross dividend covered close to three times by earnings. Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 1.78bn. Mr Lapthorne said that left 'comfortable headroom' over the Pounds 1.6bn minimum net worth specified in the group's banking covenants. Changes in accounting policy reduced profits by about Pounds 50m, Mr Lapthorne said. The largest items were a Pounds 47m write-off of launch costs on regional aircraft, offset by a reduction in pension fund payments of Pounds 59m to reflect pension surpluses. The heaviest losses came in regional aircraft, which lost Pounds 337m at the operating level besides incurring exceptional costs of Pounds 1bn. Losses in the second half were about Pounds 50m. They were likely to run at a lower level this year, according to the company. Mr Cahill said: 'The reason we lost Pounds 337m was partly to do with the market, but above all because costs are too high. The challenge for the new joint venture is to get costs out of the process.' The UK plants supplying the joint venture had been given 36 months to reduce their overheads by between 25 and 30 per cent, he said. Mr Lapthorne said adverse changes in the order book for Airbus meant BAe's share in the business would continue to consume cash until mid-1994, six months longer than expected. The group made an operating loss of Pounds 75m (1991 profit Pounds 212m) for the year to December 1992. This was made up of a profit of Pounds 352m (Pounds 371m) on defence and Pounds 14m (Pounds 28m) on construction, offset by losses of Pounds 337m (Pounds 37m) on commercial aircraft, Pounds 49m (Pounds 52m) on motor vehicles, Pounds 2m (Pounds 24m) on property development and Pounds 53m (Pounds 74m) on other businesses and central costs. After interest charges of Pounds 126m (Pounds 58m) and exceptionals of Pounds 1bn (Pounds 266m), there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.2bn (Pounds 112m). After tax of Pounds 272m (Pounds 26m) and minorities of Pounds 41m (Pounds 51m), the net loss was Pounds 888m (Pounds 132m).</p>

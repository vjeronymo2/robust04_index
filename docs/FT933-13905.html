			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Daf defence arm to be sold DAF Special Products, a defence and aerospace subsidiary of the collapsed DAF group, is expected to be sold to Van Halteren Metaal, a Dutch family-owned metalworking company. The Daf subsidiary, along with its former parent, was granted court protection from creditors in February. Daf Trucks NV later re-emerged in slimmed down form as a Dutch-Belgian company, excluding its UK factories, its financing company and the special products unit, which makes military vehicles and aerospace equipment. The formal takeover is expected later this week or early next week. Details were not disclosed, although Van Halteren hinted it might seek additional investors in DAF Special Products, saying it planned to be the sole shareholder 'for the time being'. Daf Special Products has an order book worth Fl 100m (Dollars 53m) and a workforce of 165, a decline of about 65 from the days when it was owned by Daf. It also expects additional orders from US defence contractors as part of 'compensation orders' flowing from Dutch government purchases of US defence equipment. Van Halteren, with turnover of Fl 125m and a workforce of 400, specialises in equipment for the defence and civil construction markets. The acquisition of Daf Special Products will give it access to hydraulic technology and expertise in producing aircraft parts. The family-owned company already owns eight production companies in the Netherlands and three in the US. It also has a sales office in Singapore. Daf Trucks is concentrating on producing medium to heavy trucks and is not longer active in Daf Special Products' field of small military vehicles.</p>

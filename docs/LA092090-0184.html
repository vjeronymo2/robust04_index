			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLENDING DREAMS WITH TRADITIONS;  </P> <P> GRADUATES: YOUNG IMMIGRANTS FIND DIFFICULTY IN ADJUSTING TO GREATER SOCIAL  FREEDOMS IN AMERICA.  </P> <P> After leaving the secure atmosphere of elementary school, what happens to  Cambodian refugee children as they prepare to enter an adult world? Some simply  trade war zones -- from the killing fields of Cambodia to the Asian gang wars  of Van Nuys. Most find that adjusting to greater social freedoms in the United  States, such as dating and extended friendships, depends upon their parents'  attitudes toward those freedoms.  </P> <P> "I'm not supposed to have a boyfriend," said Pinthang Ouk, a sophomore at Grant  High School in Van Nuys who entered Hazeltine Avenue School when she was 6. "In  our way, if a guy likes you, your parents have to watch after you and stuff  until you get married. If you go out with different boyfriends before you get  married, it means you're not a real virgin -- even if you just go out on a  date."  </P> <P> Pinthang, 15, lives in the Vallerio Gardens apartment complex in Van Nuys with  her mother, aunt, grandmother and two sisters. Six concrete buildings at the  complex house about 300 Cambodians, who are packed 10 to 15 each into  two-bedroom apartments. Central courtyards harbor fledgling gardens where  scores of children play, spilling out into an alley that dissects the  buildings.  </P> <P> Pinthang said she agrees with her mother's and grandmother's attitudes about  dating. "It's hard, because I can't usually go out with my friends -- my mom  wants me around the house," she said. "But I wouldn't want to hang around a lot  of girls who flirt and stuff. I want to stick with the girls who are just like  me."  </P> <P> Pinthang said traditional Cambodian dance, which she learned in Phnom Penh,  where she was born, helps her through adolescence. She now dances with a local  troupe at festivals and schools. "My grandma's mother was a dancer in the  temples for royalty in Cambodia," she said. "So now, when I dance, it's like  generation to generation, we're passing the tradition down."  </P> <P> After graduating from high school, Pinthang is thinking of becoming a flight  attendant or a "lady cop."  </P> <P> "But my mom told me to forget it," she said, flipping the pages of "Dynamic  Anatomy and Physiology" while her two younger sisters took turns combing her  shoulder-length hair. "She said to work in an office or something. My grandma  said that too. They want to keep me safe.  </P> <P> "I want to go to college, but my grandma doesn't want me to go. She doesn't  think a girl needs that much education. Only guys do. I don't agree with her.  I'm going to go anyway."  </P> <P> Roatha Buth, 18, lives next door to Pinthang with his mother, an aunt, five  sisters and three brothers. He was kicked out of 10th grade at Van Nuys High  School earlier this year and later spent one month in juvenile hall for  attempting to break into a car, a charge he denies. Roatha Buth has no plans to  return to school, often thinks of getting a job as a fast-food cook in San  Bernardino, where he has friends, and sometimes dreams of becoming a  firefighter.  </P> <P> "When I first come here, the gangs make me fight," he said, smoothing his  T-shirt, emblazoned with a Corona beer label. His thick, black hair was pulled  back with a blue rubber band and around his neck hung three gold chains, one  sporting a dime-size Mercedes-Benz symbol. "Like they hit you up. They go,  'Where you from?' I didn't know or understand who they were. First there were  Mexican gangs, then Asian gangs."  </P> <P> Roatha Buth said he was a member of the Asian Boys gang for two years when he  was 14 and 15. "They jump you in, they jump you out," he said, describing the  initiation process. "When they jump you in, three of them start to hit you and  you got to hit back for 30 seconds. And then you start hanging around them. I'd  rather be a fireman. Lots of action. But you have to graduate and all that from  high school."  </P> <P> Roatha Buth's immediate concern is his living arrangements. His mother recently  told him he must leave the house unless he gets a job. "I just want to get out  of this apartment," he said, glancing at a corner Buddhist altar laden with  incense, mostly hidden by a towering ensemble of audio equipment. "I want to go  somewhere far away. Too much trouble. Screaming, crying, arguments. Even Maria,  my girlfriend, screams at me.  </P> <P> "You can't go nowhere. You can't get out of this place. Only like in Beverly  Hills it's quiet, I think. There are no gangs over there. Or if you lived in a  house, it would be quiet then, I think." R. DANIEL FOSTER  </P></p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Forecast cut hits Coats Textiles group Coats Viyella was hit after one of its joint brokers cut its profits forecast for the company to reflect the slow recovery in the industry. Securities house BZW, which shares the brokership with Cazenove, was said to have cut by Pounds 5m to Pounds 147m for this financial year, bringing its estimate into the lower end of the current range of Pounds 145m to Pounds 155m. The downgrade was followed by a statement from the company that it expected to meet its original forecasts. Some in the market interpreted this as an unwarranted move to dampen criticism and failed to take heart. The shares remained at their low of the day, down 8 1/2 at 259 1/2 p.</p>

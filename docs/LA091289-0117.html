			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LINE PROVIDES LITTLE SUPPORT FOR PRINGLE  </P> <P> Mike Pringle was accepting congratulations Monday. He had just been named the  Big West Conference offensive player of the week, two days after running for  164 yards and three touchdowns in Cal State Fullerton's 27-20 victory over Cal  State Northridge.  </P> <P> It is customary, even politically wise, for a running back to thank his  offensive line in such situations. Forgive Pringle if he wasn't effusive.  </P> <P> Pringle got his 164 yards with only sporadic help from a line that doesn't seem  quite clear on the fact that when the crowd chants "Hold 'em," they're talking  to the defense.  </P> <P> Fullerton was called for holding four times on one second-half drive alone,  during a five-minute stretch in which the Titans grounded out all of 32 yards.  The line had a hand -- pun intended -- in turning a first-and-goal into a  42-yard field goal.  </P> <P> On the surface, it seemed as if Fullerton's running attack made great progress  Saturday, a week after being held to five yards rushing in a loss to Northern  Illinois.  </P> <P> But of 189 yards rushing Saturday, 76 came when Pringle broke free for a  touchdown, making very efficient use of a couple blocks. Another 29 came on a  rare scramble by Dan Speltz, the longest of his career.  </P> <P> Take away those two runs and the Titans averaged 2.8 yards a carry. Do that  three downs in a row and Coach Gene Murphy calls in Phil Nevin to punt.  </P> <P> Those are the kinds of numbers that left Murphy to assess the running game as  "lukewarm" Monday -- not so hot yet, but a long way from all but frozen over.  </P> <P> The problem doesn't have much to do with Pringle, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound back  who Murphy says could be the best he has had. Pringle averaged nearly five  yards a carry last season, and this season he's running in an offense similar  to the one he ran in for two seasons at Washington State before transferring to  Fullerton.  </P> <P> Instead, the trouble stems from what Murphy calls the Titans'  "equal-opportunity" line -- everybody is taking advantage of a chance to make a  mistake.  </P> <P> Don Morel, the offensive line coach, offers that tackle Reggie Redding is  playing very well. Beyond that, he'd rather not mention names.  </P> <P> "We've just been breaking down, one player at a time," Morel said.  </P> <P> Three players who started the season opener had seen little or no playing time  in a major-college game -- guards Mike Rogan and Leita Leatutufu and tackle Tom  Gang. Besides Redding, a 6-4, 295-pound pro prospect, center Marc Hauser is the  only truly experienced starter.  </P> <P> "We're very inexperienced," Morel said. "We just need to mature on the field."  </P> <P> Before the season, the concern was more for the line's pass blocking. But Morel  points out that Speltz has been sacked only twice in two games.  </P> <P> And with the Titans' offensive emphasis on a short passing game this season,  better to have a line that can handle the pass blocking. But better yet to have  one that can handle both.  </P> <P> "In order for that passing game to go like we want it to," Murphy said, "we  have to get that running game going."  </P> <P> How to Improve a Football Team: Schedule the Titans.  </P> <P> True to the tradition of last year, when Fullerton opponents West Virginia and  Wyoming enjoyed among the best seasons in their histories, the Titans' next  opponent looks like it may be a better team than Fullerton imagined when it  made the schedule.  </P> <P> Colorado State, which went 1-10 last season, is 0-2 this season in its first  year under Earle Bruce, the former Ohio State coach.  </P> <P> Fullerton meets the Rams Saturday at Fort Collins, Colo., and the scores of  those losses seem to say something Fullerton would rather not hear. The Rams  lost to Tennessee, 17-14. Tennessee later beat UCLA, 24-6. Saturday, the Rams  played Colorado, a team picked to challenge Nebraska in the Big Eight this  season. Colorado won, 45-20.  </P> <P> Add Colorado State: Starting quarterback Kevin Verdugo suffered a shoulder  sprain in the second quarter of Saturday's game and is listed as very doubtful  for this week.  </P> <P> Do No Wrong: Nevin, the freshman punter who turned down the Dodgers to kick and  play baseball at Fullerton, has been flawless in two games. He has yet to miss  a field goal, scoring on attempts of 21, 42 and 54 yards. He is five of five on  PATs, and has a punting average of 40.2, with a long of 48.  </P></p>

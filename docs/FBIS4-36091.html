			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 3 Jun (MENA) -- The Nonaligned Movement's  foreign ministers conference has condemned the Israeli air raids  on south Lebanon. In a resolution passed today, the conference  stresses its complete solidarity with the Lebanese Government  and people, and support for Lebanon in defending its sovereignty  by all available means.    The conference calls on the UN Security Council and the  cosponsors of the peace conference in the Middle East, "the  United States and Russia" to move immediately to put an end to  Israeli aggression, which is against the UN Charter and is  designed to torpedo the peace process. The resolution calls for  saving the peace process from collapse.    The resolution expresses the nonaligned conference's concern  over the Israeli acts of aggression against Lebanese towns and  villages. It said that the new massacre committed by Israel and  previous kidnappings and acts of terror are no doubt intended to  torpedo the peace process.    Hisham Dimashqiyah, Lebanese ambassador in Cairo and head of  the Lebanese delegation to the nonaligned conference, delivered  a speech at the conference. He said that by its repeated acts  of aggression against south Lebanon Israel is violating  Lebanon's sovereignty and defying the peace process. He called  on the conference to pass a resolution strongly condemning  Israeli aggression and stressing solidarity with the Lebanese  people in defending their sovereignty by all available means.    The foreign ministers and heads of delegations of Syria,  Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, Morocco, and Yemen  delivered speeches in which they expressed support for Lebanon  and called on the conference to pass an unequivocal resolution  condemning Israeli aggression against south Lebanon. They also  stressed that they support the Lebanese authorities efforts to  extend their control throughout Lebanon.    Dimashqiyah told MENA that the Israeli aggression against  Lebanon will impact negatively on the peace process in the  Middle East, particularly the Lebanese track.    Responding to a question on Lebanon's intention to freeze  the  peace talks' Lebanese-Israeli track, Dimashqiyah said that  freezing the negotiations may happen afer consultations among  the higher Lebanese authorities, the Government, and the Chamber  of Deputies. He said that the current Israeli air raids on  Lebanon are part of a series of recurring acts of aggression,  along with kidnappings of citizens and other air raids that kill  and wound dozens of Lebanese. He said that the Lebanese Army is  in a state of alert to repulse any aggression in cooperation  with the Syrian forces operating in Lebanon. He noted that  Israel uses any provocations or clashes on the border as a  pretext to launch acts of aggression deep inside Lebanese  territory, not just provocations in areas at the borders.</p>

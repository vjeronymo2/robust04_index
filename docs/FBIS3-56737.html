In his opinion, "the premier does not seem to be very fond  of  uncontrolled budget spending," while the government on the whole  will sooner or later face the need to choose between stricter  budget and monetary policies for the sake of preserving the  budget and an additional emission in order to prevent the  industries from falling to pieces.    Yasin admitted that intentionally maintaining the ruble's  stable rate and regular stepping back on promises "on the whole  could not but exhaust themselves." "It is even more  understandable that Fedorov fall victim to his own persistence  and his well-known relations with the country's chief banker,  Viktor Gerashchenko," he added. The head of the experts'  council "fails to see anything terrible in the fact that the  dollar will trade at 200-300 rubles more if it corresponds to  the pace of inflation." According to his prognosis, the  inflation rate in January will amount to 22-24%, "which is  comparable with recent months."    Speaking on Fedorov's possible successors, Yasin pointed to  the current Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin as having the  highest chances to replace Fedorov.    "Sergey Konstantinovich has great professional experience  with budget issues, and what is important as well is that he is  not inclined to give away money right and left either," Yasin  said.    As Interfax learned from Dubinin's staff, no talks of his  possible appointment had been held.</p>

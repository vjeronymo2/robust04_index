			<p>BFN     [Text] According to AFP, the U.S. State Department on 6  April issued a statement asserting that U.S. teams did not find  any signs of American servicemen being alive in the 10 detention  camps that the U.S. side had inspected over the past six weeks.  The statement rejected the allegations made by the three  American citizens who left Vietnam on 3 April that U.S.  inspectors were not allowed to have access to Vietnamese  prisons. The U.S. State Department statement asserted that  members of the Hanoi-based Task Force for U.S. Servicemen  Missing in Action had asked for permission to visit ten  detention camps in six weeks and had been allowed to go to all  of those camps.</p>

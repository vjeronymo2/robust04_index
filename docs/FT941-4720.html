			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Rethink on crime payouts rejected The government is determined to press ahead with changes to the criminal injuries compensation scheme, in spite of claims that the reforms will unjustly reduce payments to victims, Kevin Brown writes. A senior official said there was no question of a rethink on the proposed changes, which would replace individual assessments with a fixed tariff. Labour said yesterday that the tariff would reduce payments to sexually abused children, families of murder victims and injured police. The reforms have been criticised in the Lords, where peers said they could be unconstitutional and open to judicial review. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, is understood to have taken legal advice which supports the government view that the changes can be implemented in April as planned. Downing Street insisted that the scheme would remain the most generous in Europe. Officials said that some payments would rise. Compensation for aggravated rape will rise from an average of Pounds 9,500 to Pounds 10,000, and payments for facial scarring will rise from an average of Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 7,500. However, there was unrest among Conservative backbenchers about the government's admission that the reforms will cut the cost of the scheme from some Pounds 500m to about Pounds 250m a year. It was also disclosed in the Lords last night that Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, is considering extending the changes - which apply to England, Wales and Scotland - to Ulster.</p>

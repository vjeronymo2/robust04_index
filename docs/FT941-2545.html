			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: FT Opera Offer If you are among the 17,000 readers who applied for Pounds 10 tickets for a night at Covent Garden in the FT's promotion last autumn - do not fret if you still await the call. The Royal Opera House is confident that everyone will get to see a performance this season. Katya Kabanova, which recently opened to excellent reviews, should absorb some of the demand, along with long runs of Carmen (although not with Domingo) and Figaro. Readers will be pleasantly surprised if they take up tickets to see Harrison Birtwistle's Gawain. In dance there is the stylish Don Quixote to come, as well as a Triple Bill, before the Royal Ballet goes on tour. Birmingham Royal Ballet comes down to fill the gap with its romantic new production Sylvia and its Triple Bill. Covent Garden is adding a third telephone line in the hope of giving readers a week's notice of their proffered production.</p>

			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENERGY;  </P> <P> CRUDE PRICES SOAR IN BEFUDDLING SESSION  </P> <P> In a late wave of buying that left many traders befuddled, crude oil futures  shot up Thursday to record highs, soaring nearly $2 a barrel to $35 before  falling back.  </P> <P> The price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, to  be delivered in October closed at $34.71, up $1.53, on the New York Mercantile  Exchange. That shattered the Merc's previous record close of $33.63 reached  only on Monday, when the previous trading high of $33.75 was also matched.  </P> <P> The Mideast was relatively quiet, and no other major news reports seemed  responsible for triggering the increase in prices, traders said. Oil prices in  European markets fell slightly in lackluster trading; the light volume was  attributed to observance of the Jewish New Year.  </P> <P> The sharp rise in New York prices "took everybody by surprise," said James  Fiedler, a vice president at ED&amp;F Man International Futures Inc., a New  York brokerage. Prices "took off an hour before the close."  </P> <P> Refined petroleum products also rose sharply at the Merc. October heating oil  rose 3.33 cents to 91.86 cents a gallon on forecasts of a colder than normal  fall, which would increase demand. Reports of gasoline refineries closing for  scheduled maintenance helped raise the price of October unleaded gasoline by  1.64 cents to 91.54 cents a gallon.  </P> <P> Thursday was the last day of trading in October crude oil futures contracts,  and many traders had expected weaker prices as speculators and others who did  not want to take delivery of the oil would have been forced to sell. Those who  wanted to roll over their October contracts into November would have been  forced to sell as well.  </P> <P> As a result, many traders earlier may have sold October oil contracts "short,"  expecting to buy back the contracts later at lower prices and thus profit from  the decline. But instead of falling, crude oil prices kept rising, forcing  short sellers to buy October contracts or face greater losses.  </P> <P> "Some buying came in, and it looked like it was the shorts," said Fiedler.  </P> <P> "Strange things happen on the last day a contract ends," said Kevin Kelly,  manager of futures trading at Chevron International in San Francisco. "It's  hard to explain this one."  </P> <P> With the end of trading in October oil futures, the market shifted its  attention to November contracts, Kelly said. November crude rose by 45 cents to  $33.42 a barrel.  </P> <P> "We are still in a bull market," Kelly said, but he declined to offer specific  forecasts. "We are in uncharted waters, making the predictions game even  tougher."  </P></p>

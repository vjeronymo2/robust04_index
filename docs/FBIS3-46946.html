The Belgrade television of Yugoslavia on January 1 quoted  President Kim Il-song of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea as saying in his New Year address that "it is the United  States that has created the suspicion of nuclear development by  the North, and it is the United States that has actually shipped  nuclear weapons into the Korean peninsula and has been  threatening the Korean people," and that the problem "must on  any account be settled through Korea-U.S. talks."    The TANJUG news agency and Radio Belgrade of Yugoslavia  repeatedly reported the New Year address.    Parts of the New Year address dealing with the nuclear  problem on the Korean peninsula and the question of its  reunification were reported by the People's Television of  Angola, the ROMPRES news agency and central radio of Romania,  the Ugandan television and radio, the Peruvian paper LA  REPUBLICA, the Italian ANSA news agency and radio, radio  Vaticano, the Burundian radio and television and the Togolese  television.</p>

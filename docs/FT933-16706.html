			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Intelligence claims fuel furore over Nadir - Row over funding heightened after release of documents showing former minister's collusion allegations CLAIMS THAT intelligence services were involved in a plot to undermine Mr Asil Nadir and help destroy the economy of northern Cyprus yesterday fuelled the furore at Westminster over the treatment of the fugitive businessman. Detailed allegations and answers in the 48 pages of papers published by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, again raised the temperature at Westminster over the activities of the Serious Fraud Office. The row also spilled into renewed efforts by Labour to turn the focus back on to politically embarrassing donations to the Conservative party. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, yesterday attempted to heighten the funding controversy by demanding that the Tories returned Pounds 1m which he claimed had been donated to the party by Mr Octav Botnar, the chairman of Nissan UK. Mr Botnar has been accused by the Inland Revenue in court of being the prime mover behind Britain's largest-ever tax fraud. The most serious claim by Mr Michael Mates, the former northern Ireland minister, was raised in a meeting last December, when he told Sir Nicholas that he believed there might be 'strong political pressure for Mr Nadir to be convicted in order to provide a solution to the problem of northern Cyprus'. Just over three months later he telephoned the attorney-general's office to report that BBC television's Panorama was planning a programme alleging a conspiracy involving the Cypriot, British and US intelligence services. The intention was to bring about Mr Nadir's downfall. Downing Street yesterday called the suggestion 'rubbish'. One of the more extraordinary revelations contained in the documentation concerns details of a meeting held in September 1990 at the London offices of Vizards, solicitors representing Mr Nadir, at which Mr Michael Allcock, the suspended head of the Inland Revenue's section dealing with high-profile tax investigations, described the earlier SFO raid on a property management company run by Mr Nadir as 'a monumental disaster caused by the SFO'. At Westminster there remained more general concern about the behaviour of the SFO, with MPs clearly still not satisfied that it did not give the media advance information about arrests. Sir Nicholas was said to have raised the matter again with Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, who was expected to issue a further reminder that such behaviour was reprehensible. Mr Mates yesterday welcomed this move, but renewed his demand for an independent inquiry. At question time in the Commons Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, challenged Mr John Major to commit the Tory party to returning donations from Mr Botnar. Mr Major said that he hoped Mr Smith would accept that 'where tainted money has been provided to the Conservative Party, we will replace it'. But Labour seized on his inability to tell MPs whether Mr Botnar had given money to the Conservative party. 'Everyone is saying, including Mr Botnar, that he gave the Tory party Pounds 1m,' Mr Smith said later. 'Surely the prime minster has a duty to return this money to the Inland Revenue.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aside from any formal arrangements between Tribes and States, EPA notes that the objective of this rule, and EPA's responsibility in overseeing the administration of the CAA, is to provide air quality protection. Therefore, EPA encourages all affected sovereigns to work cooperatively in informal capacities to protect the public health and welfare from the serious health and welfare effects associated with air pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Tribal CAA Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The discussion which follows addresses streamlined procedures that EPA is proposing to satisfy the eligibility requirements set out in section 301(d)(2) of the Act. These are proposed requirements that Tribes must meet in order to obtain approval to implement CAA programs. The discussion also identifies those provisions of the Act for which EPA is proposing to treat Indian Tribes in the same manner as States and those provisions for which EPA believes such treatment is infeasible or otherwise inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of EPA's central concerns is to encourage Tribes to develop and administer Clean Air Act programs on Tribal lands in the same way that States currently do on State lands. This concern is grounded in the objective of Tribal self-government as enunciated in both the Federal and the EPA Indian Policies. In order to facilitate this process, EPA is proposing to eliminate duplicative review and unnecessary delay during EPA's processing of Tribal program submittals. The eligibility determination process proposed in today's action is consistent with an EPA policy pronouncement that followed from EPA's review of the Tribal programs it administers under other environmental statutes. Further, EPA is proposing to accept ``reasonably severable'' Tribal air program submittals that meet the applicable requirements of the CAA. This will allow Tribes to identify and then immediately target their most important air quality issues without the corresponding burden of developing entire CAA programs. Further, it allows Tribes to develop incremental expertise that will facilitate development and expansion of further programs over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. New Process for Determining Eligibility for CAA Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be eligible to be treated in the same manner as a State for CAA programs, including financial assistance, an applicant must meet the definition of ``tribe'' in section 302(r) of the Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  it must be Federally recognized) and must satisfy the three criteria set forth in section 301(d)(2)(A)&hyph;(C) of the Act. These criteria are set out in today's proposed rule and concern the Tribe's governing body, its jurisdiction, and its capability to carry out the necessary functions under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general these same criteria are set forth under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA has previously issued regulations implementing the criteria under those Acts. These regulations have come to be known as the ``treatment as a state'' (``TAS'') process. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Approval under this process was required every time a Tribe sought to obtain an EPA grant or implement an EPA program on its reservation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA recognizes that Tribes are sovereign nations with a unique legal status and a relationship to the Federal government that is significantly different from that of States. EPA believes that Congress did not intend to alter this when it authorized treatment of Tribes ``as States'' under the CAA. Rather, Congress intends to ensure that, to the extent appropriate and feasible, Tribes may assume a role in implementing the CAA on Tribal lands that is comparable to the role States have in implementing the CAA on State lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the ``TAS'' process proved to be quite burdensome to Tribes, EPA formed a working group to focus on ways of improving and simplifying the process. After considering the workgroup's recommendations, EPA announced a policy that is intended to streamline and simplify the process. Memorandum from F. Henry Habicht, the Deputy Administrator of EPA, to the Agency, dated November 10, 1992. EPA is proposing to implement this new policy in this rulemaking, and is calling the resulting new process the ``eligibility'' process. See also 56 FR 1380 (March 23, 1994) (proposing similar revision to Tribal approval process in Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the new eligibility process proposed in today's action, a Tribe does not need to go through a separate eligibility review every time it seeks approval for grant funding or to implement a specific program. Instead, a Tribe's eligibility may be determined at the same time that it seeks approval for a particular program. By making the eligibility determination a part of the program approval process, much of the delay and duplication inherent in the old sequential TAS process should be reduced, if not eliminated. In addition, EPA is proposing to simplify some of the demonstrations of eligibility that will be required under the Clean Air Act, as discussed below. Finally, after promulgation of this rule, EPA intends to facilitate development of Tribal applications by providing Tribes with a narrative checklist of the eligibility requirements described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

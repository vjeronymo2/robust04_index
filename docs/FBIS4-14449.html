			<p>BFN     [Text] On Wednesday the Presidium of the Russian Supreme  Court accepted the protest of the Prosecutor General against the  closure of the criminal case of members of the State Emergency  Committee in August 1991 Gennadiy Yanayev and Aleksandr Tizyakov  in connection with the amnesty. Earlier at the trial of leaders  of the abortive coup their cases were separated from the rest  and united.    The Presidium believes the case was closed in violation of  the law and should be sent to court again.</p>

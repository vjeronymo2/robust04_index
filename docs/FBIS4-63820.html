			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Aleksandr Mineyev and </F> Vladimir Smelov]    [Text] Brussels, 25 May -- The reaction of the U.S. defense  secretary to the Russian concept of wider cooperation with NATO  was "noncommittal," Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told  ITAR-TASS after meeting his U.S. counterpart William Perry at  the NATO Headquarters.    "It seems, the Russian minister added, that this is linked  to  the fact that the American side is not yet familiar with the  main parameters of our proposals on this. They will be handed  over to NATO's acting secretary general today."    In P. Grachev's words, the meeting which lasted for over an  hour discussed primarily issues of bilateral interaction. "Our  cooperation is growing stronger by the day and we are finding  more and more mutual understanding," he stressed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Pritsiolas] </F>   [Text] President Guillermo Endara is planning to announce  this week an amnesty that will benefit 578 former officials of  the former regime, according to official sources.    The list includes 75 former members, 510 former  corregimiento  representatives, former President Eric Arturo Delvalle; Juan B.  Sosa, former ambassador to the United States; and Vice  President-elect Gabriel Altamirano Duque [figures as published].    The case of the 510 representatives exists because they  appointed General Manuel Antonio Noriega as chief of government.  The dossiers against Delvalle and Sosa are related to the  investigations the second circuit prosecutor is conducting on  alleged irregularities in the handling of $10.8 million from the  funds the United States froze on Panama. The case against Tomas  Gabriel Altamirano Duque concerns charges made by Omayra Correa,  Panama City mayor-elect.    Concurrently, the assembly is debating an amnesty for  political crimes. Legislator Raul Ossa has said the individuals  in line to receive these benefits should only be those accused  of violations against state security; otherwise, this amnesty  would leave a door open to benefit those being investigated for  common crimes.    Meanwhile, Miguel Bush, legislator from the Democratic  Revolutionary Party, has wanted to add an article to the draft  amnesty so that it would exclude those charged with homicide and  embezzlement.    A judiciary source has said the dossier against the former  members of the General State Council includes: Manuel Solis  Palma; Manuel Antonio Noriega; Francisco Rodriguez; Rodolfo  Chiari De Leon; Jorge Ritter; Orville Goodin; Rene Bultron; Juan  Bosco Bernal; Elmo Martinez Blanco; Darien Ayala; Cesar Martans;  Jose Renan Esquivel; and Ricardo Bermudez.    It also includes Nander Pitty; Celso Carrizo; Carlos  Villalaz; Olmedo Sanjur; Pascual Gonzalez; Virgilio Mirones;  Rafael Arosemena; Azael Purcait; Jaime Simons; Francisco Sanchez  Cardenas; Alejandro Vernaza; Aida de Gartner; Alberto Luis  Tunon; Dario Fernandez; Dario Gonzalez; Carlos Orillac; Benjamin  Colamarco; Tomas Noriega; Rafael Castrellon; and Gilberto Tunon.    Other former members of the General State Council are: Angel  Jaen; Mario Luis Pitti; Luis Blanco; Cesar Montenegro; Bernardo  Dominguez; Leovigildo Herrera; Euclides Tejada; Elvia de Ortiz;  Dagoberto Lara; Ana Villa de Flores; Carlos Estrada; Veyra  Remon; Victor Levy; Victoria de Robolt; Marcos Hughes; Jose  Arauz; Jose Rodriguez; Marcos Mariscal; Alberto Arjona; Fermin  Herrera; and Eufemia Laguna.

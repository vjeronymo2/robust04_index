			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The fat worker and other tales of union life: David Goodhart laments the loss after 142 years of the AEEU's anecdotes from the shop floor WILL THE 20 assemblers win equal pay with the seven people in the wire tag section who earn 90p an hour more at Potterton the boiler-makers? Will the workers at the Morris Singer Foundry in Basingstoke continue to resist compulsory redundancies by working short time instead? Alas, we may never know the outcome of these everyday tales of shop floor negotiations in British manufacturing. For the monthly business reports of the regional officials of the AEEU craft union, where they are painstakingly recorded, have been published for the last time. Since 1851 the reports have been a barometer of the shop-floor mood, capturing in a few short sentences the officials' six or seven most important meetings of the month with employers, members and shop stewards. The reports, which appear under unflattering passport pictures of the 30 officials, now bear a strong whiff of the 1950s. But the issues that arise most often  - regrading, differential disputes, selection for redundancy  - are still the bread and butter of manufacturing labour relations. The following report from Mr Dave Gough, north-west, about Ford, is typical: 'Met senior management and shop stewards concerned about company intention to temporarily transfer eight craftsmen to production line without agreement. Although no loss of pay, members are worried about loss of status and the creation of a precedent for the future.' The tone is not always belligerent. Mr Denis O'Flynn of the AEEU Foundry Division writes about TRW Valves of Wednesbury: 'The company would not be moved from its intended action of curtailing the role of the convenor. A tour around the factory proved to be both interesting and educational. My thanks to the management for the opportunity to see some innovatory ideas in action.' But organised labour is not always a push-over, as Mr John Hodgkins from the South West reports about Aerostructures in Hamble. 'The management insisted on going ahead with three dismissals. Arrangements were made for a mass meeting with a recommendation for a ballot for strike action. The management found alternative work for our members before the meeting took place.' Mr Alistair Hatchett of Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, regrets the passing of the reports. 'They are an irreplaceable primary source for what is actually happening in manufacturing and a far better guide than all the academic research which says that British industrial relations is totally transformed,' he says. The reports have been useful for spotting manufacturing-wide trends. The last issue, for example, shows a cautious increase in pay militancy with about 10 bargaining groups deciding to reject 'final' pay offers from companies and opting for strike ballots. That is a markedly higher number than in previous months. Also, big companies which claim entirely to have decentralised pay bargaining to individual plants, but still operate de facto central control, can be caught out by a flick through the regional reports which show the same offer being made everywhere. There are plenty of industrial curiosities in the last issue. Such as the man at NEI Clark Chapman who was suspended for being overweight, or the dispute at Valor Heating when workers had part of their pay docked when work was disrupted by a bomb scare. The reports, like the union, are old-fashioned but rooted in the labour movement's 19th century traditions of democracy and accountability. 'The trouble is they no longer fit,' says one AEEU official as the union replaces the monthly journal with a slick new quarterly magazine sent to every member. But this will be a poor substitute for keen students of labour relations in British manufacturing.</p>

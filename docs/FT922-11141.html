			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Gaidar defends import and income taxes MR Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, warned US businessmen yesterday that his country was obliged to tax imports and foreign residents' incomes. He said Russia had lifted import duties temporarily during the period of price liberalisation, in order to impose the discipline of import competition on domestic producers who might otherwise have been tempted to raise their prices too much. It was now necessary, he told a meeting at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington, to reimpose a flat import duty. 'We are not using this import tariff to protect our domestic producers, we just want to raise tax revenue,' said Mr Gaidar, who was in Washington to attend international financial meetings. Russia's new income tax, meanwhile, has worried some foreign businessmen who say they will be unable to move employees to Russia because the new top rate of 60 per cent would be so severe a cost. Mr Gaidar said the income tax was 'a sad story', but necessary to comply with International Monetary Fund requirements. 'The problem is we have a strongly undervalued rouble, so when we apply our income tax to foreigners they have very high incomes in roubles,' he said. Mr Gaidar said a proposal to use a special exchange rate to convert foreigners' incomes for tax purposes had been rejected by the IMF, but said he still hoped to introduce some special exemptions or privileges for foreigners. The industrialised nations yesterday approved in principle the establishment of a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) stabilisation fund for the rouble, writes Peter Norman. The Group of 10 - actually 11 nations comprising the G7 plus Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland - said it was willing to activate the General Arrangements to Borrow that would provide the IMF with financial support needed to set up the stabilisation fund. In his address to the IMF's policy-making interim committee, Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, said the stabilisation fund should boost confidence in the currency once a sufficiently tight monetary stance in the rouble-zone countries had been established. But it would be difficult to find a correct parity for the rouble.</p>

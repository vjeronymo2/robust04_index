			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Fairey pays Pounds 14m for US market leader FAIREY GROUP, the specialist electronics and engineering company, has agreed to pay Dollars 21m (Pounds 13.9m) for Ircon, the infrared measurement division of Square D, the US-based electrical equipment group owned by Schneider of France. Ircon makes infrared non-contact temperature measuring equipment used in process industries such as steel, glass, rubber and plastics. Fairey said Ircon led the US market and occupied the number two position in Europe. The UK company is also acquiring Ircon's marketing and technical support subsidiaries in France, Germany and England. Completion of the deal is subject to US and French regulatory approval. Ircon made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1.8m on sales of Dollars 16.6m in 1991, and has net assets of Dollars 10.25m, including Dollars 1.5m in cash. The assets include Ircon's freehold headquarters in the northern suburbs of Chicago, where all the manufacturing takes place. In July Fairey paid Pounds 11.5m for Essex-based Infrared Engineering and its marketing and technical support subsidiaries in Boston and Stuttgart. Infrared makes specialist gauges used to measure moisture, fat and protein for the food, paper and tobacco industries and the thickness of plastic films and coatings. Mr John Poulter, Fairey's chief executive, said 'Ircon represents a logical step forward in our strategic development. The existing group subsidiaries, LasterMike and Infrared Engineering, are involved in very similar technologies and markets and all three trade internationally and are market leaders.'</p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (America): GDP details prompt strong rally in Dow Wall Street US stocks rallied yesterday after the Commerce Department announced that the economy had grown at a slower rate than expected during the second quarter, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 33.67 higher at 3,764.50, climbing to its highest closing level since June 17. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 4.02 ahead at 458.26, as advancing issues on the Big Board swamped declines by an eight-to-three margin. NYSE volume was a moderate 271m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up 3.81 at 437.69, and the Nasdaq composite surged 9.73, or 1.37 per cent, to 722.16. At the opening, stocks were fast off the mark. Investors were relieved by the earlier announcement that gross domestic product in the second three months of year had grown at a rate of 3.7 per cent, slightly less than forecast. The news deflated growing concern over the potential of a stronger-than-expected reading to damage share prices. Amid the relief, analysts began to re-evaluate the strength of the economy going into the third quarter, given a big jump in inventories. The likelihood of an early rise in interest rates diminished. The strategic thinking in the US Treasury market followed the same path. As a consequence, prices on the benchmark 30-year security soared and the yield plunged 17 basis points to 7.38 per cent as traders rushed in to cover their bets that the GDP data would exceed expectations. Amid the fanfare, bearish news from Chicago purchasing managers, suggesting higher price pressures in the manufacturing sector, was largely ignored. With fears over rates put aside, at least temporarily, stocks which are most sensitive to broad economic trends advanced. Among the Dow industrials, Caterpillar climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 108 3/8 , International Paper gained Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 72 7/8 and Alcoa added Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 78 1/4 . The improving fundamental outlook gave a lift to semi-conductor stocks, too. Texas Instruments jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 78 5/8 , Micron Technology gained Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 and Novellus Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 36 3/4 . Earnings news continued to trickle into Wall Street. LTV, a leading steel maker, was marked up Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 after posting net income of 40 cents a share, nearly double the consensus forecast. Inland Steel pushed Dollars 1 1/8 ahead to Dollars 38. The gains followed JP Morgan's recommendation to buy steel issues because of an expected price increase from Chrysler. On the negative side, Aetna surprised Wall Street by taking a Dollars 64m charge to cover pollution-related claims in the second quarter. The stock dropped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 on the news. On the Nasdaq, Thursday's speculation about a possible takeover of Intergroup Healthcare proved to be prescient, as Foundation Health agreed to buy the company through a Dollars 750m stock swap. Shares in Intergroup surged a further Dollars 10 1/8 to Dollars 57 5/8 , adding about 50 per cent to their value in two sessions. Foundation dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 32 1/8 . Canada Toronto stocks ended the week on a winning note, rising 0.70 per cent, in moderate trading. The TSE-300 composite index gained 29.16 points, or 0.70 per cent, to 4,178.97. On the week, the index was up about 3 points. Advances led declines 449 to 295, volume fell to 55.26m shares from 59.69m on Thursday. Trading value was CDollars 533.0m compared with CDollars 626.1m. All but one of the 14 stock groups increased, with mining and real estate adding 1.47 per cent and 1.30 per cent. The Toronto market will be closed Monday for a holiday. Mexico Equities closed higher on investor optimism over the forthcoming general election and a better-than-expected batch of second-quarter company reports. The IPC index of 37 leading shares gained 33.12 points, or 1.36 per cent, to close at 2,462.27 after peaking at 2,487.51 mid-morning. Analysts said the rises of recent days are based on greater confidence that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party will win Aug 21 presidential and legislative elections.</p>

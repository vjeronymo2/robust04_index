			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Peru wants to renegotiate debt PERU'S economic team, led by Mr Jorge Camet, finance minister, is in Paris today to renegotiate the country's Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.1bn) debt with its Paris Club group of creditor countries. The Peruvian proposal seeks to reduce 1993-95 debt servicing from about Dollars 1bn (equivalent to one-third of annual export earnings) to between Dollars 300m and Dollars 350m a year. 'It's a pragmatic proposal aimed at reducing servicing in line with Peru's ability to pay,' said Mr Eduardo Valdivia, Peru's chief debt adviser. Talks with the 17 creditor governments are likely to be tough. But since the IMF has already approved the current three-year economic programme, Peru is expected to get most if not all the conditions it seeks. Ultimately, however, the only realistic solution to Peru's debt burden appears to be wide-scale forgiveness. Peru proposes to tackle that question with Paris in three years' time.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Companies in Japan plan to cut spending JAPANESE companies plan to reduce capital spending by 4 per cent during the financial year beginning next month, suggesting that the weakness in the economy will continue, according to a survey by the Industrial Bank of Japan. The planned fall in investment follows an expected 5.4 per cent increase in the current year and double-digit growth in the three previous years, and highlights industry's expectation of slower domestic demand and a faint international recovery. Manufacturing companies told the bank that capital spending for the coming year is likely to fall by 10.7 per cent, while non-manufacturing industry expects a 3.1 per cent drop. Electric power companies expect a 6 per cent rise. The bank said the investment decline by manufacturing companies was the largest since 1978. Capital spending has also been slowed by turmoil on Japan's financial markets as companies had tapped the stock market for low-cost funds in the late 1980s to expand capacity and introduce labour-saving technology. The predicted falls reflect a readjustment of inventory the Bank of Japan argues is to be expected.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Looking at life in Europe, for and against  -Alison Smith and Richard Lapper on a policy split in the UK insurance industry It is not just Britain's Conservative party that is split on Europe. The UK life insurance industry is similarly divided into Euro-enthusiasts and Euro-sceptics over the immediate importance of the European market. Perhaps the most prominent Euro-sceptic - the Lady Thatcher figure of the business, so to speak - is Prudential Corporation, the UK's largest life insurer. When announcing its new business figures for the first half of the year, Prudential put great emphasis on its rapidly growing presence in the Asia Pacific markets, and made only a cursory mention of a decline in annual premium contracts in Italy. Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive, believes there will not be a pan-European medium and long-term savings market until after 2000. He expresses far greater enthusiasm about opportunities in east Asia, and in China in particular. However, a few UK life insurers, such as Scottish Amicable and Equitable Life, have already given details of how they intend to take advantage of the new freedoms they have been given by the third life directive, and others have initiatives planned for the autumn. The third life directive, which came into effect at the start of this month, frees the cross-border activities of European life companies by allowing them to market products directly rather than relying on customers coming to them. It reins in the powers of local regulators who will no longer set minimum rates for premiums or control the wording of policies. Rules governing where policyholders' funds are invested will also be less restrictive. Unit-linked policies - which link policyholder returns directly to investment performance - will become more common. Prices should begin to level out, giving consumers a better deal. )Mr John Stone, chairman of Lombard International, a Luxembourg-based European life insurance company, sees significant advantages for UK companies which have more sophisticated products and more advanced information technology. There are, he believes, particular opportunities in markets which have traditionally offered the narrowest range and poorest value products, such as Germany. Lombard is targeting affluent individuals. Last year, the group, which benefits from Luxembourg's highly favourable tax regime, earned about 40 per cent of its Pounds 80m of premium income from Germany. Other sales came from Belgium, France, the UK and Sweden. J Rothschild Assurance is another on the Euro-enthusiast wing of the UK life industry. In March, it set up J Rothschild International Assurance, which is seeking to establish links with German regional banks. Scottish Amicable has also announced a new operation, approaching the European landscape in two ways. Its Dublin-based subsidiary is to seek business in Europe, initially through capitalising on its parent's reputation among independent financial advisers. In a piece of lateral thinking, it will also use the different tax regimes in the UK and the rest of Europe as an opportunity to sell from Dublin into the UK. The tax differences enable it to produce policies at lower prices than if it were based in the UK. The UK system taxes income to policyholders as it builds up in the funds. Most of the rest of Europe taxes income when it is withdrawn from the fund and reaches the individual. Despite Scottish Amicable's move, many UK life companies are conscious of the different tax regimes as a factor blunting the immediate impact of the directive. But there is a feeling that even if the tax question is resolved quickly, as the Association of British Insurers has been urging, cultural differences will take longer to overcome. Many Europeans who are used to a market of highly regulated products may, for example, shy away from policies which offer them greater risks as well as greater returns. Mr Detlef Klaus, partner with Finanzplan, a Wiesbaden-based network of inter-mediaries, which sells products for Lombard, Friends Provident and a number of other companies, says that for 'most customers, business will stay as it is for the next five years. Many people will buy from the intermediaries they know, and they will not take out highly sophisticated plans.' 'You have to have distribution and deal in the language and culture of your customer,' says Mr Richard Giles, head of Sun Alliance's overseas life business, which has operations in five continental European countries, 'and the third life directive doesn't alter that'. So for the time being, the focus for many of the larger insurers is elsewhere. Legal &amp; General, for example, has indicated that it intends to concentrate in the short term on developing its UK operation. Mr Newmarch is enthusiastic about opportunities in east Asia. Though the cultural and regulatory barriers are higher than in Europe, they are outweighed by the sheer scale of the potential market and the speed at which it could grow. BAT Industries, which owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star Life, also regards China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan - where the group recently obtained a provisional trading licence - as a higher priority. Eagle Star Life has a sizeable presence in Spain and Ireland but is far less optimistic about expansion elsewhere on the Continent. According to Mr George Greener, chairman of the two subsidiaries: 'Europe is very difficult.'</p>

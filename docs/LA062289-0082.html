			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION PLAZA EXPANSION STARTS GAINING GROUND  </P> <P> Saying a controversial $117-million shopping center expansion is vital to this  city's financial well-being, Mayor Robert L. Bacon predicted Wednesday that the  work will proceed now that a pivotal city councilman has given his support.  </P> <P> At a press conference to rally support for the expansion of Fashion Plaza,  Bacon said: "My belief is that this project will be approved" at a joint City  Council-Redevelopment Agency meeting Monday.  </P> <P> Bacon said one of two councilmen previously opposed to the expansion plan,  Bradley J. McFadden, now favors the deal after extracting further financial  concessions from the developers, mall owner Sylvan S. Shulman and developer May  Centers Inc.  </P> <P> McFadden, asserting that the recently modified deal was probably the best the  city could expect, acknowledged that he conditionally favors the expansion. In  an interview, McFadden said he still wants assurances from May Centers that it  will not abandon the city's other shopping mall, Eastland Shopping Center,  which the developer owns.  </P> <P> The Redevelopment Agency and May Centers this week are negotiating a separate  revitalization agreement for Eastland that also will be presented Monday.  McFadden said that the company has agreed to $3.5 million in improvements of  the mall's exterior and that tax revenues will not drop.  </P> <P> The developers have also guaranteed that the city will receive $2.2 million  dollars over the next 10 years in addition to its portion of the tax revenues  generated by the Fashion Plaza expansion. The developers had originally offered  $1.6 million.  </P> <P> "If everything goes favorably between now and Monday and if we come to a  suitable compromise (on Eastland) . . . I will be more in favor," McFadden  said, referring to the Fashion Plaza proposal. "If we don't approve (the  agreement), even with the terms being offered, what will happen is there will  be a dilapidated Eastland and an old Fashion Plaza.  </P> <P> "To me, it's clear that we'll be better off with it than without it."  </P> <P> Last month, May Centers officials said they were reconsidering their  participation because of the apparent 3-2 split on the City Council over the  terms of Fashion Plaza's expansion. The proposal calls for the city to buy and  clear developed land near the Fashion Plaza for the expansion.  </P> <P> If the current owners are not willing to sell, the agency might have to condemn  the land. Condemnation proceedings by the agency board, made up of the five  council members, requires four votes.  </P> <P> Until recently, McFadden and Councilman William Tarozzi had expressed  reservations over the city's financial role in the project. Tarozzi has said  the city is giving away too much in anticipated tax revenues pledged to the  developers.  </P> <P> In March, the agency gave preliminary approval to the plan, instructing its  staff to negotiate a development agreement with the Shulman-May Centers  partnership. May Centers is a subsidiary of St. Louis-based May Department  Stores.  </P> <P> The plan for Fashion Plaza calls for adding a 140,000-square-foot May Co.  store, 100,000 square feet of new mall space and up to 82,000 square feet of  small shops near the plaza. The plaza now has 1 million square feet. The May  Co. store in the Eastland mall would be closed.  </P> <P> A large portion of the existing mall would be rehabilitated, including adding a  restaurant area and skylights and upgrading the entrance and interior. The  proposal calls for the city's acquiring -- possibly through condemnation -- 26  acres of existing developed land east of the mall.  </P> <P> Lawrence M. Costello, May Centers associate development director, said the  company views the fourth vote as crucial. "If we don't get the four votes  needed, we will have to sit down with our partners and possibly reconsider," he  said.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the proposed agreement, the city would rebate to the  developers up to $100 million in anticipated revenues over the 30-year life of  the agreement. Most of that would go to pay off the construction bonds,  redevelopment officials said.  </P> <P> The proposal calls for the city to give up all the new property tax revenues  created for 30 years. For the first 15 years, the city would give up 85% of the  new sales taxes created by the expansion, and 70% of it in the following 15  years.  </P> <P> "These payments will come solely from additional tax revenues that we don't  have today," Bacon said, adding that the city will net $35 million in new sales  and property taxes over the life of the agreement.  </P> <P> The mall now generates an estimated $1.2 million annually in sales tax, which  the city would retain. That is 15% of the city's annual sales tax revenue.  </P> <P> The agency would issue $42 million in tax-exempt bonds to acquire and clear  land, relocate existing businesses and install public improvements. The  developers would have to pay off the bonds, which would be secured by the mall  property. The city will maintain ownership of the land.  </P> <P> Shulman-May Centers will pay the city about $7 million for the property in the  expansion area. The developers are responsible for the $40-million mall  expansion, the addition of small shops near the plaza and new retail space, the  $17.5-million renovation of the existing mall, and the $13-million construction  of the new May Co. store.  </P> <P> The revitalization is intended to transform the 14-year-old center into a  "super regional mall" better able to compete with the Puente Hills Mall, Santa  Anita Fashion Park in Arcadia, and the Montclair Plaza, which has four major  department stores. The mall has a Broadway, J. C. Penney and a Bullock's  department store. The mall "is perceived as a mediocre center" by today's  standards, Costello said.  </P> <P> According to city studies, the Fashion Plaza has experienced a 7% decline in  sales and a 19% drop in foot traffic from last year.  </P> <P> Ben Wong, president of the Chamber of Commerce, and Gary Enderle, president of  the Fashion Plaza Merchants Assn., said the expansion is vital to the mall's  survival, and chided critics for not being realistic.  </P> <P> "It is clear that those individuals who are opposed to the deal have simply not  looked at the facts or do not understand them," Wong said.  </P></p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / China worried by spate of air crashes SIX serious air crashes in less than 12 months have cast a shadow over China's aviation sector, just as it is seeing a boom in passenger traffic and a proliferation of new airlines. Last Friday's accident in which a BAe 146 operated by China Northwest Airlines ploughed into a lake on take-off seems certain to add to pressures on authorities to improve safety standards. The crash killed 55 of the 113 passengers and crew, and many survivors were badly injured. The accident at Yinchuan, west of Beijing, happened just days after Mr Jiang Zhuping, head of the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the country's regulatory agency, announced the Chinese would freeze approvals for new airlines because of safety concerns. From one airline just five years ago, China now boasts at least 35 carriers, with a number of pending applications. In 1992 passenger traffic grew 33 per cent and is expected to surge 20 per cent this year. Since July 1992, when a Soviet-made Yak-42 transport exploded and crashed at Nanjing airport killing 106 people, China's skies have proved anything but safe. A spate of aircraft and helicopter crashes have left a death toll of over 300 and badly tarnished China's air safety record. The Chinese authorities have not speculated on the cause of Friday's crash in the Ningxia region, a popular tourist destination because of its proximity to the Great Wall. Sensitive to negative publicity, China has sent a senior official, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, to the crash site and to the local hospital to visit the injured. In London, British Aerospace said the company would send investigators to the site but had no reason to believe there was any fault with the aircraft. The BAe 146 was one of a fleet of about 16 delivered to China since the mid-1960s.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] MELCO has developed a 256 Kbit low power consumption  SRAM ``M5M5256C/5255C'' which uses the latest circuit design  technology and 0.7 micron process technology to enable low  voltage operation and high speed access. Samples are already  being shipped. MELCO is marketing them for use in portable  terminals, electronic memo books and notebook size personal  computers.    The new product uses the same processes as the low power  consumption second generation 1 megabit SRAM's, and it is  completely compatible with the current 256 kilobit SRAM's (B  version). The bit configuration is 32 k x 8 bit; and products  with access times of 55 ns, 70/85/100 ns are being provided. The  power consumption is 150 miliwatts when conducting read out  operations, and 0.15 microwatts during standby.    The operational voltage in the standard item is 4.5-5.5 V,  but low voltage operation is also possible with an access time  of 120 ns at 2.7-5.5 V, and an access time of 85 ns at 3.0-3.6  V. The packages are supplied in 258 pin DIP, SOP and TSOP.</p>

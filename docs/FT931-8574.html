			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Third-best results for Desjardins CANADA'S biggest co-operative financial institution, the Quebec-based Mouvement des Caisses Desjardins, says 1992 proved its third best year despite the recession, higher loan loss provisions and commercial property problems at its affiliated trust company. Desjardins operates nearly 1,500 retail banking branches in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and New Brunswick, life and general insurance units and a wholesale banking operation. Overall, 1992 profit was CDollars 286m (USDollars 228m), up 18 per cent from 1991. Assets rose 9 per cent to CDollars 56bn, well ahead of its Quebec rival, National Bank of Canada. The core Quebec retail banking business generated most of the profit, with good gains in personal and mortgage lending and in deposits. The trust company's loss was CDollars 22.2m, up from CDollars 16.6m in 1991, because of larger provisions to cover third property loans for the second year running. It has dropped its dividend and wants to convert CDollars 25m of debentures into shares. Desjardins trimmed its workforce by 1,400 to 36,000 last year. It warned of further rationalisation by shutting down a loss-making Montreal branch hit by an eight-month strike in 1992.</p>

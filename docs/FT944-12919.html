			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Property: Cool and controlled - that's how to create a best cellar - Demand from oenophiles remains solid As an object of desire it is temperamental, can suffer from alarmingly expensive ailments, and is rarely a thing of beauty. But wine-lovers are a patient breed and, to them, a cellar is to be prized, cajoled and indulged - especially as it might be protecting a considerable investment. Since three men were jailed earlier this year for the systematic theft of Pounds 2m worth of fine wines held in bond, a private - and secure - cellar has become even more attractive. BBC Food and Drink television host Oz Clarke and the Marquess of Bristol were among the victims, but the ripple of shock must have rattled claret glasses across the land. 'A lot of people ask: 'Has the house got a cellar? Because we have a lot of nice wine.'' says Colin Swait, of estate agent Hamptons. 'Most people seem to keep their wine under the stairs these days. But there are still those who buy wine to put down, so the cellar is an advantage.' Max Robertson would not live in a house without one. The voice of radio tennis until he retired nine years ago, Robertson lives in the Old Manor, a Grade II-listed Georgian house owned by Patricia Savill in Aldbourne, Wiltshire - which is now on the market through Savills, the agent, which is seeking offers of more than Pounds 1m. Almost immediately after they moved in 2 1/2 years ago, a programme of restoration was put in hand. Included was an electronic cooling system installed in the 20ft by 8ft cellar to maintain a constant temperature for his wine collection. An emergency generator provides back-up in the event of a power failure. He points out: 'If you have nice wines - and I'm not saying mine are the greatest - it is worth keeping them well.' Indeed, he says a suitable cellar was a prime consideration in moving to Aldbourne - although his previous homes in the Channel Islands and Wandsworth, south-west London, both had temperature-controlled cellars. 'My present cellar can hold between 3,000 and 4,000 bottles,' adds Robertson. 'I don't say it does have that many, though - a lot has been drunk.' Apart from the obvious charm of the six-bedroomed manor, with a conservatory running the full length of the back of the house, the cellar has provoked considerable interest. 'I have to say that all the people who have come to view the house have thought it is fantastic,' says Patricia Savill. 'And it wasn't expensive to put in - just over Pounds 5,000.' The wine racks are not included in the sale but a buyer will get an artist's studio, garden cottage, garaging for four cars and a walled rose garden. Among other country houses with wine cellars now on the market is Berden Hall, which is being sold through Bidwells for Pounds 975,000. Six miles from Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, it is grade II*-listed with eight bedrooms, staff cottage and flat, and just over 15 acres. Apart from its wine cellar, it has an indoor pool, billiards room, flood-lit tennis court, squash court and stable yard. The wine cellar is next to a secondary cellar housing the boilers. 'The trouble with a lot of cellars is that people found it convenient to put their oil-fired boilers in there when central heating was installed,' says Swait. 'It can ruin the cellars for wine. But temperature-controlled cellars are an investment.' When the Swaits bought their own house in Surrey, it had brick barrel vaults full of empty Dom Perignon bottles. They turned their cellar into a kitchen. 'Some people fill them in with rubble to cure a damp problem,' he says. 'To take on a cellar can be an expensive business if you have to sterilise the lot to deal with dry rot and then seal it. 'A tennis court is still a bigger attraction than a wine cellar, especially to people with daughters. A tennis court keeps them at home and stops them wandering.' Ian Homersham, joint chairman of John D. Wood, adds: 'Your better London house would normally have had a cellar with bins in the basement. A lot have been destroyed because people opened up the basements and now use them.' Where water tables preclude an underground wine cellar, home owners often dedicate a ground floor room as a wine store. One family who bought a house in East Anglia planned to return such a room to everyday use as a dining room. When they picked up the keys and arrived at their new home, they found the doorbell and the knocker had been removed. Once inside, they realised everything else had been stripped, too. But there was a happy ending. As Andrew Hay, of Knight Frank and Rutley, tells it: 'When the family began to refurbish, they discovered the bins at ceiling height in the wine store had not been emptied. They were full of vintage claret and port. The family sold it for a fortune - enough to pay for the work.'

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WE MUST DO MORE THAN DEPLORE THE KILLING WE FINANCE;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: PROFOUND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGES ARE NEEDED, BUT TO CALL FOR  THEM IS TO CALL DOWN ON ONESELF THE SAME FATE AS THE SIX MURDERED JESUITS.  </P> <P> The barbaric slaughter of six Jesuits and two co-workers in El Salvador last  week continues to reverberate through the United States. Although Congress  inexplicably refused to send the modest signal of withholding part of U.S.  military assistance until evidence of serious pursuit and prosecution of the  murderers is manifest, it is clear that the latest atrocities could be a threat  to new military aid.  </P> <P> Such predictions are cold comfort to Salvadorans caught in the cross fire of  insurgency and repression, but they have significance for the U.S. tie to the  violence. It is the American connection that protests rightly focused on during  the past week; Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk, president of the Catholic Bishops  Conference wrote President Bush, calling for U.S. diplomatic action to press  the investigation of the killings and to protect civilians.  </P> <P> In the last decade, the United States has been part of the war in El Salvador  because we have contributed $4 billion to the Salvadoran government. It is not  enough to deplore the violence; we are part of the process that has sustained  it.  </P> <P> From Archbishop Oscar A. Romero in 1980 to Archbishop Rivera y Damas today, the  Roman Catholic Church has defined the roots of the crisis in terms of social  justice and human rights. A long-suffering population -- the vast majority of  the country -- has experienced neither protection of their rights nor  participation in their society. A marginalized peasantry, a harassed labor  movement and a persecuted church testify to the need for profound socioeconomic  change. To call for these changes is to be labeled radical, or communist, and  to be vulnerable to the kind of brutal attacks experienced by the Jesuits.  </P> <P> Moreover, the attacks continue: In the past week, security forces have raided  Catholic and Protestant offices; threats have been made on the government radio  against Archbishop Rivera and auxiliary Bishop Rosa Chavez, and religious  workers have been expelled from the country. An astonishing precedent was set  by the country's attorney general -- responsible for investigating the murder  of the Jesuits -- when he wrote to the Pope, urging the removal of bishops from  El Salvador. The facade of the letter was to protect the bishops; the intent  was clear: Church support for the poor is unacceptable.  </P> <P> The murdered Jesuits and the threatened church workers who carry on their  witness should be seen as representatives of a wider movement. A process  initiated by Vatican Council II produced a church committed to "the option for  the poor" throughout Latin America. In Central America, the theme was given a  specific application by Archbishop Romero: The church was called to accompany  the poor in their struggle for human rights and social justice. The fulfillment  of this vocation has produced martyrs -- bishops, priests, sisters and laity.  </P> <P> To see the Jesuits as accompanying the people focuses attention on all  Salvadoran deaths, which do not attract the attention of the assassination of  six priests. In the past month, more than 600 Salvadorans have been killed.  While the attacks on church officials have consistently come from the right,  both government and insurgency have treated the civilian populace as only a  means to their ends.  </P> <P> As we celebrate Thanksgiving week, all this brutality can seem distant: awful,  yet removed. But the United States is not removed from the war. U.S. aid has  sustained the Salvadoran government. Advocates of U.S. policy quickly point out  the results of this expenditure: The insurgency has been contained, if not  defeated, elections have been held and some reform of the military has been  pursued. Critics of the policy point to other results: intensified war, an  escalation of the technological violence through expanded air power, an elected  government that seemingly has no control over death squads and hardly any over  its military and Treasury police.  </P> <P> In the face of the debate about U.S. aid, some realities are clear. The United  States cannot avoid some responsibility for the violence, and several immediate  steps by Washington are in order. First, it must be made clear to the  Salvadoran government and its military that this "open season" on church  personnel will not be tolerated; more specifically, it will not be funded.  </P> <P> Second, effective, aggressive pursuit and prosecution of the murderers of the  Jesuits and their co-workers will be a definitive test in the next round of  appropriations for military aid. The message should be: No arrests, no  prosecution, no aid. Third, the civilian population must not be treated as  "suspected sympathizers" or "suspected subversives" but as civilians, immune  from attack. Fourth, the International Red Cross must be allowed access to all  areas of conflict and provided the necessary protection to do its work.  </P> <P> Fifth, churches designated as places of refuge must be respected; by extension,  church agencies should be allowed to function in safety. Sixth, the Soviet  Union needs to be engaged by President Bush at the Malta summit; Moscow must  deliver equally firm messages about protecting civilians, prohibiting the  taking of hostages and respect for religious and humanitarian agencies to the  insurgents.  </P> <P> Finally, after a decade of war, the Central American peace process stands out  as the reasonable, humane and moral imperative to be pursued by all parties.  The Salvadoran bishops' continued call for dialogue leading to negotiation is  the alternative to the violence and madness that has engulfed El Salvador for a  decade and, last week, claimed the lives of eight of its noblest citizens.  </P></p>

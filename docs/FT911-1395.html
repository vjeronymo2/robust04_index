			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Arts: Correction In my review of Black Snow at the Cottesloe in last Saturday's paper, the role of one of the secretaries at the Moscow Arts Theatre was attributed to Elizabeth Bradley rather than Gillian Barge. There are two secretaries in the play, both of whom play other parts as well and both are uniformly excellent. Apologies to Ms Bradley and Ms Barge for any confusion.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, 4 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--According  to sources in departments in charge of price administration in  Guangzhou, the price index, which rose earlier this year,  dropped by a wide margin recently.    The recent price index for Guangzhou City increased 17.5  percent, which was 7.6 percentage points lower than last year's  average. According to preliminary estimates from departments in  charge of price administration, the index dropped nine percent  or so in May, which was markedly lower than the average increase  in prices in the first quarter of this year. The rising trend  in the general level of retail commodity prices has slowed down.  Retail prices of a number of nonstaple foodstuffs and  industrial products for daily use are lower than in the same  period last year.    In order to deal with such problems as the production of  fake  and inferior goods, reaping staggering profits, asking  exorbitant prices, and monopolizing the market, and to  standardize pricing behavior, from 6 June on, departments in  charge of the commodity price inspection in the city will  strengthen the administration of work encouraging sales at  marked prices and will punish, in strict accordance with laws  and regulations, units and individuals who do not sell  commodities at marked prices in a standardized manner. The  practice of unreasonable charges levied in the service sector  will be punished according to provincial regulations on the  administration of executive charges, state regulations on price  administration, and other laws and regulations.</p>

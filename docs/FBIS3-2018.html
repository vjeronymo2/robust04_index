			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 3 (AFP)--China, which has warned  that the row over Hong Kong will hurt Britain's interests in the  mainland market, gave reassurances Thursday that it conducted  its trade on the basis of "fair play." "We welcome foreign  companies coming to compete on the basis of fair play in the  Chinese market," foreign ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a  weekly news briefing when asked about the threat to discriminate  against British companies. "We always handle international trade  in the spirit of principles of fair competition, equality, and  mutual benefit and in the light of established international  practices," said Shen.    European Union (EU) Commissioner Leon Brittan said here  Tuesday that he had received "unequivocal" assurances from China  that it would not take discriminatory action against any EU  state on political grounds.    The assurances followed Chinese Foreign Trade Minister Wu  Yi's reiteration the previous day of Beijing's stance that  Britain's "unfriendly and uncooperative" behaviour on Hong Kong  would inevitably damage Sino-British trade ties. The comment  followed last month's escalation of the row between London and  Beijing in the wake of the adoption by Hong Kong's legislature  of part one of a bill broadening the franchise in the final  elections before the colony reverts to China in 1997.    On the Hong Kong administration's announcement Wednesday  that, even after the proposed transfer of funds to help pay for  a 20.3 billion U.S. dollar airport, it would leave behind some  120 billion HK dollars (15.4 billion US) in reserves in 1997,  Shen said only that China should not be left with a huge  economic burden. "We must not leave an excessively heavy  economic burden to the people of Hong Kong and the government of  the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," said Shen,  despite the fact that the level of reserves was nearly five  times the amount London has guaranteed.    The financing of the airport is another bone of contention  between Britain and China, with Beijing constantly raising  concerns that it may become an excessive drain on the  territory's funds.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Revised figures show stronger demand for zinc Demand for zinc, a metal used mainly by galvanised steel producers and in castings for the automotive and building industries, has been much more buoyant so far this year than it was previously believed. According to the London-based International Lead and Zinc Study Group, an intergovernmental organisation, zinc consumption in the first half of 1994 was 2.2 per cent ahead of that for the same months last year at 2.798m tonnes. A month ago the ILZSG reported that consumption in the first five months was down by 1.3 per cent from the 1994 level at 2.245m tonnes. The study group said yesterday that it had made the hefty revision because it now had more reliable statistics from the US where zinc consumption growth was much stronger than expected in the first half. Also, demand in Europe had remained stable rather than making the anticipated slip downwards. The latest statistics suggest that output of refined zinc outside for former communist bloc in the first half was below demand - but still rising. It was 1 per cent above the 1993 first-half at 2.752m tonnes. However, eastern bloc exports, particularly from China, were causing the zinc market real damage, suggested Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, an affiliate of Jardine Fleming,pointed out that last year Chinese zinc exports rose to a record 148,000 tonnes, an 85 per cent jump from the 80,000 tonnes exported in 1992. 'This (Chinese) zinc has been homeless and has bloated London Metal Exchange stocks to all-time record levels of 1.223m tonnes,' he said. 'A dramatic supply side development,' such as a smelter closure, was essential for any sustained recovery in the zinc price. Mr Jim Lennon, analyst at Macquarie, the Australian bank, said, however, that, the zinc price seemed unlikely to go much lower as good European buying emerged any time it dipped to Dollars 950 a tonne. Last night zinc for delivery in three months closed on the LME at Dollars 969.50, up Dollars 5 a tonne. Legislation is to be passed to prevent the US Defence Logistic Agency disposing of any more zinc from its stockpile - except to other governments  -between October and April. Producers have voiced concern about DLA sales of up to 50,000 tonnes a year.</p>

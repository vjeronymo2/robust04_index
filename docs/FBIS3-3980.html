Pentagon Spokesman Dennis Boxx told a news briefing that  there are currently 219 military personnel in Mogadishu awaiting  transportation and 496 in transit.    "Once the last troops are gone," Boxx said, "the 1,328 Navy  and Marine Corps personnel ashore from the Inchon Amphibious  Ready Group will load back on the ships" and will depart the  area.    Boxx said, "That will leave about 50 Marines behind as  security for the U.S. liaison office and about 13 service  members as logistics and contract support advisers to the UNOSOM  II commander."    549 other American military personnel operating elsewhere in  the region in support of the Somali operation are scheduled to  depart by the end of this month, the spokesman also said.    A welcome home ceremony will be held at Andrews Air Force  Base on March 28 and that "marks the completion of the  withdrawal and the exit of U.S. forces peacekeeping duties in  Somalia," Boxx said.</p>

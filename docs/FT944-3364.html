			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Cleared Collor may try to make political comeback Brazilians reacted with a mixture of anger and resignation yesterday to news that former president Fernando Collor, who left office in 1992 amid corruption allegations, had been cleared of the charges by the Supreme Court. Mr Collor said he had always had faith in justice. 'With my friends I do not celebrate. We merely share an intimate satisfaction in knowing that, finally, justice was done,' he said. Politicians close to Mr Collor are thought to be preparing an appeal for the lifting of a separate Senate ruling banning him from holding public office until the year 2000. Even if unsuccessful, Mr Collor is only 45 and is widely thought to be planning a political comeback. Public criticism was most virulent against attorney general and prosecutor Mr Aristides Junquiera, who was attacked over the way he presented his case. However, legal specialists pointed out that it was very difficult to link Mr Collor to the alleged influence peddling scheme which took place during his government. Without documents directly linking the former president to the acceptance of money, several of the eight judges hearing the case decided the evidence was too weak. Many people interviewed by television and radio stations yesterday expressed disappointment at the ruling, but no great surprise. An opinion poll conducted ahead of the trial found more than half the interviewees believing Mr Collor would not be found guilty of the charge he faced of 'passive corruption'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ottawa, May 3 (XINHUA) -- Bank of Montreal plans  for an expansion in China to serve Canadian business there, the  Canadian newspaper GLOBE AND MAIL said today.    Neil Tait, the bank's senior vice-president for Asian  banking, was quoted as saying that the bank wants to upgrade its  presence in China. It intends to convert the Guangzhou office  into a full branch and to open a branch in Shanghai, he said.    "We would like to see more so that we can service the needs  of Canadian businesses," Tait said, adding that "we believe that  the Canadian banks have to be there on the ground in the market  to allow Canadian business to enter China."    The bank's chairman and chief executive officer Matthew  Barrett will meet Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji in Beijing  this week to discuss the expansion plans.    Bank of Montreal is not the first Canadian financial  institution to branch out in China. Last year, Royal Bank of  Canada became the first Canadian Bank to open a full branch in  the country.    Tait said it is mostly small and medium-sized businesses in  Canada that have an interest in establishing a presence in  China. "So the banking system has to be there as a leader as  opposed to countries such as Europe or North America, where  businesses are larger and can enter those markets more readily,"  he added.    He said, the branches will initially be offering trade  financing services to stimulate trade between Canada and China.  Money markets and project financing will also be offered, he  said.    China has hinted at a greater role for foreign banks in its  booming markets. Hong Kong Bank, with its affiliate Hang Seng  Bank Ltd., has one of the largest networks among foreign banks  in China, with 12 branches and four representative offices,  while Standard Chartered Bank has 13 branches and offices.    U.S. and Japanese banks are also angling for a bigger  presence in China.</p>

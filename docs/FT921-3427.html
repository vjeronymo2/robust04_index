			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Attributable loss at Inoco increases sharply to Pounds 8m Pre-tax losses at Inoco, the property development company, were reduced from Pounds 6.13m to Pounds 3.71m in the year to December 31. Gross rents receivable slipped to Pounds 10.4m (Pounds 10.8m). The share of associated companies' losses grew to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 799,000) though the exceptional costs declined to Pounds 691,000 (Pounds 1.78m). Below the line however, there was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 4.32m (profit Pounds 1.51m) relating mainly to the sale of the investment in Gulf Resources &amp; Chemical Corporation and the investment properties in Houston, Texas. This resulted in attributable losses of Pounds 8.01m, sharply up on last time's Pounds 4.27m, but down on the Pounds 10.4m at the interim stage. Losses per share were cut to 1.78p (2.79p). On the plus side, voids throughout the year remained below 8 per cent - a 'creditable performance in prevailing market conditions'.</p>

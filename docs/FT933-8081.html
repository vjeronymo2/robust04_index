			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Monopolies Reports on British Gas: Call for body to monitor watchdogs - Regulators BRITISH Gas yesterday called on the government to reconsider urgently establishing a body to regulate the privatised industry regulators. Its call followed the rejection by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of a request by British Gas and others for the commission to examine the overall system of regulation. According to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, the commission concluded that its terms of reference were inappropriate to a wider assessment of the way regulatory affairs are conducted. British Gas made a number of criticisms of the regulation system to the commission. They included: instability and uncertainty in the system; overlap between the Office of Fair Trading, the Department of Trade and Industry and Ofgas; inadequate procedures for the management of regulation; and the public perception of an acrimonious relationship between Ofgas and British Gas. The commission, in its report on the Fair Trading Act reference, confirms that it was asked to consider a number of detailed changes to the regulatory system set up by the 1986 Gas Act that were outside its remit. 'Any findings which we were to make relating to the (gas) industry would inevitably be considered as having relevance to other regulated industries,' it says. Such issues raise considerations of such importance, it adds, that if they are to be considered 'they should be dealt with in the context of suitably broad terms of reference which would allow a relevant body to consider them as they applied to all regulators and not simply a single example'. It is not clear whether the commission feels it would be the right body to carry out this role, or even whether it believes such a change is necessary at this stage. Yesterday it declined to expand on the view expressed in the report. But in an interview with the Financial Times last week, Mr Graeme Odgers, the new chairman of the commission, indicated he was not convinced of the need for change in the regulatory framework. He said: 'Because the privatisation process as a whole has been so successful, the government should think very carefully before making any substantial changes to the regulatory regime.' The disappointment of British Gas and others at the commission's failure to investigate the regulatory system appears to stem from confusion about its role. But it was 'not right to think of the MMC as regulator of the regulators.' The UK system of regulation, including the regulation of competition, involves a separation of the roles of investigator, prosecutor and adjudicator, which Mr Odgers is keen to preserve. The commission's role is to act as adjudicator. Regulating the regulators would involve it in a prosecuting role. The commission's rejection of British Gas's request for an examination of the regulatory system should not be interpreted as reluctance to carry out privatisation inquiries in future. Mr Odgers confirmed last week that the commission was happy to continue to handle them.</p>

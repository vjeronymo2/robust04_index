			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, 22 April (LETA) -- The focal point of the  meeting of the Latvian Government's head, Valdis Birkavs, with  the delegation of the European Union [EU] was what issues Latvia  wishes to discuss at the conference in Paris scheduled for late  May and dedicated to the European stability pact.    The governmental information agency reports that Valdis  Birkavs confirmed his willingness to take an active part in the  European stability pact. Speaking on the issues Latvia would  like to consider during the coming conference in Paris, the  prime minister said Latvia is interested to involve into the  discussion with other countries of the issues of national  identity preserving, national minorities' integration into a  society and teaching a state language.    Latvia would wish to view the possibility of launching the  ombudsman institution. The issue of the repatriation of Russian  military retirees is of the same importance and needs  consideration in the context of the stability pact. All these  matters Latvia would like to discuss at the multilateral talks.    Mentioning the issue of the borders with Russia, Birkavs  expressed doubt whether it is comprehensive to discuss the issue  at the coming conference and stressed the fact that Latvia is  forming its stand basing upon the peace pact of 1920 between the  two states.</p>

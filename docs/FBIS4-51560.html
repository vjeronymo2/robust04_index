			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report; from the "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] Speaking with reporters today, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai said the Hata cabinet will continue to  pursue reformist policies which the Hosokawa government  initiated and seek cooperation from the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] which jointly ran the previous government in  implementing those reformist policies.    [Begin Kumagai recording] Prime Minister Hata was involved  in working out those reformist policies as deputy prime  minister. I believe that the Hata government will inherit and  develop the reformist policies which the Hosokawa government  worked out. [end recording].    While speaking with the reporters, the chief cabinet  secretary also stressed that the Hata government will promote  political reform which still leaves the issue of drafting a bill  on the demarcation of single-seat constituencies unresolved,  economic reform to relax bureaucratic deregulations, and  administrative reform to precipitate decentralization.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai commented on the discussion  of ways to reform the current tax system by ruling coalition  parties in a recent interview with the NHK and said as follows:    [Begin Kumagai recording] In the past, the SDPJ participated  in the discussion. With the SDPJ breaking away from the  coalition, however, the discussion is making little headway.  Some are asserting that the discussion should be held without  the SDPJ. It is important to promote reform of the current tax  system in a way that we lure the SDPJ back to the coalition, but  I believe that the SDPJ will absolutely not come bask to the  coalition. Therefore, we will have to make substantive efforts  to make the SDPJ come back to the coalition. [end recording].    In this way, Mr. Kumagai indicated that as a minority  government, the Hata government will carry out the reformist  policies while giving consideration to the SDPJ.    With regard to the issue of Japan's participation in the  collective self-defense set by the UN Charter, the government  has so far taken the view that Japan's participation in the  collective self-defense is tantamount to exercising the right of  collective self-defense and that violates the Constitution. In  this connection, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai said the Hata  cabinet does need to alter the view. Thus, he made it clear that  the Hata cabinet does not intend to put into effect the idea of  changing the interpretation of the Constitution that has been  broached by Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party].</p>

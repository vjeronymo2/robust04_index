The students, who called themselves the Action  Front of Indonesian Youths (FAPI), intended to see Wahono, House  Speaker, to protest the arrest of 21 students, and to demand the  release of their friends who were detained last month. Those  students had been charged with insulting President Suharto  during a demonstration in front of the House on 14 December.    The new wave of protest by about 40 students criticized the  harsh "security approach" being used by the government in its  development efforts. During the protest demonstration, banners  reading "Security approach is antidemocratic," and "Free our  friends," were unfurled.    Security troops managed to grab some of the demonstrating  students while others succeeded in getting away. The  demonstration was eventually dispersed by the mobile brigade of  the Jakarta Police Headquarters.    It was said that Beathor Suryadi, 35, spokesman for FAPI,  managed to speak to the DPR's public relations officer about the  matter because Wahono was absent from the House. However, while  he was trying to do so, his friends who were waiting outside the  House were arrested.    According to Police Lieutenant Colonel Latif Rabar, the  students were arrested for violating Section 510 of the Criminal  Code of Law -- for staging demonstration and holding street  processions without the police permit.    He said that at this moment, the arrested students are under  intensive police investigation. [passage omitted]    News of the arrest reached Luhut Pangaribuan, director of  Jakarta's Legal Aid Bureau. He said that there was no reason to  arrest the students because they had not broken any law.  [passage omitted]</p>

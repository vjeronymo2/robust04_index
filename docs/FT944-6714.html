			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Berlusconi fights leaks from corruption probe Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the embattled Italian prime minister, this week faces interrogation by Milan magistrates over corruption allegations and a threatened general strike on Friday. Mr Berlusconi was originally expected to be questioned by Milan's anti-corruption magistrates at the weekend, but his lawyer was reported to be unwell and the appointment was postponed. The delay has given the prime minister time to tighten the security surrounding the encounter, which is likely to take place at an undisclosed location in Milan. Political analysts have warned that, should any compromising information emerge, it would be hard for Mr Berlusconi to reject calls for his resignation. He was angered by the leak last Tuesday of the fact that he was being investigated for corruption while running his Fininvest business empire. He is anxious to protect the full secrecy of the interrogation and prevent the Milan judiciary allowing testimony to leak immediately to the media. Mr Berlusconi last week insisted that he had done no wrong while running Fininvest, Italy's second-largest private business group. He has accused the magistrates of conducting a political vendetta against him. Meanwhile, the three main trade union confederations are standing by their call for an eight-hour stoppage on Friday to protest against pension cuts in the 1995 budget even though a compromise plan is to be discussed on Wednesday. The compromise centres on removing structural changes in the costly state pensions system from the 1995 budget and treating them separately. The unions have hinted that this would probably be enough to avert the strike. The new proposals, which would have to include alternative spending cuts, also meet many of the objections to the pension reform plans made by the ruling rightwing coalition's populist Northern League, led by Mr Umberto Bossi. The league leader held a long meeting at the weekend with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. It was announced afterwards that Mr Bossi had pledged to support his coalition partners until the 1995 budget has passed through parliament. The magistrates' move against the prime minister follows recent admissions by his younger brother, Mr Paolo Berlusconi, and by Mr Salvatore Sciascia, the head of Fininvest's tax department, that L330bn (Dollars 204m) was paid between 1989-92 in bribes to officials of the Guardia di Finanza, the financial police, to ensure favourable inspections of company books.</p>

U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the United  States attaches great importance to the meeting between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton due to Syria's basic role in the  peace process and to the expected results of the meeting in  terms of pushing the Middle East peace process forward.    The Americans, in general, think it likely there will be  substantive progress after the summit. However, we do not want  to prejudge things or express excessive optimism due to Israel's  history of destroying peace opportunities and creating  obstacles. Progress in the peace process ultimately hinges on a  change in the Israeli policy toward implementing UN Security  Council resolutions and recognizing the formula of a just and  comprehensive peace in the region. No one sensed this so far.  Moreover, observers agree that Israel will not submit to the  resolutions of international legitimacy and will not put aside  the policy of prevarication and procrastination without an  effective and decisive U.S. role that puts an end to Israel's  evasion of these resolutions.    Syria has dealt with the issue of peace in the Middle East  with absolute sincerity and positiveness. Syria's contribution  has been effective and fruitful, as the world, including the  United States, attests. Syria facilitated the convocation of  the Madrid conference when Israel closed all doors. And since  the sixth round of talks, Syria has presented constructive and  balanced proposals. Syria also twice helped the United States  save the peace process from collapse. The first time was when  Rabin's government sent large forces to southern Lebanon and  committed a wicked barbarian aggression that led to the  displacement of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese civilians.  The second time was when the Washington talks were halted as a  result of the separate deal in Oslo and when Israel overtly  declared that it is not concerned with the Syrian and Lebanese  tracks, thus obstructing the peace talks in Washington.    The Oslo deal reveals an ambiguous and incomplete agreement,  for which its two sides; that is, the Palestinian and Israeli  sides, have conflicting interpretations. This agreement was  rejected by the Palestinian people in the occupied territories  and the diaspora since it contradicts the Security Council  resolutions and does not meet the minimum level of rights and  ambitions. It was not to be nice that Warren Christopher  visited the region and held lengthy talks with President Hafiz  al-Asad in Damascus; talks that were crowned by the arrangement  of a summit in Geneva.    The United Stated realizes that separate deals cannot  achieve  peace and that there is no alternative to returning to the  basics of the Madrid conference, the Security Council  resolutions, and the formula for a just and comprehensive peace  which Syria continues to call for.    Out of the above comes this not-so-optimistic outlook  expressed by Damascus and other Arab capitals. The United  States' reaffirmation of the formula of a just and comprehensive  peace and of the need to implement Security Council resolutions  is a positive factor that helps put the peace process on the  right and beneficial track. However, one must not forget that  Israel has a long record of striking at the peace opportunities,  aborting the peace efforts, and containing the U.S. stands.    It is no coincidence that Israeli officials expect the  situation to heat up in southern Lebanon on the eve of the  Syrian-U.S. summit. In most cases, Israel has resorted to  escalation whenever there are signs of real progress.  Throughout the past, Israel sought to diminish Syria's role,  cast doubts on Lebanon's effectiveness, and convince the United  States to concentrate its efforts on the Gaza-Jericho agreement.  However, the events revealed to the public that only a just and  comprehensive peace can save the Middle East from the whirlpool  of conflicts and wars and that separate deals do not lead to  peace but add more to the serious tension in the region.    President Clinton, who will begin a tour of Russia and many  European countries today, will surely listen to statements that  will reinforce the United States' conviction of the need to  achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East based  on Security Council resolutions and the land-for-peace  principle. President Clinton will find out that President  al-Asad is completely willing to push the peace process forward  and achieve tangible results based on Security Council  resolutions. Syria is eager to achieve peace inasmuch as it is  eager to restore its territories and end the Israeli occupation  of all Arab territories. Peace is synonymous with justice.  Justice stipulates the removal of the Israeli occupation so  every party can restore its rights.</p>

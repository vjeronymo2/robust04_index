			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEGGING  </P> <P> Everyone should read the opinions of George F. Will and Alan M. Dershowitz ("Is  Begging Protected Speech or a Blight on Public Space?" Op-Ed Page, Feb. 1).  </P> <P> Will should remember that this country was founded in large part because of the  dangerous decision to have "actions feed the anarchic impulse toward violent  self-help."  </P> <P> Albeit a well-reasoned decision. 1984 is well past and this is a society in  which the individual is increasingly at the mercy of our bureaucracies.  </P> <P> In one of the world's largest cities, the pace and range of life are, indeed,  harried and frightening. New York City does resemble a Third World city. In a  population density like this, it is just as unreasonable to expect not to be  touched or threatened (how do you outlaw the latter -- one person's threat is  another person's joke?) as to expect daily life to be free of unpleasant people  or situations. The courts seem intent on replacing individual discretion and  common sense with court decisions. This is what happens when bureaucracies make  rules. 1984, indeed.  </P> <P> DAVID R. TABER  </P> <P> Redlands  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporters Kim Chang-yong and Yi Chang-sop] </F>   [Text] At a kindergarten southwest of the Han River, kids  are taught not to buy "bad" foreign goods. A nearby elementary  school advises students against wearing "alien" bags and clothes.    These "indoctrinated" children complain when their parents  casually buy goods bearing foreign brands. Even from childhood,  Korean children are blindly taught to buy only Korean goods and  shun alien goods rather than being trained to compare them for  quality.    In the eyes of foreigners, the episode symbolizes how hollow  President Kim Yong-sam's internationalization drive is. The  Economic Planning Board [EPB] said in its bulletin that  internationalization is not a "zero sum game" but a "positive  sum game." It is also a process of "give and take." But in  Korea, internationalization still seems to mean "to take much  and give less."    Many foreign businessmen are skeptical about Korea's  much-touted internationalization campaign and believe there are  a host of ingrained anti-internationalization practices.    For example, it is legal for foreign religious organizations  to donate whatever amount of money to their Korean counterparts  to build churches or finance missionary activities here. But it  is illegal for a Korean religious organization to send overseas  more than 5,000 dollars without authorization from the  authorities.    Ford has an equity stake in Kia Motors but Ford faces  difficulty in selling its cars through Kia sales outlets in  Korea. Consequently, Kia is unable to sell its cars through the  Ford network in the United States and thus has to spend a huge  amount of money in establishing its sales network in America.    Many Western businessmen said transforming Korea's  producer-oriented economy into a consumer-oriented one is one of  the essential tasks Korea must tackle if it is really dedicated  to internationalizing the economy and its society.    Any talk of importing foreign agricultural produce raises  emotions here and invites noisy opposition from farmers and  politicians for that matter. But Korea's economy loses more  than it gains just because of the import ban on farming  products, they say.    According to the EPB, consumer prices rose by 2.4 percent  from January through February. More than 50 percent of the rise  is attributable to an increase in agricultural products and  service charges, it said.    The solution to arresting inflation is quite simple: The  imports of cheap foreign farming products. Nonetheless, the  government has been hesitating to take action out of concern not  to antagonize farmers, who account for less than 15 percent of  the population. The government has used other tools, squeezing  money supply, which has the chain effect of raising interest  rates, depressing the stock market and stifling manufacturing  investment. In addition, the government mobilizes tax officials  to conduct an audit of businesses not following the  anti-inflation campaign.    Om Pong-song, advisor to the finance minister, said the  government needs to be more internationalized in managing  inflation as the old-style method of curbing money growth puts a  strain on the overall sector.    Korean consumer electronics goods are more than two times as  expensive as foreign goods of the same quality. The wide price  gap is due to the government's high tariffs on imports.    Even when imports are allowed, prices of foreign goods shoot  up due to lack of efficient distribution channels, expensive  office rental fees, high wages and bureaucratic red tape.    As Korean manufacturers are not exposed to hectic  competition  with foreign brands in the domestic market, they have a tough  time in competing with foreign rivals outside Korea.    In the area of technology, the government had tightly  controlled the imports of foreign knowhow. So, Korean makers  could not freely buy much foreign technology which would improve  their product quality as the government scrutinized prices and  contents of technology inducement contracts.    A Western diplomat complained that Korea keeps tight grip on  the opening of the distribution market out of concern not to  damage "unclean and expensive" small-size sundry shops.    But if foreign retailers open shops and clean their floors,  he said, Korean sundry shops will also clean their floors and  lower prices to compete with their foreign rivals. This is also  good for Korean consumers, he said.    The problem does not end here as far as foreign investment  is  concerned. As the United States submitted to the Korean  government a list of industrial sectors, including cable TV  equipment that American businessmen have shown a great interest  in investing here, the local media interpreted this as an  "intolerable U.S. pressure." The U.S. action was in response to  the Korean government seeking to attract foreign direct  investment, an embassy official noted.    A U.S. State Department official said while on a visit here,  "Whenever I read translated versions of Korean language dailies  about Korea-U.S. trade issues, I never fail to notice such words  "U.S. pressure, American threat, demand, meddle in internal  sovereign affairs."    Whatever foreigners talk or propose, it is regarded as a  "demand, threat, or pressure," which blurs the true meaning of  the agenda, he complained.    As Korea has such a xenophobic attitude toward foreign  direct  investment, multinational enterprises shun investing in Korea  and instead team up with other "hospitable" Asian countries and  move to third countries for profitable business expansion. It  is Korea and its companies that lose most due to foreign  hesitancy in initiating ventures here, a Western journalist here  said.    Yi Chong-ku, a director at the Ministry of Finance, said,  "By  internationalization, we mean internationalization of the  industry, system and practices and people."    In his view, Korea had made significant progress in  internationalizing industry and its practices and system, but it  may take time for the Korean people to become internationalized.    The EPB said that the government alone cannot  internationalize Korea. It requires joint efforts by the  government, private companies, farmers, consumer goods and grass  roots people.    It is the people, not the system or industry, that will  internationalize Korea, a Western diplomat said. Thus unless  the Korean people change their narrow-minded, mercantilistic and  xenophobic attitudes, Korea cannot be truly categorized as an  internationalized country, a Seoul professor said.</p>

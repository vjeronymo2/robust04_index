			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OSCAR SCHOLARSHIP  </P> <P> Martin Scorsese should not have been nominated for best director ("The Last  Temptation of Christ"). He should have been nominated for best con man for  displaying a caricature of Jesus Christ in 70 millimeter and fooling a lot of  intelligent people into believing his film had accomplished something  honorable.  </P> <P> If he thinks he has a chance of winning, he is indulging in still another  fantasy.  </P> <P> GREG VELNER  </P> <P> Rowland Heights  </P></p>

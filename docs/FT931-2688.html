			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Brazil still has no budget for 1993 THREE months after it should have been voted by Congress, Brazil has no budget for 1993. Six months into office, the government of President Itamar Franco has still not filled thousands of administration jobs. The delays are the fault of congressmen who, with their eyes on next year's elections, are demanding government jobs for supporters and money for projects in their areas as reward for their support for last year's impeachment of President Fernando Collor and for voting through government legislation. Brazil's highly fragmented party system means that each bill must be negotiated with 19 parties. This year, the budget commission received a record 75,000 requests for the Dollars 9bn which Congress controls of the government budget. On Sunday, Mr Messias Gois, the commission's president, fled in tears from negotiations after being attacked by the proponents of 5,000 amendments excluded from the commission's proposal. It seems to matter little what the projects are for. The latest budget proposal awards more money to Bahia than to Amazonia for combating malaria, yet the disease is almost unknown in the first and endemic in the latter. It reduces to a third the government provision of resources for land reform - one of Brazil's biggest problems. The most popular requests are bridges and roads, because of the potential commissions and electoral appeal. Some deputies are even directors of engineering companies. Mr Paes Landim, a deputy who suggested using the army for road construction, had his amendment shot down, he believes 'because the army don't pay commission'. Complaining that Brazil was ending up with schools where it needs sewerage and bridges where it needs hospitals, Mr Paulo Bernardo, the Workers' Party representative on the commission, said: 'This is becoming a complete marketplace.' Mr Gois told the Brazilian press that he had been offered Dollars 1m bribes by some deputies to accede to their requests. Finally this week, a compromise was reached by the commission, but it must still pass through Congress. Waiting impatiently is Ms Yeda Crusius, the planning minister, unable to plan without the budget. Little better is the process under way to fill jobs in ministries, government agencies and state companies. Mr Franco's wide congressional support means 18 parties, further divided into regional blocs, jostling for positions. A group of deputies from Minas Gerais state have set up a system whereby they award points for federal jobs in their state such as running state companies. Points are then awarded to the deputies according to the level of support they have given to Mr Franco. All then have the right to spend their points. None of this is very inspiring for Brazilians, who vote next month in a referendum on whether to maintain a presidentiial system or return to a parliamentary system and even a monarchy.</p>

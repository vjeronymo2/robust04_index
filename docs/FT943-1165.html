			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Faulty drainage system causing puddles in tunnel Eurotunnel, which operates Channel tunnel services, yesterday confirmed that small amounts of water had collected in the tunnel because of a faulty drainage system, Charles Batchelor writes. The company, which is expected to launch passenger services next week, denied that the accumulation was serious. Eurotunnel said the tunnel had been designed to leak slightly and that five pumping stations had been built to deal with the water. For every kilometre of tunnel there were 600 joints in the lining of the wall. In four places the drain designed to take away excess water had become clogged with silt. The company said: 'We didn't expect the clogging but it is a very minor issue. We are talking about a bucket or two of water over a matter of weeks.' Only three of the pumping stations have had to be used.</p>

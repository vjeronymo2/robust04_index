			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALLED  </P> <P> The statement that, "The Boys Club itself is divided about playing malls," is  simply not true ("Boys Club Malls Its Way Up the Charts," by Dennis Hunt, Dec.  27).  </P> <P> What is true is that there was some initial concern, from myself, as to whether  playing in malls was a prudent career and/or business move for a group such as  the Boys Club.  </P> <P> After an initial meeting with the MCA representatives who were organizing the  event, it became very clear that not only was it an exciting career opportunity  but also a brilliant way to tie in the grass-roots support that is the life  blood for a group in our position.  </P> <P> As for my statement, "It's sort of embarrassing but I'll do the mall thing," my  feeling is that we will go anywhere at anytime to find our audience, until it  is easier for them to find us; whether it's malls, radio stations, promotion  powerhouses in hotel ballrooms, or any other alternative venue, we will be  there, and have been!  </P> <P> JOE PASQUALE  </P> <P> Boys Club, Sylmar  </P></p>

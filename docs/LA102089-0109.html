			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> What are we to make of an "American Baroque Hiboy Refrigerator"? Well, it hums  like a fridge and it has cans of cold Coke inside. But it sits on curving metal  legs and supports an elaborate metal scrollwork balancing a trio of American  Indian pots. And the door is colored leaded glass, with velvet wound around the  handle.  </P> <P> The piece is one of Joel Otterson's ingenious portmanteau creations -- a little  of this and a little of that, pieced together to reflect what he calls the  "hybrid" character of contemporary life. What makes this refrigerator  "American" anyway -- the Coke inside or the artifacts of Indian culture? The  refrigerator surely has become as central a piece of furniture in the  middle-class home as the highboy -- a tall chest of drawers mounted on legs --  once was. (Otterson's spelling gives it the flip, vernacular sound of mass  marketing.)  </P> <P> In "Single Cell on Wheels/Hindeloopen Piece," Otterson paints a colony of  plump, curving PVC sewer pipes punctured by constellations of tiny holes and  painted with small floral designs similar to Pennsylvania Dutch patterns. The  pipes rest on an old-fashioned I-shaped steel pipe delicately balanced on small  piano wheels.  </P> <P> The piece seems to be partly about our surprisingly flexible notions of what  can be decorative, and about the way vastly disparate objects can be read as  organic forms of a greater or lesser order. Puns on the various definitions of  "cell" are also at work here.  </P> <P> And there's more. While he wryly observes consumer culture dancing a jig with  art forms past and present, Otterson -- a young Los Angeles artist who lives in  New York -- is also creating works that stand on their own as delights for the  eye.

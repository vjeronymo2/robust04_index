			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Ciba result undermined by financial factors Ciba, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, reported unchanged first-half net income of SFr1.4bn (Dollars 1.05bn), as unfavourable currency and financial factors undermined a 'creditable' operating result. Mr Alex Krauer, chairman, forecast that net income in the full year would be comparable to last year's SFr1.78bn. First-half sales were down 2 per cent to SFr11.64bn, but operating income rose 3 per cent to SFr2bn. Ciba said operating profits expressed in local currencies jumped by 19 per cent, with two-thirds of the growth coming from better margins and the remainder from expense control. However, the group's financial income, based on liquid funds of SFr7.2bn at the end of last year, plunged 30 per cent to SFr199m, largely because of the decline in market values of many investments. The group's currency hedging activity also suffered, swinging from a SFr44m profit to a SFr61m loss. Ciba said it had been able to compensate partially through hedging the rise in the Swiss franc's value, but the cost was high. Sales in the healthcare division were down 2 per cent to SFr4.24bn, but up 3 per cent in local currencies. Pharmaceutical sales were flat at SFr2.9bn, hurt by pressures from governments to cut prices. Generic competition for the leading anti-rheumatic drug Voltaren should start to have an impact in the second half. However, sales of Ciba Vision, which is acquiring the ophthalmic drugs business of Johnson &amp; Johnson, advanced 6 per cent to SFr530m. The self-medication division, following the acquisition of Fisons products, raised its sales by 3 per cent to SFr485m, 10 per cent in local currencies. The agriculture sector also reported a 2 per cent decline in sales to SFr3.02bn, a 3 per cent rise in local currencies.</p>

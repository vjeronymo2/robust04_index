			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chaowen (1728 6389 2429)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 25 May (XINHUA) -- Jointly sponsored by  the State Planning Commission, the State Economic and Trade  Commission, and the Ministry of Power Industry [MPI], a national  work conference on rural electrification, which opened in  Beijing today, declared that China will, within this century,  supply electricity to all its counties, provide electricity to  more than 120 million farmers living in remote and  poverty-stricken areas, and raise to over 95 percent farmers'  households with access to electricity.    On behalf of the State Council, Vice Premier Zou Jiahua told  the conference that there are three essential requirements in  bringing about rural electrification: policy implementation,  self-reliance, and vigorous utilization of rich local  resources. He said that the CPC Central Committee and State  Council have always been deeply concerned about agriculture,  rural areas, and farmers. They are also deeply concerned about  the process of rural electrification. He urged electricity and  other departments and sectors to cooperate with each other;  enlist the support of local governments and people; redouble  their efforts in implementing the project of using electricity  supplies to alleviate poverty; help the broad masses overcome  poverty and achieve prosperity; and make new, solid  contributions to a thriving rural economy.    It has been learned that China's rural electrification  process, which started in the 1960's, has achieved remarkable  progress since China started implementing the policy of reform  and opening up. By the end of 1993, electricity consumption at  the county and lower levels reached 249 billion kwh, or 35  percent of the nation's total; 97 percent of townships, 93  percent of villages, and 89 percent of farmers' households had  been provided with electricity, showing an increase of 5.2,  14.9, and 23.7 percent, respectively, over the 1980 levels. Per  capita annual electricity consumption for the rural population  reached 48 kwh in 1993, 7.9 times the figure for 1978.  Nationwide, 144 counties have accomplished rural electrification  while plans for rudimentary electrification through the  development of hydroelectric power stations are being carried  out smoothly in 200 counties. Power stations are being built in  the countryside nationwide at different levels and through  multiple channels. A structure of rural power sources that  include electricity supplies from the major power grids, small  hydroelectric and coal-fired power stations, and wind and solar  energy is beginning to take shape.    However, due to the restraints of a multitude of historical  and economic factors and natural conditions, there are still 28  counties, 1,269 towns, and 54,860 villages that have virtually  no electricity supply. About 120 million farmers in  poverty-stricken areas in a dozen provinces and autonomous  regions, mostly in central and western China, are waiting to get  electricity. These areas, often sparsely populated and  economically undeveloped, are the most difficult to electrify  because they are far from major power grids, and the local  finances are tight.    At the conference, the MPI put forward the "Program for  Electrifying China's Countryside in the 1990's." Among its  primary targets are supplying electricity to all counties by the  year 2000 so that most of the poverty-stricken villages and over  95 percent of farmers' households will have electricity. It  also calls for building 1,000 counties with electricity across  the country. These targets have been incorporated as key parts  of the State Council's plan for helping 80 million people  overcome poverty in the next seven years.    It has been learned that the MPI's "project of alleviating  poverty and bringing about common prosperity through the supply  of electricity" has received vigorous support from local  governments. The Shandong Provincial Power Bureau, for example,  has announced a six-point preferential policy. The Inner  Mongolian Autonomous Region worked out a plan of providing power  supplies to all villages. Shaanxi Province has announced a plan  of electrifying impoverished areas in three steps. The meeting  urged local governments and national departments in charge of  planning, economics, electricity, and poverty alleviation to  work as one and make contributions to providing electricity to  farmers' households across the nation.</p>

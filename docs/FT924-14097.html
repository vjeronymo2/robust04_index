			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Job loss warning for British Coal UP TO 100,000 jobs could eventually be lost if British Coal goes ahead with its 'devastating' pit closure programme this week, Mr Stephen Fothergill, director of the Coalfield Communities Campaign, said yesterday. He said companies that service and supply the coal industry will be forced to lay off thousands of workers after the announcement expected this week that 20 collieries are to close with the loss of 20,000 miners' jobs. Between 5,000 and 10,000 rail jobs may also be wiped out, along with thousands of private contractors' jobs, he added. 'It is an absolutely devastating picture,' he said.</p>

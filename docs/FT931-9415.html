			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Schnapps, to take-away TWO MEN in caps, wellington boots and working clothes stand half-way up a Swiss hillside admiring a Heath Robinson contraption of large proportions. An assortment of bins and barrels and pipes throbs gently in the autumn sunshine beside the vineyards at Chardonne in the Vaud canton, halfway between Lausanne and Montreux. It certainly does not look like a place where a precious commodity is manufactured. But it is. Monsieur Raymond Perroud, 25 years a distiller, is turning out fruit schnapps. To a tourist in Switzerland he presents an astonishing sight with his rickety-looking still perched on the edge of the road, but to the locals he is as familiar as gnomes in Zurich. He charges SFr4.60 a litre for distilling cherries into a clear liquid 60 degrees proof that makes your eyes water and your knees wobble. Perroud spends about six months on the road and between times is based at home where anyone can bring their fruit to him for distillation. Perroud is proud of his still - 'it cost me SFr150,000' - but like everything in Switzerland it is regulated down to the last cherry pip. Bureaucrats regularly check on him to ensure that correct standards are maintained. Unlicensed stills are illegal in Switzerland, so 'home-made' schnapps is made by local licensed distillers such as Perroud. Locals take their fruit to such peripatetic distillers and later collect their bounty in the form of fully distilled schnapps. What a pity we cannot obtain a similar service in the UK, especially given the annual glut of soft fruit, pears and apples. Roadside schnapps distilling - now that is a service industry. But, for the visitor, 'home-made' schnapps is difficult to obtain. You will have to plead with Swiss friends for a bottle of the fiery, fruity liquid. Alternatively, the Swiss Wine Growers Association, 4 av. Avant-Poste, Case Postale 1346, CH-10001, Lausanne, can provide you with a list of spirit exporters who can supply good branded schnapps such as Morvand. Delicatessens, such as Manuel in the Place St Francois, Lausanne, also stock a variety of fruit schnapps as do other good food shops in Switzerland.</p>

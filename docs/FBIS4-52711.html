			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Masuo Matsuoka, secretary general of the </F> ruling Japan New Party, by MAINICHI SHIMBUN: place and date not  given -- from "Listening Without Reservation" column]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you think of Shigeto  Nagano's resignation as justice minister?    [Matsuoka] He has already apologized for his controversial  remarks, and I am not in a position to comment on his  resignation.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and  Komeito are in control of the Hata government, is it not true?    [Matsuoka] Outsiders may view the Hata government that way.  The situation is that, after the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] backed out of the coalition, both Shinseito and  Komeito had to fill the vacuum left by the SDPJ. We are calling  on the SDPJ to return to the coalition, and with Shinseito and  Komeito in the coalition, members of the Hata cabinet can be  replaced whenever the SDPJ returns to the coalition.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How are the coalition partners going to  coax the SDPJ into the government?    [Matsuoka] There is no way but for us to show sincerity. The  Japan New Party [JNP] is playing a role of holding the coalition  partners together. The JNP intends to contact the SDPJ through  various channels and create the climate for the SDPJ to return  to the coalition.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN) What are the major tasks the Hata  government must grapple with?    [Matsuoka] It goes without saying that the Hata government  should work for economic recovery. The Hata government will work  on economic reform, deregulation, and administrative reform, for  which the Hosokawa government paved the way. The Hata government  was inaugurated under a banner of continuing those reforms. The  1975 system [the Liberal Democratic Party-SDPJ system] is in the  process of collapsing, but I believe that the biggest task for  the Hata government is to put an end to the system that is still  active.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] With a minority in the Diet, the Hata  government is expected to face difficulty in running the Diet.  How about the possibility of the coalition partners cooperating  with the SDPJ and the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in the Diet?    [Matsuoka] I believe that past coalition partners deserve to  be thanked for their efforts to shore up the Hosokawa  government, and the Hata government should reciprocate their  efforts. Taking advantage of disarray among the coalition  partners, the LDP is making moves to forge an alliance with  conservative members of the SDPJ. If the SDPJ cooperates with  the LDP in running the Diet, this would be a big minus for it,  because the coalition government came into being to end the  one-party rule of the LDP. If the SDPJ cooperates with the LDP  in steering the Diet, it would make meaningless the efforts that  we have made over the past eight months.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Details of the political reform remain to  be work out. What is your opinion?    [Matsuoka] We will have to do everything we can do to get  the  Diet to pass a bill on the demarcation of single-seat  constituencies during its current session. The SDPJ held two  important cabinet posts for political reform and autonomy when a  new electoral system was adopted. The SDPJ should fulfill its  responsibility to the end. Some are advocating that the House of  Representatives should be dissolved and general elections held  under the present multiseat constituency system. If their  advocacy is accepted, this would deny the political reform for  which we have striven so hard. In principle, the general  elections should be held under a new electoral system.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The JNP is suffering a sharp fall in its  public support rating.    [Matsuoka] That means the difference between the ideal and  reality. The JNP has taken the position of keeping the  government in check with the feelings of citizens. The JNP was  an amateur in politics when it was formed, but it later joined  the government as a result of representative Hosokawa's  assumption of the premiership. Our party should deal  realistically with Diet affairs and in its relationship with  other ruling coalition parties. Our party can no longer speak  only of ideals.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How does the JNP plan to win back public  support?    [Matsuoka] Our party is a political group of newly elected  legislators, but our party is rapidly bolstering its  policymaking ability. The JNP has set forth policies from the  position of a civic political party. Our party intends to  fulfill the public's expectations. We will ask representative  Hosokawa to assume his duty of running our party. We also will  ask him to prepare our party for the next leap forward in the  period of change.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Some members of the JNP have broken away,  and their breakaway has shaken the JNP.    [MAINICH SHIHMBUN] Legislators with various experiences and  differing views formed the JNP. Essentially, it is difficult to  hold them together. If they leave the JNP, it would cause big  troubles. I hope they will remain in the JNP and fight for  reforms. In last year's general elections, our party won many  seats with the support of many voters, but our party will be  unable to win so many seats if it simply relies on the support  of voters. It is important for the ruling coalition parties to  create a system under which they make concerted campaigns in the  next general election. I want to urge the ruling coalition  parties to create a unified parliamentary group. If the next  general election is held under the single-seat constituency  system, a change will occur among the ruling coalition parties.  I intend to hasten enactment of the bill on the demarcation of  single-seat constituencies to hold our party together.</p>

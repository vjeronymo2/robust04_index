			<p>BFN     [Text] Hojjat ol-Eslam val-Moslemin Mohammad Reyshahri, the  representative of the esteemed leader and the supervisor of the  Iranian pilgrims to the House of God [Mecca] stressed: The  disavowal of infidels is a part of the hajj, is the spirit of  the hajj and is the true meaning of this great congress.    The supervisor of the Iranian pilgrims to the House of God,  who was speaking before today's Friday prayers sermons in  Tehran, criticized the approach of the Saudi Arabian Government  towards the disavowal of infidels ceremonies and said: We are  not trying to create any disturbances for the Saudi Government.  However, on the basis of Islamic principles and at the urging  of the guardian of the cause of Muslims [Khamene'i], and in  order to implement a divine injunction, we will perform these  ceremonies.    He said: In Islam it is incumbent upon people to take part  in the disavowal of infidels ceremonies. He added: To separate  the political dimension from the hajj means that in this great  congress the Muslims will have to do nothing regarding the  enemies of Islam and should not find any solutions for the  political and social problems in Islamic countries, including in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is burning in the fire of Serbian  atrocities.    He urged Saudi officials not to prevent the Muslims from  carrying out their duty in performing the disavowal of infidels  ceremonies in this year's hajj pilgrimage.</p>

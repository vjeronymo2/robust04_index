			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / E German protests running out of steam DEMONSTRATIONS against unemployment in east Germany appear to be giving way to apathy and resignation. Only 35,000 people turned up for a rally in Berlin yesterday compared with the 100,000 expected by the organisers. On Monday night only about 5,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig, where weekly rallies earlier this year attracted tens of thousands protesting against the collapse of industry. East Germans are expressing increasing scepticism about whether they can change the economic situation by demonstrating, an attitude bred by 40 years of enforced passivity under the Communists. Addressing yesterday's demonstration, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of the IG Metall union, hit back at conservative politicians who had accused him of creating a climate of confrontation which enabled terrorists to assassinate Mr Detlev Rohwedder, president of the Treuhand privatisation agency, on April 1. His critics have also condemned him for organising the weekly protest demonstrations in Leipzig against unemployment. Mr Steinkuhler said it was 'abominable' to use Mr Rohwedder's murder to equate peaceful demonstrations with violence. He demanded an end to 'willy-nilly' privatisation by the Treuhand which he said was demotivating workers. IG Metall is hoping to win an extension of the one-year no-sackings agreement it negotiated last year for the east German metal industry. The agreement runs out on July 1 but the union is to hold talks with employers on April 26. Many employers have been waiting for it to run out before announcing big redundancies.</p>

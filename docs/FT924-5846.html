			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Mussolini's restless heirs: Italy RACIST attacks have prompted the government to announce plans for tougher laws against violence by right-wing groups, writes Robert Graham in Rome. In the latest incident, a 30-year-old Spaniard was beaten and stabbed by skinheads in Milan at the weekend. Italy's sole parliamentary party of the extreme right, the Italian National Right Socialist Movement (MSI-DN), has consistently presented itself as a neo-fascist party inheriting the mantle of Mussolini's national socialism. While its share of the national vote has been falling, from a peak of 8.7per cent in 1983 to 5.4 per cent this year, it has retained a solid core of electoral support especially in the Naples area and in southern Italy. The emergent Lombard League in northern Italy contains national front elements hostile to immigration but it has broader support and does not fall into a crude right-wing extremist category. The 'nazi-skin' movement - skin-heads with neo-Nazi sympathies - is concentrated in cities such as Rome and Milan.</p>

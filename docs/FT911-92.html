			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Fiscal studies institute backs local income tax A LOCAL TAX based on property values is backed as the best short-term replacement for the poll tax in an independent report published yesterday. But the report, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, advocates the introduction of a local income tax in the longer term to raise additional revenue. The report emphasises that what matters more than the method of raising finance is that whatever is chosen should be sustainable and able to survive changes in national government. The institute says that the economic case for a property tax, as now advocated by both the government and the Labour party, is strong because property enjoys substantial fiscal privileges in the UK and should bear its share of taxation. On valuation, Mr Michael Ridge and Mr Stephen Smith of the IFS, who wrote the report, prefer the use of capital values as favoured by the government rather than rental values. But they are unconvinced of the need for 'banding' categories of property by value. 'We see no great merit in rough and ready forms of valuation (numbers of rooms etc.) nor in banding,' they say. 'Both are likely to lead to more perceived inequity in the treatment of similar properties than with a conventional capital valuation; banding in particular seems unlikely to promise much saving in valuation and administration costs, since the tax implications of being placed in one band rather than another are likely to provoke taxpayers to contest the valuation in borderline cases.' The advantage of a local income tax, which is advocated by the Liberal Democrats, is that it could raise more revenue than is now raised from local taxation. That could be important, as funding a high proportion of local government from central grants has often been seen as a source of instability in council finances. There would be a problem of timing, however. A property tax could be introduced quickly - the government is aiming at April 1993 - whereas any form of local income tax would require a much longer timescale. 'In the longer term, however, if it is intended that local taxes should contribute more to the costs of local government, we see no alternative to the eventual introduction of a local income tax, either as a supplement to, or replacing, property taxation,' the authors state.

Present at the ceremony were Pak Song-chol, Politburo member  of the C.C. [Central Committee], the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] and vice-president; Kim Chung-nin, secretary of the WPK  Central Committee; and Kim Pok-sin, vice-premier of the  Administration Council.    Chu Song-il, chairman of the C.C., the General Federation of  Trade Unions of Korea, made a report there which was followed by  speeches.    The reporter and speakers recalled that President Kim  Il-song  opened up a broad vista for land development, indicating the  orientation, ways and tasks for reforestation and wisely led the  work to carry them into practice.    They also noted that Comrade Kim Chong-il instituted tree-  planting day and tree-planting months to convert afforestation  into a nationwide work and called for a brisk movement of  tree-planting on a mass scale. As a result, mountains and  fields of the country are covered with green forests and the  cities and countryside have changed their appearance, looking  more beautiful, they added.    They referred to the task to create in the next few years  200,000 hectares of forests of oil-bearing trees and 200,000  hectares of forests of trees for industrial use.    After the ceremony the participants and working people  planted hundreds of thousands of trees on Munsu and Chang hills  and in Nungna islet, the Taesongsan holiday resort, Kwangbok  street and other places to make the capital city of Pyongyang  more beautiful and covered with more luxuriant verdure.</p>

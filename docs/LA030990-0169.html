			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW CO-PASTOR IS HIRED FOR CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert H. Schuller has hired a Presbyterian minister from Seattle to  be co-pastor of the Crystal Cathedral.  </P> <P> Schuller will remain as head of the ministry, but in June he will turn over the  day-to-day operation to the Rev. Bruce Larson, pastor of Seattle's 3,600-member  University Presbyterian Church.  </P> <P> "I am strictly the No. 2 man (at the Crystal Cathedral)," Larson, 64, said in a  telephone interview. "I am there to assist Bob to help build and bless that  congregation."  </P> <P> Schuller, 63, will spend most of his time to running his television ministry  and will continue to conduct Sunday services for broadcast on his "Hour of  Power" television show, church officials said.  </P> <P> "There are two very separate tracks that meet at the Crystal Cathedral -- the  world track with the 'Hour of Power' show, and the local track," Larson said.  "The Orange County congregation will be my primary concern."  </P> <P> In the past, several ministers have served in similar co-pastoral roles,  Schuller assistant Chester Tolson said. Herman Ridder, who retired in 1988, was  the last co-pastor of the 35-year-old congregation in Garden Grove.  </P> <P> Church officials expressed the hope that Larson will be as popular in Orange  County as he is in Seattle.  </P> <P> The University Presbyterian Church membership has doubled since Larson became  pastor there in 1980. In addition, annual donations have increased to $5  million from $600,000 in 1980.  </P> <P> Larson's pastoral duties will include coordinating and developing small groups,  Tolson said, to allow the large congregation to feel more involved with the  church and sermons.  </P> <P> "The Crystal Cathedral is so large in numbers that if we create small groups,  like Larson has done in Seattle, the congregation will feel more comfortable,"  Tolson said.  </P> <P> Current membership at the Crystal Cathedral is estimated at 6,000, Tolson said.  </P></p>

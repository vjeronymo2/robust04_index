			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (14): A global view of finance - Consolidation in financial services / Information on financial market changes is Knight-Ridder's main commodity, but fluctuation was less welcome in-house, when it came to consolidating international accounts. A multi-dimensional spreadsheet was the answer For Allan Richardson, chief financial officer at Knight-Ridder Financial/Europe, based in London's Fleet Street, the problem of controlling five finance departments across the continent held few fears. He had already dealt with the same issues in previous posts in multinational organisations, and had clear ideas of what was needed. 'What you really want is something like a spreadsheet, which allows accountants to look at what they want, wherever it is held, and in whatever format suits them,' he says. Knight-Ridder Europe is part of the Dollars 2.3bn US-owned multinational, provider of financial information and services to the European commodities and financial services market. Its own product is information: news, reports, and analysis of foreign exchange fluctuations, and international commodities pricing. However, the mechanisms Knight-Ridder had in place to handle its own financial reporting were, in Richardson's view, too reliant on spreadsheets. These involved the writing of macros, (inbuilt programs written to suit specific needs), frequent re-keying of data, and unwieldy models which made global budgeting in particular very clumsy. Mr Richardson's main objection to spreadsheets as a tool for control is that the data is tied to the specific spreadsheet structure - 'if you change one, you change the other. What we want is to change the spreadsheet without affecting the underlying data,' he says. No spreadsheet assessed by Knight-Ridder, including Excel and Lotus 123, could get round this problem. Lotus Improv was a single-user, single-currency tool, not sophisticated enough for Knight-Ridder's purposes. Extracting data from the mainframe to a PC was too cumbersome, and didn't meet the demand for dynamic data. The data had to be live, and real, not a 'frozen copy' of centrally-held information. This requirement led to an evaluation of various executive information systems (EIS), including EPS, Comshare, Express and Essbase. The company decided that it needed a multi-user client-server system, which would provide easy access through a graphical user interface, and access (by name, such as 'sales') to any available data item. The eventual choice, based on its ability to handle changes efficiently, was Essbase, running on an HP3000 mainframe supporting a Novell network of 486 and 386 PCs. The entire installation, excluding an 'extra,' the currency conversion package, was around Pounds 40,000. Essbase, from Arbor software, is described variously as a a multi-dimensional analysis tool, a decision-support system, executive information system, and spreadsheet. Its attraction was that it could be addressed by end users through the familiar medium of their Lotus or Microsoft spreadsheets. 'What Essbase does is to download transactional data, from invoicing, general ledger or any other source and mix it with other data,' he says. 'It allows me to first define the structure, then define the report and cut and dice the data any way we wish to see it. Forecasting is a different job again, but with this, rather than creating a new set of figures, we can have actual, budget, and forecast: rather like playing 3D chess.' Multi-dimensional analysis provides a familiar spreadsheet 'look and feel,' to Knight-Ridder's 40 or so users across Europe, but is far more flexible than spreadsheet modelling. This flexibility allows Richardson to extract data to a level of detail that once would have demanded custom-built Cobol programs. He can examine the sales performance of a particular country, mapped against target, allocate direct costs, and tell which products are making what profit. All tailoring is being done in-house - 'you need one person who is PC-literate and who understands accounting,' says Mr Richardson. The main benefits have been timely information in a manageable format, using dynamic data - 'rather than spending time writing macros, and putting data in, it frees people's time to ask questions and look at what is actually happening,' he comments. 'Interpretation becomes the key: it makes the job more interesting. Arbor Essbase This product, the Essbase Multi-dimensional Analysis System, version 3, was launched in October 1993.

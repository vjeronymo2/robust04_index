			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: IT'S UP TO INDIVIDUALS TO FIGHT THE WAR ON POVERTY  </P> <P> The most recent debates on income distribution in the United States have  degenerated into a clash among statisticians and those who use those  statistics. Some experienced analysts conclude, from their inspection of the  data, that the distribution of income is becoming more unequal, and especially  that the upper income classes are gaining at the expense of people with lower  incomes.  </P> <P> Simultaneously, other professionals conclude that the degree of income equality  did not change significantly in the 1980s and that, when fringe benefits and  income-in-kind payments are properly taken into account, the poverty problem is  far less severe than it has been portrayed.  </P> <P> I take a "plague on both your houses" view. Whether the total tally of the poor  has been rising or falling, the hard fact is that there are a great many poor  people in the United States. The basic thrust of the debate should be shifted  to a far more useful set of questions: How do people fall into poverty? How can  they be helped to move out of poverty?  </P> <P> First of all, it is inaccurate for Americans to castigate themselves as a  heartless society. Over the past 25 years, federal spending for income support  to individuals multiplied over five times in constant dollars. Any way it is  measured, the per-capita outlay of public funds to fight poverty has been  expanding faster than inflation and real outlays also have grown faster than  the number of poor people.  </P> <P> The continuing problem is that, while these expensive efforts now represent a  far larger share of the nation's resources than was devoted when Franklin D.  Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson sat in the Oval Office, the large outlays have  not produced the promised results.  </P> <P> There is virtually universal agreement in the United States that those who are  physically or mentally unable to support themselves should be helped by  society. Such assistance should be provided in adequate amounts and with a  minimum of hassle. Over the years, however, a profound broadening has occurred  in the qualification for such aid. Low or no income has become the only basis  necessary to qualify for the receipt of welfare. The earlier terms, "handouts"  and "charity," have been transformed into "transfer payments" and  "entitlements."  </P> <P> Many long-term welfare recipients are beset by deep-rooted personal and social  problems not quickly cured by money. There is a powerful connection between the  health of the family as an institution and the depths of the poverty problem.  </P> <P> A few examples will help. Nine out of 10 families on welfare are headed by  women. Men living alone have twice the unemployment rates of family men. Nearly  three-fourths of the children on welfare are on the rolls because neither of  their parents is willing to support them. Frequently, the father has left the  home or never took responsibility for the child in the first place.  </P> <P> Without judging the moral basis of these alternative lifestyles, it is apparent  that much of the cost of such actions is not borne by the individuals making  those decisions, but by the children and by society as a whole.  </P> <P> Focusing on a positive approach, a distinguished panel of both liberal and  conservative analysts issued a report, "The New Consensus on Family and  Welfare." The panel stated, "An indispensable resource in the war against  poverty is a sense of personal responsibility." The panel also noted that  climbing out of poverty is something the individual must do, albeit with some  help from society.  </P> <P> More often than not, all it takes for a person to leave the ranks of the poor  is three things: 1) completing high school, 2) getting and staying married  (even if not on the first try), and 3) staying employed, even if at modest pay  such as the statutory minimum wage. The three factors are closely interrelated.  The high school diploma helps in getting a job. The wages received enable the  person to get married and to begin raising a family. The obligation to support  a family encourages the person to stick with the job or to quickly find  another.  </P> <P> An examination of the available data is useful in destroying some widely held  myths. Poverty is primarily a children's, not a senior citizens', problem.  Three and a half million of the elderly are poor, while 13 million children  are. About three-fourths of the elderly own their homes. The average family  headed by someone 65 to 74 years of age holds more than twice the dollar assets  than the typical family headed by a person 35 to 44 years old. The older the  head of the family, the wealthier the family is likely to be -- through age 74.  </P> <P> Also, very few men, black or white, who are heads of households are even near  poverty -- if they just have a high school education. In 1986, less than 5% of  black males and less than 10% of black females who met these simple  requirements were in poverty. Of adult black males who were high school  graduates in 1986, 86% had family incomes more than twice the poverty level.  </P> <P> When a woman on welfare takes on a full-time job, the odds are overwhelming  that she is lifting herself out of poverty. Few women working steadily earn  only the minimum wage. The median annual earnings of full-time female workers  without a high school diploma are higher than the minimum wage. Raising a child  is often cited as a reason for unmarried women staying on welfare. The fact is  that most mothers are now working, including a slight majority of those with  children under six.  </P> <P> There is much that government can and should do to reduce poverty. That  includes conducting a sensible macroeconomic policy that yields a growing  economy, which in turn generates a rising supply of jobs. Strengthening the  educational system -- perhaps by opening up more competition -- would surely  help. And continuing to provide large sums of money to alleviate distress will  be necessary for the foreseeable future.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the most important actions generating poverty are personal --  producing children out of wedlock, getting divorced, dropping out of school and  waiting for the dream job to come along before starting to work.  </P> <P> All in all, however, the message that arises from any detailed examination of  poverty in the United States is upbeat. The solution is within reach of most  people. Marriage and family prevent poverty. Schooling prevents poverty.  Working at almost any job prevents poverty. Individual actions -- rather than  more generous government expenditures -- are required to escape the poverty  trap.  </P></p>

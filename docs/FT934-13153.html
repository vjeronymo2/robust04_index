			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Bangkok takes stock of global rally in equities - William Barnes assesses the current situation Thailand's stock brokers are as bemused as anyone in Asia about the wave of foreign, notably US, money that has washed over the stock market since the end of September. The SET index climbed to a new all-time high this week of 1,160.95, before some mild profit-taking yesterday took it down 4.56 to 1,153.32. Mr Peter Schiefelbein, chief representative of Standard Chartered Securities, says: 'Liquidity-driven markets are difficult to predict, so trying to choose an upside limit for this rally is fruitless.' Mr Scott Klimo, head of research at Smith New Court Far East, adds: 'You have to look at this in the broader Asia context  - with US investment we may have to get used to these markets on different ratings than we have grown accustomed to. Does US investment, for example, add two or three points on to the price/earnings ratios for these markets?' The market still looks reasonably cheap on a regional basis with a p/e ratio of 18.3 times for 1993 earnings and 16.3 times for 1994 earnings, based on forecasts by Baring. This compares with Malaysia on 25.5 times 1993 earnings and Singapore on 26 times. But setting aside the banking sector changes the p/e ratios to 22 times for this year and 20 times for 1994. Mr David Robinson, managing director of Baring Research in Bangkok, says there is concern that the Thai market is now acquiring some speculative froth. 'If you do not believe that institutional flows (from the US, Europe and Japan) are going to continue, then you have got to be a bear; the recovery in the economy or in earnings does not justify current ratings,' he maintains. However, some brokers dismiss as 'myth' talk of foreign money driving the Thai market through the roof. One broking house managing director pointed out that the current upswing started long before the late-September/October injection of foreign money. Overnight money currently collecting 2 to 3 per cent makes the stock market's 4 per cent yield look attractive to locals. Baht interest rates appear hardly likely to stiffen in the near future given surplus liquidity of between Bt50bn to Bt70bn (Dollars 2bn to Dollars 2.8bn). No significant fundamental changes have taken place recently to steel the nerves of investors scared earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which rounded up some 30 alleged share manipulators, followed by the 'accidental' leaking of the names of 123 suspects. No sooner did a rather deflated market pop its collective head above the parapet than it was battered by dreadful first-quarter results: from a peak of 998 in January the SET index hit bottom this summer at around 820. Encouraged by relative pol-itical stability, lukewarm half-year results and the Bank of Thailand's confidence that its 7.5 per cent growth target for the year was achievable with low inflation, local investors took the market towards the 1,000 level in October when foreign funds leapt into the fray. As elsewhere in Asia the money wave injected new life into smaller stocks and special situations whose balance sheets would not have been entertained by fund managers a year ago. Although a correction, even an uncomfortable one, before the next advance would surprise none, several research-driven houses moot a level of 1,300 or 1,400 for the SET index before the end of the year. However, the head of one brokerage house in Bangkok says that his best negative indicator has already been triggered: 'I get worried when journalists phone up and start asking about the market, because then you are always near a high.'</p>

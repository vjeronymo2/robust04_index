			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THATCHER SEEKS U.N. ENVIRONMENTAL PACT  </P> <P> British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called today for the drafting of a  "good conduct guide for all nations" to protect the environment.  </P> <P> "I believe we should aim to have a convention on global climate change ready by  the time the World Conference on Environment and Development meets in 1992,"  she said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly. "That will be among the most  important conferences the United Nations has ever held."  </P> <P> In an address devoted entirely to environmental concerns, she said, "The most  pressing task which faces us at the international level is to negotiate a  framework convention on climate change -- a sort of good conduct guide for all  nations."  </P> <P> Thatcher also announced that Britain, which has some of the leading experts in  the field, will establish a Center for the Prediction of Climate Change "which  will lead the effort to improve our prophetic capacity."  </P> <P> The center, providing advanced computing facilities, would be open to experts  from all over the world, especially from developing countries.  </P> <P> Delivering her first U.N. speech since 1985, Thatcher cited the threats posed  by over-intensive cultivation, the destruction of forests, the laying bare of  mountainsides, the burning of fossil fuels that produce so-called greenhouse  gases and the pollution of rivers and seas.  </P> <P> Every year an area of forest equal to the whole surface of Britain is  destroyed, she told the Assembly.  </P> <P> It was no good squabbling over who was responsible or who should pay, she said.  Whole areas of the planet could be subject to drought and starvation if the  pattern of rains and monsoons were to change as a result of the destruction of  forests and the accumulation of greenhouse gases.  </P></p>

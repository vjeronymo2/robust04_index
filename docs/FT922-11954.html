			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Moscow threatens regional chiefs over privatisation THE RUSSIAN government will sack regional governors who fail to meet its targets for privatising state industry. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said in an interview yesterday he feared that Moscow would not be able to ensure the implementation of its programme - which sets percentages of specific sectors to be privatised by the end of this year - in the semi-autonomous republics within Russia. But he was confident such 'traditional bureaucratic methods' would work in most of the country. He said a recent auction of 21 shops in the town of Nizhny Novgorod, organised with the help of the World Bank and the support of enlightened local authorities, would 'show the way' to others. 'No bureaucrat wants to be the first, but nobody will want to be the last (in this process),' he said. He added that he would finalise by mid-May which sort of voucher system would be used to give Russia's inhabitants the right to acquire free of charge shares in shops and enterprises. He said the government had set itself an autumn deadline to give ordinary Russian citizens a stake in its ambitious privatisation programme. Mr Chubais said a deluge of private western offers to invest in privatised Russian enterprises - which followed the west's announcement of a Dollars 24bn aid package for Russian economic reforms  - made it imperative to set rules quickly for foreigners to take part in privatisation process. He suggested that no decision had yet been taken on plans for a special exchange rate for foreigners to buy assets so as not to squeeze out Russians thanks to the rouble's weak market value. But he reiterated his preference for organising special auctions reserved for foreigners, or special coefficients to make assets more expensive for foreigners multiplying the value of assets sold to foreigners.</p>

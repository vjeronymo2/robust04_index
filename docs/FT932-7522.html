			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Books: A stiff upper lip DEATH PLUS TEN YEARS by Roger Cooper HarperCollins Pounds 17.50, 330 pages ROGER Cooper has written a cool, elegant and in the end rather moving account of his five and a half years in that nightmare situation of today's expatriate, the Middle East hostage. When he was imprisoned by the Iranians in 1985 he was in great danger because, on the face of it, he was indeed qualified to be a 'British spy': he was an authority on Persia, had lived there for many years, was variously a journalist, consultant, teacher and businessman. Quite soon in his interrogation he was prepared to write a 'confession' in which he confected a colourful autobiography that relied on characters drawn from Evelyn Waugh's novels. He was eventually sentenced to death (for 'alleged fornication' 25 years before) and another ten years for spying. One of the few sympathetic Iranians in this book assured him that he would serve the two sentences in reverse order. There is a corpus of Hostage Literature. Cooper never attempts to match the remarkable poetic candour of Brian Keenan, and he does not have the best-selling story to compete with the boy-girl romance of John McCarthy. What he achieves is a fascinating demonstration of the stiff upper lip. His imperturbability - which is a high form of courage - is almost unbelievable. This is a narrative devoid of anguish, terror, even anger. 'I felt very sorry for myself'; 'Anyone who has been to an English public school and served in the ranks of the British army is perfectly at home in a Third World prison'; 'I felt quite wobbly'; 'the beatings were unpleasant enough, of course, but not seriously damaging': that is as far as he is prepared to go. It is a book full of jokes as well as blindfolds and deprivation and mock executions and, just once, a rejection of suicide. How can a man be so cool about five wasted years? The answer lies in the character. Roger Cooper (who had various connections, and friendships, on this newspaper) always had an insouciant quality which, I suspect, helped carry him through. He loves Iran and believed he knew best how to cope with its fundamentalist rulers. He is too modest to mention it but he is a Persian scholar of distinction; he might perhaps have been an academic but was sent down from Oxford, ridiculously, for going to join the Hungarian uprising in 1956. (It would have been good to have a fuller autobiography - the Cooper family is interesting, his uncle was Robert Graves, etc.) He describes how he used his later imprisonment to set out on a course of intense study. As for the spying, surely MI6 is not so crazy as to hire such an oddball eccentric - yet there is a curious sequence in the chronology when he makes notes for a 'confession' which he hides under his mattress and they are of course found. One guesses that the full story will never be told; FT readers who know the Middle East will appreciate that these things are never simple. Only at the end, after he is free, do we glimpse the horror which Cooper is so loath to admit: 'even in a curtained bedroom I slept with my airline eyeshade on as a kind of security blanket just as I had worn my blindfold in gaol to keep out the non-stop lights of my cell'. A brave man, and he is still not willing to admit just how much that means.</p>

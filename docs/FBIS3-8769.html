The command of the Sarajevo-Romania Corps of the Bosnian  Serb  army said in a statement that Moslem forces threw hand grenades  and fired rifle-launched grenades at Serb defense lines on the  Rajlovac front and that Moslem forces made provocations with  infantry weapons in the area of Vrbanja Most and at the Ilijas  front. Moslem snipers were not silent either and their targets  were the barracks in Rajlovac and in the suburb of Faletici.    Moslem units carried out civil engineering works in the area  of Mrkovic and the Jewish cemetary as well as along the lines of  separation with the Serb forces on the Ilidza front. The  Moslems are trying to advance their positions towards the Serb  forces before the very eyes of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces],  which has been acting as a buffer between the warring sides  following the withdrawal of heavy artillery from the Sarajevo  area, the statement said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Increased security measures have been taken at the  U.S. Embassy in Nicosia following information about a terrorist  act. Correspondent Petros Konstandinou has the following report:    [Begin Konstandinou recording] The U.S. Embassy in Nicosia  is a target for terrorists. According to CyBC [Cyprus  Broadcasting Corporation] information, messages from various  sources have been conveyed to the U.S. Embassy. According to  these messages, the pro-Iranian Hizballah organization could  attack. Following these messages, strict instructions were  given to the embassy's security personnel to take all the  necessary measures to avoid unpleasant situations. Instructions  for increased alertness have also been given to the policemen  who guard the embassy. A police spokesman who we contacted  refrained from commenting on the information. He only said that  increased security measures are always taken at the U.S.  Embassy. A U.S. Embassy spokesman, who we asked to confirm the  reports that terrorists might attack and measures were being  taken against that, answered: Today is a day like any other.  Other sources, though, confirmed that there is increased  alertness but the measures assumed, he added, are not obvious.  [end recording]</p>

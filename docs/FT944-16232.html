			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / People: Lord Chalfont to step down All change at the Radio Authority, which licenses and regulates Britain's fast-growing commercial radio industry. Lord Chalfont, 74, is handing over the chairmanship to Sir Peter Gibbings, 65, former chairman of both The Guardian Media group and Anglia Television. The news of Lord Chalfont's departure comes less than a fortnight after the authority's chief executive, Peter Baldwin, 67, announced that he planned to take early retirement. He will leave next June, six months earlier than planned. Sir Peter, who takes over the Pounds 46,590 a year part-time job on January 1, will inherit a vastly expanded commercial radio network. Over the next year or so commercial radio is expected to take a majority share of total UK listening from the BBC for the first time.</p>

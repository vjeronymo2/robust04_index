			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / EC's greencar-lover proposes sacrifice tosave cities MR Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, yesterday said he was ready to become car-less, and so should other city dwellers, to help prevent Europe's cities being choked by the internal combustion engine. Saying he was ready to set the example of abandoning his Alfa Romeo, Mr Ripa di Meana unveiled a study showing that it would cost between two and five times less to live and work in car-free cities because of the savings people could make in not having cars to buy, park, insure and maintain. Mr Ripa di Meana, an idealist who stayed away from this month's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro because of what he thought would be its failure to take sufficiently tough action on the planet's environment, insisted the report showed that car-free cities could be a practical proposition. Limited numbers of car users in city centres could be made to pay steeper fees for parking, and city authorities could be persuaded to invest more in public transport, escalators and moving walkways. Following the lead of Amsterdam, whose residents recently voted to restrict cars in their city centre, other European cities ranging from Naples in Italy to Bath in England had become interested, Mr Ripa di Meana said, in making the transition from what he called 'the car dream to the dream city - the car-less city'. The Commission plans to convene a meeting in September of interested city leaders to exchange ideas on ways of 'adapting the car to the city, instead of the city to the car', the commissioner said. Mr Ripa di Meana, who recently proposed levying a special Community eco-tax on carbon fuels, said he was far from hostile to cars, which would always have a use on longer, out-of-town journeys. But he was ready to make what for an Italian represents the ultimate sacrifice by giving up the use of his own car, 'a red Alfa Romeo with a three-way catalytic converter, which runs on unleaded petrol'. He has made sacrifices before. 'I used to own an XK120 Jaguar of the kind that won Le Mans in the 1950s. But it was very heavy on petrol, and now I only have a miniature of it on my desk.' Curbing his love affair with the car has not been easy, though. Three years ago he did the London to Brighton vintage car rally. 'It was freezing', said the Italian commissioner, 'but I loved it'.

			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO TRIM MILITARY BUDGET BY 8% NEXT YEAR  </P> <P> The Soviet Union said today it will slash military spending by more than 8%  next year and gave the most detailed breakdown to date of its armed forces.  </P> <P> Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov said at a news conference that the 8.2% cut, to $115  billion, is part of a program of shifting the Soviet armed forces from an  offensive to a more defensive role.  </P> <P> The number of men in the armed force as of Jan. 1 will be 3,993,000, he said,  without specifying what category of personnel the figure included.  </P> <P> "The new political thinking in defense doctrines allowed the military to reduce  the budget in practical terms," said Chervov.  </P></p>

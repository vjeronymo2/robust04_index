			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> WARHOL PROFILE DOESN'T PENETRATE ENIGMATIC ARTIST  </P> <P> He has been dead for more than two years and the tent has folded on his  retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, but the jury is still  out on Andy Warhol. Was he a genius or a fraud, a wise child or a cynical  street kid? Or was he a minor talent with an uncanny ability to sniff out the  Zeitgeist?  </P> <P> "Andy Warhol," premiering at 10 tonight on KCET Channel 28, doesn't render a  final judgment of the late Pop artist. Instead the 90-minute profile hears  testimony from members of the art and avant-garde film world who worked with  Warhol. Their memories, assessments and occasional criticisms mingle with  Warhol's art and films in an engaging biographical collage, hosted by Melvyn  Bragg of London Weekend Television's "South Bank Show" and directed by Kim  Evans.  </P> <P> Strains of "Over the Rainbow" and romantic shots of smokestacks -- a reference  to the fairy-tale quality of Warhol's life and his working-class background --  quickly give way to pounding rock music and brash Pop imagery, but the film  maintains an ironic distance.  </P> <P> At the end Warhol comments, "Death can really make you look like a star, but  then it could be all wrong because if your makeup isn't right when you're dead,  you won't look really right." As he applies makeup and turns into a  computer-generated image, we realize that we still don't know Andy Warhol; we  have merely learned some things about his life from his infinitely more  knowable friends.  </P> <P> Dealer Ivan Karp, for example, talks about Warhol's decision "not to drip" (in  the reigning style of Abstract Expressionism) and reveals himself as a salesman  with a taste for tough-looking art that turns out to be fun. Gerard Malanga,  Warhol's chief assistant from 1963 to 1970, proves himself a shrewd, if  self-interested, critic when he notes slippage in Warhol's art -- from  chillingly detached portraits of famous strangers to splashy commissions later  churned out by "a court painter." "It's an American disease to love famous  people," and Warhol had a severe case, according to film director Emile de  Antonio.  </P> <P> When called upon to explain himself, Warhol is a stony-faced shadow who says  "uh yes" and "uh no" to interviewers or begs them to give him answers as well  as questions.  </P> <P> "This thing about Andy can't keep going on because now it's really finished,"  says actress Brigid Berlin. She is wrong. In art world circles, Warhol is  generally considered the quintessential Pop artist, but his public reputation  is far less circumscribed. Fascination with Warhol won't go away because he  never revealed himself. Unlike stereotypical Americans who blurt out their life  stories and plead, "Do you like me?" Warhol kept his feelings under his wig.  </P></p>

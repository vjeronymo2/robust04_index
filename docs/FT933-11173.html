			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Company News: Argentaria improves 14.6% to Pta43bn after loans provision ARGENTARIA, the state-controlled Spanish banking group that was partially privatised earlier this year, lifted first-half net profits by 14.6 per cent to Pta43.1bn (Dollars 324m) after putting aside a Pta49.5bn provision for non-performing loans. The profit figure was due to high earnings in fee commissions which were up by 13.3 per cent to Pta24.2bn and, in particular, to sharply increased extraordinary income which was up 33.6 per cent and realised Pta40.1bn. Reflecting Argentaria's tightened management structure, nearly half of the extraordinary income was raised through loans recoveries. The banking group's provisions, which increased by 45.6 per cent against the first six months of last year, raised Argentaria's non-performing loan coverage to 91.4 per cent. Argentaria reported an improved return of assets, to 0.87 per cent from 0.81 per cent in the first half of last year. The group's return of equity was up to 15.31 per cent from 14.60 per cent. In early May, Argentaria placed just under 25 per cent of its shares on the market in an offering aimed at both the domestic retail market and foreign institutions. By the end of June, the offered share price of Pta3.800 had revalued by 24.3 per cent to Pta4.725.</p>

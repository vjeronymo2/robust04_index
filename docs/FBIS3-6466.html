A special topic for discussion, he said,  was the situation of various Asian countries, namely China,  Thailand, and Japan, in encountering the protectionist trade  measures imposed by the United States and European Union. Both  Thailand and China have agreed with the concept of an Asia for  Asia cooperation program.    Under this program, Asian nations will join hands in  developing the quality standards of their products, boosting the  standard of living of their peoples, and coordinating the  management of their natural resources in line with their  cultural values so that they will not be dominated by western  and U.S. influences.    Bunchu said: "Prime Minister Chuan Likphai will bring up  this  issue for discussion and consultation with Japanese officials  during his visit to Japan in April."    Asked if the Asia for Asia program is a form of free trade  cooperation, Bunchu replied that configuration has not been  discussed. Further consultation must be held with all countries  concerned to decide what can be done. Several countries will  participate in this plan, which will include cultural  cooperation.    Bunchu also said that he will visit China at the invitation  of the Chinese trade minister, and discuss with the Chinese side  trade and investment cooperation among the four nations  [Thailand, Laos, Burma, and China] under the Northern Quadrangle  economic development program.</p>

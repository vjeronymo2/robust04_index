			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTS ON VENTURA COUNTY SECTION  </P> <P> As a 10-year subscriber to the Los Angeles Times, I wish to commend you for the  expanded Ventura County Edition.  </P> <P> It's nice to be accepted as part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area!  </P> <P> Your format of breaking the county into geographic districts makes it easy to  locate purely Oxnard news. I'm looking forward to in-depth articles by your  reporters on affordable housing, landfills, air pollution, slow growth and  juvenile gangs.  </P> <P> ERNEST WHITAKER  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

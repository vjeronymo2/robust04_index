			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / AT&amp;T intends to compete with BT and Mercury in UK A MOVE BY America's largest telephone operator to challenge BT and Mercury on their home ground by offering international businesses their own private networks was yesterday welcomed by the British government. The Department of Trade and Industry, which favours opening up the UK's Pounds 15bn telephone market to foreign competition, said the application by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph would be considered on its merits. Moves to liberalise the European Community telephone service by 1998 were backed by Mr Karel Van Miert, EC Commissioner, in Brussels yesterday. Mr Van Miert's comments were the first clear indication that the Commission, the EC's executive body, is likely to endorse a policy paper calling for full deregulation of national telephone monopolies by 1998. The AT&amp;T application is direct retaliation for BT's application to the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a licence enabling it to sell international customers a broad range of voice, data and video services. The UK company said it welcomed AT&amp;T's application and the prospect of competition, but argued that its success should be dependent on the success of its own application to the FCC. Mercury Communications' response, however, reflected its difficulties in negotiating access to BT's UK network. The UK's other licensed carrier said it welcomed AT&amp;T's recognition that BT's dominance of the local distribution of telephone calls was the main bottleneck to the growth of effective competition in the UK. AT&amp;T's initial intention is to offer international business customers a range of services based on the resale of telephone lines purchased from BT or Mercury. It made clear, however, that the aim was eventually to compete comprehensively in the UK, selling services to both business and domestic customers and creating its own network. AT&amp;T said it was aware its plans needed the approval of both the UK and US governments. The DTI said yesterday that it welcomed the application as evidence that AT&amp;T believed there were equivalent opportunities for US companies in the UK as for UK telecommunications operators in the US. AT&amp;T said yesterday that it had been urging the FCC and the Clinton administration to withhold approval of BT's application until US carriers had comparable access to the British market. It said once equivalent access had been achieved, it would support BT's request. EC calls for full telecoms competition, Page 2 Customers could be winners in telecoms battle, Page 10</p>

Juergen Knorr,  member of Siemens Corporation's board of directors and director  of its Semiconductor Division, believes in a recovery of lost  ground by European microelectronics.    In the eighties the German semiconductor industry suffered  harsh losses in position vis-a-vis its American and Asian  competitors. The cause are the work hours per annum: today 1519  h in Germany while 1857 h in the U.S.A. and 2007 h in Japan. The  net labor costs are about the same in Germany and in Japan, in  the U.S.A. 20% lower, but the supplementary labor costs  are in  Japan 37% and in the U.S.A. only 33% of what they  are in  Germany.    Manufacturing wafers for the 1 Mbit DRAM (Dynamic  Random-Access Memory) in Germany thus costs 10% more than  it  does in the U.S.A. and 16% more than it does in Japan. In  the  nineties the European and especially German semiconductor  industry has invested a great deal into holding its ground under  such a pressure from abroad.    System engineering was expanded. Many innovations coming  from  Europe have found acceptance worldwide, among them the GSM  mobile radio system and DECT cordless telephone Standard for  which ASIC's (Amorphous-Silicon Integrated Circuits) had been  developed.    Semiconductor enterprises in Europe underwent slimming  cures.  Production was tightened and wage-intensive operations  transferred to Southeast Asia.    Collaborations were entered into so as to reduce the rising  cost of new technological developments. An example is the  agreement with IBM and Toshiba regarding the joint chip  development.    If the European policy were to create conditions equally  favorable for competitiveness, then an invigorated semiconductor  sector could be supporting other sectors of industry with its  innovations.</p>

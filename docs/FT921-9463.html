			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bryant advances 5% to Pounds 9.8m despite fall in house prices BRYANT, the housebuilder, yesterday reported a 5 per cent profits increase in a market dogged by the sluggish economy and a lack of consumer confidence ahead of the election. The West Midlands-based company is expecting confidence to remain depressed until after the election. 'The cost of buying is not a problem at the moment,' said Mr Andrew Mackenzie, managing director. 'There is a concern in the marketplace about the possibility of increased taxation.' Pre-tax profits in the six months to November 30 rose from Pounds 9.3m to Pounds 9.8m on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 163.5m. Earnings per share were 0.3p lower at 2.5p; the interim dividend is maintained at 1.4p. Mr Michael Chapman, finance director, said operating margins had only fallen from 9 per cent to 7 per cent despite the worst recession for years. Gearing fell from 5 per cent to 2 per cent on debt of Pounds 4m at the period-end. The group said it would continue to acquire land at the right price but would not raise gearing beyond 25 per cent by the year-end. Mr Chris Bryant, chairman, said that despite a further downward drift in selling prices, the group managed a 20 per cent increase in the number of completions during the period to 1,140 units. Bryant was placing greater emphasis on the three to four-bedroom house market which would raise the sale price per unit. COMMENT Bryant has successfully maintained sales volumes through aggressive pricing and with low gearing it is also well placed to be rebuild its landbank at favourable prices. But with the property and construction divisions unlikely to provide any excitement, strong recovery depends on the unpredictable housing market. It does not take a wildly unlikely scenario - slower than expected economic recovery and/or the return of a Labour government - before the dividend begins to look vulnerable. This year the dividend, if maintained at 4.8p, is barely covered by earnings of 5.3p on anticipated profits of Pounds 20m. At a multiple of about 19, Bryant is looking fully priced although it will be supported by its above average yield for the sector.</p>

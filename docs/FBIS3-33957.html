Following the attack, Basil was moved to a Syrian Hospital  in  a complete coma. He died on Friday morning after a two-day coma.    The sources emphasized that the killers succeeded in  escaping. A joint committee of the Syrian and Lebanese  intelligence services is investigating the incident.    The preliminary conclusions of the committee indicate that  foreign quarters are behind the sinful assassination.</p>

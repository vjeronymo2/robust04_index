			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Small savers are hit - SAYE available at building societies - have been abolished. National Savings is to withdraw its Yearly Plan from February 1 1995. WHAT IT MEANS: These two measures have squeezed out small, regular savers. The popular, government-operated SAYE scheme was available at building societies and the Abbey National bank. It was a monthly savings plan with a minimum of Pounds 1 and a maximum of Pounds 20. At the end of five years, the investor would receive tax-free interest equivalent to an annual 8.3 per cent. 'We are very disappointed,' says Abbey National, which has 250,000 SAYE accounts. 'It was one of the few accounts allowing the man in the street to take advantage of tax-free opportunities.' According to the government, SAYE was abolished to simplify tax-incentive savings schemes and because it had been superseded by tax-exempt special savings accounts. Unlike Tessas, however, the terms and conditions of SAYE were the same from every provider. Existing SAYE schemes are not affected. National Savings will be dropping its Yearly Plan in 1995. This was designed to help those who want to buy a National Savings certificate, Monthly payments of between Pounds 20 and Pounds 400 are made by standing order for 12 months to buy a four-year Yearly Plan certificate. The tax-free return after five years is 5.85 per cent a year compound. Customers with existing Yearly Plan agreements can complete their payments to get their next certificate.</p>

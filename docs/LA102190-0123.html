			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RANCHO SANTA FE  </P> <P> I am writing in response to the article "A Country Oasis Girds For Change"  (Oct. 14). In my opinion, there is no reason why some so-called place of luxury  should complain about how overcrowded their community is becoming, when most of  the people who live in this particular place don't even know what their  neighbors look like.  </P> <P> The houses are at least a quarter of a mile apart from each other. Give me a  break. How would these people feel if the house next door was within just a few  dozen yards of their own. This is how most people in our country live.  </P> <P> They are also complaining about their giant traffic problems. I have driven  through this place (Rancho Santa Fe) a countless number of times and I have yet  to see any sort of traffic jam. Try driving down Highway 101 in the middle of a  summer day, then you will see what traffic is all about.  </P> <P> EDDIE BECK, Solana Beach  </P></p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Tories accused on health trusts Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow health secretary, last night accused the government of packing hospital trusts with supporters of the Conservative party and privatising the National Health Service by stealth. She said 66 of the self-governing trusts were chaired either by a Tory or by someone connected with a company which had made donations to the Conservative party. The charges were strongly rebutted in the Commons by Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, who confirmed that the trusts could be examined by the new committee which was to scrutinise the standards of conduct of all holders of public office. Mrs Bottomley said that the outcome would be a recognition that the new management bodies established in the NHS were 'models to follow'. Mrs Beckett called for a central register of quangos and a register listing every NHS trust board member and their qualifications. The shadow health secretary, who branded Mrs Bottomley the 'Madame Mao' of the health service, said trust boards were overwhelmingly packed with 'representatives of Conservative interests'. One third of the places were held by directors of private companies, while others were filled by solicitors and accountants. Only 4 per cent to 6 per cent of those appointed had experience of the NHS. The government won a majority of 34 (297-263) to defeat a Labour motion endorsing 'public alarm' at the creeping privatisation of the NHS.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Property: Index hits record high The total return on the Investment Property Databank all-property index in October was 1.7 per cent, taking the index as a whole to 181.76, a record. (The previous peak of 179.70 was reached in January 1990, at the end of the 1980s boom.) The total return for the first 10 months of the year is now 9.2 per cent. Rental value growth was negative in October, but capital growth has been positive in each of the past five months, reaching 0.9 per cent last month. The all-property aggregate equivalent yield fell 0.1 percentage points to 9.5 per cent, its lowest level since February 1991. Office and industrial sectors were the performance leaders, each posting a total return of 1.7 per cent; retail reported a total return of 1.6 per cent. For the year to October, total return on retail property reached 10.4 per cent, with industrial property at 9.8 per cent and office property at 7.3 per cent. IPD says: 'Market circumstances are unprecedented. With the downward trend in rental values now stretching to within a month of three years and yields half a point below their peak, the index of total returns manages to reach a record high off its biggest monthly movement in five years: a boom and recession at the same time?'</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Bhutto in Punjab campaign MS BENAZIR BHUTTO, Pakistan's former prime minister, took her election campaign to the heart of the Punjab, the country's wealthiest province, over the weekend as the two front-runners intensified their efforts to make a comeback in the October 6 elections. Mr Nawaz Sharif, her main rival, was in Pakistan's poorest province, Baluchistan, but is expected to step up the campaign in the Punjab this week. The Punjab is home to at least 55 per cent of Pakistanis and therefore holds the key to electoral success. It would elect 115 of the 217 MPs to the national assembly, the lower house of parliament. The stakes are also high for elections to the 240-seat provincial assembly. In 1988, Mr Sharif was able to win enough seats in the province to become chief minister, while Ms Bhutto formed the central government. Although no proper opinion polls exist, most analysts believe Ms Bhutto is overtaking Mr Sharif in up to 80 of 140 key constituencies. Ms Bhutto gained on two fronts at the weekend. First, Mr Murtaza Bhutto, her exiled brother, withdrew his nominations from 14 of the 23 constituencies where he was contesting seats in the national assembly and the provincial assembly in Sindh. Second, the PPP announced an alliance with a faction of the Pakistan Moslem League, which broke away from Mr Sharif this year.</p>

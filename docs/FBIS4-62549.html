			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 May -- During the address to NATO leaders  and to the heads of the bloc countries' military departments,  which is planned in Brussels for 24 May, Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev will put forward the main tenets of  Russia's military doctrine and proposals for the Partnership for  Peace program. Grachev told this to journalists today after his  meeting with the leaders of the military departments of  Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Nagorno-Karabakh. "I am ready to  answer any question so that nobody has any doubts about anything  after this meeting," Pavel Grachev stated.    As far as the Partnership for Peace program is concerned,  Pavel Grachev and U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will hold  another telephone conversation on this at 1915 this evening.    The Russian minister said that he does not intend to submit  an alternative to the Partnership for Peace program in Brussels,  rather its Russian version. "We are nontheless still a  superpower," Pavel Grachev stated, "and it is not quite right to  put us on the same level as other states, we have to be reckoned  with. We should have our own view of partnership."</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / People: Taylor to head URA David Taylor, managing director of Amec Developments, has been chosen as the first chief executive of the Urban Regeneration Agency, the public body that will be set up this autumn to reclaim 150,000 acres of vacant land. Taylor, a 43-year old Scot, beat off competition from 177 other candidates to win the post. Lord Walker, chairman designate of the URA, said Taylor had been chosen because he had experience 'at the leading edge of regeneration activity and the personal qualities to match.' 'He is already well-respected in both the private and public sectors and will give the agency a head start in developing the partnership approach vital to its success,' he added. Taylor, who originally trained as an architect, has spent four years at Amec Developments, which is responsible for urban regeneration schemes in Merseyside, Newcastle and Salford Quays. Before joining Amec, he was managing director of Lancashire Enterprises, an agency set up by local authorities in the north west. Taylor has served on the Business in the Community task force responsible for preparing a report on raising finance for inner city areas. He has also been a member of the Prince of Wales' Urban Village Group and a director of the North West Business Leadership Team. Taylor, whose appointment was announced yesterday in a written parliamentary answer by John Gummer, environment secretary, said that his task over the next few months would be to decide on the agency's strategy with Lord Walker. He will work as a consultant to the Department of the Environment until the agency is formally established under the Leasehold Reform, Housing and Urban Development Bill which is now going through Parliament. The agency, which is sometimes described as a roving urban development corporation, will subsume the Derelict Land Grant and City Grant programmes which will account for Pounds 177m of funds from the Department of the Environment this year.</p>

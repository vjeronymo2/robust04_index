			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rank upset Nervousness ahead of today's annual meeting of the board with City analysts upset Rank Organisation shares, which tumbled 14 to 696p, although volume was weak. One leading securities house also took the opportunity to turn negative ahead of the meeting, believing that some poor overseas trading news was likely to be disclosed. This is likely to include continuing concern over the Japanese photocopier market. One dealer said that the shares' decline yesterday had been triggered because a line of stock was on offer at 700p a share and buyers were unwilling to commit themselves ahead of the meeting.</p>

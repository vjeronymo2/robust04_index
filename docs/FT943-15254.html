			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / International Press Review: No fire behind smoke - South Africa In a week in which the South Africa's press were unable to discover just what were the 'personal reasons' that lay behind finance minister Derek Keys' unexpected departure on Tuesday, there were several other fascinating but unanswered questions. How would President Nelson Mandela placate Mrs Marike de Klerk, the former president's wife, whose fury at being forced to move from Libertas, the official presidential residence in Pretoria, was disclosed by the Afrikaans daily, Beeld? Could Mr F W de Klerk's eviction have anything to do with the disappearance of Dinky, the family dog, whose plight was reported in the Pretoria News? And could the Springboks rugby team recover from their defeat against the All Blacks? the Sunday Tribune asked. However, for several days, a single question was uppermost for all papers: Why did Mr Keys resign? After much speculation, South Africa's press shared the conclusion of the Weekly Mail, the independent paper. 'Keys: no fire behind the smoke'. Shaun Johnson, deputy editor of The Star, the city's afternoon paper, put the best face on the affair: Keys 'did the most difficult of things, quitting while he was right on top . . . the retrospective portrait will be one of unflamboyant glory,' he wrote in his weekly column. He would be known as the man who laid down a solid economic foundation for a new government, 'his reputation unsullied by the worst excesses of bygone National party cabinets and untarnished by the inevitable failings of the African National Congress controlled one'. Keys established a psychological precedent, wrote Johnson, selling to the middle classes 'the concept of a tax surcharge' - a reference to the budget's 5 per cent levy on higher-bracket tax payers. No such generous treatment from The Citizen, whose editor Johnnie Johnstone has managed to pay generous tribute to President Mandela while maintaining a conservative stance. Easily the best paper of record, with a large black readership attracted - according to conventional wisdom - by the paper's comprehensive racing coverage, the Citizen's midweek editorial spared neither Keys nor government. 'It's not satisfactory, Mr Keys. You should have stayed on. But as you have resigned, you owe it to the country to say exactly why. 'As for the government, we think its handling of the matter putrid.' Johannesburg's Business Day, which had added to the confusion by confidently reporting that Mr Chris Liebenberg, the successor to Mr Keys, 'had already attended (cabinet) meetings as finance minister designate', expressed city sentiment. The resignation 'presents the government of national unity, still basking in the afterglow of its remarkable installation, with the most difficult test it has faced so far', said Wednesday's editorial. By the end of the week, however, interest had focused on another question: Who benefitted from insider trading in the hours before the Mr Keys' resignation became official? asked the Sunday Times. And one question was never raised. Why did the powerful Congress of South African of Trade Unions accuse Mr Keys of letting the side down and 'betraying Mandela's trust' by leaving early, instead of saying good riddance to Mr Keys? After all, he was the finance minister who advocated fiscal discipline, and refused to bend to union pleas to extend VAT zero rating to more foods Maybe in the answer to this question lay the secret of Mr Keys' success.</p>

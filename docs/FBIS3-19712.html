			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Mafia is just one of the themes of the electoral  campaign. The central puzzle remains that of what will happen  after the vote and the makeup of any possible government. This  problem has pushed the parties to lay siege to the center in  order to gain the moderate vote. Mario De Scalzi reports.    [De Scalzi] A few days away from polling day, the various  political groupings appear to have suddenly realized the  strategic importance of the center. It is from there -- if  nobody obtains the necessary votes in order to govern alone --  that any political alliance will have to be formed. However,  Mino Martinazzoli [secretary of the Italian Popular Party]  warned that the center ground is already occupied and that his  party is not prepared to give up this role.    [Begin Martinazzoli recording] If the center were to win, a  government would be formed 24 hours afterwards. [end recording]    [De Scalzi] Giorgio La Malfa [secretary of the Italian  Republican Party] pointed out that there are so many rifts and  contradictions within the left-wing and right-wing slates that  it is for this reason the center will be strengthened.    Whether this analysis is right or wrong, [National Alliance  Party leader] Gianfranco Fini today toned down his argument with  the Northern League. He said that it would be possible to  govern with Bossi if certain conditions were laid down.    [Begin Fini recording] We must be absolutely clear on the  concepts of unity and national identity, and there must be  absolute clarity on the necessity of the politics of solidarity  between the north and the south and solidarity between the weak  and the strong. [end recording]    [De Scalzi] This move toward the center leaves Umberto Bossi  completely indifferent. He said in a radio interview that he  would never back Silvio Berlusconi's candidacy for the post of  prime minister.</p>

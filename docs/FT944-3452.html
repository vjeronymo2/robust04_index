			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Eastern advances 27% to Pounds 98m Eastern Group said yesterday it was asking the regulator to lift limits on the amount of electricity it could generate as it revealed a 27 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 77.4m to Pounds 98.1m. Mr John Devaney, chief executive, said it had asked the regulator to lift a restriction that means it can buy only 15 per cent of its power from companies it owns or with which it is associated. Eastern has used up 83 per cent of the limit, more than any other regional electricity company. 'We are prepared to supply competition to the generators,' said Mr Devaney. 'Why should we be falsely capped?' Mr Devaney said his company had spoken to the electricity generators following their commitment to try to sell off up to 6 gigawatts of capacity. He said: 'No-one is getting much clarity from the generators.' Mr Eric Anstee, finance director, said that even with existing interests, the company expected to make about a quarter of its profits from generation within a few years. In the half year to September 30, Eastern increased turnover from Pounds 799m to Pounds 820.4m. Earnings per share were 28.4p (20.9p) and the interim dividend is 8.25p (6.6p). The company announced a Pounds 28m rebate for domestic and small business customer, making a total of Pounds 46m for the year. Cuts in staff helped the company to reduce operating costs in the distribution business by 7 per cent. Units distributed rose 2.4 per cent. Distribution operating profits were 16 per cent ahead at Pounds 82.4m (Pounds 71m) while supply showed a 38 per cent improvement to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 6.3m). Generation contributed profits of Pounds 2.2m, against losses of Pounds 600,000, and gas Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 200,000 loss). However, retailing made Pounds 1.9m, a sharp drop on the previous Pounds 3.1m. Analysts believe Eastern's commitment to retailing through its Powerhouse joint venture may be challenged unless the performance improves. Mr Anstee said gearing was likely to rise from about 18 per cent at September 30, when debt was Pounds 154m, to 20 per cent at the year end.</p>

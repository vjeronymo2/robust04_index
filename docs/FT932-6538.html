			<p>930527 FT  27 MAY 93 / Backing for Swedish budget Sweden's centre-right minority government yesterday finalised a deal with the opposition New Democracy party which ensures broad parliamentary support for the supplementary budget proposals which it announced last month, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. The government has agreed to scrap personal allowances for higher rate taxpayers and to reduce VAT on hotels and internal travel as part of the agreement. In return New Democracy has said it will vote for a plan to cut housing benefits by SKr3bn over three years. The reduction is part of a broad package of savings designed to reduce Sweden's SKr200bn budget deficit.</p>

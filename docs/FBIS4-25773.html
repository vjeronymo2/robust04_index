During the meeting, the Chinese vice minister also said:  What is important is to keep North Korea from withdrawing from  the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; the situation surrounding  the North Korean nuclear issue has now reached a breaking point.  If U.S.-North Korean high-level talks are resumed, it will be  possible to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. All nations  involved need to urge both the United States and North Korea to  resume high-level talks. In this way, he stressed the  importance of resuming U.S.-North Korean high-level talks.    According to the opposition Social Democratic Party of Japan  delegation, which is now visiting Pyongyang, North Korea has  voiced strong discontent with moves by the United States and  other nations to impose sanctions against it. It also has  insisted that efforts be made to look for a way to resume  U.S.-North Korean high-level talks since there is no longer a  channel for dialogue with the IAEA.</p>

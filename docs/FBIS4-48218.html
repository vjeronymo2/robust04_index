			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Constitutional Conference Commission  has completed its deliberations on the agenda for the  conference. A clean copy of the agenda will be ready this week  for submission to the government. The chairman of the publicity  committee of the commission, Dr. (Wota Ofonagoro), gave this  information yesterday in the Radio Nigeria Network phoning  program, Radio Link. He said all the views expressed in the  memoranda by interest groups and individuals had been taken care  of in the agenda. Answering a question, Dr. (Ofonagoro), said  memoranda were received from traditional rulers, articulating  what their role should be. He stated that the commission would  recommend that some of them should be nominated to present their  views at the conference.    Also answering a question, the chairman of the finance and  general purposes committee of the commission, Chief (Derbo  Akonde), said the military would be a subject on the agenda. He  said that the military would not be represented at the  conference to avoid creating the impression that they were there  to guide the delegates. Chief (Akonde), however, explained that  the commission, in its recommendation and the government in  accepting it, did not completely leave out the military. He  said it was possible that some retired military officers would  be elected into the conference.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Farmers' earnings increase by 60% Farmers' incomes rose by about Pounds 1.1bn last year, an increase of 60 per cent on the level of earnings in 1992, according to figures to be published by the government today. The rise in farm receipts was almost wholly due to the devaluation of sterling in September 1992, which increased the value of European Union agricultural payments for UK farmers. Overall output slipped by 2 per cent during the year. Farmers producing milk, arable crops, beef and sheep all benefited from sterling's devaluation. Cereal growers gained from higher subsidies paid as part of the EU's farm reforms. Pig farmers and vegetable growers did not share in the overall return of confidence to agriculture. Pig producers saw prices for pork slump because of European overproduction in the past two years. At the same time, their costs rose because of higher grain prices caused by the devaluation. Vegetable growers' margins come under pressure with receipts falling in real terms for the past three to four years. Demand for fresh vegetables has also dropped. With farm incomes up substantially and most costs remaining steady because of low inflation and low interest rates, many farmers are resuming investment in their business again. The National Farmers' Union estimates that investment increased 30 per cent last year. Farmers also reduced borrowings by 5 per cent. Mr David Naish, NFU president, said the increase in incomes came after years of falling earnings and poor investment.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.N. APPROVES MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAQ  </P> <P> In response to "Deadline Could Speed Up the Timetable" (editorial, Nov. 27):  </P> <P> The hope that the United Nation's resolution, allowing the use of force against  Iraq, will force Hussein to back down could be futile. Hussein is already boxed  into a no-win situation.  </P> <P> His only "honorable" way out now is for his enemies to attack, then go down in  defeat on the field of battle.  </P> <P> We still have another option, time. To allow time for the embargo to rot the  will and ability of the Iraqi military and people to sustain their position.  This is really a test of wills between the so-called free world and the  barbarian, Hussein. Hussein understands this. The question is, do we?  </P> <P> I think many in the military know that pulling "hard time" in the desert is  better than an "early out" in a body bag. It's too bad that those making our  decisions aren't faced with the same option.  </P> <P> DON LOVE, Palm Springs  </P></p>

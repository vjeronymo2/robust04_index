			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Finally, the commenter notes that the proposed rule provides no mechanism for appealing decisions by the Department not to accept costs after March 15, 1995. In developing the parameters for reallocating unexpended funds to States with unreimbursed SLIAG-related costs, we were concerned with ensuring that the reallocation of unexpended funds and the drawdown of the reallotted funds by States would be completed by the statutory deadline. In order to ensure that the reallocation takes place in a timely manner, we have established the date of March 15, 1995, as the final date on which SLIAG-related costs will be accepted by the Department prior to the reallocation of unexpended funds. We have not included in the final rule any mechanism for revisiting the Department's decision not to consider in its reallocation determinations any costs which have not been submitted to the Department by March 15, 1995. However, with respect to costs which a State has submitted by March 15, 1995, but which have not been accepted by the Department, &sect;402.25 of the regulation permits such a State to appeal to the Departmental Appeals Board an order requiring the State to repay amounts disallowed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Labor/Health and Human Services FY 1995 Appropriations Act, Public Law 103&hyph;333, amended 204(b)(4) of IRCA to provide that States use reallocated funds to reimburse SLIAG-related costs within 90 days of the award of the reallotted funds but no later than July 31, 1995. We have therefore revised &sect;402.11(q) to incorporate this provision. States are reimbursed for their SLIAG-related costs when they draw down funds from their allotments. This provision applies also to a State's reimbursing other governmental entities within the State for SLIAG-related costs they have incurred. These costs must have been submitted by the State in annual cost reports by December 29, 1994, and accepted by the Department by March 15, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=2 --> Section 402.26, Time Period for Obligation and Expenditure of Grant Funds <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This section of the rule stated that any obligations of grant funds by a State must be expended within the time limit set by 45 CFR 92.23(b). It also stated that this deadline could be extended by the Secretary at the request of a State. We proposed to revise this section by establishing the deadline for expending obligations as December 29, 1994, and by deleting the provision allowing a State to request an extension of this deadline. We noted in the preamble of the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that we were proposing this revision to ensure that we would be able to determine the amount of unexpended funds as of December 30, 1994, as mandated by the amendment to IRCA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> We received two comments on this section of the proposed rule. The first commenter suggested a revision to specify that only obligations from grant funds awarded under &sect;&sect;402.31 and 402.33 must be liquidated by December 29, 1994, and that grant funds awarded under &sect;402.34 be available for obligation and expenditure through June 30, 1995. The second commenter suggested that the section be revised to allow obligations incurred through September 30, 1994, to be expended through June 30, 1995, with funds awarded under &sect;402.34. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> With regard to the first comment, it was not our intent in our proposed wording of this provision to limit what States could do with funds received under &sect;402.34. The provision to which the commenter refers; i.e., that obligations be expended by December 29, 1994, was intended, as noted above, to provide a basis for determining the total amount of unexpended funds from grants awarded under &sect;&sect;402.31 and 402.33 as of December 30, 1994, as required by the amendment to IRCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the purpose of the reallocation of unexpended funds is to reimburse States for costs incurred prior to October 1, 1994, we do not believe that the time limit of 45 CFR 92.23(b) is applicable to the reallotted funds. In response to this comment and to clarify our intent in this provision, we are revising the wording of the first sentence of &sect;402.26(b) to specify that the time limit for liquidating obligations pertains only to funds awarded under &sect;402.31 and &sect;402.33. We are further revising &sect;402.26(b) to state explicitly that the time limit of 45 CFR 92.23(b) does not apply to funds awarded under &sect;402.34. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options tradin STOCK index futures main-tained a healthy premium over the underlying cash market yesterday, although turnover was down on recent levels, writes Joel Kibazo. A one-point fall in the June contract on the FT-SE to 2,648 shortly after the opening proved to be a temporary setback, before June began slowly to crawl forward thereafter in light trading. Dealers said the few selling orders on offer were quickly taken up. With Wall Street having little impact, June continued forward during the afternoon session and a surge just before the market close to 2,672 was recorded after a large order for 300 contracts was transacted. June eventually closed at 2,668, around 21 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover amounted to a poor 4,661 contracts. In the traded options market, turnover reached 28,265 - well down on recent levels. However, the FT-SE 100 option was busy, trading 13,605 lots. Volume in the Euro FT-SE option reached only 937 contracts. Among stock options, British Airways led the way with a day's total of 969 lots, with the July 280 calls the busiest series. This was followed by Marks and Spencer at 888 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Josef Riedmiller: "They Are Not Yet Being </F> Embraced"]    [Text] At the conclusion of the NATO summt conference in  Brussels there was no lack of lofty rhetoric on the Western side  since there was no room for major accomplishments. NATO  Secretary General Manfred Woerner described the Partnership for  Peace program, which was devised in Washington and is intended  to let the reform states that emerged from the rubble of the  former East Bloc lean on NATO but deny them direct access, as a  "historic turning point." In less pretentious words, Federal  Chancellor Helmut Kohl spoke of a "decisive step," which would  have to be followed by intensive contacts not only with those  countries that are seeking NATO membership but also with those  countries, such as Russia and Ukraine, that are not among the  group of candidates. That is balsam on the wounds of the  disappointed; one will talk to them, but one will not embrace  them -- not yet.    This is not contradictory to the fact that on his visit to  Prague and Moscow, Bill Clinton will go further than just  shaking people's hands and take one or the other Partner for  Peace into his arms; after all, it is mainly the U.S.  President's policy not to extend NATO toward the east at the  current stage and to prevent an "over-commitment" in Europe.  This position is not at all merely determined by the intention  not to provoke Russia, to strengthen its reform forces, and not  to provide their nationalist opponents with any new arguments;  behind it is also the understanding that East and Central Europe  has not yet settled down and that it still harbors a  considerable dangerous potential. This potential is not only  the result of the sometimes strong ups and downs of Moscow  politics but it is somehow locally rooted. Nothing shows that  more clearly than the competition between the Visegrad countries  (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic), as to which  of them is more worthy of NATO membership. These four primary  membership candidates neither follow a single course nor can it  be said that they have already settled all the problems between  them.    It is not only a "gray area of security," as Kohl put it,  but  also a gray area in a political respect. That is quite natural  and it is reflected in the differing intensity of the feeling of  insecurity, which is stronger in Poland than, for example, in  Hungary. This is why Polish President Lech Walesa stands in the  first rank of critics of NATO's cautious position; for him it is  a consequence of Russian blackmailing. However, his severe  verdict fails to take account of the fact that, apart from  Slovakia and Lithuania, Poland is the only would-be NATO member  with a government in which neo- or reform-communist forces play  a significant role. This would also have to be taken into  consideration if NATO were to begin defining membership criteria  for East and Central European members. Nevertheless, Walesa's  proposal to accept even Russia as a NATO member to control its  arsenal of nuclear arms does retain its humorous fascination.    In the light of NATO's stance in the conflict in Bosnia it  has turned out that the Western alliance is not at all able to  prevent all wars or to end them in time; it is, thus, all the  more surprising that the Visegrad states and even the Baltic  countries assume that NATO might have this very power. The  Clinton Administration has drawn different conclusions from the  experience of helplessness: since the transatlantic alliance  basically has no longer any enemies (not even Russia), security  has to be defined differently today. For Washington, a security  policy of a new kind must focus on the control of arms of mass  destruction and the prevention of new conflict situations and in  the creation of stability. It is more of a development program  than a strategy of military containment. And there are no plans  for security guarantees, as requested by the East and Central  Europeans as a substitute for direct NATO membership. To cover  the "gray zone" with security guarantees should deter all those  who are now requesting them: Poland had such guarantees in 1939,  but they became effective only six years later, six years too  late.</p>

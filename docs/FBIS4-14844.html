			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 4 TASS -- The Georgian-Abkhazian  agreements signed in Moscow on Monday are regarded by diplomats  as the initial real attempt to begin political settement of the  long-drawn regional conflict. The agreements open an  opportunity for the stationing of U.N. peacekeeping forces in  the region. Still, an appropriate decision of the U.N. Security  Council is required for this, experts believe.    The problem of refugees return will be resolved in stages,  ITAR-TASS learned. At initial stages, refugees will return to  places of their permanent residence in Galiy District.  According to diplomatic circles close to the Georgian  delegation, the question of refugees return to Sukhumi and Gagry  is not yet raised. This problem is to be solved at future  negotiations.    The agreements do not apply to refugees who participated in  hostilities against the Abkhazian side. This provision has been  included in the document on Abkhazia's insistence, but in a  milder form then intially planned, according to the same sources.    Another important point of agreements invisages  consultations  in Geneva between the Georgian and Abkhazian delegations on a  permanent basis.</p>

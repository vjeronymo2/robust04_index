			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DIPLOMAT HOWELL COMES HOME A HERO;  </P> <P> HOSTAGES: HE SAYS THAT 'WE COULD DO NOTHING ELSE' BUT HOLD OUT IN THE BESIEGED  KUWAIT EMBASSY UNTIL ALL AMERICANS WERE FREE.  </P> <P> Calling them "victorious" and heroic, Secretary of State James A. Baker III  welcomed back U.S. diplomats from Kuwait city and the last group of American  and Canadian hostages from Kuwait and Iraq on Friday at Andrews Air Force Base.  </P> <P> Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell III, who along with a skeleton staff had  withstood threats and deprivation to keep open the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,  declared that "we could do nothing else" but hold firm in the besieged compound  until the last Americans were freed.  </P> <P> "Yesterday morning, I locked the door on the embassy and left the garrison flag  flying," Howell told the crowd of well-wishers at Andrews Air Force Base. "The  embassy will reopen in a free Kuwait."  </P> <P> He called President Bush's policy in the Persian Gulf "moral and honorable and  right."  </P> <P> "Make no mistake," Howell said, "the only industry in Kuwait today is war and  military occupation."  </P> <P> "I left Iraqis building bunkers around the seacoast and around our embassy. I  saw no indication that they plan to leave," said the ambassador, 50, who warded  off the clear December chill with a tan raincoat.  </P> <P> The 48 passengers cheered and waved as they walked off the C-5 military  transport plane onto a red carpet shortly after 4 p.m. and into the warm  embraces of about 400 family members.  </P> <P> Roses, green and silver balloons and, in one case, a full-length fur coat  greeted the passengers -- 23 Americans, 10 spouses and children of Americans,  and 15 Canadians. After 132 days in detention -- either in the embassy or in  hiding -- the former hostages left Baghdad on Thursday and spent the night in  Frankfurt, Germany.  </P> <P> Calling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein a "vicious and capricious dictator" and  an international outlaw, Baker told the delegation: "Your ordeal is over, but  the ordeal of the Kuwaiti people continues."  </P> <P> Baker told the former hostages that Hussein "deserves no thanks, no reward" for  releasing the foreign nationals, some of whom were detained as "human shields"  at military and industrial sites to deter a possible attack from U.S.-led  forces against Iraq.  </P> <P> Howell, with a spirited step, was the first to walk off the plane. He stood  beside his wife with his hands behind his back as he listened to Baker's  welcoming speech.  </P> <P> Howell kept the embassy open in defiance of an Iraqi order that all foreign  embassies in Kuwait close by Aug. 24. He said it was more than just an American  effort that allowed about 20 Americans, who fled Iraqi troops during the Aug. 2  invasion, and his embassy staff to survive. He mentioned Europeans and  Canadians but did not detail their actions.  </P> <P> The embassy staff, trapped inside the U.S. compound without electricity and tap  water for almost four months, reportedly survived on canned tuna and boiled  water from the compound's swimming pool.  </P> <P> Howell said he and his staff were proud to have stayed and overseen more than a  dozen flights of American citizens from Iraq and Kuwait. Earlier this week,  State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said 2,520 Americans had been  evacuated in 13 flights since Aug. 2; 200 more Americans escaped from Iraq and  600 from Kuwait.  </P> <P> No more flights are planned, since all Americans who want to leave have been  given the chance and commercial flights have resumed to Amman, Jordan. The  State Department estimates that about 500 U.S. citizens remain in Kuwait and  Iraq by their own choice. That figure includes 294 children, 100 women and 115  men with dual citizenship.  </P> <P> Howell concluded by addressing Baker and saying: "As you pointed out, our  ordeal is over, but the ordeal of the Kuwaitis and the problems created by the  war begun in August, which we all would prefer to be solved peacefully, still  persist in Kuwait. The people of Kuwait must be free."  </P></p>

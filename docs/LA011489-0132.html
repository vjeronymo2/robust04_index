			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH LEADERS ANNOUNCE ANTI-APARTHEID CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> The leaders of seven denominations have announced a joint campaign to mobilize  their national memberships in support a variety of anti-apartheid measures,  including comprehensive U.S. sanctions against South Africa.  </P> <P> The initiative was devised at a summit of leaders of black church groups here  Tuesday and Wednesday. The denominations represented at the meeting -- the  African Methodist Episcopal Church, AME Zion Church, Christian Methodist  Episcopal Church, Church of God in Christ, National Baptist Convention of  America, National Baptist Convention U.S.A. and the Progressive National  Baptist Convention -- have a combined membership of 19 million.  </P> <P> "The intensifying brutality of the Pretoria regime -- death and detention of  children, attacks against the churches and church leaders -- and the war  against South Africa's neighbors compel us to speak out as one united voice for  an end to the pain being inflicted upon our sisters and brothers," the leaders  said in a closing statement.  </P> <P> The effort announced here originated in a September, 1987, challenge by the  Rev. Alan Boesak, a leading South African anti-apartheid activist. In a speech  to black church leaders in Atlanta, Boesak, a minister in the Dutch Reformed  Church and president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, called on them  to "exert every effort possible to bring an end to the long night of suffering  by the people of South Africa."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overseas Visit  </P> <P> In September, a delegation of church leaders traveled to southern Africa to  meet with South African church leaders and officials of other anti-apartheid  groups, including the African National Congress. The discussions were carried  on in neighboring countries because delegation members had been denied visas to  enter South Africa.  </P> <P> The leaders vowed at the meeting to engage their memberships in actions that  would support:  </P> <P> * Stronger U.S. economic sanctions against South Africa. In particular, they  pledged support for a bill by Rep. Ronald V. Dellums (D-Berkeley) and Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-California) that would impose further sanctions on South Africa.  </P> <P> * U.S. economic aid for the black-ruled states that border South Africa. The  church leaders said South Africa has punished these nations economically and  militarily for their opposition to apartheid.  </P> <P> * An end to U.S. backing for the South Africa-supported rebels trying to  overthrow the government of Angola, which has had the aid of Cuban troops. The  group also said it would seek a meeting with President-elect George Bush, who  has assured Angolan rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of continued U.S. support.  </P> <P> * The international boycott of Shell Oil Co., which has clashed with  anti-apartheid activists and churches over its activities in South Africa.  </P> <P> Boesak said at the meeting that U.S. sanctions against South Africa have been  effective and that they played a role in South Africa's recent decision to  settle conflicts in Namibia and Angola. As part of the U.S.-brokered  settlement, South Africa agreed to withdraw its forces from Namibia and to end  its aid to Savimbi's anticommunist rebels; Angola agreed to an evacuation of  Cuban troops. Boesak also said the sanctions have helped cool South Africa's  economy, which has made it harder for the country to maintain its military  campaigns.  </P> <P> The U.S. Congress imposed limited sanctions on South Africa in 1986. Last year,  the House of Representatives approved a bill imposing further sanctions, but no  such measure was considered in the Senate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Consensus on ANC  </P> <P> Bishop Ruben Speaks of the AME Zion Church said the church leaders reached no  consensus on whether to back the African National Congress. The ANC, which has  been banned in South Africa, has been accused of terrorism in its struggle  against the South African government.  </P> <P> There were statements indicating sympathy with the ANC, however. "We do not  agree with others who have called them terrorists and communists," said the  Rev. Mac Charles Jones of the National Baptist Convention of America.  </P></p>

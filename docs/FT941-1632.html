			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Sunset in the east for Jardine Matheson's stock: Simon Holberton reports on group's delisting Jardine Matheson, the British trading company, is to cease trading its shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange at the end of this year. Mr Henry Keswick, chairman, said yesterday Jardine had been unable to persuade the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Hong Kong's corporate watchdog, to relinquish its regulatory oversight of the company in favour of arrangements which Jardine had entered into with the authorities in Bermuda, its place of incorporation. The Bermudan authorities have brought the group under a statutory version of the London Takeover Code. The SFC did not believe the Bermudan authorities had the experience to regulate a Hong Kong-listed company. Jardine's announcement brings to an end a 10-year process of disengagement from Hong Kong's regulatory regime. In 1984 it moved its domicile to Bermuda; in 1991 it moved its primary stock exchange listing to London. Jardine's shares have been traded in Hong Kong since 1961. Its decision to delist seems a sad move for a company which can trace its antecedents back to the 1830s in Canton. It was on the encouragement of Mr William Jardine, one of the company's co-founders, that Lord Palmerston agreed to the occupation of Chinese territory to promote Anglo-Chinese trade. This led to the seizure of Hong Kong in 1841. But the company has had a chequered relationship with China. It made its fortune trading opium and built China's first railway. Jardine executives ran the Shanghai municipal council until the revolution; Sir John Keswick, friend of Chinese premier Zhou Enlai, signed over Jardine's assets to the communists. The decision to quit the Hong Kong stock exchange was visceral rather than logical. Sir Charles Powell, a Jardine director argued it was a technical measure to complete a process of bringing the company under UK law, begging the question of why it was necessary to do so in the first place. Jardine's top managers - the brothers Henry and Simon Keswick - lack faith in the ability of the SFC and stock exchange to administer a level playing field in the colony after China resumes sovereignty in 1997. Jardine, which employed 250,000 people in China in 1949 when the Communist Party assumed power, fears the possibility of asset appropriation through arbitrary decision making by regulators. In any case, its corporate roots are increasingly in the UK: through Hongkong Land, Jardine moved last year to control Trafalgar House, the construction and engineering group, and through Dairy Farm International it controls KwikSave, the food retailer. Under the arrangements which Jardine has fashioned for itself, the final judicial arbiter in any legal dispute will be the Privy Council in London; in Hong Kong post-1997, the final arbiter would be the standing committee of the Chinese National People's Congress. Jardine's decision put the SFC in an impossible position. The SFC would have been endorsing Jardine's view of post-1997 Hong Kong had it agreed to let the Bermudan authorities regulate the company while it remained listed in Hong Kong. The company's fears appear to be limited to itself as yesterday stock prices in Hong Kong rose strongly. A lot of market activity was centred on investors chasing stocks which might be candidates for the Hang Seng Index slots which Jardine will relinquish. Mr Charles Lee, chairman of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, pointed out that Jardine Matheson accounted for only 1.66 per cent of the stock market's capitalisation. The stock exchange saw its future with China. Jardine's position on the mainland must be under question. It has one of the largest business presences in China: 60 joint ventures and other businesses with turnover of about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) a year. This is despite selling HKDollars 7.4bn (Pounds 643m) of assets in Hong Kong since 1989, according to Peregrine, a local brokerage. Mr Nigel Rich, Jardine taipan, did not expect delisting to have a significant impact on the company's business in China. It is possible that Jardine may be able to go about its business more quietly, without its share price functioning as a barometer of Anglo-Chinese relations. The company's recent prospective 1994 price/earnings multiple of 10.5 compared with about 17 for Inchcape, the UK-listed trading group. As Peregrine said: 'There is a possibility of an upward re-rating of Jardine Matheson if its principal audience were London and not Hong Kong.' Results, Page 30; Observer, Page 21</p>

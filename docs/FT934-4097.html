			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Lilley in retreat over targeting of benefits Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, yesterday retreated from earlier hints that middle-class entitlement to universal child benefit and the basic state pension could be withdrawn. He said his opposition to opting out of the basic pension was 'a pledge for me forever'. His comments followed a warning to rightwing ministers from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, that speculation about benefit entitlements could undermine public acceptance of his tough Budget. Labour moved quickly to exploit the divisions in the government. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said: 'This is a major reverse by Mr Lilley, and it suggests that his wings have been well and truly clipped.' Mr Lilley said on ITV's Walden programme that both universal child benefit and the universal basic pension would remain unchanged during the present parliament. His assurances contrasted sharply with earlier suggestions that universal child benefit should be replaced by a targeted benefit, and that opting out of the basic pension should be encouraged. They coincided with suggestions that Labour's Social Justice Commission might be preparing to recommend much greater targeting of benefits when it reports next year to Mr John Smith, the party leader. But officials said reports that the commission had decided to call for the abolition of universal child benefit were 'premature speculation'. The commission reported yesterday in one of a series of preliminary papers that Britain is increasingly divided between 'work-rich' and 'work-poor' families. The paper, Work and Welfare, says there are more dual-earner couples alongside more no-earner couples, and the inflexible benefit system is partly to blame. The authors, Mr Paul Gregg, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and Edward Balls, of the Financial Times, say dependence on benefits among people of working age has grown from less than 3m in 1977 to 5.5m by 1991.

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Ideas appeal Thinking caps on, please, on behalf of Ukraine. As if creating an independent country for the first time in three centuries and dealing with the wreckage left by 70 years of communism were not enough, the young nation is still struggling to cope with the effect of history's worst nuclear accident. In its desperation, the government has turned to a novel approach. It has announced an international public competition for ways to prevent the unreliable cement sarcaphagus which covers the melted-down Chernobyl reactor, from cracking and releasing another deadly cloud of radiation. Any reader who can work out a solution is invited to submit it to the Ministry for Chernobyl, No 1 Lesia Ukrainka Square, Kiev, Ukraine. Alas, in its haste to inform the world of the competition, the government has so far neglected to specify the prize.</p>

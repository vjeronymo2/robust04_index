			<p>BFN     [Text] The Greek Foreign Ministry described a Macedonian  News Agency [based in Thessaloniki] dispatch from Washington  that says the ministry promotes the idea of a more loose  interception of Turkish planes that violate Greek airspace and  that at a certain time missiles will be taken off our planes as  totally untrue.    The Foreign Ministry also noted: As it has been very clearly  stressed in the government's policy statement and as Foreign  Minister Karolos Papoulias has repeatedly stressed, Greece's  firm and unmoved position is the defense of our national  sovereignty and the complete exercise of the right of defense  with all necessary means.</p>

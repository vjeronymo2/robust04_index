It is considered symbolic that for Russia the year  1994 is beginning with the U.S. President's Moscow visit and the  Russian foreign minister's visit to Beijing. According to a  high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry official, these visits  confirm that Russia's foreign policy is balanced and looks  equally to the West and the East.    The visit is being held according to agreements on regular  contacts and high-level consultations on issues of interest  between the two countries. These agreements were reached during  the Russian president's visit to China in 1992.    During the forthcoming talks in China, the two sides plan to  discuss issues of preparation for the second Russian-Chinese  summit. The negotiators will consider a wide range of issues of  bilateral relations and regional and international problems of  their common interest. It is obvious that Russian-Chinese  relations have an influence on stability and security in Asia  and all over the world, Mikhail Beliy, head of the First Asian  Department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, told ITAR-TASS on  Monday.    Positions of the two countries coincide on many  international  and regional issues, but naturally there are differences as  well. The countries are working to settle them.    The Russian delegation will visit the province of Guangdong  and familiarise itself with the special economic zone in  Shezheng. The idea of creating such zones has provided a great  stimulus to the development of China's economy. This idea has  not yet been studied thoroughly in Russia, but is now being  actively considered in the country.    Possibilities of and prospects for the development of  economic and trade cooperation are to be discussed in Beijing.  The volume of bilateral trade (38 per cent of which was  accounted for by machinery exports to China) amounted to 7.2  billion dollars in 1993, a record for bilateral trade. The  trade balance, 2 billion dollars, is in favour of Russia, though  it has a clearing debt to China. It is worth mentioning that  China is second only to Germany among Russian trade partners.    Progress has also been made in military and technical  cooperation. Moscow exported SU-27 military aircraft and S-300  missile systems to Beijing.    The countries are conducting border negotiations. A treaty  on settlement in the eastern section of the border was signed in  May, 1991. A joint delegation from the two countries is still  working on the western section.    "There are unsettled border problems, but there is no  animosity, no danger of explosive situations", the Russian  Foreign Ministry official believes.    During Andrey Kozyrev's visit, the sides are to sign a  treaty  on check points on the Russian-Chinese border and a protocol of  consultations between the two countries' foreign ministries.  There are 21 such check points (19 of which are operating) and  the treaty is to fix the rules for their work and envisage new  ones to cope with the increased traffic between Russia and  China. 2.5 million people crossed the border last year.    Comprehensive development of Russian-Chinese relations and  cooperation is in the interests of the two countries. It is  mutually advantageous and promising, Beliy said.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: London International After London International's earlier indiscretions, its annual results yesterday held little surprise, except possibly that the photo-processing business has done even worse in the second half than most expected. Nor, having been rebuked by the stock exchange, is the company giving much away about the extent of likely recovery this year. The absence of restructuring charges should stem the outflow of cash, but LIG will need more than that to reduce its 105 per cent gearing. That may eventually require the sale of the photo business which has proved too vulnerable to the cycle for a company of this size. Without that division, the company would be left with health-care business generating a high-return but offering limited growth prospects given the modest expansion of the world condom market, LIG's wide margins and its high market share in many countries. How that question will be addressed is a matter for the longer term. For now, much depends on photo-processing which is a matter of the weather as much as the economy. Judging by the way some are inclined to interpret the new insider trading legislation, the stock exchange might have to pay close attention to who is receiving long-range weather forecasts from Mr Michael Fish. It would help prevent another communications upset, though, if LIG were to issue a timely statement about the summer photo business at the latest by its annual meeting in September.</p>

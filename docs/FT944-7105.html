			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Weekend Money: Executive gluttony under attack - Fury over British Gas pay rises is fuelling demands for change Part of the price British Gas directors are paying for their spectacular pay increases is the scrapping of 'automatic' share option grants. But the context for this apparent sacrifice is a growing consensus that the options gravy train is in danger of hitting the buffers. Executives aboard this financial express have had a very satisfactory ride, but shareholders and the public have felt increasingly that they were being taken for a ride. It is a truth universally acknowledged, that the raison d'etre of share incentives is to motivate executives, so boosting corporate performance. Shareholders may see their slice of the cake reduced because extra shares are issued to managers - but they will be better off if they are compensated for that reduction by the cake-expanding skills of those same managers. Critics of conventional share options question whether the behaviour of a company's share price is the best indicator of the performance of its senior executives. Overall stock market conditions will exert a strong influence on most companies' prices. The boss of a company which excels in a bear market could still be left with worthless options; by contrast, those whose companies perform indifferently during a bull phase will, usually, be rewarded. The anomaly can be even more glaring where a whole sector has outperformed. Which of the electricity overlords would have the chutzpah to claim the credit for the more-than-threefold increase in all the Regional Electricity Companies' (recs) share prices since privatisation? Yet, those increases have been the sole basis for those executives' vast options gains. One solution is to prevent options from being exercised unless, during the option period, the share price meets a relative performance target. This could be beating the FT-SE index or coming in the top half or quartile in the company's own sector. The option-holder's actual gain would still reflect the absolute price movement, but receiving that gain would depend on whether the relative hurdle had been cleared. To extend this argument: if the objective is to reward executives who do well for their shareholders, then options should be linked to total shareholder return. This would encompass not just share price growth but also the value of dividends received during the option period. It seems that this concept of overall return is to be the linchpin of the new British Gas executive share option scheme. The peer group against which performance is to be measured will be the companies making up the FT-SE 100 index. There is, however, a widespread feeling that the inadequacy of share prices as a yardstick of performance cannot be cured simply by tagging on a relative target. Instead, it is argued, the benchmark of success should be management's ability to enhance earnings per share. Options should be realisable only if EPS growth beats a target. This can be by reference to the average EPS increase of other companies - constituents of an index or companies in the same sector - or linked to an external variable such as the retail prices index. Each of these alternative approaches has its strengths and weaknesses, and each can produce arbitrary results. Let us revert for a moment to the electricity companies. All had embarrassingly large cash mountains which they have been shrinking either by paying extraordinary dividends to shareholders or buying back their own shares. No doubt a good corporate case can be made out for either alternative. Yet, a super-dividend will work immediate wonders for overall shareholder return but do nothing at all for EPS, while a buy-back will have precisely the opposite effect. The British Gas share option scheme has no performance conditions. Indeed, one of the justifications being suggested for the huge increases in basic salaries is that the executives are sacrificing 'automatic' option gains for a much riskier performance-related alternative. Yet, Gas is hardly alone in making this switch. Hundreds of quoted companies have revamped their incentives by introducing performance criteria in recent years. Is this the result of board members developing guilty consciences after raking in easy winnings for so long? A more plausible explanation is that companies have been responding to a statement in July 1993 by the Association of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. This called for all executive options to be subject to targets requiring 'sustained and significant improvement in underlying financial performance'. Since insurance companies and pension funds are by far the most influential blocs of shareholders in quoted companies, few have stood out against this institutional diktat. And since the main motivation has been to appease the institutions, the specific targets selected have, predictably, tended to follow the wishes of the ABI, the more assertive of the powerful twins. So, most companies have plumped for a target of EPS growth beating the average rate for comparable companies, or exceeding RPI increases by at least 2 per cent a year. In spite of these improvements, some still see the concept of share options as fundamentally flawed. Special criticism is directed at the high gearing effect which magnifies and distorts the impact of share price movement. This has prompted several major plcs - although not, apparently, British Gas - to replace their option schemes with long-term incentive plans which deliver free shares to executives provided they stay put for a set period (usually five years) and their company meets pre-determined performance targets (usually similar to those now being set for option schemes). Meanwhile, the Labour party has put Revenue-approved options high on its tax-avoidance hit list and has vowed to treat option gains as income rather than capital. All in all, it does seem clear that top directors probably should hedge their bets by buying some lottery tickets. David Cohen is a partner in the City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co.</p>

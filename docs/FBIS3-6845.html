[prefecture], March 20  KYODO -- Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Sunday  [20 March] told the graduating class of the National Defense  Academy that Japan should reconsider its defense policies in the  post-cold war world.    "Considering the changes in the international situation  since  the end of the cold war and the remarkable progress in science  and technology, it is important, with regard to the way the  defensive strength of our nation should be, that the government  indicate a new fundamental thinking," Takemura said.    Takemura spoke on behalf of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa,  who has been in China for a three-day official visit since  Saturday.    Defense Agency [DA] chief Kazuo Aichi also said Japan must  have a more divergent way of thinking than in the past on the  defense of the nation in the post-cold war era.    "The role of the Self-Defense Forces which positively  contributes to the peace and stability of the world through the  United Nations will continue to grow larger," said Aichi,  indicating a future increase in Japan's participation in U.N.  peacekeeping operations.</p>

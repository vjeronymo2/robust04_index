			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> BENSON WOOED TO STAY IN DIXIE  </P> <P> Actor Robby Benson, whose six-figure earnings at the University of South  Carolina stirred controversy, is being wooed to remain in the Palmetto State.  </P> <P> The State Development Board and Columbia College are working on a package deal  to keep the actor and filmmaker in the state.  </P> <P> The board that works to attract business and industry into the state,  unanimously approved contract negotiations with Benson on Wednesday.  </P> <P> But Isabel M. Hill, head of the Development Board's film office, said talks  with Benson have not moved past "very cursory initial contact."  </P> <P> Officials asked Benson and his wife, singer-actress Karla DeVito, to consider  staying in South Carolina, possibly to teach at Columbia College and help bring  movie producers to the state, she said.  </P> <P> Benson was caught up in negative publicity surrounding University of South  Carolina President James B. Holderman, who resigned last week amid reports of  lavish spending.  </P> <P> Among spending criticized was the $158,367 in salary and living expenses the  school paid Benson over the past two years. Benson taught filmmaking there and  made the movie "Modern Love" in Columbia, using students and local  professionals.  </P> <P> The actor of such films as "Tribute," "One on One" and "The Chosen" could not  be reached for comment but he said last week that he resigned "the second Dr.  Holderman did" and that he would be moving to Los Angeles this month.  </P></p>

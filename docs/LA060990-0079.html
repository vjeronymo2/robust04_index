			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB;  </P> <P> MAN VS. MICROCHIP  </P> <P> All good things, even hypothetical ones, have to end sometime. After a flying  start with my new bankroll Thursday, I came back to Earth when my $40 win bet  Friday, Rejim in the eighth race, finished third.  </P> <P> But it's far too early to start worrying. After all, the computer's pick  finished last. Take that, silicon breath!  </P> <P> My bets for today are $20 to win on Classic Overlay in the fourth race and $60  to win on Patches in the sixth.  </P> <P> Bob's Beginning Bankroll $2,000  </P> <P> Friday's Loss $40  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $2,150  </P> <P> The computer lost $40 on Por D.J. in the fifth race. Its bet today is $40 to  win and $40 to place on Silver Circus in the ninth (it probably thinks the  horse's name is Silver Circuits).  </P> <P> Computer's Beginning Bankroll $2,000  </P> <P> Friday's Loss $40  </P> <P> Current Bankroll $1,992.50  </P></p>

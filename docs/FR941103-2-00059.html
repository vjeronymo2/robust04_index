			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western disagrees with the comment which suggests that surplus sales  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and purchase pricing should be identical, without consideration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nature of the constraint condition at Glen Canyon. The methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed by Western for assessment of conditions with and without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim release constraints at Glen Canyon currently predict (a) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher, but acceptable, average purchase prices will result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> near future from deliveries under several long-term purchase agreements and (b) lower average surplus sale prices will occur due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant ``forced sales'' during offpeak and shoulder onpeak hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, should additional operation experience suggest modification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to this base assumption, Western will consider future improvements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the methods used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western applied the hourly modeling of net purchased power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense to only 3 years. The other years between and beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 years modeled were estimated based on a regression analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3 years' results . . . regression analysis using three data points to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpolate and extrapolate results may be unreliable and is certainly less than ideal. (The commentor) recommends that the hourly model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to calculate annual net expense at least through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year 2002, when the recovery of the hydrosystem and increases in firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> load . . . have stabilized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Western disagrees with the suggestion that additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years of hourly modeling in its current form would significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve the reliability of forecasted net purchase power expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The methodology developed by Western to forecast the net purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power expense considers several significant variables such as hourly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firm load and available hourly hydrogeneration in determination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hourly deficits or surpluses. The method then considers seasonal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variation in purchase and surplus sales pricing structures in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimation of the net purchase power expense. Given the simplifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions made in the methods, Western recognizes a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlation between deficit (or surplus) hydrogeneration and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated net purchase power expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In balancing the limited time required to complete the analysis and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the precision required for the net expense estimate, Western determined that modeling all hours within each month for 3 years (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36 months) would be adequate and that hourly modeling for additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years would not significantly improve the reliability of the forecasted net purchase power expense.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Western continues to support the general application of these methods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to express the causal relationship between deficit (or surplus) hydrogeneration and annual net purchase power expenses. However, Western  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledges that some future modifications may be beneficial, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as (1) additional refinements of the model, (2) validation of key  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assumptions, and (3) application of refined methods and assumptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to additional future periods (i.e., months, years) to increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample size. Such changes will be considered in future net purchase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power expense forecasts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large customer organization says that it has been unable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to understand or replicate Western's results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

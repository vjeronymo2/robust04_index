			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Illness casts doubt over defence secretary MR LES ASPIN, the US defence secretary, remained in hospital yesterday with heart problems and may have to reduce his workload when he is eventually released, according to his aides. Mr Aspin was taken to hospital on Sunday night suffering from acute shortness of breath triggered by a reaction to a typhoid inoculation. He is expected to make a complete recovery. Nevertheless, his illness has amplified concerns about the vacuum of power at the Pentagon, where Mr Aspin is the only senior official to have been appointed so far by President Bill Clinton. Mr William Perry, who has been nominated to be deputy secretary, has not yet been confirmed by the Senate, and the acting secretary in Mr Aspin's absence is a 'caretaker' left over from the Bush administration. Mr Aspin's former colleagues in Congress had already begun, before his illness, to criticise the slowness with which he has filled top positions at the Pentagon. One member of the Armed Services Committee, which Mr Aspin chaired for nine years, said he was more alone than General Custer at the battle of the Little Big Horn. In the hurry to produce a defence budget by the administration's March 23 deadline, Mr Aspin has already been forced to content himself with makeshift cuts from the baseline proposed by his predecessors in the Bush administration, rather than rethinking the missions and structures of the US armed forces from the bottom up. Mr Aspin had spent a 'good night' in hospital, according to an aide yesterday, but it was not clear when he would be released.</p>

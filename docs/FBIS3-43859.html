Ostensibly it  was all about 100-percent pay rise the soldiers were demanding.  But there has been talking of rival factions developing with  some elements of the defense force openly opposed to the  10-month-old government led by Ntsu Mokhehle. At the weekend  South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha intervened and calm  appeared to have been restored, but there are still a few  political rifts to be patched up, as Candy Ramanoene reports in  this telex from Maseru:    The capital Maseru was calm today with shops and businesses  open as usual. Military presence was less than it has been over  the past three days, but people are still fearful of further  shootings. It is still not known what has happened to the  soldiers involved in the incidents, but it is thought that they  are under arrest. No statement has, however, come from the  government. The prime minister, Ntsu Mokhehle, today announced  that on Wednesday [19 January] they will be having a meeting  with members of seven political parties to try and work out a  solution to the crisis, but surprisingly, the two main  opposition parties, the BNP [Basotho National Party] and the  royalist Marematlou Freedom Party are unlikely to be at the  meeting, because they haven't signed, unlike the other seven  parties, the letter requesting an urgent meeting with the prime  minister.    Political observers here say that popular opinion firmly  believe that the prime minister should not give into the  soldiers' demand for 100-percent pay rise. Despite the party's  denial, the talk on the streets is that BNP was somehow behind  the weekend's incident.</p>

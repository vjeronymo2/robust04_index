			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS / LONNIE WHITE: TESTS DIDN'T LET COPELAND KNOW DANGER HE FACED  </P> <P> This football season in the Southland will be remembered for the deaths of  three outstanding players.  </P> <P> In late August, Raider safety Stacey Toran, 27, was killed in an automobile  accident; last month, University of Colorado quarterback Sal Aunese, 21, from  the San Diego Area, died of stomach cancer, and Friday night, Kevin Copeland,  17, of Dorsey High School died apparently of heart failure during a game  against San Pedro.  </P> <P> Copeland's family has a history of heart problems. In 1975, his father, Ron  Copeland Sr., who played football at UCLA and with the Chicago Bears, died of a  heart attack at 28 after running a sprint race. Kevin's grandfather, Harold  Copeland, died of heart disease a week before the death of Ron Sr.  </P> <P> In light of these facts, the question immediately arose: Should Kevin Copeland  have been playing football?  </P> <P> Millicent Copeland said that she knew her son could be taking a risk by playing  football. She had even taken him to doctors before he became involved in the  sport, but nothing was discovered that would indicate he should not play.  </P> <P> The mother hoped that any heart problems had passed over Kevin and his  brothers, Ron Jr. and Kyle. But Friday night, Kevin Copeland collapsed on the  sideline at Daniels Field in San Pedro shortly before the end of the first  quarter. He was pronounced dead at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital at 9:20 p.m.  </P> <P> Everyone who came in contact with Kevin Copeland knew that he was special.  </P> <P> He seemed to go through life as if he had a secret, because everything came so  easy for him. He was an outstanding student and athlete who always greeted  people warmly and had an aura about him that made it seem he was destined for  greatness.  </P> <P> Copeland played football because he loved the game. He also had the required  talent, and that combination made the sport fun to play. For him, there was  football and then the other sports.  </P> <P> In the spring, he competed on the track, where he also excelled. As a junior,  he was a state meet qualifier in the 100 and 200 meters and a member of  Dorsey's state champion 400-meter relay team. However, he was quick to point  out that he was just running to stay in shape for his real sport, football.  </P> <P> Everything he did on the football field appeared smooth and effortless, whether  he was catching a pass, receiving a kick, avoiding tacklers or intercepting a  pass. As a scoring threat, he was to Dorsey what Tim Brown was to Notre Dame  during his Heisman Trophy season.  </P> <P> After being selected to the All-City team last year from a senior-led Dorsey  team, Copeland figured that this would be his season. Gone from the Dons'  roster were Beno Bryant, Shawn Miller, Roman Foster and Sharrief Shah. It was  up to Copeland to provide Dorsey with leadership in 1989.  </P> <P> He had begun to assume that role last season, when he became one of the top  prep receivers in the nation, catching 33 passes for more than 700 yards and 11  touchdowns.  </P> <P> Although seemingly quiet and mild-mannered, Copeland displayed an aggressive  competitive spirit on the football field, as if every play might be his last.  He never wanted an opponent to feel that they had an edge over him because he  did not give his best.  </P> <P> His obvious talents made him a top college prospect and he was being heavily  recruited by USC, UCLA, Notre Dame, Michigan and Miami.  </P> <P> Showboating was not his style; he thought of himself merely as a hard worker  who usually accomplished what he set out to do. After making an outstanding  play, he would let those around him celebrate.  </P> <P> Now, in the aftermath of his death, Kevin Copeland has again left any emotion  up to others. And for those who knew him, it will be hard to conceal.  </P> <P> Funeral services will be held Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. at the Maranatha  Community Church, 3800 West Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. Donations may be sent  in the name of Millicent Copeland to Dorsey High School, 3537 Farmdale Ave, Los  Angeles 90016.  </P> <P> Twenty-five years ago, Whittier High upset top-ranked Loyola, 21-14, to win the  Southern Section 4-A Division football title for the first and only time. With  the victory, the Cardinals ended the Cubs' 35-game winning streak.  </P> <P> Last Friday night, that championship team was honored during Whittier's 21-17  win over town-rival California before an estimated crowd of 3,000 at California  High.  </P> <P> Among the returning Cardinals were tight end George Buehler, who became a  standout at Stanford and with the Raiders, and Bob Chandler, a star wide  receiver at USC and with the Buffalo Bills and the Raiders. That season,  Buehler, who now lives in the Bay Area, was Southern Section player of the  year; Chandler, master of ceremonies for the reunion, was a reserve  underclassman on the team.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most important Cardinal to return was Gary Styler, now an  electrician. He came to the rescue Friday night when the game was delayed 30  minutes because of a power failure at the stadium, getting the lights back on  so the game could begin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prep Notes  </P> <P> Carson quarterback Armin Youngblood completed 10 of 14 passes for 244 yards and  four touchdowns in the Colts' 52-0 rout of Washington. . . . Wilmington Banning  quarterback John Ma'ae passed for 232 yards while completing 15 of 28 passes in  the Pilots' 42-10 victory over Narbonne of Harbor City. . . . Ivan Wilson of  South Gate scored two touchdowns and rushed for 116 yards in the Rams' 14-6 win  over Huntington Park. . . . Jerome Casey of Sylmar rushed for 275 yards in the  Spartans' 27-3 romp over Birmingham of Van Nuys. . . . Shane Sherman of  Huntington Beach Edison rushed for over 300 yards as the Chargers defeated  Bellflower St. John Bosco, 48-27. . . . Roger Boden set two school records with  35 carries and 277 yards rushing as Los Altos beat Nogales, 21-14. . . . The  Dorsey-San Pedro game, which was halted after the death of Kevin Copeland, will  not be rescheduled unless it affects the City playoffs.  </P> <P> TIMES' TOP TEAMS  </P> <P> Southern Section  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.64IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="2"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> No. School, League  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Record  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> 1.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Baghdad, May 8, INA--AL-JUMHURIYAH newspaper of  Baghdad today said that no one imagined that affairs in Yemen  would turn into such military confrontations as if they were  between enemies and not brothers from one country. [passage  omitted]    The English language newspaper `THE BAGHDAD OBSERVER'  editorially commented on the military battles raging in Yemen  and said the crisis there is a result of foreign and internal  factors.    The paper said the United States and Saudia [Saudi Arabia]  as  well as the Kuwaiti regime have worked covertly and in the open  to destabilize the security and political situation in Yemen.  Although the three parties are united in their opposition to  any Arab gathering that could become a nucleus for a pan-Arab  unity, each party has its own motives in opposing any Arab unity.    The United States along with the world Zionism are against  the unity of the Arab nation so that the Arabs remain weak and  suffer from their international divisions and differences.    The Iraqi paper further said that Israel in occupied  Palestine will remain having the upper hand over the Arabs.    The U.S. showed indifference to the Yemen unity at the  beginning because it felt that the Yemen unity would serve its  global policy of winning footholds against the former USSR since  south Yemen used to be an ally of the latter.    But since the collapse of the former USSR and the discovery  of oil in the southern part of Yemen, the U.S. policy towards  Yemen has shifted to its previous approach.    The paper added that the U.S. touches in the current Yemen  crisis are indicated in the suspicious roles played by the U.S.  ambassador to Yemen and other U.S. officials who are playing an  agitating role in the Yemen crisis.    The U.S. influence on Yemen affairs has increased with the  increasing number of U.S. oil companies digging for oil.  Currently there are about 26 U.S. companies having oil  contracts with Yemen.    The official invitations being extended to a number of  Yemeni  officials, journalists, and politicians is another tactic used  by the U.S. Administration and its agencies to win political and  economic influence in Yemen.    It added that the Saudis, for their part, are playing the  same suspicious role played by the U.S. Administration in that  since the unification of the two parts of Yemen, the Saudis  increased their support to feudalism and tribalism in Yemen to  destabilize the security and political situation in that Arab  country.    Since then Saudi Arabia has expelled thousands of Yemeni  expatriates and made extra territorial claims against Yemen.    This Saudi stance is in line with their government's  customary policy of opposing any Arab economic or political  unity.    The paper pointed out that the Kuwaitis for their part  played  an agitating role trying to castigate the Yemeni leadership for  its support for Iraq during the U.S.-led aggression on the  country.    So what is going on in Yemen nowadays is a result of a  regional and international conspiracy to destroy the fragile  Yemen unity and once again bring about its fragmentation.    If this is allowed to happen, it would be in the interest of  the enemies of the Arab nation and very deterimental to Arab  interests.</p>

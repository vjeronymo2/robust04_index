			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PAPANDREOU GIVES UP ON COALITION  </P> <P> Former Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou gave up on forming a leftist  coalition government today and again blasted communist forces for their recent  deal with the right.  </P> <P> The Socialist leader, ordered to stand trial on criminal charges by a  conservative-communist coalition that resigned Saturday, is seeking a comeback  after a crushing June election defeat.  </P> <P> "It was not possible to form a government," he told reporters after returning a  three-day mandate to seek coalition partners to President Christos Sartzetakis.  </P> <P> Papandreou, 70, has accused the unprecedented right-left coalition of carrying  out a political vendetta to destroy his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, which  held power from 1981 until June.  </P></p>

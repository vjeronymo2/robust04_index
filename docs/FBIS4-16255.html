			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 14 April, TASS -- The agreement on merging of  the Russian and Byelorussian [Belarusian] monetary systems,  which provides for solving of certain military problems as well,  is above all "to the advantage of the Russian servicemen  temporarily deployed on Byelorussian territory," according to  the Republic's Defence Minister Pavel Kazlowski.    After the meeting of the Council of CIS Defence Ministers,  Kazlowski noted in an interview with TASS that all nuclear  weapons stationed on Byelorussian soil belong to Russia, which  is withdrawing them strictly according to the schedule. The  minister believes the entire nuclear arsenal will be removed to  Russia by 1999, as scheduled, or even earlier.</p>

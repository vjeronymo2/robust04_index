The head of the delegation said Comrade Yi In-mo maintained  his faith and will as a communist for scores of years behind  bars in South Korea and this is an example to be followed not  only by the Korean people but also by the world communists and  revolutionaries.    He stressed that any enemy can never bring the Korean people  to their knees because they have the Workers' Party of Korea  [WPK] which produced such incarnation of faith and will as Yi  In-mo and they are wisely guided by the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    A member of the delegation Sandra Bains said it is an  intolerable crime that the South Korean puppets had kept him  behind bars for 34 years, putting him to all manner of inhuman  persecution.    Noting that it was possible in the socialist homeland that  Comrade Yi In-mo recovered his health, she said that while in  Korea, the delegation could see socialism of Korea advancing  dynamically.    Comrade Yi In-mo said he regained his life under the deep  loving care of the great leader and the dear leader.    "I could undauntedly struggle, maintaining my faith and  will,  because I deeply trusted only the WPK, the leader and the  socialist homeland," he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hal" signed report: "Discussion About Tax Plans Within </F> SPD"]    [Text] Bonn, 27 Mar -- Views within the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] on the party's tax policy in the event  that the SPD wins the upcoming Bundestag elections continue to  differ. Whereas Rudolf Scharping, SPD Chairman and chancellor  candidate, rejected an increase in the gasoline tax in an  interview with FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG,  Schleswig-Holstein Minister-President Heide Simonis (SPD) told  ZDF that, over the long term, one should think about "whether  one could use an increase in the gasoline tax to initiate  certain developments." Thus, it is important to shift local  traffic from private cars to public transportation. Scharping  told BILD that he does not want to set a time limit for the  10-percent unification surcharge for high-income earners. The  charge will be levied until the "old inherited burdens from the  shadow budgets of the current Federal Government are removed."  Frau Simonis pleaded in favor of increasing the property and  inheritance tax. Those who possess property have been spared so  far and made sizable profits. These people "must now also  realize slowly" that they must make a contribution to financing  the state. According to an Emnid poll among 1,000 citizens, 55  percent support the unification surcharge for high-income  earners, suggested by the SPD. A total of 34 percent endorse  the general solidarity surcharge of 7.5 percent, planned by the  government for 1 January 1995. Klaus Kinkel, chairman of the  Free Democratic Party of Germany, described the SPD proposal as  a "frontal attack on the top performers in the country." The  high-income earners already provide over 90 percent of the  overall tax revenue.</p>

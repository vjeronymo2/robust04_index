			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Socorro Lopez Espinosa] </F>   [Text] The free trade agreements being negotiated with  Central America and other areas in Latin America "are not and  will not be a free ticket for access to NAFTA." We will  negotiate with each country or group of countries in accordance  with the interests of each. In addition, the agreements with  Central America are "to promote rather than to regulate trade"  as was the case with the two North American countries.    Herminio Blanco, deputy secretary of International Trade  Relations of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial  Development (Secofi), and Jesus Flores Ayala in charge of Latin  American negotiations for the Secofi, expressed themselves in  these terms while participating in a course on "Public  Administration Vis-a-vis the New Dimensions of Foreign Trade  between Mexico and Central American Countries," which was  organized by the Secofi and the National Public Administration  Institute (INAP).    Herminio Blanco pointed out that Mexico is interested in  negotiating with Central American countries: Honduras, El  Salvador, and Guatemala (Mexico has already signed an agreement  with Costa Rica), but as to how far and how these nations want  to negotiate with Mexico must be determined. Besides, it is up  to the Central Americans to decide if they want to join NAFTA.    The Partial Reach Agreements [Acuerdos de Alcance Parcial,  AAP] are a very "old" model no longer functional within the  framework of ongoing economic and trade globalization. What is  more, of the agreements currently in force only 50 percent of a  total of 1,000 tariffs are being used. Through these agreements  Mexico has imported only $51 million from Central America,  two-thirds of this amount from Guatemala. That is why free  trade agreements are sought to modernize relationships in order  to encourage investments and joint investments, to exchange  technology, and to create jobs, in essence for the economic  development of countries, Blanco stressed.    He made clear that the rules of origin established in trade  agreements with Mexico are simple, and above all seek to reduce  costs and avoid the illegal transshipment of goods. The  established rules are balanced according to the interests and  competitive capacity of the countries seeking free trade.    In addition, Jesus Flores Ayala, in charge of negotiations  with Latin America, warned that agreements such as that signed  with Costa Rica "are not a free ticket for access to NAFTA"  because the grounds for negotiations on specific items are  different, in the long run they might be complementary, but it  is obvious certain adjustments have to be made to comply with  NAFTA provisions.    The Central and South American countries must evaluate "if  they are or are not in condition to compete on an international  level with prevalent market conditions." In this sense, for  example, Guatemala and Honduras should define what they want to  do in trade, whether to negotiate bilaterally or as a group with  El Salvador. This is despite a long-standing "political  agreement" that all three Central American nations together  would negotiate with Mexico. While they decide about their  positions, we must not lose any time and must continue to  negotiate, Flores Ayala said.    Lastly, Herminio Blanco stressed the importance of updating  relations between countries, and seeking opportunities and  access to markets within the context of equality and mutual  benefits.</p>

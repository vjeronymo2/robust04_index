			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Williams hints at disposals move WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is to focus on three of its five core businesses with the clear implication that engineering and electronics are up for sale. The new strategy was outlined by Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, as he unveiled static pre-tax profits of Pounds 76.4m (against Pounds 76.2m) for the half-year ending June. The shares fell 7p to 326p. Williams is to concentrate on building products in Europe and the US and fire and safety where many of its brand names, such as Yale &amp; Valor and Thorn Fire Protection, are market leaders. However, engineering and electronics, which suffered profit falls and account for around 10 per cent of the group's revenue, are understood to be prime candidates for disposal. Many of their businesses, such as Fairey Engineering, are only number two in the market. The desire to dispose of non-market leaders was one of the main reasons which prompted Williams to sell Crown Berger paints in 1990. Mr Rudd, while declining to comment directly on the future of engineering and electronics, said: 'We are focusing on three core businesses which we expect to grow organically and through bolt-on acquisitions.' Borrowings have increased to Pounds 210.5m (from Pounds 161.9m) representing gearing of 56 per cent. The rise in debt is mainly due to acquisitions. Williams has been looking at possible acquisitions with a price tag of up to Pounds 300m on both sides of the Atlantic. Mr Rudd singled out Germany as offering interesting buying opportunities. Mr Roger Carr, managing director, said: 'Our investors have told us, without exception, that they will support the right deal.' Operating profit rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 86.4m on increased sales of Pounds 589.9m (from Pounds 493.8m). Last year's pre-tax profits benefited from an exceptional Pounds 6.1m, which included the disposal of its Racal shareholding. European consumer and building products saw operating profits rise to Pounds 36.2m (from Pounds 32.2m) on the back of a strong performance from DIY products. North American consumer and building products, benefiting from cost reduction and the stronger dollar, increased profits to Pounds 25.1m (from Pounds 20.7m). Fire and safety's profits rose to Pounds 20.2m (against Pounds 17.5m) excluding a four-month contribution from Thorn Fire Protection which was acquired earlier this year from Thorn EMI. Profits from electronics and engineering fell to Pounds 1.6m (from Pounds 5.6m) and Pounds 3.3m (against Pounds 4.3m) respectively. Earnings per share fell to 8.4p (from 9p), although excluding exceptionals earnings rose from 7.7p. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p. Lex, Page 20</p>

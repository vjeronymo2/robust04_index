			<p>BFN       [Editorial report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2236 GMT on 30 April, in its "News 2001" program,  carries a live 25-minute interview with Yoshiro Mori, secretary  general of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), by FNN  announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Tomomi Seki, political commentator  Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki  Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo.    At the outset of the interview, Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment  on the Hata coalition government. Mori stresses: "If the  LDP--the largest political party--had formed a coalition  government, the current political upheaval would have not  occurred." Calling the Hosokawa coalition government a  "failure," Mori notes that the ruling coalition partners had  difficulty in coordinating policy amongst themselves, then  stresses: "The coalition partners should have turned over power  to the LDP in accordance with the principle of constitutional  government."    Discussing the fate of the Hata government, Mori notes the  206 seats held by the LDP in the House of Representatives,  stating: "The Hata cabinet is saddled with too many problems in  various aspects." During the interview, Mori criticizes Prime  Minister Hata for not apologizing to the people for supporting  former Prime Minister Hosokawa while he served as deputy prime  minister in the Hosokawa cabinet. Mori emphatically states:  "In any case, we have to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994  passed in the Diet. He adds: "Various changes are expected to  take place once the budget bill is enacted." Discussing the  prospects of the LDP retaking power, Mori states: "The LDP is  presently engaged in soul-searching on its losing power, using  the time to make various efforts and study various things." He  adds: "From now on, the LDP will have to consider the process  of retaking power and work on polishing its public image."    Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP seeking an  alliance with the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in a  bid to return to power, Mori states: "It would be very  difficult to reach an agreement with the SDPJ on policies."    Noting that an FNN poll shows 64.3 percent of the voters  believe the House of Representatives must be dissolved prior to  general elections once the budget bill is enacted in the Diet,  Kuroiwa asks Mori to comment. Mori discusses how the LDP worked  on political reform, particularly the reform of the current  electoral system in the past, stating: "The next general  elections must be held under a new electoral system called the  combined electoral system of proportional representation and  single-seat constituency." Hinting at the possibility of the  LDP submitting a no-confidence motion to the Diet against the  Hata cabinet for delaying the enactment of the budget bill, Mori  stresses: "All Diet members are responsible for speedy  deliberation of the budget bill and its quick enactment."    Discussing how the LDP intends to retake power, Mori points  out: "Hata has virtually no knowledge of how to stimulate the  economy." He discovered this when Hata served as finance  minister in the LDP government. Noting that "industrialists and  business managers have come to find that only the LDP's policies  can make it possible to run Japan's economy smoothly," Mori  says: "The LDP is presently working hard to polish its public  image."    Asked by Kuroiwa about the possibility of the LDP splitting  again, Mori states: "The LDP is formed by politicians with  differing views."    Kuroiwa concludes the interview at 2351 GMT after thanking  the participants.</p>

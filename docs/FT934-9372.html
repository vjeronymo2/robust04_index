			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Heady cocktail in NY: Saleroom AN early abstract expressionist work, 'Year after Year', painted in 1947 by Arshile Gorky, sold for Dollars 3.85m (Pounds 2.6m) at Christie's in New York on Tuesday night. The price paid by a private American collector for this colourful, optimistic, cocktail of greens, reds and oranges was not only a record for the artist but set the seal on Christie's most successful auction of contemporary art for years. 'This was the most heady sale since the late 1980s,' said Mr Christopher Burge, Christie's US president. 'The excitement in the room signalled a return of confidence to the market, with people keen to buy works of art again, whether expensive or reasonably priced,' he said. 'We noticed a number of new buyers.' The auction brought in Dollars 15.9m (Pounds 10.8m) and was 85 per cent sold by value, a high success rate for a contemporary art sale. A fire at Gorky's studio destroyed much of his output, and important works rarely come on to the market. Another highlight was the Dollars 1.7m paid for a study by Francis Bacon of his fellow-artist Lucien Freud. It fetched almost double its estimate. Bacon painted the portrait in 1964.</p>

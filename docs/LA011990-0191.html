			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BO JACKSON'S NEW SURPRISE, BACK TO SCHOOL  </P> <P> Bo Jackson likes to surprise people.  </P> <P> He decided to play both football and baseball when almost everyone said it  couldn't be done.  </P> <P> Now he's returned to Auburn University to work toward his diploma even though  his athletic prowess already earns him of millions of dollars each year.  </P> <P> "It was time to come back for something I need and want to do," Jackson said  Thursday during a news conference at Auburn's School of Human Sciences. "A lot  of people would say that if they were in my position they wouldn't come back.  Well, I'm not most people. People never expect what I do to happen."  </P> <P> Jackson, who is majoring in family and child development, found time to come  back to school between careers with the NFL's Los Angeles Raiders and  baseball's Kansas City Royals. He encouraged other athletes to follow his  example.  </P> <P> After completing an internship and correspondence courses this quarter, Jackson  will be 23 credit hours away from completing requirements for his degree.  </P> <P> He decided to continue working toward his diploma to keep a promise to his  mother and because he wants to be the first in his family to receive a degree  from a major university.  </P></p>

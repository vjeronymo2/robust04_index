It held a speech rally in Bi'r Hasan  attended by an Islamic Republic of Iran delegation represented  by its ambassadors to Lebanon and Syria Homayun 'Ali Zadeh and  Mohammad Akhtari-Forughi, and by Lebanese and Palestinian  deputies and religious, military, and partisan figures, and  others. [passage omitted]    Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the "Islamic  Jihad  Movement in Palestine," made a speech in which he said that the  "resistance men insist on defeating Israel." He criticized  those "who drink toasts with murderers and who speak of future  normalization." [passage omitted]    At the end, Hizballah Secretary General Hasan Nasrallah  spoke. He said that "the resistance, whose leaders they killed  in order to destroy it, is now stronger, firmer, and more  solid." He reaffirmed that "our firm choice and absolute  conviction is that the resistance is the only way to regain the  territories and the holy places and to make real and precious  peace. We will complete that journey most strongly and will not  be deterred by Zionist terrorist methods or the continuous  threats of a new war or annihilation of Hizballah...."    He asked "is it not time for everyone to give up their bet  on  negotiations which can only produce an Israeli peace on Israeli  terms?" He criticized the United States for reneging on the  commitments announced at the Geneva summit, and he also  criticized the "Gaza-Jericho First" and Cairo agreements. He  charged that Israel "has not abandoned the option of separate  solutions so that it would move quickly to impose its terms on  the Palestinian side with the presence of a traitor like  (Palestinian President) Yasir 'Arafat who is making endless  concessions."    He urged "the Palestinian people to intensify their  revolution and uprising and to work seriously for the downfall  of the treasonous Zionized leadership of which 'Arafat is the  black symbol, and even to destroy it and, by doing so, abort all  the humiliating agreements."    He called on all the peoples of the region to "uphold the  great resistance option in order to put an end to the  occupation, especially in Lebanon." He appealed to "all the  Lebanese to join the ranks of the resistance." He thanked Iran  and Syria for their positions and criticized the "Lebanese  Government and the official silence" about what is taking place  in the south. He said: "That government is the biggest  absentee in relation to all national issues." He added: "Did  you not notice the great official interest shown in the incident  of the execution of the murderer who had committed his  abominable crime in Ba'labakk (Husayn 'Awwadah) carried out by  agreement among the families concerned which adhered to a known  Shari'ah rule and carried it out immediately to prevent  sedition, at a time when there was terrible official silence  about the horrible Israeli aggressions in the south and in  western al-Biqa'? Is that government performance not considered  to be an encouragement and a complementary factor to the  aggression?"    He criticized the way the government addresses the  steadfastness of the southerners and the economic and social  issues as well as the issue of the return of the evacuees. He  also criticized it for "keeping in flux the investigation into  the 13 September massacre" (the al-Ghubayri incident) and he  challenged the government to hold a referendum to determine its  popularity.</p>

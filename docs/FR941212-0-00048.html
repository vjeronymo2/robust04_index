			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 54. Under our rules, interested parties, as well as the Commission, will have ample opportunity to review the application of Part 64 to video dialtone-related nonregulated offerings. All LECs with $100 million or more in annual operating revenues are required to keep their current Part 64 Cost Allocation Manuals (CAMs) on file with this Commission. To assist State regulators and other interested parties in tracking video dialtone-related CAM filings, we hereby require that any LEC receiving authorization to provide video dialtone file CAM amendments within thirty days after the effective date of the Section 214 authorization and at least sixty days prior to providing nonregulated products or services related to video dialtone. Video dialtone-related CAM amendments are subject to public comment and will be closely scrutinized by the Commission. Changes to time reporting procedures, cost apportionment tables, and the affiliate transactions statement can, if necessary, be suspended for up to 180 days, after which the Bureau may either allow the new procedures to become effective or prescribe different procedures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Part 36_Jurisdictional Separations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 55. We decline the parties' requests that we institute at this time Federal-State Joint Board proceedings to amend our Part 36 jurisdictional separations rules for video dialtone service. For the time being, LECs will allocate regulated video dialtone investment and expenses between the State and Federal jurisdictions in accordance with existing rules. To ensure that our decisions do not have untoward effects outside of our regulatory jurisdiction, we are directing the Common Carrier Bureau to monitor the impact of video dialtone on separations results and on intrastate local telephone rates, and to report its findings periodically to this Commission. This course of action will provide us and State regulators with the practical experience and the data necessary to make appropriate decisions concerning the future of the Part 36 rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 56. Joint Petitioners and others have complained that existing separations rules would assign to the States 75% of increased loop costs attributable to video dialtone, but no video dialtone revenues. This argument is premised on our jurisdictional determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> which we now modify on reconsideration. Thus, regulated video dialtone services of a purely intrastate nature may be tariffed in the intrastate jurisdiction. The availability of intrastate video dialtone revenues should help offset any increase in intrastate costs caused by LEC provision of video dialtone services and help prevent any local rate increases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 57. In declining to institute a Joint Board proceeding to address issues raised by the particular video dialtone proposals now pending before the Commission, we do not mean to imply that we will never revisit Part 36. Indeed, it appears likely that, as telecommunications networks and the marketplace evolve, the separations rules will require revision. In our judgment, however, it is too soon to begin proceedings to propose specific rule changes in this area. Video dialtone is but the first of what we expect to be an array of broadband services, and the current video dialtone proposals may or may not be representative of the manner in which those services will use network facilities, or of the jurisdictional mix of those services. Under these circumstances, scarce Federal and State regulatory resources should not be expended to craft separations rules tailored to video dialtone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 58. We will take the following steps to help ensure that local telephone ratepayers are not being harmed by the advent of video dialtone_a preeminent concern of State commenters. We direct the Common Carrier Bureau to develop a data collection program that will track the impact of video dialtone on both separations results and intrastate telephone rates. As part of this program, the Bureau will require all carriers offering video dialtone to submit detailed explanations of how they are applying the Part 36 rules, as well as Parts 32, 61, and 64, to video dialtone investments and expenses. The Bureau will report is results periodically so that this Commission and State regulators can determine when and if rule changes or other actions appear necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 59. We also will open an inquiry proceeding focusing on a matter of paramount concern to both Federal and State regulators_the implications for the jurisdictional separations process of the introduction of new technologies, including broadband technology, into LEC networks. This proceeding will provide a forum for exploring the broader separations policy issues raised by continuing changes in network technology, of which video dialtone is but one example. The inquiry also will be a vehicle for updating, in light of actual video dialtone experience, the record created in the instant proceeding. We strongly encourage active State commission involvement in our inquiry and seek to establish a dialogue between State and Federal regulators on these issues. The information we gather in this inquiry could serve as a basis for future rulemaking proposals as we examine our existing rules in light of the evolving nature of LEC networks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60. State commissions, of course, bear the primary responsibility for ensuring that intrastate rates are reasonable. We emphasize that neither our decisions in this proceeding nor our actions on the various video dialtone Section 214 applications preempt the State commissions from disallowing from local telephone service rates any video dialtone-related costs that do not meet their own standards for inclusion in rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 61. Finally, some parties contend that Section 410(c) of the Communications Act legally compels us to refer all separations issues, including use of common plant for video dialtone, to a Joint Board. Although Section 410(c) requires the Commission to refer separations issues to a Joint Board upon instituting a notice and comment rulemaking proceeding, we are not proposing to modify any separations rules here but are simply applying our existing rules. We conclude that we have the authority to apply existing jurisdictional separations rules during the initial phase of video dialtone service deployment. Our initial determinations regarding implementation of existing jurisdictional separations to video dialtone are, of course, subject to revision as we gain further experience with video dialtone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Part 69_Access Charge-Cost Allocations and Rate Structure <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 62. We conclude that access to the basic video dialtone platform is a form of interstate access to the extent it is used to route interstate video programming to end users. We also conclude that a separate access charge category for video dialtone may be desirable to help ensure that interstate video dialtone costs are not recovered through charges for access services provided to interexchange carriers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 63. We decline, however, to prescribe a new rate element or to initiate a notice of proposed rulemaking at this time. We recognize that the access charge rules define rate elements established for traditional telephone facilities. Video dialtone may use both new and existing network facilities to deliver services in ways not contemplated at the time the Part 69 rules were written. Because video dialtone is a nascent service, though, and in light of the wide variety of possible video dialtone architectures LECs may employ, we find that there is a significant risk that any uniform rate structure we would prescribe now would fail to produce rate elements that logically match each carrier's video dialtone offering. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

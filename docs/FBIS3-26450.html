The overall trend of development is good,  but there is no denying that some people have gone to bizarre  lengths to celebrate their New Year, holding extravagant  functions to cultivate social relations with a view to  furthering their interests, or even pursuing illegal activities.    In line with social progress, we must establish a new  concept  for the New Year.    We must establish a new "thrifty New Year" concept.  Recently, reform and opening up have raised people's living  standards considerably and have increased their consumption  power. A certain number of regions and people seem to have  forgotten how all this came about and have become extravagant,  holding banquets to celebrate the New Year and festivals, trying  to outspend each other. This "nouveau riche" demeanor is  absolutely wrong. We must see the rapid development of our  economy, as well as the fact that there still are people who  have not solved the problem of getting enough to eat and clothe  themselves with, and that millions of students are unable to pay  their tuition fees. Horizontally speaking, we still lag behind  many countries. Vertically speaking, our foundation is not yet  solid. Granted, we will be very rich in the future, but we  still should uphold the good traditional morals of hardwork and  thriftiness and the good style of arduous struggle.  Individually, most of us earn our income through toil.  Throwing away the money earned through daily labor on a  spending spree is unfortunate, unnecessary, and not worth it.    We must establish a new "stay-clean" New Year concept.  During the Spring Festival, it is only normal for units to  visit each other to boost relations, and for individuals to  visit relatives to renew and strengthen friendship. A few units  and individuals, however, may give gifts under the cover of the  festive season and at the expense of the state or may bribe  people under the cover of social calls, to the extent of  breaking the law. This is abnormal and must be halted firmly.  Encouraging clean government is part of the agenda of socialist  spiritual civilization and must be pursued through unyielding  efforts. During the Spring Festival, the broad mass of the  people must be highly self-disciplined; party and government  cadres of all ranks should practise what they enforce, set a  good personal example, refuse to give or accept bribes or to  take advantage of anyone, and set an example of "clean  government" for the people.    We must establish a new "civilized" New Year concept. Over  the years, socialist spiritual civilization has improved  people's spiritual lives greatly, but we must see that certain  unhealthy practices always surface at the Spring Festival.  People play mahjong, gamble, worship ancestors, disseminate  superstitious beliefs, and socialize to extend kinship networks  -- all unhealthy, uncivilized activities in that are out of tune  with the happy festive atmosphere. Another meaning of  celebrating a "civilized" New Year is to voluntarily observe law  and discipline, lead an orderly life, and be a civilized  passenger, audience, and worker, and in short, a civilized  citizen.    We must establish a new "planned New Year" concept. In  traditional Chinese customs, the Spring Festival is the  beginning of a new year. It does not harm us to sit down and  review the past and take a look at the future; to see what we  achieved and did not achieve last year, and sum them up; and to  outline the work and objectives for next year. Thus, we really  can "make a step of progress with the passing of another year."    Spring is the time to plan for the whole year. In the  history of our civilization, the Spring Festival is the most  important of all festivals. It takes place in spring -- at the  start of a year. Therefore, it is highly significant for us -- a  populous, not so wealthy developing country -- to celebrate the  New Year properly. To do that, we must establish a New Year  concept that corresponds with the times. That is only the first  step. The most important is practice.    The 1994 step is approaching. Here I wish everybody a happy,  harmonious, comfortable, and healthy New Year!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janusz Jankowiak: "Grandpa Kolodko and Our </F> Troubles"]    [Text] Who is Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz W.  Kolodko? He is someone who, while writing an economic report on  the postcommunist era, is capable of mentioning Balcerowicz's  name just once, in a footnote, while not even once mentioning  Dariusz Rosati (who, after all, was the founding father of the  anti-Balcerowicz opposition). Instead, Kolodko mentions his own  works, articles, and short reports more than 10 times.    Sure, one can do it this way, too. Let us not ignore the  fact that the above sheds some light on character-related vices  and professional qualifications of the most recent deputy prime  minister/finance minister.  <H5>  Anti-Winiecki </H5>   Because we described Rosati as one of the founding fathers,  Kolodko deserves the description of the grandfather of the  anti-Balcerowicz opposition, or, at any rate, he deserves the  description of someone older and famous for his authority in  this harmonious family.    Kolodko is a fundamentalist critic of the changes taking  place in the postcommunist economy. Placed next to him, Rosati  is indeed a real gentle lamb. ("The concept of a transformation  policy carried out, in practice, has lead to a situation where a  huge drop in output is accompanied by an avalanche-type increase  in unemployment and an extensive crisis in public finances. It  would be hard to find clearer proof of the mistaken nature of  this concept," the current deputy prime minister writes.)    Against this backdrop, Kolodko's position on the economic  legacy of the Polish People's Republic [PRL] is quite special.  While writing about some mistakes that were made, he speaks at  the same time about dynamic growth and a balanced budget. This  reminds me of a subtle admonition, with many elements of  affirmation contained in it. There is no doubt that Kolodko's  assessment of Poland after 1989 is much harsher than that of the  PRL period. Naturally, he has a right to that.    But it is hard to avoid the feeling that there is a very  personal and emotional attitude of Kolodko on the issues he  evaluates, lying at the very core of his criticism. If I were  to sketch a psychological portrait of Grzegorz Kolodko, I would  have to say that this very talented economist, by his decision  to associate himself with a political orientation that went into  opposition after the fall of PRL, had no direct influence on the  direction of economic changes in Poland after 1989.    A wounded ambition and complex of the rejected have been  shaping the aggressive tone of many of Kolodko's public  statements. Haughtiness and a lack of respect for those who have  different views--and also unconcealed joy over their  mistakes--can all be sensed in the statements. Every now and  then, a reader of Kolodko's works comes across: "official  optimism of the new elites," "nonsense plans and forecasts," "a  new propaganda of success," "a lack of realism, professionalism,  and insufficient imagination," "atrophy of the sense of  responsibility," "manipulating the confused public opinion,"  "economic charlatanry," "neoliberal orthodoxy," "populism," and  similar terms.    It is interesting that Grzegorz Kolodko finds an alter ego  in  the Polish economic literature. That alter ego is Professor Jan  Winiecki, a representative of constitutional liberalism, a  hard-working fighter against socialism, which, in Winiecki's  view, is the result of a mental aberration.    It would be hard to imagine two people so different from one  another and yet so similar as Kolodko and Winiecki. They are  different on literally everything: the past and their views.  What is common to them is the style of writing and the type of  personality. In both cases, we are dealing with people who are  intolerant and who cannot take criticism. It is enough to  familiarize oneself with any piece written by either man.    I doubt that these are the best references for someone to  manage the economy of a country with 40 million people. At any  rate, Kolodko tends to be an anti-Winiecki of the governing  coalition rather than its anti-Balcerowicz (which Rosati was).  It seems that the difference is rather significant.    [Union of Labor Chairman] Ryszard Bugaj has described  Kolodko  as a red liberal. As far as colors are concerned, I do not feel  authorized to speak out. As far as liberalism is concerned,  however, in my view Bugaj is wrong. Kolodko is definitely an  economist of modern social democracy's left wing. He is to the  left of not only Balcerowicz but also of Rosati, even though,  naturally, he is to the right of Bugaj at the same time.    But, according to traditional left-wing standards of the  1970's, Kolodko is still a liberal because he has spoken out  many times against the budget being burdened with social  expenditures to an excessive degree (such as is happening now),  against inflation, spinning the demand side, and against a  permanent budget deficit. He has stressed the need to reduce the  public debt, the need to legalize the economic "gray zone," and  has demanded restrictive monetary policies.    But, according to standards of constitutional liberalism,  literally nothing that Kolodko has to say on economy, can be  defended--that is, except for just one issue: his position on  the balance of public finances. On an orthodox scale, Kolodko  is an incomplete quarter-liberal, at the most. Never mind the  colors.  <H5>  The Absolutely Indispensable State </H5>   Kolodko negates an emergence in the postcommunist economy of  an independent mechanism widely known in regular market systems,  which causes growth after a period of depression. Such an  argument implies that the state is ascribed an active role in  setting economic growth in motion. So Kolodko draws a logical  conclusion that allowing for "creative destruction" after 1989  was a major mistake. Institutional and structural changes  should not have been implemented through shock, like a  macroeconomic stabilization. The indispensable transformations  "should have been managed by the governments with sensitivity."  That is a clear suggestion that the state uphold part of the  inefficient demand, which is an outlet for costly and obsolete  production.    Generally speaking, Kolodko's expectations vis-a-vis the  state are high. The state is not only supposed to contribute to  securing the proper conditions for stabilization and to deal  with establishing a market infrastructure, but, in Kolodko's  view, must also get involved in the process of allocating  capital and must direct that capital to those places where,  according to the government, it will be utilized in the best  possible manner. The state should even demonstrate "direct  production activity."    The state/the owner should manage its own wealth well. There  would be nothing wrong with this otherwise correct statement by  Kolodko if it were not for another idea being promoted by the  professor--namely, that "one must not privatize more or faster  than is possible." Someone could draw the conclusion from this  that there is too much privatization in Poland and that it is  taking place too fast. But that would be a completely false  conclusion. Kolodko's position on privatization is confusing.  He thinks the rate of privatization is not very impressive  currently and so one must increase it. So the warning mentioned  earlier is understood to be of a preventative nature.    But, for those who managed to "swallow" the warning while  concentrating primarily on the announcement of greater  privatization than up to now, Professor Kolodko has another  surprise up his sleeve: He says there is a close relationship  between the rate of privatization and the level of state  activity. It seems like a quite trivial thing. In strictly  technical terms, all it means is that the more somebody sells,  the harder he has to work. But it cannot be ruled out that this  argument by Kolodko should be interpreted in less trivial  fashion: The faster the rate of privatization, the more  government involvement in the economy.  <H5>  A Pentagon Out of Sync </H5>   To define Kolodko's economic views, his position on the  unemployment issue may also be quite helpful. Fortunately, in  this regard, we are no longer condemned to trying to track down  unclear traces.    Grzegorz Kolodko is the author of a theoretical concept that  allows one to measure the level of economic stabilization in  practically every country of the world. His "stabilization  pentagon" (described in a separate book) is an intellectually  interesting attempt at defining the relationship among the  growth of national product, unemployment, inflation, the state  of the budget, and the current balance of payments.    In the view of many economists, the practical utility of the  pentagon theory is rather small due to many simplifications  contained in it (for instance ignoring the NAIRU [expansion  unknown] indicator, which means unemployment rate not resulting  in increased inflation, or Kolodko's assumption that the cost of  bringing inflation down, as measured by unemployment, increases  in a linear fashion, which is obviously false, inasmuch as  bringing inflation from 600 percent down to 60 percent is less  costly than a reduction from 60 percent to 6 percent). That is  why one must take a distanced position on the dogmatic views on  the miserable effects of stabilization in postcommunist  economies, as determined by using the pentagon theory.    What is more important is that Kolodko's concept makes it  possible to describe in much better terms the economic trend to  which he belongs. For instance, according to Kolodko,  stabilization increases along with production, and the faster  unemployment falls, the greater the degree of stabilization.  This is undoubtedly a result of the growth theory as viewed by  social democrats, which ignores the issue of the cost of using  resources. In the eyes of liberals, that omission absolutely  disqualifies the pentagon theory as a credible economic  instrument.    Charges concerning links between stabilization and the  state of the current balance of state payments are of a similar  nature. Kolodko completely ignores the significance of the  inflow and outflow of capital, for the state's balance of  payments. But, in reality--and this is demonstrated not just by  the case of Poland--even a significant deficit of current  turnover going on for years does not necessarily have to drain  state hard-currency reserves.    It looks as if the author, while creating his pentagon,  picked and chose those elements (unemployment, trade deficit)  that support the theory on the miserable effects of  stabilization, while rejecting (in the assumptions that  simplified the model) anything that could contradict the  argument of the miserable effects of stabilization.  <H5>  A State-Controlled Kick in the Pants </H5>   Kolodko's nomination is significant for a number of reasons:    First, the left wing finally has its own transition ritual.  The left wing's economic team is being headed by a prestigious,  talented, and very aggressive critic of Balcerowicz's policies.    Second, the return to Kolodko's candidacy is, in a way, a  gesture of despair on the part of the Democratic Left Alliance  and the prime minister himself. I am saying that because what  really happened between fall and spring to make Kolodko's  comeback possible? The deputy prime minister has written  somewhere that neoliberalism begets populism. Someone could  make the observation now that Prof. Kolodko has finally gained  power on the basis of that very populism.    Third, the confusion surrounding the finance minister  demonstrated that politicians of a single camp are capable of  promoting people of quite differing views for the economy's  chief over a relatively short period of time.    A nomination of Rosati would make it likely that an easing  of  monetary policies will take place, which means introducing more  money into the economy, but it would also mean increasing the  state's fiscal discipline (for instance, a restrictive execution  of tax laws and of other laws resulting in revenue for the state  budget, or carrying out enterprise insolvencies). Kolodko's  concept seems to be exactly the opposite of that. In a recent  work, he wrote about the need to apply nondogmatic "instruments  in the area of revenues, flexible, active, and proinvestment  fiscal policies, and restrictive monetary policies."    What Rosati, the would-be deputy prime minister, wanted to  tighten, Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko, who assumed the post  while being recommended by the same left wing, wants to ease up.  And vice versa. What is this all about?    On a cautious note, I think this demonstrates the  politicians' weak knowledge concerning detailed views by  economists who are proposed for the state's supreme posts, or  else it demonstrates that the politicians just do not think such  details are very important. What is important, they think, is  that Borowski, Rosati, and Kolodko belong to the same political  team and so are included in the same trend that is described as  a reformist or liberal left wing. Apart from that common  denominator of the most general nature, everything else does not  count. The truth is that this view is obviously false. The  "everything else" does count a lot, by all means.    If Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko tries to implement  demands that he voiced as a professor/reviewer, then it is only  now that our economy will get a real state-controlled kick in  the pants.    I think this makes it easy to understand why, from the  standpoint of liberal economists, Rosati, the founding father,  who was much less unequivocal than Kolodko, may have seemed like  the lesser evil.</p>

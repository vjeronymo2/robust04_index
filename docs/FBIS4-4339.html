			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Moscow agreed to assume  responsibility for repaying all South Korean loans, including  commodity and bank loans, to the former Soviet Union at a  working-level meeting with Seoul that closed here on Tuesday.    In November 1992, Russia agreed to repay all commodity loans  South Korea had extended to the former Soviet Union.    But the two countries differed on how and when Russia should  repay the loans, agreeing only to meet again in the near future.    Assistant Finance Minister Yim Chang-yol, who headed the  South Korean delegation to the meeting, said Russia had insisted  on a moratorium on the loans, refusing to accept South Korea's  offer to take repayment of the loans in kind, such as in  industrial materials.    South Korea will push for another meeting on the matter in  May, he added.    Russia proposed that South Korea grant a moratorium similar  to the one provided for under an agreement reached with the  Paris Club of 19 advanced nations in April last year.    But, Korea rejected the proposal, saying it cannot allow a  Paris-Club-type moratorium since Korea is not a Paris Club  member.    Under the agreement it made with the Paris Club, Russia must  repay half of the Paris Club nations' loans to the former Soviet  Union outstanding as of the end of 1992 by September 1993 and  the rest in five years after a two-year grace period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade </F> and industry, by unidentified NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given; from the "Interview  With Hata Cabinet Members in Charge of Economic Matters" series;  one of two interviews comprising first part of series: "All  Hata Cabinet Members Will Work To Defuse Japan-U.S. Friction";  first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] The Hata cabinet was inaugurated on 28 April. How  will it tackle economic tasks such as early enactment of the  1994 fiscal budget and the resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks? NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN has interviewed  Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, on  how he intends to carry out these pressing policies.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are there any prospects for resuming  the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks?    [Hata] The cooperative system between Japan and the United  States is important for the world economy, so all members of the  Hata cabinet will work towards resuming the stalled framework  talks. Although the Japanese Government is trying to conclude  the framework talks prior to the Naples summit, I intend to use  every contact with U.S. Government officials as an opportunity  to discuss ways to resume the stalled talks.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The United States imposes one-sided  sanctions against Japan. What do you think of this U.S. posture?    [Hata] Neither Japan nor the United States should engage in  eccentric action. Now that moves are afoot worldwide to create  the World Trade Organization (WTO), Japan should have a candid  exchange of views with the United States in order to dissuade  the latter from invoking the Super 301 provision against Japan.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you think Japan should deal  with North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons?    [Hata] Japan needs to cooperate with any decisions made by  the United Nations. Since North Korea intends to settle the  issue through dialogue, it is premature to discuss specific ways  to resolve the issue.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How are you going to promote  deregulation?    [Hata] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] is being asked to press ahead with deregulation. MITI  needs to make further efforts towards deregulation.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you see Japan's economy? When  do you anticipate Japan's economy recovery?    [Hata] Housing and certain commercial electrical goods are  showing favorable indicators, but Japan's economy is still mired  in recession. The budget has a great effect on the economy, so  I want to get a budget bill for fiscal 1994 enacted in the Diet  at the earliest possible date.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] There is growing criticism that the  bureaucracy is conspicuously controlling the policy decision  process.    [Hata] Such criticism attests to the excellence of Japanese  bureaucrats. While bureaucrats have expert knowledge,  politicians make their decisions based on broad perspective.  Politicians and political parties decide on policy matters and  take responsibility for what they decide.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you have concrete measures to  reduce Japan's trade surplus?    [Hata] Japanese private enterprises are largely responsible  for Japan's surplus trade. I doubt the administration set  certain numerical targets for reducing Japan's trade surplus.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the controversy  over the resignation of former Industrial Policy Bureau chief  Naito?    [Hata] Personnel changes are to turn the bureaucratic  mentality around and make bureaucrats carry out their duties in  a fair and neutral manner. MITI has tried to conduct personnel  changes in that manner since Naito's resignation triggered the  controversy.</p>

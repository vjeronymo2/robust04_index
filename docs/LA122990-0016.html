			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER LOSS, HARRICK GETS SOME ADVICE  </P> <P> Jim Harrick's inability to recognize, create and adjust quickly during game  situations has cost UCLA more than just last week's Iowa game. For his teams to  win crucial games with any consistency, Harrick must not only provide more  flexible and effective game plans, but, more importantly, must demonstrate the  sensitivity necessary to call for crucial adjustments at appropriate points  during the course of the game.  </P> <P> This has been Harrick's major flaw throughout his tenure at UCLA, and it's high  time he addressed it.  </P> <P> HALO JONES  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

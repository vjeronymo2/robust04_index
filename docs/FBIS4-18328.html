			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by Charles </F> Lambroschini; place and date not given: "Employment in France  Also Depends on Asia" -- first paragraph is LE FIGARO  introduction]    [Text] Alain Juppe left Paris yesterday for a tour of Asia  which is intended, he said, to make up for the "negligence"  which Paris has shown toward some countries in the region. The  foreign minister will visit Japan, India, and China. On 6  April, he will join Edouard Balladur in Beijing for a visit  which is particularly significant because it is doubly symbolic.  The prime minister's visit will take place within a few weeks  of the 30th anniversary of the restoration of diplomatic  relations between France and China by General de Gaulle.  Following the normalization jointly agreed on in January, this  visit will also confirm the end of the quarrel started by the  sales of arms to Taiwan under the Socialist governments.    [Lambroschini] You are starting a vast tour of Asia. Do you  really think that France can play a role on a theater of  operations which is so far removed from its natural sphere of  influence, namely Europe?    [Juppe] I think so. For several years, we have shown, if  not indifference, then at least a degree of negligence toward  some Asian countries. For instance, the last bilateral visit by  a foreign minister to Japan and India date back to 1987.  However, in this region, France can play a dual role. First,  it must have an increased economic presence in the most dynamic  area of the world. Employment in France also depends on Asia.  Overall, our market share in the area is around 2 percent, in  other words half that of Germany. Second, France must also play  a political role. We have had a political dialogue with China  for 30 years. I think that France can also add a dimension to  its relations with Japan which is not exclusively commercial.  Finally, it is important not to forget countries with smaller  populations but in which we have a very longstanding tradition:  I am thinking of the countries of former Indochina: Vietnam,  Laos, and Cambodia. For this last country, France has played an  essential role, in the UN framework, in the organization of  elections which, after 25 years of war, have paved the way for  peace.    [Lambroschini] You are going to participate in Edouard  Balladur's visit to China which will confirm the normalization  of relations between Paris and Beijing. Now that the dispute  created by the arms sales to Taiwan has been removed, what  positive effects can France expect from China?    [Juppe] The prime minister's visit will mainly be a  political visit which falls within the framework of the 30th  anniversary of the establishment of our diplomatic relations.  When the government was formed last year, I noted that our  relations with China were not good. We know what had cast a  shadow over them: a number of arms sales to Taiwan. My  objective was to reestablish the political relationship between  France and China, because it is in our interest to do so. The  aim was not to abandon our relations with Taiwan, but to return  to a degree of restraint which had been forgotten. We have  achieved that because, by common consent, we decided to restore  warmer relations in January. That will be demonstrated by the  prime minister's presence which, I repeat, has a primarily  political dimension. Second, we hope that our economic  relations will be developed in a whole series of sectors in  which China needs cooperation -- telecommunications,  transportation, aeronautics, urban development, energy, and so  forth.    [Lambroschini] But France's commercial lag cannot be  explained only by the Taiwan affair. Do you not think that our  businesses are more timid than the German or Italian competition?    [Juppe] The deterioration in the political situation has  played a role, but this is probably not the only explanation.  Our businesses must also be encouraged to show more dynamism.  Our trade deficit with China is 12 billion francs [Fr]. This  is therefore a challenge to us. I think that if the French  Government shows real determination, the industrialists are  capable of mobilizing. With Singapore, we have a trade surplus  of Fr2 billion. With Korea, our relations are balanced.    [Lambroschini] In 1964, France was the first Western country  to restore relations with Beijing. Why did French businesses  not profit from this advantage?    [Juppe] This advantage has been very useful. Even if  Germany is doing twice as well, we already have a market share  which is not negligible: It is at the same level as that of  Britain. And yet, since 1964, we have perhaps rested too much  on the idea that it was enough to have good political relations  for trade to follow. China has changed. It has swung into a  different system -- that of a market economy in which, aside  from a few big contracts which are the result of a largely  political choice, the decisionmaking process is much more  decentralized. We must adapt our working methods to this new  Chinese situation and encourage businesses to engage in direct  dialogue.    [Lambroschini] Is it not humiliating for France to note  that there are double standards? The United States has also  sold "offensive" weapons to Taiwan. And yet, the reprisals only  affected France.    [Juppe] I do not want to go back over that. We have opened  a new chapter, let us not go back over it. But, you know,  international relations are still based on power relationships.    [Lambroschini] Having said that, the Chinese reacted very  badly when U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher preached  to them on human rights.    [Juppe] France has absolutely no intention of turning a  blind eye to the human rights problems in China. During Mr.  Balladur's visit, we will speak clearly on this subject. When  Mr. Christopher went to China, there was obviously great  tension, but I would nonetheless like to point out that the aim  of the visit was not to find out whether or not the United  States would grant China most favored nation status. It already  has it. The aim was simply to find out whether it was going to  be called into question. Let us not have any complexes. We will  say what we have to say. But we do not need any lessons in  morality from anybody.    [Lambroschini] How do you reconcile the defense of human  rights and the preservation of economic interests?    [Juppe] This is a problem which is not specifically Chinese.  We have numerous commercial interlocutors and partners who are  not irreproachable in terms of human rights. If I started to  draw up the list, I do not know where I would stop. Our  attitude is therefore very clear. We remain loyal to our  principles, saying to our interlocutors that we are not  satisfied with the existing situation. At the same time, we are  defending France's interests.    [Lambroschini] When you say that the prime minister's visit  is primarily a political visit, what strategic impact can France  have in this region?    [Juppe] It is true that China may seem remote and that  Europe's security is our main priority. But we have reasons for  affinity with China. Our two countries are permanent members of  the Security Council. This responsibility often leads us to  compare our views and sometimes to coordinate them. Second,  France and China are nuclear powers, and sometimes have the same  kinds of concerns. A political dialogue between our countries is  therefore useful. I would like to add that we are interested in  the stability of the whole region because France is a world  power. I cannot neglect this area in which it has cultural and  historical interests. The fact that Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos  are envisaging joining ASEAN shows quite clearly that we stand  to gain from having a presence and having dialogue with China.    [Lambroschini] Do you see China as a stabilizing factor in  the region? Or do you think that this new economic power will  necessarily become a military power which could be tempted by  hegemony?    [Juppe] China is already a power. The fact that this area  is not protected from strong tensions is perfectly clear. There  are often clashes in relations between China and Japan.  Moreover, we must not disregard North Korea and the danger  which its rejection of the nonproliferation rules could present  for the region, particularly South Korea. For the time being, I  see China as a factor of stability. At all events, it must be  encouraged to move in this direction.    [Lambroschini] What do you hope that your visit to Tokyo  will achieve? A reduction in the enormous trade deficit between  Japan and France?    [Juppe] This is our main trade deficit, on the order of Fr23  billion. We must clearly not resign ourselves to this  situation. A few spectacular successes show that French  businesses can penetrate the Japanese market. And not only the  big ones or the luxury industries. There are also successes for  small- and medium-sized businesses. Through a system of  information and support for our companies, we hope to extend  this trend. I also note that, for three years, our trade  balance with Japan has been improving.    [Lambroschini] But Japan must make parallel efforts. The  authorities are doing nothing to encourage the entry of foreign  products. Do you think that you will be heeded this time?    [Juppe] I am not sure that a visit is enough to ensure that  you are heeded. But, in the future, we will also be able to use  the instruments created within the framework of the Uruguay  Round negotiations, especially the World Trade Organization  [WTO]. We must ensure that the rules of the game are more  clearly defined in a number of fundamental spheres.    [Lambroschini] Japan is agreeing to import rice because the  national harvest has been bad. But a campaign of denigration  was immediately started: "This rice tastes bad or has weevils."  The same blocking technique was formerly used against our  cheeses. How can the creation of the WTO, to take over from  GATT, persuade the Japanese to import more?    [Juppe] The Japanese tenacity is well-known. For years, the  Americans have been thrown off course by it. That is no reason  to give up. These practices are unfair, they are not in  accordance with the philosophy of GATT. We will therefore take  advantage of this new international body which contains a  procedure for the prevention and settlement of trade conflicts.  If that does not suffice, it would be useful for the European  Union [EU] to equip itself with equivalent retaliation methods.  In the international sphere, only the language of power is  understood.    [Lambroschini] But the EU has a great weakness. In reality,  Japan is facing 12 countries which are competing with each other.    [Juppe] Theoretically that is not the case, because, with  regard to international trade issues, the EU is united. But the  facts are there. Japan has political superiority: It is easier  to negotiate when you are expressing the viewpoint of just one  government than when you are expressing the viewpoint of 12  states. In addition, it must be admitted that, culturally,  Japanese society agrees to make sacrifices to protect itself.  Domestic prices are very high: This makes it possible to find  flexible export margins. Some of the Twelve are almost allergic  to regarding the EU as an entity. For many of our partners,  this Union is merely a market. For us, it must be a power. It  is a market which must have the capacity to organize and defend  itself.    [Lambroschini] Paradoxically, France and Japan are in the  same camp opposite the United States which, despite the recent  GATT agreement establishing the foundations of the WTO, is again  using the reprisals of the 301 provision against Tokyo.    [Juppe] We have vigorously condemned this practice which is  contrary to the spirit of the WTO. Even if, legally, this WTO  does not yet exist. You are aware of the battle which the  Twelve fought to improve the instruments of EU commercial policy.    The decision was made on 15 December, but experience shows  that having the documents is not enough, you also have to have  the will. However, I am not sure that it still exists among the  European officials of this sector.    [Lambroschini] In the strategic sphere, the impression is  that Japan feels more confident. Do you see this increase in  power as a stabilizing factor in Asia or, instead, as a danger?    [Juppe] I do not want to give an evasive answer, but it may  be both. It is an illusion to imagine that a country which has  this economic power can remain a political dwarf. There is a  logic in the lives of nations and states. This logic and this  desire for power must be channeled in the right direction. That  is why the political dialogue with Japan strikes me as so  important.    [Lambroschini] Do you think that Japan might one day be  tempted by the acquisition of nuclear weapons? After all, it  has neighbors who have the bomb -- China and India -- and  another, North Korea, which dreams of having it.    [Juppe] Japan has given constitutional pledges and I see no  reason to think that it is tempted to change its line.  Moreover, the aim of French diplomacy is nonproliferation. And  this is also something which we must express clearly to our  Japanese interlocutors. In Tokyo, I will explain why we have  such a firm attitude on the question of North Korea. For us,  the fact that this country has withdrawn from the  Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and that it refuses to keep its  promises to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is  unacceptable.    [Lambroschini] Are you in favor of Japan joining the  Security Council as a permanent member?    [Juppe] This is not 1945. We must take account of the new  situation in the world. We have no objections in principle to  Japan joining the Security Council, but we would add two or  three considerations. The first is that being a Security  Council member does not only give you rights. It also implies  duties and obligations. In particular, participating in  peacekeeping operations. Japan has already agreed to that with  its involvement in Cambodia. The second consideration is that  there are regional balances to be respected. If Japan and  Germany join, it is obvious that the big countries of the south,  even if they are less economically developed, also have a reason  to join.    [Lambroschini] Is political cooperation between France and  Japan limited to the nuclear problem and the United Nations?    [Juppe] Not at all. For instance, with regard to Third  World aid, I think that we need to create a synergy. France is  one of the few countries in the world to reaffirm that  development aid must remain a priority. At the last G-7 summit,  it was Japan which, with France, was the country which was most  receptive to this idea of an additional effort for Africa.    [Lambroschini] For a long time Japan has been told: Pay and  shut up. But should we not expect problems when Japan wants a  say?    [Juppe] That is precisely what I mean by political dialogue.  That consists of saying: Let us talk and pay, each according to  our abilities.    [Lambroschini] You are also going to Delhi. Do you hope to  develop relations between France and India, which are still  limited? At a time when that huge country is starting on the  path to economic liberalization, France is only India's eighth  biggest commercial partner.    [Juppe] Our relations with India are inadequate. In the  economic sphere, we have some difficult disputes which are not  encouraging our businesses. They must be settled. There is the  dispute over the construction of the HBJ [expansion unknown] gas  pipeline or the problems connected with the construction of the  Dulmasti dam in Kashmir. It is not easy to find a solution, but  we must make an active effort to do so, because we stand to gain  from developing our bilateral relations. Mr. Rao, the current  prime minister, has undertaken a policy of economic  modernization which is producing good results. The 200 or 300  million inhabitants who have already entered the consumer  society represent a very big market.    [Lambroschini] It is said that the Chinese market is  commercially more exciting but that the Indian market is less  dangerous politically.    [Juppe] In all cases you have to take risks and show  perseverance. It is true that our commercial relations with  India are balanced, whereas we have a Fr12-billion deficit with  China. Our market share in India is larger than the one we have  in China.    [Lambroschini] Like China, India is experiencing great  tensions: religious, ethnic, and social. How do you view the  dialectic between this economic growth which is taking shape and  the archaism of some of India's structures?    [Juppe] With modesty... It is not for France to try to  outline social development in such a huge and complex country  with such strong cultural traditions. Our role is to tell India  that we are ready to work with it. I think that we have  something to contribute here too. The preferential dialogue  between Moscow and Delhi is no longer what it was, because one  of the partners -- the former USSR -- has changed profoundly.  That gives us a window of opportunity which we must use.</p>

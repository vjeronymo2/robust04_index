			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Macmillan's fate known today when final bids are opened THE FATE of Macmillan, the US publisher bought by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, should be known today after the final bids for the company are opened. Price Waterhouse, administrators to the Maxwell Communication Corporation, are responsible for selling the business, which includes a 50 per cent stake in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing joint venture. Four companies were invited to submit final sealed bids by 5pm New York time yesterday. The four are Harcourt Brace Jovanovich the US publishers, K-111 the US magazine publisher, Paramount Communications and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Price Waterhouse said last night there would be no further round of bidding and that the highest bid submitted would now win. The sale is likely to be the largest of the US disposals of the former Maxwell empire and is likely to produce well in excess of Dollars 500m (Pounds 331m). Pearson, the only non-US bidder, is particularly interested in the college and school textbook business of Macmillan.</p>

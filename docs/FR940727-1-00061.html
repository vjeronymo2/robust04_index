Those amendments were the result of the first comprehensive review of the regulations since their promulgation in 1973. The purpose of the current proposed revision to the regulations is to update them to reflect developments and changes in procedures since 1991, and to include changes that were overlooked in the last revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Among the changes to part 51&hyph;2 on Committee responsibilities,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;51&hyph;2.2(b) has been amended to make clear that the Committee authorizes and deauthorizes both central nonprofit agencies and nonprofit agencies employing people who are blind or have other severe disabilities to accept orders from Government agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Committee's program. Section 51&hyph;2.3 is amended to indicate that the Committee publishes notices of proposed deletions and additions to the Procurement List and to require interested persons who submit bound comments on these proposals to also submit an unbound copy to be duplicated for staff use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 51&hyph;2.4, 51&hyph;2.7, and 51&hyph;3.2 have been amended to make them consistent with the JWOD Act, which considers a determination that a commodity or service is suitable for addition to the Procurement List and the establishment of an initial fair market price for the commodity or service to be two legally separate actions. The confusing term ``current or most recent contractor'' in &sect;51&hyph;2.4 has been changed to ``current contractor.'' An explanation of those rare instances when ``current contractor'' means ``most recent contractor'' will be addressed in the Committee's procedural memoranda. The Committee's position that the ``current contractor'' includes affiliated companies and parent corporations is explicitly stated in the amended &sect;51&hyph;2.4. A provision has been added to &sect;51&hyph;2.4 to express the Committee's position that its discretion to determine what commodities and services are suitable for addition to the Procurement List is not totally constrained by the enumerated criteria in the section. Section 51&hyph;2.7 has also been rewritten to reflect current Committee pricing practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51&hyph;2.5 has been amended to make clear that when the Committee decides that a proposed addition is likely to have a severe adverse impact on a current contractor, it will decide either to reduce the portion of the Government requirement for the commodity or service to be added to the Procurement List or will decline to add it. The Committee's standard for reconsidering a decision to add a commodity or service to the Procurement List, which appears in an internal memorandum, has been added to &sect;51&hyph;2.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51&hyph;3.3, which deals with assignment of a commodity or service to a central nonprofit agency for possible addition to the Procurement List, and &sect;&sect;51&hyph;6.4 and 51&hyph;6.12, which deal with military resale commodities and specification changes respectively, have been rewritten to clarify their language. Small editorial changes for clarity have been made in &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.2 and 51&hyph;5.2. Recordkeeping provisions in &sect;51&hyph;4.3 have been changed to permit acceptance of State certifications of disability to document individuals' disability status in accordance with recent changes in Federal disability regulations. The section title ``Violations'' used for both &sect;&sect;51&hyph;4.5 and 51&hyph;5.8 has been changed to indicate that the former applies to violations of Committee regulations by nonprofit agencies and the latter to violations by entities of the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 51&hyph;5.3, which sets forth the scope of the mandatory procurement source requirement of the JWOD Program, has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amended to indicate that the requirement applies to items that are essentially the same as commodities identified on the Pro curement List by a National Stock Number or other item designation. This change was made necessary by the increasing number of commercial items in the system which are essentially the same as Procurement List commodities. A similar change was made in &sect;51&hyph;6.13 on replacement and similar commodities. A new paragraph was added to &sect;51&hyph;5.3 to set forth the Committee's longstanding policy that Procurement List additions do not affect contracts in being before the effective date of the addition, or options exercised under those contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The minimum figure for prior Committee approval of purchase exceptions granted by central nonprofit agencies in &sect;51&hyph;5.4 has been raised from $25,000 to $100,000. The $25,000 figure was set in the 1991 revision of the Committee regulations to correspond with the Government's small purchase limitation. The new figure corresponds with the simplified acquisition threshold which is expected to replace the small purchase limitation. Sections 51&hyph;5.5 and 51&hyph;5.6 on prices and shipping of commodities have been amended to allow for pricing and delivery on an FOB destination basis, consistent with recent developments in Government ordering procedures, as well as the Committee's traditional FOB origin practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

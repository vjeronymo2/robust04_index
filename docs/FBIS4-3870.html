			<p>BFN     [Text] Toronto, 21 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou  Jiahua, who was paying a visit to Canada, toured the Darlington  Nuclear Power Plant on 21 April.    Zou Jiahua arrived in Toronto on 20 April after visiting  Vancouver. The Darlington Nuclear Power Plant was the first  stop of the tour arranged for him in Toronto. Strichter, chief  of the nuclear power plant, told Zou Jiahua that he hoped to see  Canadian built nuclear power plants equipped with heavy-water  reactors in China.    Strichter enthusiastically recommended Canada's heavy-water  reactor technology to the Chinese guests. He said: Canada's  heavy- water reactors are one of the world's recognized high  technologies. Since they use natural uranium as fuel, they not  only cost less than reactors using enriched uranium, but are  also safer. In addition, Canada uses the parallel connection  technology so that nuclear power plants will not have to stop  operation while having their old nuclear fuel pellets replaced  with new ones. Canada currently owns 22 reactors; all of them  have adopted heavy-water reactor technology.    After his tour of the Darlington Nuclear Power Plant, Zou  Jiahua was received by Ontario Province Governor Ray [name as  received]. On the afternoon of the same day, he also visited the  Spa Aircraft Company [name as received]. In the evening, the  Canadian-Chinese Trade Council held a banquet in his honor.</p>

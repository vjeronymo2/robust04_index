He said:  "Saudi banks operating in Saudi Arabia undertook an important  basic role in financing the national private sector in order  that its projects be carried out during previous development  plan periods. Total financing offered by them to borrowers  increased from about 5 billion riyals [R] during the first  five-year plan to R82 billion in May of 1992. Most of this  financing was offered to the national private sector. This  financing was in addition to the enormous financing programs  offered by the state in the form of long-term loans via special  funds."    He added: "The commercial banks, in order to attract  citizens' savings and encourage them to make investments,  created various investment funds that have met with a steadily  increasing response on the part of investors. Furthermore, the  commercial banks' methods of operation and the level of services  they offer to the public have become more advanced in order to  keep up with international progress in this field. All this is  in addition to the volume of financing offered by these banks  and the creation of new instruments to attract citizens'  savings. These banks have benefited from modern banking  technology and the introduction of automated teller machines,  permitting them to offer basic banking services to customers  both during the regular bank hours and when the banks are  closed."    Al-Sayyari went on to say: "The commercial banks benefit  from  the Saudi payments network established by SAMA. By means of this  network, customers can use the automated teller machines of  other banks. Also, in order to develop the Saudi financial  market and improve the procedures for the circulation of shares,  SAMA has implemented a plan that links the banks' central  circulation units to the central computer of SAMA itself, where  these units receive all the offers, orders, and information  relevant to the circulation of shares. In addition to all of  this, SAMA and the banks are participating in the international  electronic communications network that links more than 2,600  banks and international financial establishments to each other."    When referring to the banking sector, he said: "Historically  it has been one of the oldest sectors that has played an  important role in the development of the economies of Saudi  Arabia and the Gulf nations. This sector has been subjected to a  degree of supervision and control, but this has been necessary  because the banking operations have expanded and branched out.  This was the reason for the decision by the minister of finance  and national economy, on 16 Safar 1402 A.H. [1981], to regulate  the banking profession, and this task was entrusted to SAMA. A  whole division of SAMA undertakes the supervision and regulation  of the banking operations."    The subject of the Saudi banks was brought up in a Saudi  Economics Association conference held in Riyadh, which dealt  with the topic of the challenges faced by the banking sector in  Saudi Arabia. One person who spoke at the conference was  Sulayman al-Mandil, general manager of the Riyadh Bank, and he  presented a brief history of Saudi banking since its beginnings  in 1926.    "Actually the history of Saudi banking goes back to the year  1345 A.H. (15 November 1926), when the Dutch Commercial Company  opened a branch in Jeddah for the purpose of exchanging  currencies carried by pilgrims from Indonesia, which at that  time was under Dutch colonial rule. After that, a branch of the  Indochina Bank was also opened in Jeddah on 18 Jumada I 1367  A.H. (March of 1949), then a branch of the British Middle East  Bank opened in Jeddah in the month of Rajab in 1370 A.H. (22  April 1950), as well as a branch of the Pakistani National Bank  in the month of Ramadan in 1370. Also, in the early fifties, a  quasi-banking corporation and some bankers [started operations].  These were the beginnings of the Saudi banking sector, which by  now has become a giant."    Al-Mandil said: "The Saudi banking sector, including both  its  domestic and foreign operations, was not able, during the oil  boom period of the seventies, to meet the demands of development  in Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries. This provided a great  incentive for the emergence of the off-shore banks, among which  a great many were established in Bahrain." After referring to  the period all during the seventies when foreign banks such as  the Dutch, French, British, Arab National, and Cairo banks  flourished, he said: "The process of Saudiization of the capital  of these banks began, and this was the source of a great  incentive for them to begin important steps of development.  Consequently, there began the processes of modernization of  methods of administration and the utilization of modern  technology. When the seventies came to an end, the Saudi banking  sector had already become strong and profitable, in spite of the  fact that international establishments continued to participate,  to a considerable degree, in the financing of the development  projects."    After having dealt with the period of the eighties, the  stumbling debt crisis due to clients' inability to honor their  obligations, and the fact that Saudi banks were able to  successfully overcome this crisis due to their high degree of  solvency at that time, al-Mandil went on to say: "The present  situation of the Saudi banks is good, and the banking sector as  a whole possesses clear elements of strength, which are the  following:    "1. A high degree of financial solvency. The assets of these  banks have increased from R5.86 billion in 1973 to R318 billion  in 1993 (about $84.2 billion), and this is twenty times what the  banks had twenty years ago. Also, shareholder equities have  increased from R243 million in 1973 to R30.2 billion in 1993. It  has been shown that [a bank's] degree of solvency, according to  criteria set by the World Bank, should be not less than 8  percent of its total assets as shareholder equities. The  solvency of Saudi banks as a whole during 1992 was 13 percent,  and this is higher than the solvency of banks in Japan (9  percent), Britain (10.6 percent), and France (8.8 percent).  Total assets of the Saudi banking sector amounted to R318  billion.    "2. Diversification of the Saudi banking sector. It includes  all of the national banks and joint banks. This is a source of  strength since it is a source of enrichment and diversification  for banking operations.    "3. The dynamic nature and capability of the Saudi private  sector has constituted an element of strength for the Saudi  banking sector.    "4. The fourth element of strength of the Saudi banking  sector is the existence of SAMA, because in its work it has gone  beyond the traditional role of central banks in the world today  as a high bank commissioner in case of crises, and it has taken  on the job of developing the Saudi banking sector and impelling  it to utilize the world's most modern banking methods."    The general manager of the Riyadh Bank went on to say:  "Saudi  banks face several challenges, such as the acquisition of  technological development, the development of the Saudi banking  sector, the improvement of conditions of the work force, and  expansion of loan activities." He then pointed out: "Saudi banks  are in the process of facing these challenges concerning the  acquisition of technology or development of the Saudi private  economic sector. As far as the work force is concerned, there  are requirements for them to be trained and to improve their  qualifications. These banks currently have 25,600 employees, 55  percent of whom are Saudis. Total Saudiization will require a  few more years, since it is proceeding at a rate of 5 percent  per year, and the Saudiization of the jobs has to proceed  gradually in view of the specialized positions that are occupied  by foreign employees.    "The last challenge is that of loans, and this is something  that the Saudi banks can increase. The volume of loans as  compared with the banks' total assets at the present time is  R104 billion out of a total of R318 billion, that is, they  constitute 33 percent of these assets. This is an indication of  the fact that loans can be increased."    The Basel Committee has classified Saudi banks as being in  the same category as those of the advanced industrial nations.  In spite of this fact, most of the Saudi banks have increased  their capital. The solvency and sufficiency of their capital  have reached a percentage higher than that set by the Basel  Committee. Al-Sayyari said: "The percentage of sufficiency of  the capital of the Saudi banks, by the end of April of 1992, and  according to the Basel Committee's criteria for "probable  dangers," totalled 9.6 percent, as compared with the figure of 8  percent, which is required by the committee."    The fact is that Saudi banks are a reflection of the Saudi  economy itself in terms of its stability and ability to achieve  development when faced by crises. In this regard, the newspaper  IRISH TIMES says that Saudi Arabia has followed the policy of a  free market economy, diversified production and the sources  thereof, encouraged industrial and agricultural development in  the private sector, developed its work force personnel,  increased economic cooperation on all levels, and utilized its  wealth and revenues in development programs on the national  level in order to hasten the rates of growth in the industrial  and agricultural sectors after having provided them with the  appropriate infrastructural support.</p>

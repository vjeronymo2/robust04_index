			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Charterhouse to launch smaller companies trust CHARTERHOUSE Tilney, the stockbroker, is attempting to launch a new investment trust which will specialise in smaller companies, writes Philip Coggan. The trust will concentrate on the smallest quoted stocks, the 1,000 or so with market capitalisations of less than Pounds 30m. Smaller company shares are widely expected to enjoy a revival after four successive years of underperforming larger stocks. Issue details have not been settled but the trust will have a fixed life and warrants in an attempt to limit the perennial problem of investment trust new issues - that the shares fall to a discount to net asset value. The launch is expected to take the form of an offer for subscription in February. The chairman of the trust will be Sir Peter Michael, who also chairs Cray Electronic Holdings. The fund manager is expected to be Rutherford Asset Management.</p>

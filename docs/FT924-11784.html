			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Outsider on the inside - John Gapper and Bethan Hutton profile a hard-fighting bank regulator MR BRIAN QUINN, executive director for banking supervision at the Bank of England, is accustomed to struggle. But his brush with Bank of Credit and Commerce International has propelled him into the hardest fight of his career. Mr Quinn took the decision to shut down BCCI, and it was he who chose not to do so earlier. Were it not for his conviction that he acted correctly, he would probably have resigned yesterday. Though he remains in place, the investigations unit announced yesterday removes primary responsibility for the investigation of fraud from his department. Silver-haired Mr Quinn, the son of a Glasgow shipyard worker, has none of the arrogance that might be expected from one in his position: his manner is friendly and affable. Yet visitors to his office are struck by his alert, slightly tense air as he pores over papers or discusses a bank. Bankers speak with one voice about Mr Quinn. All of them smile first, with affection and amusement. 'Tough,' says one; 'A real Glasgow street fighter,' says another. Doubts emerge only after a discreet pause. 'Does he have quite the stature?' one finally asks. If stature means the assumption of natural privilege from an early age, the answer is no. Mr Quinn penetrated the inner circle of the English establishment from outside. He managed it because of two character traits. One is a combination of meritocratic qualities: intelligence, hard work, clarity and energy. 'He is very, very cautious,' says Mr Rattan Bhatia, a friend from the International Monetary Fund. 'Cautious and far-sighted. Where you and I look at four sides of a problem, he finds a fifth one.' The second facet is a strong sense of probity. Mr Quinn is a practising Roman Catholic, though he has questioned aspects of church doctrine. He has the Catholic's faith that wrong-doing should be punished and virtue rewarded  -and that both will happen. It is this combination that has led Mr Quinn to remain in his job. Friends attest that since the BCCI scandal broke and he could speak about it, he has never wavered from believing that his actions were right. Mr Quinn moved on from his Scots working-class roots when he took a degree in economics at Glasgow University, then a masters degree at Manchester and finally a doctorate at Cornell University. He moved to the International Monetary Fund's Africa department as an economist in 1964, and with his teacher wife Mary spent two years on secondment in Sierra Leone. They returned to London in 1970, when he joined the Bank's economic division. After a seamless rise through the Bank, he became the head of banking supervision in 1982. It was a rough time to start. Just as he was starting to settle down, the Johnson Matthey Bankers storm broke. Mr Quinn survived the subsequent outcry, and moved in 1988 to his current role. The job is a curious mixture of elevated intellectual analysis and hard-nosed practicality. His responsibilities include everything from planning the future framework of international supervision to tackling senior managers of domestic banks about ill-advised policy. The pity of BCCI for Mr Quinn is that he finally collided with a bank that proved too tough and deceitful for him to fight.</p>

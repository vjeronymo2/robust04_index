			<p>BFN     [Text] Japan has pledged $200 million to the Palestinian  autonomy, which may be extended. This was announced this  morning by Japan's Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa after meeting  Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni in East Jerusalem.  Earlier, he met with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Tel Aviv.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent No'omi Segal] Japan has  committed $200 million to the Palestinian autonomy, to be spread  over the coming two years. Fifty million dollars have already  been dispersed. The money was used to buy medical equipment for  the Jericho hospital, to pay for the construction of Palestinian  police facilities, and other development projects. The Japanese  have also invited 70 Palestinians for training in the use of  construction machinery.    Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa announced the aid  package after meeting with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Tel  Aviv. He praised Rabin on the peace process, noting that he had  been in Cairo for the signing ceremony.    Afterwards, Koji Kakizawa held talks in East Jerusalem with  Palestinian leader Faysal al-Husayni. Emerging from the  meeting, the Japanese foreign minister said he hoped the aid  package would be extended and congratulated Israel and the PLO  on signing the autonomy accord.    [Kakizawa] I am very pleased to be here at this historical  moment. There are still critical issues on both sides -- on the  Palestinian side and the Israeli side -- but we hope that your  goodwill and your determination to get peace will solve many,  many difficulties, and we hope that you will go forward for  stability and peace in this region.    [Segal] Kakizawa continued on to Jericho, becoming the first  foreign dignitary to visit since the signing. He will then  cross into Jordan via the Allenby bridge and later visit Syria.

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> O'MEARA STANDS ALONE AT FINISH OF SHOOTOUT  </P> <P> Two and a half weeks ago, Escondido's Mark O'Meara lofted a 93-yard third shot  with his sand wedge that ended 10 feet above the 72nd hole, made the putt for a  birdie and won the $180,000 first prize at the AT&amp;T National Pro-Am at  Pebble Beach.  </P> <P> Tuesday afternoon at Torrey Pines, O'Meara lofted an 88-yard third shot with  his sand wedge that ended 10 feet below the last hole, made the putt for a  birdie and won $3,000 and first place in the 10-man Shearson Lehman Hutton  Shootout on the South Course.  </P> <P> "I was actually just as nervous over this one as I was at Pebble Beach,"  O'Meara said afterward.  </P> <P> Sure you were, Mark. And Mac O'Grady rooms on the road with PGA Commissioner  Deane Beman.  </P> <P> The colorful O'Grady was one of nine other touring pros that O'Meara outlasted  in the popular nine-hole shootout format, which eliminates one player on each  hole until two remain with a hole to play.  </P> <P> Long-hitting Joey Sindelar parred the last hole to finish second. Mark Wiebe,  raised in Escondido, finished third. The shootout serves as a warmup of sorts  for the Shearson Lehman Hutton Open, which begins Thursday on Torrey Lines  North and South. The final 36 holes, scheduled for the weekend, will be played  on the tougher South course.  </P> <P> O'Grady, who finished second in last year's shootout at Torrey Pines while  playing left-handed, bowed out on the fourth hole with a double bogey after a  poor pitch. He played right-handed Tuesday.  </P> <P> Fred Couples birdied three of the first four holes but said bye-bye when he  three-putted the par-four fifth. Defending tournament champion Steve Pate lost  a chip-off to Jay Haas on the sixth.  </P> <P> O'Meara, 32, is fourth on the tour money list after six events this year with  earnings of $194,500.  </P> <P> The long driving competition was a misnomer of sorts. Ten players launched two  tee shots apiece on the first hole on the South course. The winner of the event  was Bill Sander at 278 yards.  </P> <P> To be sure, that's a long drive. But not by the standards of the PGA tour  professionals. Andy Bean, the longest driver on tour in 1985, averaged 278  yards off the tee that year.  </P> <P> The second-place finisher Tuesday was Davis Love III at 265. Sander won $3,500  for his effort.  </P> <P> The reason for the relatively short drives was a lively breeze blowing into the  players' faces and wet ground that kept the balls from rolling more than a few  yards.  </P> <P> The winner of the celebrity competition was former Charger tight end Eric  Sievers (235 yards). Sievers' winning drive was 27 yards farther than the  last-place drive of pro Duffy Waldorf. Waldorf snap-hooked both his attempts.  </P> <P> The glamour pairing for today's pro-am will tee off on No. 1 on the North  Course. The group: former President Gerald Ford, entertainer Bob Hope, Charger  owner Alex Spanos and businessman Leon Parma. The pro: Craig Stadler. Starting  time: 10:40.  </P> <P> But perhaps the most interesting group is the one that will tee off on No. 10  on the South course at 7:45. The pro is Tom Sieckmann. The celebrity is Steve  Ortmayer, the Chargers' director of football operations.  </P> <P> But the hero in the group is Glenn Ankton, 40, of Oceanside. Both of Ankton's  legs were blown off just above the knee by a land mine in Vietnam in 1968. He  plays with prosthetic devices on both legs and regularly shoots in the low 70s.  </P> <P> For a long time, one of his goals has been to play in a pro-am. When people  around Oceanside heard about it, they raised the $2,250 it costs to play as an  amateur in the event. Maybe next year, tournament officials will invite him  back as a celebrity so he can play for free.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Thursday through Sunday, tournament sponsor Shearson Lehman Hutton will present  a zero coupon Treasury certificate (worth $10,000 at maturity) to a spectator.  The spectator must donate the certificate to a charity. The spectator will also  be treated to a free round of golf with a PGA touring pro. Shearson Lehman  Hutton will also present a zero coupon certificate (worth $50,000 at maturity)  to the low pro Thursday through Friday. In the event of a tie, the coupon value  will be carried over to the next day. . . . Other celebrities scheduled to  participate in today's pro-am include Dan Fouts, Hal Linden, Wayne Rogers,  Claude Akins, John Havlicek, Johnny Bench, Gene Barry and Steve Garvey.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station editor (Yi Qing) commentary: "Direct Three </F> Exchanges Inevitable if Mainland and Taiwan Join GATT"; from the  "News and Current Events" program]    [Text] If the mainland and Taiwan join the GATT, there will  be a positive effect for realizing the three exchanges  [exchanges of mail, trade, and air and shipping services].  GATT's regulations forbid member nations and regions from  obstructing trade exchanges with each other, and it will also be  impossible to erect trade barriers even if they want to do so  because doing so constitutes a violation of GATT's regulations.    At present, opinions in Taiwan vary regarding the adoption  of  measures to cope with the cross-strait relationship following  the accession to GATT. At a meeting of senior party and  government officials in early March, Li Denghui [Li Teng-hui)  noted that Taiwan is feeling great pressure to effect early  direct exchanges with the mainland as the time for Taiwan's  joining GATT draws closer and also keeping in mind the  requirements for transforming Taiwan into a trading center in  Asia and the Pacific. He, however, pointed out the need for the  government to develop the cross-strait relationship by adhering  to the principles and process of the state reunification plan  and for applying the exclusion clause so that it will be  impossible for Communist China to find fault with Taiwan's  commitment to GATT.    Taiwan's commercial and industrial circles, media, and some  legislators have long questioned the adherence to the principles  and process of the state reunification plan in developing  cross-strait relations; they suggested revising the plan to  realize direct trade, shipping and air services, and mail  between the two sides of the strait at an early date. At  interpellation sessions, many legislators asked: If there are  no direct shipping and air links between the two sides, and if  there is no direct free flow of goods between the two sides,  then how can Taiwan put GATT's spirit of free trade into  practice following the accession to GATT? Therefore, they  called on the authorities to be pragmatic in dealing with  cross-strait economic and trade exchanges and to not be bound by  the inflexible state reunification plan.    To realize the three exchanges, they also called on the  mainland and Taiwan to recognize each other as political  entities.    Taiwan's Board of Foreign Trade said that by citing the  exclusion clause, Taiwan businessmen may trade directly with the  mainland and invest in the mainland. Xiao Wanchang [Vincent  Siew], chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and  Development, said that in dealing with the mainland, Taiwan may  not have to resort to the exclusion clause and added that  Taiwan's response is contingent upon how the communists play the  card.    Gao Konglian [Kao Kung-lien], vice chairman of the Mainland  Affairs Council, recently said that if the cross-strait  relationship has entered the medium-term stage as stipulated in  the state reunification plan following the accession to GATT,  then the three exchanges between the two sides of the strait  will of course have no problems. But he also stressed that  there is no absolute relationship between Taiwan and the  mainland joining GATT and the entering of the medium-term stage  of the cross-strait relationship. In pointing out his ambiguous  remarks, Taiwan's media said that Gao Konglian has further  complicated the issue.    Because of pressures from various sides, the Taiwan  authorities still have not adopted a clear-cut attitude in  dealing with the cross-strait relationship following the  accession to GATT. Because the aim of joining GATT is to  converge with the international economy and to pursue the  greatest economic benefits, more and more people on the island  are beginning to question the inflexible state reunification  plan. Following its accession to GATT, Taiwan will have to  address the issue of the three direct exchanges.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Brazil bank in revolt over rate cut BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco is facing a central bank rebellion over his plan to reduce interest rates, the main feature of his economic package announced last weekend. Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, the bank's governor, is said by associates to be considering resigning in protest at Mr Franco's announcement, made with no prior consultation, of an interest rate cut to stimulate growth. Cancelling a planned visit to Washington where he was due to participate in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Mr Ximenes and his team have spent all week fending off presidential pressure for a cut in interest rates, up till now the government's principal weapon against inflation. Central bank officials argue that real interest rates have already fallen from last year's average 35 per cent to 27 per cent this year. Mr Francisco Amadeu, director of monetary policy, insists that rates must remain positive. However, Mr Franco has sought to cast the financial sector as the main villains in the fight against inflation and is accusing the central bank of collaborating with the traders. The uncertainty caused by the conflicting statements emerging from different parts of the government is provoking enormous volatility on financial markets, with interest rates fluctuating wildly and a flight to gold and dollars. Through the Brazilian press Mr Franco yesterday issued a stern warning to the central bank board to co-operate. 'A high interest rate policy will not survive in my government,' the Jornal do Brasil reported him as saying, adding that he said he would dismiss the directors unless they obeyed. 'These people think I'm stupid but I'm watching them and I know that the rates are not coming down,' he said. Ironically on Monday Mr Franco said he favoured an independent central bank.</p>

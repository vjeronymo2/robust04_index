			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The third condition is that generators taking advantage of the exclusion would be required to maintain a written certification indicating the disposal or recycling location for the lamps. The proposed certification, to be signed by the generator or its authorized representative, would state that on a specified date a specified amount of lamps was consigned to a specified transporter for disposal or recycling at a specified facility. This certification would be required for each shipment of lamps and would be maintained by the generator for three years from the date of shipment. The Agency is proposing this documentation as a mechanism for verifying that the conditions of the exclusion have been met. Failure to maintain the required documentation would disqualify the generator from eligibility for the exclusion. The existence of the certification, however, would not protect a generator from an enforcement action if the lamps were not actually disposed of or recycled in accordance with the conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is proposing that separate documentation be required for each shipment based on its belief that most lamp generation is sporadic (every three to four years), as opposed to on-going generation which would lead to a continuous relationship with the same disposal or recycling facility. Given that the life span of mercury-containing lamps is approximately three to four years, businesses that participate in mass relampings would only dispose of their lamps every few years. Under the current hazardous waste regulations, many of these businesses would be subject to hazardous waste regulation because mass relamping could cause them to exceed the conditionally-exempt small quantity generator level (approximately 350 four foot lamps, if lamps are the only hazardous waste generated). However, small businesses and other facilities that generate just under the CESQG limit of hazardous waste (100 kg per month) may exceed this limit with attrition relamping. For these generators, this recordkeeping requirement could be more burdensome. The Agency requests comments on whether there are alternative mechanisms that can be used by generators to demonstrate compliance with the conditions of the exclusion. The Agency also requests comment on whether, if the Agency determines that documentation is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the conditions, the form and frequency of documentation proposed are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to requesting comment on the conditions of the exclusion, the Agency requests comment on having a 3 to 5 year sunset provision on the exclusion. A sunset provision would require the Agency to re-evaluate the exclusion after a period of three to five years, to determine whether an exclusion is indeed appropriate for lamps given any unanticipated management or risk issues that develop as a result of the exclusion. The Agency would then determine whether to extend the exclusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

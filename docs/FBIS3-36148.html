Waiting for a Flop"]    [Text] Viktor Chernomyrdin, who was expected to address  the Federation Council on Monday, indicated at yesterday's press  conference that he is only going to address the parliamentarians  after Boris Yeltsin has spoken in the Federal Assembly. The  president is expected to attend the joint session of the  chambers on 18 February. Relations between the president and  the premier are analyzed by KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Maksim  Sokolov:    The president's desire to distance himself from the prime  minister's new economic course would have been surprising only  if the talk about "humanization," "easing," and so forth of  reforms corresponded to reality. If an "era of humanism" does  arrive, Yeltsin's saying "It wasn't me who did it," would truly  sound absurd -- who would voluntarily refuse to accept the title  of a good ruler? But it is far simpler and more logical to  suppose that far from being made humane, the economic policy is  being made only different -- because gaining the upper hand at  the present moment, to use the language of Marxism, is the  detachment of the monopoly bourgeoisie (the raw material lobby)  that is oriented to inflation.    The politician cannot obviously ignore the present  correlation of forces in the detachments of the monopoly  bourgeoisie -- hence the presidential ratification of the new  Chernomyrdin cabinet. He cannot, however, ignore the fact that  the new economic policy has no way of being more popular than  the previous one. The novel by Melnikov-Pecherskiy "On the  Hills" has one fish merchant reproaching another for dumping:  "Think about your neighbors." The rejoinder is: "Our  neighbors are not all fish merchants." Realizing that our  neighbors are not all directors, it would be strange to gamble  on what remains of presidential prestige in a bid just to wet  the appetites of that lobby. It is more advantageous by far to  preserve those remnants and to demonstrate publicly his absolute  readiness to dump Chernomyrdin at the first opportunity.    In this sense, Yeltsin, Gaydar, Zhirinovskiy, and Yavlinskiy  -- otherwise dissimilar in all respects -- are related by their  rational or instinctive realization of the fact that given the  rather weak Russian finances, the resource for jacking up  inflation is very small, and the short-lived and small initial  pleasure (if it comes at all) would rapidly deteriorate into the  hard and prolonged Ukrainian morning after. Instead of having  to suffer through no fault of your own, it is much wiser to step  aside, later to reappear in spotless snow-white garb. Such a  unanimous desire to let the agrarian-industrial gargantuans get  roaring drunk has been dictated by the realization that a flop  is inevitable, by the realization of the inability to stave it  off, or by the desire at least to turn it to one's own political  advantage.    The situation would have been trivial, and Chernomyrdin's  prospects totally hopeless, had the premier not realized how  eagerly everyone is awaiting his looming debacle. In order to  frustrate everyone's expectations of such a thing, a politician  during his brief time at bat should try to make the situation  irreversible. Either economically -- like Gaydar did in letting  prices go, thinking that you cannot make them come back with a  stick. Or politically -- like Premier Pavlov, who in summer  1991 sought for himself dictatorial powers that would, if  realized, have shriveled President Gorbachev into a purely  decorative figure. Striving for this irreversibility, it would  be logical for Chernomyrdin to increase the scope of his powers  sharply, pulling into his orbit of influence the "power  ministers" so far subordinated to the president on the one hand,  and on the other, to get the economy solidly on the needle of  inflation injections. Correspondingly, Yeltsin's logic is to  retain the "power men" at any price, and pray to God that  hangover from the issuance of credits comes as soon as possible.</p>

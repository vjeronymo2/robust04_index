			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a small fire today at the Oskarshamn  nuclear power plant when a cable in the turbine house of Reactor  3 caught fire. The actual reactor was not affected by the fire,  which has now been extinguished. The management of the nuclear  power plant expects that Reactor 3 will return to full capacity  later today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Is it possible to work for the future under the  economic crisis and not to be afraid of bankrupcy? A positive  answer to this question was given by Ukan Atabayev, president of  Karatau, the republic's largest holding company, to [Kazakh  President] Nazarbayev who paid a working visit to Zhambyl Oblast  yesterday and today. The head of the republic was greatly  interested in products manufactured by the joint  Kazakhstani-Israeli venture set up at the Khimprom production  amalgamation, namely corrugated and smooth-surfaced pipes made  from polypropylene. Nazarbayev expressed his satisfaction with  the hard work of the Zhambyl chemistry workers. In a difficult  situation they did not begin to complain and pin hopes on the  government to tackle all their problems. Their products are of  high quality, competitive, and highly profitable.    The head of state had a lively and interesting conversation  with workers who felt very much at ease with him. First of all,  they talked about strengthenning ties of friendship between  representatives of various nationalities. Unfortunately, this  friendship has been lost in a number of the former USSR  republics. Traditionally good interethnic relations are  maintained in Kazakhstan, but it does not mean that one can sit  back and allow such an important issue to be developed on its  own.    They also discussed dual citizenship. The president said:  "My opinion in this case is very unequivocal. Let the people  themselves freely choose which country they want to live in, and  then that country must give them citizenship quickly and without  any obstacles. This would be better than having two passports  and being indecisive for all of one's life where to reside."    The president also had a warm meeting with orphaned  children from the Ulan orphanage in Zhambyl. Children told him  about their life and performed a concert.    Nursultan Nazarbayev left for Kyrgyzstan today.</p>

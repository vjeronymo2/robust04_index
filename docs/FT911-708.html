			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: Saffa bids for box-board supremacy - The plans of Italy's Bonomi family AFTER an absence of some years, the name of Bonomi, one of northern Italy's leading business families, has been edging back into the headlines after a string of deals by Saffa, the quoted packaging group 52 per cent owned by Mr Carlo Bonomi. Does this signal the first signs of a comeback by what was once a household name in Italian business circles? 'Definitely not,' says Mr Bonomi. But while denying that Saffa is the vehicle for his return to the mainstream of Italian business, he makes no secret of the fact that he would like the group, already Europe's third biggest producer of box-board, to expand much further. It is the concentration on box-board, the material from which cigarette packets and much of the packaging for food products is made, that lay behind last February's complex deal between Milan-based Saffa and Torras Hostench, the Spanish industrial holding group controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office. In one of the biggest asset swaps in Spanish industrial history, the two companies exchanged a variety of paper-industry interests, giving Torras Hostench control of the Spanish paper market as a result. In return for the speciality papers business of Sarrio, the Spanish paper maker of which Saffa had only just gained control, Mr Bonomi's company received 4 per cent of Ebro, the sugar and foods division of Torras Hostench, 9.9 per cent of Torras Papel, its paper division, 6 per cent of Prima Immobiliaria, Spain's richest property group, a large box-board production plant and Pta10bn (Dollars 94.33m) in cash. The move surprised analysts, who had followed with approval Saffa's step-by-step courtship of Sarrio, one of Spain's biggest paper groups, which had led to majority control last December. The decision to part company triggered particular surprise as Saffa had only recently merged its own speciality paper interests - which form its second main line of business after box-board - with those of the Spanish company, which had assumed overall control of the sector. Mr Bonomi says he understands the market's astonishment. But he rejects speculation that the disposal of the special papers business, coming so soon after Saffa gained control of Sarrio, was a purely opportunistic step in response to an unusually generous offer from the Kuwaitis. Rather, the decision reflected Saffa's policy of concentrating on box-board following the collapse of much wider plans with Feldmuhle Nobel, the German paper group which also had a stake in Sarrio, to set up two joint ventures covering special papers and box-board. Under the strategy worked out between Saffa and Feldmuhle, the Germans would have taken management control of the two companies' pooled interests in special papers, while Saffa would have been responsible for their joint box-board activities. However, the plan was abandoned when Stora, the Swedish paper group, acquired Feldmuhle. Left on its own, Saffa lacked the resources for the heavy capital investments necessary to keep ahead in both businesses, leading to the decision to shed special papers business, Mr Bonomi explains. By providing an additional plant, the Spanish deal has already allowed Saffa to consolidate its position. Although Saffa, including associated companies, only produces around 740,000 tonnes a year, Mr Bonomi highlights the fact that it is the second biggest user in Europe, after Mayr-Melnhof of Austria, of an extremely high proportion of recycled paper. Some 99 per cent of Saffa's output is based on recycled products, he notes. That has become increasingly important as a marketing tool, especially with big consumer goods producers, which have grown increasingly sensitive to environmental concerns in recent years. Mr Bonomi does not expect Saffa to make any further big acquisitions on the box-board side, following the Spanish realignment. However, further small purchases in some southern European markets are not to be ruled out, he hints. Meanwhile, the company will push ahead with its strategy of expanding beyond box-board into value-added services like converting, the business - traditionally done by specialists - of cutting and printing raw box-board to a customer's specifications. Packaging machinery is another area for future growth, particularly as medium-sized Italian engineering companies, many clustered around Bologna, are among the world's leaders in the field. Saffa has already made a number of acquisitions. However, equipment manufacturing still accounts for only about L100bn of the group's sales of L1,050bn (Dollars 818m) last year, with speciality papers making up L400bn and box-board around L500bn. The disposal of the specialist papers business means those figures will change sharply this year, notes Mr Bonomi. The workforce has already shrunk to about 2,700. In 1989, the group made L40.3bn after tax. Figures for 1990 will not be released until May. Meanwhile, Saffa is also aiming to work its property interests harder thanks to the opening provided by the Sarrio deal into the Spanish property market. Mr Bonomi aims to combine the group's Italian and Spanish property activities, which include one of the biggest vineyards in Sardinia, into a new subsidiary, which will supervise growth in the property field. That in itself would mark something of a return to first principles for the Bonomi family, much of whose wealth has been based on Italian property interests.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IT'S JUST 'BUSINESS' TO ROXANNE  </P> <P> Roxanne Pulitzer, who parlayed her lurid 1982 divorce into a career as a  novelist, apparently has landed in the middle of another breakup.  </P> <P> This time, she has been accused of cavorting with a 27-year-old race car driver  who two weeks ago filed for divorce from his wife of five years, the Palm Beach  Post reported Wednesday.  </P> <P> Pulitzer, 39, and the French-born driver, Jean de la Moussaye, who traces his  lineage back to Louis XIV and calls himself "Count," won't say whether they had  an affair. But they have made a business relationship public.  </P> <P> De la Moussaye advertised Pulitzer's new novel, "Twins," on the front of his  car last month in the Tampa Grand Prix. She promoted him on radio and  television.  </P> <P> "Business indeed," said De la Moussaye's wife, Francine. "Monkey business."  </P></p>

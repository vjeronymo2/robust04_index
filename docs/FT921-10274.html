			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Mandela to reconsider nationalisation MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, said yesterday the organisation would reconsider its policy of nationalisation because of opposition from potential investors. 'Nationalisation is our policy,' Mr Mandela told businessmen during a visit to Denmark, 'but there is a shift in our thinking. We have observed the hostility and concern of businessmen towards nationalisation, and we can't ignore their perceptions,' he said. 'If we want to create a climate where investors will not fear losing their investments, their dividends, we have to take a decision on the question of nationalisation.' Mr Mandela for months has insisted that the ANC is not 'wedded' to the idea of nationalisation, but has threatened that the movement would resort to nationalisation unless businessmen came up with an alternative which would improve distribution of income and wealth in South Africa. He repeated this demand only four days ago and is likely to revert to threats of nationalisation if it is not met. The ANC leader's latest moderate line contradicts views of hardline members within the organisation, some of whom are very influential. His speech last weekend to the World Economic Forum in Davos had originally included a section obviously prepared by hardliners, in which he promised nationalisation of key enterprises as 'a major step towards overcoming the huge inequality in the ownership of our country's wealth' and accused South African business of illegally transferring huge sums abroad. Mr Mandela dropped these sections. A further sign of dissent came on Wednesday when the ANC repeated its threat to renege on foreign loans made to the current government, contradicting assurances made by Mr Mandela at Davos. Yesterday he said he had been struck by the concern over the ANC's nationalisation stand expressed by the 2,000 businessmen present at Davos. He had also been told that whereas countries emerging from war had previously been able to nationalise to provide jobs and stimulate economic growth, this was no longer feasible in a world of inter-linked economies.</p>

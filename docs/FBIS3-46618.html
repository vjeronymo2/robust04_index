Moored in front of the Royal Palace and less than 50 metres  from the National Assembly, its presence was perceived as  cultural insensitivity and arrogance. Its ability to lift  anchor and steam out of town if things got a little hot also  implied a grab and run mentality that many Cambodians say is  typical of Thai investment in their country.    The hotel, on government orders, has since taken up a new,  less offensive birth further up the Tonle Sap river but much  resentment still remains in Cambodia over Thai businessmen and  their activities. A dispute over fees charged for stalls at the  central Olympic market, redeveloped by a Thai company, continues  to simmer and in recent weeks Khmer language papers have renewed  their attacks on Thai investment.    Like Thailand's military leaders, Thai businessmen, who  could  have served to lay foundations for better relations between the  two countries have instead only caused greater distrust. And in  many cases it has been nothing more than naked greed for which  in many cases they are starting to pay.    During the more than two decades that Cambodia was engulfed  in war and revolution, Thailand prospered and emerged as a  regional economic power. Cambodia's reopening to the world came  as Thai businessmen were beginning to assume a relatively new  role as foreign investors. With the signing of the Paris Peace  accords in 1989, Cambodia was hailed as a golden opportunity and  Thai speculators and businessmen rushed in.    Poor, undeveloped, closed off to the world for decades and  soon to host the cash-rich UN peace mission -- the thinking was  get in now or miss the chance forever. Two years later,  however, Cambodia has become more like a business nightmare.    The new government is indicating it will redraft concessions  awarded to some of the biggest Thai investors in aviation,  tourism and telecommunications and a sober reevaluation of the  country suggests the rewards from doing business there are going  to be small and slow in coming.    In the meantime, Thailand's international reputation has  been  dragged through the mud. Thai loggers and gem concessionaires  became the focus of an international campaign to have their  operations halted because of the environmental havoc they were  wreaking. The perception that they were the main financial  supporters of the Khmer Rouge also did little to help Thailand's  assertions that it deserved credit as one of the main forces  behind the peace process. In Phnom Penh, Thai businessmen, in  particular bar and massage owners were singled out as the worst  of the carpet baggers who descended on Cambodia in search of  quick profits from the UN mission.    In a pure business sense, the most essential mistake made by  Thai businessmen was to back the wrong horse. Practising  business much as they have at home, Thai businessmen invested  heavily in building up contacts with the despised former Phnom  Penh based government of Hun Sen.    The shock election win by the royalist Funcinpec [National  United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and  Cooperative Cambodia] party left many Thai businessmen holding  dubious and potentially worthless contracts.    Thai businessmen in Phnom Penh estimate the cost in pay-offs  for some of the more spectacular concessions won by their  compatriots could have been as high as 10 million dollars. If  such reckoning is correct it is a sad irony because, with the  exception of the oil exploration companies and a few others,  there has been little legitimate investment in Cambodia of the  same magnitude.    Thais were obviously not the only foreigners doing business  in Cambodia, nor were they the only ones involved in the logging  or bar trades, or the only ones with conspicuously close ties to  the former government. The behaviour of Singaporean and  Malaysian businessmen has been little different to their Thai  counterparts although for the most part they seemed to have  escaped international condemnation.    Part of the problem for Thailand has been the traditional  suspicion with Cambodians have viewed their larger neighbours.  The return of peace provided the two countries with an  opportunity to embark on a new chapter in Thai-Cambodian  relations but so far there is little to suggest a change from  the distrust of past.    The Thai government itself can do little to control Thai  companies overseas. That is the responsibility of the host  countries. It can, however, be more aware of internationally  accepted standards of business behaviour and not defend the  worst excesses of its businessmen, as was the case with the  logging and gems concessions.    It is also too much to expect Thai businessmen to heed  official recommendations. In the world of business the only  lessons are the ones taught by the profit line. Hopefully,  after the debacle in Cambodia they may yet learn that good  ethics may also be good business.</p>

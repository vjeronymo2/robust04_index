			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Gas-fired power station unveiled ENRON, one of the largest gas companies in the US, yesterday unveiled its Pounds 850m showpiece gas-fired power station at Teesside. The company has a 50 per cent stake in the 1,875MW plant which is the largest combined heat and power station in the world. The glittering high-tech plant is a powerful symbol of the electricity industry's 'dash-for-gas', the rush to replace coal-fired power with gas. Its four equity partners - Midlands, Northern, South Western and South Wales regional electricity companies - have agreed to buy most of the power to supply their domestic customers. 'Projects like these help us and the other regional electricity companies to keep prices in check,' said Mr David Jones, chief executive of South Wales Electricity, who is also chairman of Teesside Power, the company that will run the power plant. Imperial Chemical Industries has also agreed to buy 257MW of the electricity. In addition, waste gases from the combined cycle gas turbine plant will provide all the steam required by ICI's nearby Wilton facility. The fully computerised power station employs just 65 people compared with 650 workers at a similar coal-fired plant. It covers 23 acres - just a fraction of the 800 acres occupied by a coal plant with the same power output. Mr Jones said that Teesside would save 9m tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year - it emits half the carbon dioxide of a coal plant. The plant's sulphur emissions are negligible and it produces one-ninth of the nitrous oxide waste.</p>

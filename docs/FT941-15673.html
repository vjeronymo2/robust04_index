			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / US to give Moscow reform incentive: Clinton to press for faster economic change President Bill Clinton will today hold out the promise of accelerated assistance to Russia, in talks with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow, if the new Russian government remains committed to reform. Mr Clinton's move comes as the prospect of a reformist cabinet still hangs in the balance and as the main reformers - Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, and Mr Anatoly Cgubais and Mr Boris Fyodorov, deputy prime ministers for privatisation and for finance - are themselves doubtful and divided about the possibility of working in the new cabinet. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is said to favour a 'balanced' inner cabinet of two conservative and two radical deputy prime ministers - a structure with which the reformists have said they would be unhappy, and in which they may refuse to take part. Mr Clinton's message on the economic front, according to a senior US official last night, is for 'more reform in Russia and more money from the west to support it'. This comes after a meeting of senior officials from the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Frankfurt last weekend agreed that the International Monetary Fund - the main instrument for providing financial aid to Russia - should become much more active in offering assistance to reform. The IMF last year disbursed, after some hesitation, a Dollars 1.5bn tranche of a systemic transformation facility designed to encourage and support reform efforts. However, negotiations of the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche, and the further Dollars 4bn for stabilisation, are not expected until the end of this month and are delayed because of lack of a budget for this year and uncertainties about the shape of the new cabinet. The G7 officials, who represent the IMF's main paymasters, believe that while the IMF should remain the lead agency for assistance and that no new money should be made available, a fresh effort should be made by the fund and by the World Bank to put the resources already committed, and their expertise, more immediately at the service of reform strategies - assuming that these survive the coming cabinet changes. They do not believe as some senior US administration members, including vice-president Al Gore and Mr Strobe Talbott, ambassador at large for the former Soviet Union, appeared to suggest in the past few weeks, that Russian efforts to bring down inflation and the budget deficit should be eased. Instead, they have taken the lesson of the Russia's December elections, in which communists and ultra-nationalist parties won large shares of the vote, to mean that the west must not be seen to be too carping in its demand for precise inflationary and deficit reduction targets. They believe that western governments and financial institutions should instead show recognition of the structural reforms already achieved, especially in the field of privatisation.</p>

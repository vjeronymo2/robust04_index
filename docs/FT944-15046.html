			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Civil Service Reorganisation: Shaping up for a radical reorientation The radical report on the Treasury's 'fundamental expenditure review of running costs', published yesterday with a broad endorsement by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, recommends that a quarter of the department's top jobs should go by next April. Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's permanent secretary, is frank. 'We shall have a difficult and stressful period ahead,' he wrote to staff yesterday. One senior official likened the impact of the report to the visit of the International Monetary Fund in 1976, the crisis year of the last Labour government. The review proposes that the number of senior management posts in the Treasury be cut from 99 to 72 by next April. The knock-on effect will be significant in the lower grades which account for most of the Treasury's 1,400 staff. Behind the cuts lies a radical reorientation of the Treasury's activities. The number of directorates will be reduced from nine to seven, with a lesser emphasis on economic forecasting - which Mr Clarke insists should be market-tested in two years' time - and a big reduction in the effort the Treasury makes to shadow the spending departments. The review also proposes a mission statement for the first time. Even Conservatives close to the Treasury are divided about the plans. Mr Andrew Tyrie, an adviser to both Lord Lawson and Mr John Major in their periods as chancellor, said: 'Unlike much of the civil service the Treasury ain't broken, so there must be doubts about the wisdom of such a fundamental cull.' By contrast, Mr Graham Mather, president of the European Policy Forum and a Tory MEP, said the proposals represented a 'historic opportunity' to reshape Whitehall and strip out unnecessary administrative tiers. He likened the review to the revolutionary Treasury-driven reform process in New Zealand, which has led to senior officials serving on individual contracts tied to performance targets. For most observers the key issue is whether the reforms will limit the Treasury's capacity to control the spending departments. The review insists that the Treasury must 'continue to exercise the firmest possible control over public expenditure' but can do so without the 'current panoply of detailed controls over departmental gifts, ex gratia payments, projects and so on.' Some Treasury insiders are doubtful. 'It's a shame Terry Burns was not around when the IMF came in 1976 - then he would know why the controls are necessary,' said one.</p>

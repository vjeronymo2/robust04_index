			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, the Christian Democratic Party's (PDC)  rank and file elected a Transitional Political Commission in an  attempt to politically define this institution and save it from  extinction. The political commission will have eight members  instead of the outgoing commission's 15 and will operate until  November. Its main objective will be to reform the party's  bylaws.    Napoleon Duarte, Jr., Julio Rivas Gallot, Remo Bardi, Ramon  Sigfredo Jovel, Gustavo Molino, Roberto Giron Flores, Mauricio  Monico, and Jorge Arriaza form the Transitional Political  Commission.    During this transitional phase, the secretary generalship  will be replaced by a coordinator who will be elected at the  commission's first meeting.    The outgoing commission was formed by Fidel Chavez Mena,  Roberto Viera, Atilio Vieytez, Orlando Arevalo, Alfonso  Aristides Alvarenga, Miguel Espinal, Gerardo Le Chevalier,  Antonio Morales, Pablo Alvergue, Amanda Villatoro, Antorio  Torres, Gustavo Salinas, Roberto Serrano, and Arturo Argumendo,  Jr., [14 names as published] all of whom resigned their  positions.    In addition to electing a transitional commission, it was  agreed during the party convention to draft a code of ethics and  discipline for disclosure in September and to schedule a  doctrine congress in August. Thus, members will have until 30  July to present collective or individual suggestions for reforms  to the bylaws.    According to Milagro Azcunaga de Melendez of the Movement  for  the PDC's Recovery, this convention is only a cosmetic measure  because it did not take into account the requests the group  presented. Likewise, the party's youth, who presented their  criticism at the convention with a pamphlet entitled "Ten Years  of Decline, Crisis, and Recovery in the PDC," stressed that the  reforms should be deep, not superficial.    The PDC reorganization is part of a series of internal  changes following the political failure in the past elections.</p>

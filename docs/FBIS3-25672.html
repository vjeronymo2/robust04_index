There would  also be a general shake-up in local agriculture as export  subsidies and domestic support were reduced.    Addressing the Agricultural Outlook Conference in Pretoria,  Dr van Niekerk said the conclusion of the Uruguay Round should  lead to an increase in world prices of agricultural products.  "This will strengthen the comparative advantage of South  African products on the world and domestic markets."    Dr van Niekerk said the country would gain many advantages  from its recent admission to the UN's food and agricultural  organisation and other bodies.    Onderstepoort was to become a cooperation centre for Africa,  and South Africa would host the World Veterinary Association  congress later this year.    He said the cabinet had in principle endorsed the guidelines  contained in the report of the Agricultural Marketing Policy  Evaluation Committee which recommended one agricultural  marketing policy to serve the commercial and developing sectors  and provide market access for both. Dr van Niekerk said  continued single-channel marketing schemes and marketing boards  for commodities could not be ruled out. But all marketing  systems would have to be transparent, supported by all those  involved and applied without political interference.</p>

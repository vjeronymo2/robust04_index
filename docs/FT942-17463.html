			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Nigeria accused over drugs The US State Department yesterday labelled Nigeria as a major drug trafficking country, bringing an immediate halt to US aid, writes George Graham in Washington. Nigeria joins Burma, Iran and Syria on the State Department's list of major drug producing or trafficking countries that are failing to co-operate in international drug control efforts. The US suspended most of its Dollars 32m aid programme to Nigeria last year, after military leaders annulled a presidential election and seized power. Under the terms of the Foreign Assistance Act, it will now also deny Export-Import Bank financing and vote against loans to Nigeria from the multilateral development banks. Mr Robert Gelbard, assistant secretary of state for international narcotics affairs, said Nigerian drug couriers accounted for 35 to 40 per cent of the heroin coming into the US.</p>

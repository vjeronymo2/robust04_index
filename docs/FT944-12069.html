A mixture of funding from the licence fee and advertisers would enable the corporation to compete effectively with growing satellite and multimedia rivals, said the society, which represents many of the UK's largest advertisers. Mr Kenneth Miles, the society's director-general, said all other 'leading countries in Europe now have mixed funding for state channels, with advertising as a major source of income'.

The white paper, published in July, reinforced the current universal licence fee arrangements until at least 2001.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Arts: Going Out versus Staying In - Television It is, people insist, much the best to be there: whether Wimbledon or the Royal Tournament, rock festival or Comedy Store; while television may convey an approximation of the 'real' experience, there is no substitute for actually going along. In the past this column has considered the subject specifically in relation to sport and concluded that there is, indeed, a certain something - the strawberry factor - about going to Wimbledon, and risking skin cancer from all that sun for the sake of the smell of crushed grass. Yet there is also a powerful argument for staying on the old green sofa in the cool of your own sitting room in front of your television. At home there are no men in uniforms ordering you about, you can drink your own properly chilled Sancerre, and people do not sit behind you explaining Navratilova's sexual relationships in stage whispers. Travel time to and from the sofa is negligible, and at home you have all the advantages of umpteen camera positions and the zoom lens which are denied those who pay the appalling price of a Centre Court ticket. What about the sort of events more commonly reviewed on this page though? Can television ever hope to provide more than a vague idea of the experience of sitting in a West End theatre as the house lights go down, of being a part of a big audience dominated by the big screen in a cinema, of feeling the expectation in a concert hall as the conductor raises his baton? A refresher course in Going Out can leave you in two minds. Certainly there are aspects of live entertainment that television fails to convey, but the incidentals, at least in a big city  - travel, tickets, food and drink, fellow members of the audience - can be enough to make you vow never to relinquish the old green sofa again. In comparing the two experiences we do tend to underestimate the sheer convenience of television. In London today, unless you have a chauffeur, the only way of being sure you can reach any venue and park close by is to drive a motorcycle, and not everyone is as game as Mrs Dunkley when it comes to riding pillion. (Yes, when necessary in evening dress.) You can easily spend the price of a whole year's licence fee on two opera tickets or three moderate seats in a Shaftesbury Avenue theatre. In the all too accurately named crush bar two glasses of ghastly blended table wine will cost you around Pounds 4, and there is a dreadful tendency now to provide only 'souvenir' programmes which means the format of Radio Times and a price of Pounds 6. While you have control over those with whom you watch television, the same is obviously not true when you Go Out. If you are fortunate enough to be invited by John Drummond, director of the BBC Proms, to share his box, as we were on Sunday, you may find yourself sitting with Sir David and Lady Attenborough - and what could be more pleasant. However, buy yourself a couple of Pounds 25 seats at the Prince Edward to see the Gershwin musical Crazy For You and you may find yourself towards the back of the circle behind three vast teenage girls who continually lean forward in their seats, forcing everyone behind to do the same, and eat sweets out of cellophane bags seemingly prepared by some insane sound effects department. That does not happen with television. As for the cinema, on the day after we saw Jurassic Park last week it was announced that this had become the biggest grossing movie of all time in Britain, a fact which scarcely surprised us since we had had to pay Pounds 10 each for seats, not in the West End but at the Parkway, Camden Town. True, when we left the cinema there was a pianist playing in the bar, supporting the claim printed on the back of the tickets that they are 'Making movie going an occasion'. But it was also true that we sat through the film with our feet on a thick layer of popcorn, on top of a worn-out and badly torn carpet. Funny sort of occasion. But what about the content of these events? Spielberg's dinosaur extravaganza is so determined to terrify the life out of you that it produces a defiant reaction: 'Garn] Can't frighten me]' Yet it is one of those films that will lose much of its impact when it comes to television. Whereas the subtle frights of a Hitchcock can be as effective on the small screen as the large, Jurassic Park relies upon the overwhelming size of its cinema images and the deafening volume of trillion-track Dolby sound for its effect, and those will not be available on the box. So if you do want to see dinosaurs chasing children and crunching adults, see it in the cinema. Score one, reluctantly, for Going Out. We happened to see Crazy For You on the same night that the Queen took her mother for a 93rd birthday treat, along with her sister and umpteen other members of the royal family. This created an even more monumental traffic jam than usual around Soho, and thus even more smugness among motorcyclists. There may have been another effect, too: the company seemed to perform with abnormal energy, as companies will when the royals are in. Since this is a classic American musical with a tap line 10-babes long, and a great basketful of Gershwin hits - 'Someone To Watch Over Me', 'I Got Rhythm', 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' and many more - the effect was electrifying . . . or perhaps they really are that good every night. Anyway, even without any special royal edge, there is something about the stage musical which has never been transferred successfully to television. To experience the full sense of hair-raising exhilaration from, say, a massed tap routine you have to be in a theatre seeing the thing live, with no chance of anyone 'dubbing in the taps'. The same goes for those typically American stage-wide dance routines, such as Embraceable You in this show, where there is no chance, as with television, of cutting together the best bits from five takes, and the dancers end up, chests heaving for breath, with the whole house on a roar. Score another, very definitely, for Going Out. As for the Proms, the experience varies. When the front promenaders turned round on Monday last week and chanted 'Arena to gallery: tonight's concert can be heard on Radio 3' even Mr Drummond seemed to think they had a point, murmuring 'They've been quite witty this year'. The point was that The Hanover Band playing an all-Bach programme on period instruments did not produce a great enough volume of sound, some of the time anyway, for the marvellous and familiar but very large space inside the Albert Hall. That said, the Concerto for Violin and Oboe, and especially Anthony Robson's performance on the oboe, was simply splendid, large space or not. But had this been televised, home viewers would have had no trouble at all with sound - as the promenaders' message indicated. Score one for Going Out and one for staying home. So Going Out emerges from this refresher course pretty robustly; the vitality of live events and the uniqueness of each performance score heavily. However, if you throw the incidentals into the scales the balance tips back dramatically towards the old green sofa. And what could you see on television in the past week? The second part of Billy Roche's powerful Wexford Trilogy, first performed at The Bush, a tiny fringe theatre with a name for innovation but cramped and uncomfortable seating. The third in a new series of the amazingly effective (even if, perhaps because, the content can be infuriating) Teenage Diaries, a form impossible to imagine outside television. A repeat of a hilarious episode of French And Saunders (with the 'Looky Likeys', a parody of The Exorcist and an embarrassingly accurate publisher's lunch) and more. Of course watching television is not the same as being there, but nor is being there the same as watching television. You miss an awful lot if you go out every night.</p>

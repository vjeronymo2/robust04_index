			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOOD FOOD: CHESTNUTS BEYOND THE OPEN FIRE  </P> <P> As things currently stand, chestnuts are almost as ephemeral as poinsettias.  From Thanksgiving to Christmas, they're everywhere; then boom, adios until next  turkey time. There are a number of reasons for this, primary among them the  fact that the fresh nuts are harvested only once a year. They are also  expensive. And they're a hassle: You've got to peel a lot to get much food, and  you've got to peel them while they're hot or the skins will stick.  </P> <P> Dried chestnuts, on the other hand, are a delight all year. They come already  peeled, they're easy on the budget and they're very easy to eat. Though they  lack the almost fluffy texture of the fresh article, they do retain the same  sweetness and classic, addictive, smoky chestnut flavor.  </P> <P> In fact, dried chestnuts might best be seen as a sort of very high-class dried  bean, just as wild rice is considered a fancier version of rice. The two aren't  botanically related, but their uses at the table are parallel, and chestnuts,  like beans, are high in protein and low in fat.  </P> <P> Chestnuts are sweeter than beans, and this must be allowed for, but they do  beautifully for many classic bean purposes, such as teamed with rice. I  wouldn't try to make chili with them, but they do make dandy burritos; just  boil with an onion, mash in a bit of oil or bacon fat, and serve in tortillas  with lots of shredded lettuce, onions, cheese, hot peppers and other fixings of  choice.  </P> <P> Chestnuts go well with members of the cabbage family and taste good in beef  stew. Try them as a garnish for baked squash, or marinate them in vinaigrette  and sprinkle on the salad. There's no reason for chestnuts to vanish up the  chimney with Santa; in the dried version they are, or should be, a staple that  knows no season.  </P> <P> The hardest part is finding them, since they are not generally a supermarket  item. I get mine at the local co-op; other likely sources are health-food  stores and groceries that deal in Italian or Mediterranean foods. Once  purchased, dried chestnuts must be picked over before use, since even the  finest quality will include three or four wormy ones per pound. Generally, when  a recipe calls for half a pound of walnuts, buy a generous half-pound.  </P> <P> While it is not absolutely essential to soak them, an eight- to 24-hour bath in  cool water to cover will help them cook more evenly. It will also loosen those  last little bits of skin, which can be easily removed with a wood pick. (Do not  soak longer than 24 hours or they will start to ferment.) Use the soaking water  as part of the cooking liquid, but otherwise proceed as you would with dried  beans.  </P> <P>  The fresh, very slightly bitter taste of the celery balances the smoky  sweetness of the chestnuts, and celery's crispness makes a fine contrast to the  otherwise smooth puree. Though this tastes as rich as a classic cream soup,  it's actually very low in fat. Just pleasantly filling, it's ideal for a winter  lunch or as the main dish of a winter dinner that also includes a substantial  salad and a loaf of crusty garlic bread.  </P> <P> CHESTNUT AND  </P> <P> CELERY SOUP  </P> <P> 1/2 pound dried chestnuts  </P> <P> 3 cups chicken broth  </P> <P> 1 heaping tablespoon butter  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups sliced (scant 1/4-inch thick) celery  </P> <P> 2 or 3 tablespoons minced celery leaves  </P> <P> 1/3 cup thinly sliced green onions, including about 1 inch green part  </P> <P> 1 cup low-fat milk  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1/4 cup minced parsley or fennel  </P> <P> 4 lemon wedges  </P> <P> Pick over chestnuts. Place in deep bowl and cover generously with cold water.  Soak 8 to 24 hours. Remove clinging skins with wood pick.  </P> <P> Transfer chestnuts to heavy saucepan. Add 2 cups soaking water and chicken  broth. Bring liquid to boil. Cover pan and simmer until chestnuts are very  tender, about 1 1/2 hours.  </P> <P> Remove chestnuts with slotted spoon and puree in blender or processor, adding  just enough cooking liquid to keep grinder from sticking. Keep liquid hot.  </P> <P> Melt butter in clean pan over medium-high heat until sizzling and beginning to  brown. Add celery, celery leaves and green onions. Raise heat to high and cook,  stirring, until vegetables are just translucent and starting to brown.  </P> <P> Reduce heat to low. Add chestnut puree and stir well. Slowly stir in broth. Add  enough milk to achieve good smooth consistency. Heat to desired temperature.  Season to taste with salt.  </P> <P> Transfer soup to heated bowls. Sprinkle with parsley and serve at once,  accompanied by lemon wedges. Makes 4 servings.  </P> <P>  Marrons Glacees, the huge, soft, sugar-glazed chestnuts imported from France,  are one of the world's loveliest candies. Unfortunately, they are also one of  the world's most expensive -- last time I looked, they were running about two  bucks apiece -- and they cannot be made at home. The bonbons below, however,  deliver a similar satisfaction at a fraction of the cost, and they are very  easy to prepare. They make a lovely New Years' Eve present, especially when  presented in pretty foil or printed paper cases. This recipe can easily be  doubled.  </P> <P> MOCK MARRONS  </P> <P> GLACEES  </P> <P> (Chestnut Bonbons)  </P> <P> 1/4 pound dried chestnuts, about 1/2 cup  </P> <P> 1 egg white, beaten just enough to mix  </P> <P> Superfine sugar  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon butter, softened  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> Pick over chestnuts. Place in bowl and cover with 1 1/2 cups cold water. Allow  to soak 8 to 24 hours, removing skins with wood pick. Place chestnuts and  soaking liquid in heavy, covered saucepan. Cook over low heat until very  tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Cool in cooking liquid.  </P> <P> Drain chestnuts well (juice may be saved for adding to soup or stew). Puree in  blender or food processor with half of egg white, 1 scant tablespoon superfine  sugar, butter and vanilla until paste is completely smooth.  </P> <P> Line baking sheet with parchment paper or butter lightly. Form chestnut paste  into balls the size of large grapes, leaving surface little rough if possible.  One at time, dip balls in remaining egg white and let drain briefly. Roll in  superfine sugar until thoroughly covered. Set well apart on baking sheet.  </P> <P> Bake at 275 degrees 30 minutes, or until sugar shell is set. Check halfway  through and lower heat if bonbons are browning. (If light gold in color, they  are still good but white is ideal.) Cool few minutes on sheet. Carefully remove  and finish cooling on wire racks. Store airtight to prevent sogginess. Makes  about 20 candies.  </P></p>

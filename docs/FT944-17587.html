			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Recognition for continuous speech The first speech recognition system that can deal with continuous speech was announced by Philips Electronics of the Netherlands this week. Although such recognition systems have been available for several years, they have been difficult to use for dictation because they relied on pauses between words. The Philips technology depends on the recognition of phonemes, the smallest acoustical component of a language. The system, which must be trained to the user's voice, draws on knowledge of how words are pronounced and how sentences are put together to recognise text. Philips researchers in Vienna and Aachen have used the technology in a dictation system for radiologists. The system, which has a vocabulary of 25,000 words, recognises normal speed speech and converts it into text. Philips Dictation Systems: UK, tel 01206 755600; fax 01206 755666</p>

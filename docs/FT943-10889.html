			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / SmithKline and Cyanamid look at Dollars 3bn business swap SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, is in talks to acquire the drugs business of US company Cyanamid in an exchange of businesses with combined annual sales of more than Dollars 3bn(Pounds 1.90bn). If completed, the transaction would mark SmithKline Beecham's second big expansion in the US pharmaceuticals market this year. Two months ago, the company agreed to pay Dollars 2.3bn for Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, a drugs distributor. Cyanamid's drugs business, with annual sales of Dollars 1.4bn, would give SmithKline Beecham a broader range of products to sell through Diversified. The companies are discussing a swap of SmithKline Beecham's vaccine and animal health businesses, with annual sales of Dollars 1.2bn, for most of Cyanamid's medical operations. SmithKline Beecham would acquire the consumer healthcare division and generic, non-patented drugs operations, while Cyanamid would retain its vaccines business. Neither company was prepared to confirm the talks. Sources close to the deal stressed there were still a number of details to be concluded. No investment bank advisers have yet been instructed to work on the transaction, according to one of the group's usual financial advisers. The deal would give SmithKline Beecham total annual drugs sales of about Dollars 6.2bn, according to an estimate by Lehman Brothers. It would remain the fourth largest manufacturer of branded pharmaceuticals. 'The swap would make strategic sense,' said Mr Kevin Scotcher, pharmaceuticals analyst at brokers Kleinwort Benson. 'The operating profits of the two sides' businesses are about the same, and SmithKline Beecham could cut costs quickly to drive up margins.' The acquisition would also provide SmithKline Beecham with new therapeutic areas such as cancer, which the company could market through Diversified. Cyanamid's drugs subsidiary, Lederle has a strong position in the market for cancer products and holds a 52 per cent stake in Immunex, a Seattle-based group specialising in cancer. The deal would make Cyanamid the world's leading vaccines maker, and boost it from number 10 to number one in sales of animal health products, an Dollars 11bn market. SmithKline Beecham's animal health and vaccines businesses had generated operating profits of about Dollars 95m and between Dollars 120m and Dollars 140m respectively last year. SmithKline Beecham's vaccines business had sales of about Dollars 490m last year, while Cyanamid's vaccines operations had a turnover of Dollars 305m.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Case for pension fund exposure to equities Sir, The current criticism of pension fund exposure to equities that Barry Riley has raided ('Too many eggs in one basket', November 11) seems perilously close to an outbreak of short-termism in a world in which long-termism is vital for pension fund health. There is a danger that the wrong funds will surge back into bonds, which the government will be only too willing to supply. Is this sensible in the 'more familiar climate of devaluation' referred to? It seems vital to divide pension funds into two groups. The first covers the majority of members of occupational pension funds, those which have time horizons long enough to invest heavily in equities throughout the economic cycle. Here, the 'balanced fund' system has worked exceptionally well. The second group, which is growing, is where time horizons are shorter because of the maturity of their liabilities or the precariousness of their discontinuance solvency. Such funds often need more balance in their asset strategies than the classic balanced fund provides them (with its current 85 per cent in equities). The dangers in the situation are not so much to do with the economic climate and today's equity values as with tomorrow's liability calls and more relevant asset planning.

Shasta Historic District was determined eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The property was determined to meet National Register Criterion A (associated with important events) in the area of Ethnic Heritage: Native American because of its long history of use and traditional importance to several different Native American tribes. This finding was based upon nearly a dozen publicly-available professional reports and approximately 200 letters submitted by the Forest Service to the Keeper of the National Register, which address the historical and cultural significance of Mt. Shasta. The National Park Service received additional letters regarding the significance of Mt. Shasta. The reports were prepared for the Forest Service as part of its survey to identify properties that are eligible for listing in the National Register under its responsibilities under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966. A copy of the determination is available from the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7127. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The documentation previously submitted to the National Register indicates that the entire Mt. Shasta is significant and the property, most appropriately, should be classified as a ``district.'' The boundary of the Mt. Shasta Historic District is: ``The northernmost point is a point on Military Pass Road approximately midway between the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and Highway 97, thence westerly midway between the railroad tracks and the highway to its intersection with the National Forest boundary, thence south along the National Forest boundary to Howard east of the town of Mt. Shasta, thence following the McCloud River Railroad tracks eastward to the Pilgrim Creek Road, thence northeast to Coonrod Flat, thence northwest along Ash Creek to Military Pass Road, thence back to the point of beginning.'' Based on Forest Service documentation, this area has been established using a mixture of geographic referents, including manmade features (e.g., railroad tracks) and natural features (e.g., buttes). Within this boundary are all the specific places mentioned in the historical studies and recent interviews. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the determination of eligibility was made, property owners within the boundary of the determined eligible area and individuals nationwide have written to us either endorsing or disagreeing with the eligibility of the property. In order to accommodate those who wish to provide new information on whether or not this property meets the National Register Criteria for Evaluation or on the scope of the district's boundary, the National Park Service is providing a 60 day comment period on these issues. The National Register Criteria for Evaluation are set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Anyone wishing to submit additional information bearing on the historic significance and/or the extent of the boundary should do so within 60 days of the date of this notice. A written statement on the determination of eligibility will be issued after the close of the comment period and review of all comments. The determination of eligibility remains in effect pending issuance of this written statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments should be addressed to the National Register of Historic Places, National Park Service, P.O. Box 37127, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7127. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol D.

That are associated with events that have made a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our past; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important to prehistory or history. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ordinarily cemeteries, birthplaces, or graves of historical figures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious purposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed history buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall not be considered eligible for the National Register. However, such properties will qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria or if they fall within the following categories: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. A religious property deriving primary significance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical importance; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. A building or structure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily for architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly associated with a historic person or event; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. A birthplace or grave of a historical figure of outstanding importance if there is no other appropriate site or building directly associated with his productive life; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. A cemetery that derives its primary significance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from distinctive design features, or from association with historic events; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. A reconstructed building when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a dignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other building or structure with the same association has survived; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. A property primarily commemorative in intent if design, age, traditional, or symbolic value has invested it with its own historical significance; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. A property achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of exceptional importance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;21415 Filed 8&hyph;30&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

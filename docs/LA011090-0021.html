Ferrand said it did not  appear that robbery was a motive, nor was there any evidence that the victim  was involved in gangs or drugs.  </P> <P> Ferrand described Costa as a free-lance auto mechanic who paid a fee to use the  facility for car repairs. Witnesses told police they heard a shot and saw the  gunman looking down at the victim. Police said the two may have known each  other, but the nature of the relationship was unknown.  </P></p>

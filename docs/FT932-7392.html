			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Stores of value Some sparkling results and upbeat trading statements from UK retailers last week were not enough to lift the gloom from the stores sector. April's consumer spending figures were a touch disappointing, but they followed something of a mini-boom in April last year. About the only concrete bad news was the average earnings figures which suggested that wage increases are likely to continue at a very low level. But the rumblings about public spending cuts also reminded investors that consumers are likely to be squeezed. Marks and Spencer's announcement that its wage bill would rise by 6 per cent also focused attention on costs, and the success of its 'outstanding value' promotion on price competition. Both will be critical factors for a sector unlikely to return to 1980s-style easy living. Marks has turned up the heat on those clothing retailers which rely on high margins. Kingfisher's consistent low pricing efforts in DIY, perfume and sun care products are doing the same to Texas, Do It All and Boots. The recent spat about the relative prices of CDs in the UK and the US has brought the high cost of UK retailing to consumers' attention. Perhaps most significantly the advent of several US discount retailing formats such as Warehouse Clubs will undermine the price structure of a wide range of retailers. Marks and Kingfisher have at least focused on the problem. Sleepier stores which do not dominate their categories with low cost operations had better wake up.</p>

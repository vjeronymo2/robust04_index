Background and Purpose <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required under title V of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (``the Act''), EPA has promulgated rules which define the minimum elements of an approvable State operating permits program and the corresponding standards and procedures by which the EPA will approve, oversee, and withdraw approval of a State operating permits program (see 57 FR 32250 (July 21, 1992)). These rules are codified at title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 70. Title V requires States to develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing these operating permits to all major stationary sources and to certain other sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act requires that States develop and submit these programs to EPA by November 15, 1993, and that EPA act to approve or disapprove each program within one year after receiving the submittal. The EPA's program review occurs pursuant to section 502 of the Act and the part 70 regulations which together outline criteria for approval or disapproval. Where a program substantially, but not fully, meets the requirements of part 70, EPA may grant the program interim approval for a period of up to two years. If EPA has not fully approved a program by two years after the November 15, 1993, date, or by the end of an interim program, it must establish and implement a Federal program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Proposed Action and Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Analysis of State Submission <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Support Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 502(d) of the Clean Air Act as amended (1990 Amendments), the Governor of each State must develop and submit to the Administrator an operating permits program under State or local law or under an interstate compact meeting the requirements of title V of the Act. NMED requested, under the signature of Governor Bruce King, approval with full authority to administer the State operating permits program submittal, prepared by NMED, in all areas of the State of New Mexico with the exceptions of Bernalillo County and Indian Lands. The title V operating permits program package for Bernalillo County will be submitted separately by the City of Albuquerque Environmental Health Department, and it will be addressed in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  action. Bernalillo County is granted the authority to administer a local air pollution control program by the New Mexico Air Quality Control Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NMED operating permits program submittal, New Mexico does not assert jurisdiction over Indian lands or reservations for purposes of 40 CFR part 70 and title V. EPA will, at a future date, conduct a Federal title V operating permits program governing title V sources of air emissions on Indian lands and reservations in New Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To date, no tribal or Pueblo government in New Mexico has authority to administer an independent air program in the State. Upon promulgation of the Indian air regulations, the Indians will then be able to apply as a State, and receive the authority from EPA, to implement an operating permits program under title V of the 1990 Amendments. The Navajo Nation lands, including those in New Mexico, are administered under the jurisdiction of EPA Region 9. The State of New Mexico recognizes the five (5) reservations and nineteen (19) Pueblos throughout the lands of the State. A map outlining and listing each tribe by name is attached to the Governor's letter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New Mexico submittal, provided as Item II&hyph;''Operating Permits Program Description,'' addresses 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1) by describing how NMED intends to carry out its responsibilities under the part 70 regulations. The program description addresses the following areas: (A) Organizational structure; (B) Regulations, guidelines, policies, and procedures; and (C) Future regulatory actions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) and (v)). The program description has been deemed to be appropriate for meeting the requirement of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3), the Governor is required to submit a legal opinion from the attorney general (or the attorney for the State air pollution control agency that has independent legal counsel) demonstrating adequate authority to carry out all aspects of a title V operating permits program. The State of New Mexico submitted an Attorney General's Opinion and a Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion demonstrating adequate legal authority as required by Federal law and regulation except with regard to criminal fine authority. The Attorney General's Opinion acknowledged that a statutory revision would be required to bring its criminal fine authority into precise conformance with the requirements of 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State statutes cited in the Attorney General's Opinion authorize the imposition of criminal fines in the amounts of only $1,000 and $5,000 for misdemeanor and felony violations, respectively, rather than the $10,000 per violation amounts required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii) for knowing violations of applicable requirements, permit conditions and fee and filing requirements. Further, those statutes do not appear to authorize the fine amounts to be imposed per day per violation as required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii). Although these defects in criminal fine authority preclude EPA from granting full approval of the State's operating permits program at this time, EPA may grant interim approval, subject to the State obtaining the needed criminal fine authority within 18 months after the Administrator's approval of the New Mexico title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4(f)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State's Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion addresses the criminal fine authority required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii) for tampering and false statement. EPA is relying on the State's interpretation of its statute,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMSA 1978 section 74&hyph;2&hyph;14.E., as demonstrating that New Mexico law allows criminal fines of at least $10,000 per day for each act of tampering and for each false statement as required by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(iii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(i) requires that the State demonstrate adequate legal authority to issue permits and assure compliance with each applicable requirement of 40 CFR part 70. New Mexico regulation, AQCR 770.III.C.1.d., states that ``The department may impose conditions regulating emissions during start-up and shutdown.'' EPA is relying on the State's interpretation of this language, discussed in the State's Supplemental Attorney General's Opinion, as allowing the department to impose requirements which exceed title V applicable requirements, but not to waive any title V requirements for title V sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4) requires the submission of relevant permitting program documentation not contained in the regulations, such as permit forms and relevant guidance to assist in the State's implementation of its permit program. The State addresses this requirement in its program submittal under Item II&hyph;''Program Description'' and Item V&hyph;''Program Documentation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Regulations and Program Implementation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of New Mexico has submitted Air Quality Control Regulations (AQCR) 770&hyph;''Operating Permit Regulations'' and AQCR 771&hyph;''Fee Regulations,'' for implementing the State part 70 program as required by 40 CFR 70.4(b)(2). Sufficient evidence of their procedurally correct adoption was submitted in a supplemental submittal on January 11, 1994, supplementing the evidence of adoption which was sent to EPA in the State's original submittal. Copies of all applicable State and local statutes and regulations which authorize the part 70 program, including those governing State administrative procedures, were submitted with the State's program. The State also submitted a list of insignificant activities with the submittal for EPA to propose approving with the approval of the State operating permits program. This list which has been through the public participation process during the operating permits regulation hearing was addressed by the Regional office with no comment. The list can be found in the submittal under Item II&hyph;''Operating Permits Program Description,'' Attachment II&hyph;3&hyph;''List of Insignificant Activities.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The New Mexico operating permits regulations followed part 70 very closely with a few exceptions. The cross-reference chart can be found in the New Mexico submittal under Item VI&hyph;''Various Provisions,'' Attachment VI&hyph;1, indicating where each paragraph of the part 70 regulation is addressed in AQCR 770. AQCR 770 is submitted as Attachment III&hyph;1. The following requirements, set out in EPA's part 70 operating permits program review, are addressed in Item VI of the State's submittal: (A) Applicability criteria, including any criteria used to determine insignificant activities or emissions levels (40 CFR 70.4(b)(2)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AQCR 770.II., ``List of Insignificant Activities''; (B) Provisions for continuing permits or permit terms if a timely and complete application is submitted, but action is not taken on a request prior to permit expiration (40 CFR 70.4(b)(10)): AQCR 770.IV A.4.; (C) Provisions for action on permit applications (40 CFR 70.4(b)(6)): AQCR 770.IV.A.3.; (D) Provisions for permit content, (including 40 CFR 70.4(b)(16)): all applicable requirements: AQCR 770.III.C.1.; a fixed term: AQCR 770.III.C.2.; monitoring and related record keeping and reporting requirements: AQCR 770.III.C.3. through 5.; source compliance requirements: AQCR 770.III.C.7.; (E) Operational flexibility provisions (40 CFR 70.4(b)(12)): AQCR 770.III.C.8.; (F) Provisions for permit issuance, renewals, reopenings and revisions, including public, EPA and affected State review to be accomplished in an expeditious manner (40 CFR 70.4(b)(13) and (16)): AQCR 770.VI.; and (G) If the permitting authority allows off-permit changes, provisions assuring compliance with &sect;&sect;70.4(b)(14) and (15): AQCR 770.C.9. The AQCR regulations, in section 770.IV.(H), provide that applicants can receive variances from non-Federal conditions only. The State prevents any source from receiving a variance from any AQCR 770 or part 70 requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Permit Fee Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In AQCR 771, the State's fee regulation, New Mexico established fees for criteria air pollutants which are below the presumptive minimum. The New Mexico regulation allows for a fee of $10.25 per ton for criteria pollutants based on allowable emissions at major sources as defined in AQCR 770&hyph;''Operating Permits'' regulations. For facilities which are only major for hazardous air pollutants (HAP) and not for other pollutants, the fees are $150 per ton for the 189 HAPs listed in title III of the 1990 Amendments. These fees, when converted using EPA criteria, result in the collection of an average of $19.30 per ton for title V sources. The State of New Mexico, after careful review, determined that these fees would support the title V permit program costs as required by 40 CFR 70.9(a). New Mexico explains in its fee demonstration that it chose this fee structure because it allowed for program costs to be covered without unduly penalizing any industry in the State, and the fees generated would meet, but not likely exceed, program costs. The NMED will have a periodic review of the program fee schedule. The New Mexico fee demonstration shows that this fee schedule meets the requirements for an operating permits program in New Mexico. The State will collect 2.7 million dollars per year to support all applicable part 70 activities. The State projects the direct cost to fund the operation of the title V program to be 2.3 million dollars per year, and the indirect cost to be approximately $372,000. The State anticipates increasing its air quality staff by 38 new full time employees (FTE), a total of 1/3 of the existing air program staff. Any changes in the fees would need to be made by NMED through the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Provisions Implementing the Requirements of Other Titles of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of New Mexico acknowledges that its request for approval of a part 70 program is also a request for approval of a program for delegation of section 112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. The State of New Mexico currently receives delegation of any new provisions required by section 112 of the Act (governing National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP)) on an annual basis through a delegation agreement with EPA. Under the 1990 Amendments, the State can now receive delegation of any new authority required by section 112 of the Act through approval of the State operating permits program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State has the option at any time to request, under section 112(l) of the Act, delegation of section 112 requirements in the form of State regulations which the State demonstrates are equivalent to the corresponding section 112 provisions promulgated by EPA. At this time, the State plans to use the mechanism of incorporation by reference to adopt unchanged Federal section 112 requirements into its regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The radionuclide NESHAP is a section 112 regulation and therefore, also an applicable requirement under the State operating permits program. The EPA will work with the State in the development of its radionuclide program to ensure that permits are issued in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 112(g) of the Act requires that, after the effective date of a permits program under title V, no person may construct or reconstruct any major source of any HAPs unless the State determines that the maximum achievable control technology emission limitation under section 112(g) for new sources will be met. Such determination must be made on a case-by-case basis where no applicable limitations have been established by the Administrator. After the title V effective date and before the promulgation of the Federal 112(g) rule, New Mexico intends to implement section 112(g) of the Act with regard to new sources through the State's preconstruction process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of New Mexico commits to appropriately implementing the existing and future requirements of sections 111, 112 and 129 of the Act, and all maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards promulgated in the future, in a timely manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of New Mexico commits to having an acid rain program in place by January 1, 1995. The State will submit copies to EPA of any proposed program rules, regulations and guidance prepared for review and comment to meet the Federal implementation date and to issue permits by December 1997. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Enforcement Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NMED's operating permits program submittal addressed the enforcement requirements of 40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and 70.4(b)(5) in Item VIII&hyph;''Enforcement Provisions.'' In a supplemental submittal, received by EPA after the November 15, 1993 submittal, the Regional Office received a signed Memorandum of Understanding between EPA Region 6 and NMED. This document, which was the product of negotiations between EPA Region 6 and NMED, had been awaiting signature at the time of the original submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Item VIII of the State's submittal addresses the following issues: (A) Compliance Tracking and Enforcement Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (40 CFR 70.4(b)(4)(ii) and 70.4(b)(5)); (B) Commitment to Submit Enforcement Information (40 CFR 70.4(b)(9)); and (C) Enforcement Authority (40 CFR 70.4(b)(2) and 70.4(b)(3)(vii)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Technical Support Document <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results of this review will be shown in a document entitled ``Technical Support Document'', which will be available in the docket at the locations noted above. The technical support documentation shows that all operating permits program requirements of part 70 and relevant guidance were met by the submittal for the NMED, except with regard to criminal enforcement authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of New Mexico submitted to EPA, under a cover letter from the Governor dated November 15, 1993, the State's operating permits program. The submittal has adequately addressed all sixteen (16) elements required for full approval as discussed in part 70, except with regard to criminal fine authority. The State of New Mexico addressed appropriately all requirements necessary to receive interim approval of the State operating permits program pursuant to title V, 1990 Amendments and 40 CFR part 70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Options for Approval/Disapproval and Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is proposing to grant interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by New Mexico on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15, 1993. Interim approvals under section 502(g) of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. If promulgated, the State must make the following changes to receive full approval: Correct the statutory defect in criminal fine authority. In addition to raising the criminal fine amounts to at least $10,000 for all offenses listed in 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii), statutory revisions must provide authority for the imposition of those fines on a per day per violation basis, as required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii). Evidence of these statutory revisions and their procedurally correct adoption must be submitted to EPA within 18 months of EPA's approval of the New Mexico operating permits program. This interim approval, which may not be renewed, extends for a period of up to two years. During the interim approval period, the State is protected from sanctions for failure to have a program, and EPA is not obligated to promulgate a Federal permit program in the State. Permits issued under a program with interim approval have full standing with respect to part 70, and the one year time period for submittal of permit applications by subject sources begins upon interim approval, as does the three year time period for processing the initial permit applications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If this proposed interim approval is converted to a disapproval, it will not affect any existing State requirements applicable to small entities. Federal disapproval of the State submittal would not affect its State-enforceability. Moreover, EPA's disapproval of the submittal would not impose a new Federal requirement. Therefore, EPA certifies that such a disapproval action would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it would not remove existing State requirements or substitute a new Federal requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Rulemaking Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this action, EPA is proposing interim approval of the operating permits program submitted by the State of New Mexico. The program was submitted by the State to EPA for the purpose of complying with Federal requirements found in title V of the 1990 Amendments, and in 40 CFR part 70, which mandate that States develop, and submit to EPA, programs for issuing operating permits to all major stationary sources, and to certain other sources with the exceptions of Bernalillo County and Indian Lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements for title V approval, specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 70.4(b), encompass section 112(l)(5) requirements for approval of a program for delegation of Federal section 112 standards as they apply to part 70 sources. Section 112(l)(5) requires that the State's program contain adequate authorities, adequate resources for implementation, and an expeditious compliance schedule, which are also requirements under part 70. Therefore, as part of this interim approval, the EPA is also proposing to grant approval under section 112(l)(5) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63.91 of the State's program for receiving delegation of section 112 standards that are unchanged from Federal standards as promulgated. This applies to existing and future standards as they apply to sources covered by the part 70 program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has reviewed this submittal of the New Mexico operating permits program and is proposing interim approval. Certain defects in the State's statutory criminal fine authority preclude EPA from granting full approval of the State's operating permits program at this time. EPA is proposing to grant interim approval, subject to the State obtaining the needed criminal fine authority within 18 months after the Administrator's approval of the New Mexico title V program pursuant to 40 CFR 70.4. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Administrative Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Request for Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA is requesting comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. Copies of the State's submittal and other information relied upon for the proposed interim approval are contained in a docket maintained at the EPA Regional Office. The docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submitted to, or otherwise considered by, EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking. The principal purposes of the docket are: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) To allow interested parties a means to identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participate in the rulemaking process; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) To serve as the record in case of judicial review.

Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to review of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant'' regulatory action as one that is likely to lead to a rule that may:Q02 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It has been determined that this rule is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the terms of Executive Order 12866 and is therefore not subject to OMB review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), Federal agencies must obtain OMB clearance for collection of information from ten (10) or more non-Federal respondents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operating permits program approvals under section 502 of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal operating permits program approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning operating permits programs on such grounds ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 70 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Allyn M.

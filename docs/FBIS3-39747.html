			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] The German press today comments on the expiration  of the NATO ultimatum for the Bosnian Serbs.    SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG writes: On the day after the expiration  of the NATO ultimatum, the United Nations and NATO must admit  they are still at the beginning. The threat of the use of force  was only the first step and not the finale. NATO and the United  Nations must not decrease their efforts. Direct pressure on all  parties to the war must continue to exist until the fight  against the siege of Sarajevo is finally over. If NATO and the  United Nations achieve in the long run [a situation in which]  shots are no longer fired in Sarajevo, this would bring great  relief. However, the town can only survive if peace is restored  in other areas, too. Public attention has mainly focused on the  Bosnian capital in this war. However, it was overlooked that  the fiercest fighting took place in other regions, and that  Sarajevo was not so important for the Serbs.    NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG points out: Despite the modest  hope that is budding in view of developments in Sarajevo, the  rest of Bosnia must not be forgotten. Fighting is still going  on in many places. The community of states must show the same  determination with which it supported a cease-fire in the  capital in other focal points, too -- in Tuzla, for example,  where the Serbs launched new attacks during the weekend, or in  Gorazde, Srebrenica, or Mostar. Otherwise the chances for peace  that were created in Sarajevo will again be wasted.    LEIPZIGER VOLKSZEITUNG stresses another aspect. The NATO  ultimatum for Sarajevo does not only mean a decision for the  Serbs over war or peace with NATO, but it is part of the  historic changes that are currently taking place. Bosnia is not  a NATO member, and no NATO state has been attacked. Still, NATO  prepared itself for military strikes -- for the first time under  such preconditions since its founding in 1949. Thus, NATO has  abandoned the principles valid during the East-West  confrontation and has broken new ground the outline of which is  not yet clearly discernible. The assessment of this step will  probably only be possible after the next few decades, when new  global structures are developed.    DIE WELT states: Russia's return to the policy vis-a-vis the  Balkans is of particular significance. With the deployment of  Russian soldiers in the Bosnian theater of war, Moscow has  adopted a leading position allowing it to codetermine or block  any political solution. Blocking NATO was one of Moscow's goals  from the very beginning. Because of increased consideration for  Russia's interests, the consequences will become visible in  Athens, Ankara, and everywhere else in southeastern Europe.  Russia is behaving like a major European power, and it will  again find political customers via Belgrade, particularly  because the internal cohesion of NATO has been critically  weakened at its southern flank. Not only the situation around  Sarajevo has changed but the European situation, too.</p>

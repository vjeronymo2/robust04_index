			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEMINARY HEAD TO STAY IN POST PENDING RULING  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert D. Preus will remain president of Concordia Seminary in Ft.  Wayne, Ind., pending a court decision on whether he can be removed from office  while appealing a board of regents decision that he be "honorably retired."  </P> <P> In a ruling issued Aug. 14, the Allen County, Ind., circuit court granted a  temporary restraining order that keeps Preus in office until arguments are  concluded on an injunction that would allow him to remain president during the  entire appeals process.  </P> <P> The hearing process began Wednesday but was continued until Sept. 11, according  to a court official.  </P> <P> The regents voted July 27, by a 5-3 majority, to "honorably retire" Preus, who  has the reputation of being a staunch conservative within the already  conservative Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. In their resolution the regents  praised Preus' accomplishments at the seminary and in the church but said he  could no longer serve effectively in the face of "turmoil within the faculty  and staff."  </P> <P> The seminary was recently censured for violations of academic freedom by the  American Assn. of University Professors, which charged the school with  requiring faculty doctrinal commitments that are "incompatible with academic  freedom as generally understood and upheld at American institutions of higher  learning."  </P> <P> According to a report from the church, the circuit court issued the temporary  restraining order Aug. 14, one day before Preus' retirement was to take effect.  </P> <P> The church also reported that two of the three regents who voted against the  forced retirement of Preus have issued a public protest of the regents' action.  </P> <P> The Rev. Donald E. Kirchner of Chestnut, Ill., and the Rev. Raymond Mueller of  Rocky River, Ohio, said they believe the action violates the regents' handbook  and deprives Preus of appeal rights spelled out in the church's constitution.  In addition, they objected to the "precipitousness" of the retirement, pointing  out that there were only 19 days between the vote and the scheduled retirement.  </P> <P> At the center of the controversy at the seminary is the June, 1988, firing of  tenured Prof. Alvin J. Schmidt, who is suing the seminary.  </P> <P> Schmidt was fired on grounds that he advocated the ordination of women in  opposition to the synod's official position.  </P> <P> In an effort at compromise, Schmidt signed a prepared statement recognizing  that there are some biblical texts that forbid female ministers, but he added  an amendment expressing a desire to continue pursing his "right to academic  freedom."  </P> <P> However, Preus rejected the statement and ordered that Schmidt be fired.  </P></p>

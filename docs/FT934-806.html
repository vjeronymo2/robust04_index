			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Survey of Saudi Arabia (12): Why European carbon tax is an irritant - Oil production Saudi Arabia's post-Gulf war oil production policy has never been under greater pressure. The slide in crude prices - in late November these hit a five-year low - is the greatest test the kingdom has faced of its determination to hang on to the expanded share of Opec production it won during the war, when it boosted output to replace Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. But even if the kingdom were to agree to an expedient to buoy failing prices under the pressure of its Opec colleagues, senior Saudi officials suggest that any such move should not be seen as a deviation from the country's oil strategy. 'No short-term action on our part should be interpreted as a policy change,' says one. Some analysts made just such an interpretation after the October Opec ministerial meeting, when the organisation agreed slightly to increase its official output ceiling to 24.52m barrels a day but Saudi Arabia forsook any rise in its own production allocation. The kingdom's decision to stick to its output of around 8m b/d was seen by some as a slide back towards becoming Opec's 'swing producer' - a notion Saudi officials determinedly resist. While agreeing that 'price is an important issue', the officials refuse to discuss any possibility of Saudi Arabia cutting output below 8m b/d, and a share of Opec's total production of around a third. The officials hope the market will recover of its own accord. But the depressants overhanging the market - chiefly rising North Sea and other non-Opec production and the possibility that Iraq may return to the oil market - are unlikely to have diminished by the next Opec meeting early next year. Some analysts suggest that the kingdom may well have to countenance a cut in its allocation in 1994. However, Saudi officials are unlikely to see this as an abandonment of their commitment to sustained market share - one of the prime goals of post-war policy and one which shores up the kingdom's long- standing pursuit of moderate oil prices to assure steady growth in world petroleum demand and to diminish incentives to harness alternative energy sources. With these longer-term strategic aims in mind, and anticipating what many experts predict to be a 1m b/d rise per annum in world oil consumption to the end of the century, the kingdom has pressed ahead with expansion of its oil production capacity. Present capacity is around 9.4m b/d and is expected to reach a target sustainable capacity of 10m b/d by next year after a programme that Aramco officials say will have cost around Dollars 15bn. The scheme was planned before the Gulf conflict and accelerated - largely by demothballing existing facilities - during it. Aramco staff say that work to bring on stream the new light and super light crudes from Hawtah and neighbouring fields south of Riyadh is near completion and the oil should be available to lighten the kingdom's export mix by next year. In pursuit of the kingdom's concomitant goal of achieving maximum oil market stability through the greatest achievable integration, Saudi Aramco is continuing to seek joint venture refining partnerships in or near its main consumer markets. This strategy first found fruit with Aramco's 50-50 venture with Texaco, Star Petroleum, which locks in 600,000 b/d of crude in sales to Star's refineries and US east coast distribution network. A 35 per cent share in Ssangyong of Korea's refining operations followed in 1991 and it had been widely expected that the third deal would tie Aramco into a joint venture with Nikko Kyodo, Nippon Oil and Arabian Oil. The plan, which Saudi officials said had passed feasibility studies, would have led to the upgrading of two refineries in Japan and construction of a third in a deal worth an estimated Dollars 10bn. However, disagreement over the economic viability of the deal between two of the Japanese partners led to its cancellation in early November. Aramco is now in advanced negotiations with at least two south-east Asian oil groups - one of these is understood to be Nippon Oil - for an alternative deal that officials say will be of similar scale. An announcement is possible soon. Aramco has also long been known to be negotiating similar deals with European refiners, but nothing tangible has emerged from talks that the Saudi officials have tried to keep firmly under wraps. One reason for this, some Saudi officials say, is that the kingdom's opposition to European plans to introduce a carbon tax - which Saudi Arabia is in the forefront of opposing - 'weigh' on Aramco's negotiations, as to some extent do continuing and unresolved discussions on access of Gulf refined and petrochemical products to European markets. Saudi Arabia has long emphasised what it calls 'reciprocal security' in its oil relations - meaning that producer countries will commit themselves to policies guaranteeing security of supply in return for consumer countries' own commitment not to introduce barriers or restrictions to oil exports. Carbon tax is perceived as exactly such an impediment. Officials also say they have been dissatisfied with what they describe as the attitude of some European oil companies in seeking upstream access in Saudi Arabia in return for a downstream joint venture agreement. 'Once companies in Europe are persuaded that they should change their attitude and deal on commercial terms, then we'll be ready to enter into joint ventures,' says one senior Saudi.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu: "The </F> Alternative Is Autonomy"]    [Text] Only fools and liars would now deny that the Rabin  government's policy is leading to the establishment of a PLO  state in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza.    In Oslo, the government consented to set up Palestinian  executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. It  agreed to withdraw the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] from all  Arab-populated areas in the territories (and not just from Gaza  and Jericho). It handed over to the PLO responsibility for  security in all areas of withdrawal.    It is bringing the "Palestinian Liberation Army" (the  so-called "police") into the territories, equipped with armored  cars, helicopters, and machine guns, and introducing a  multinational force to give this PLO army international cover.  And it is letting the PLO fly its flag on the border with  Jordan and in the heart of Jerusalem.    The real aim of all this is, clearly, not to create  autonomy,  but to establish a full-fledged state. What will be the results  of this policy?    We have witnessed an unparalleled deterioration in security  since the signing of the Oslo accords and the government's  subsequent capitulation to PLO demands. Hardly a day passes  without Jews being murdered, wounded or maimed on both sides of  the "Green Line." On Wednesday, there was the horror of the  massacre in 'Afula, and yesterday the shooting in Ashdod.  Accompanying this renewed terrorism is a violent resurgence of  the old-style intifadah, with rocks and fire-bombs being hurled  in record numbers.    But heightened terror and violence does not cover the full  extent of the threat to Israel posed by the government's  policies.    For a PLO state in Judaea and Samaria will not be limited to  the West Bank alone. It will be only a matter of time before  such a state topples the Hashemite regime in Jordan and  incorporates the East Bank into its realm as well.    Israel will then be confronting a Palestinian-Islamic state  four times its size, one which will have assimilated the  Jordanian army into its forces, and which will be forging  military pacts with the PLO's allied regimes in Iran and Iraq.  As rulers of this state, the PLO will open its gates to  millions of Arabs who will claim the "right of return" not only  to Judaea and Samaria, but to 'Akko, Yafo and Haifa.    The creation of a PLO state will inexorably lead to the  formation of an emboldened Arab Eastern Front, stretching from  Tehran to Israel's coastal plain.    Who can seriously argue that such a neighboring state  portends peace for Israel? Indeed, 'Arafat isn't negotiating  with Rabin over peace, but over the creation of a Palestinian  state, which he says will constitute the first stage in the  notorious "phased plan" to destroy Israel.    The alternative to the government's policy aims to save  Israel from this kind of "peace." It consists of four main  elements:    -- Israeli sovereign control of the area west of the Jordan  River;    -- autonomy for the Arabs of Judaea, Samaria and Gaza;    -- exclusive IDF responsibility for security in the  territories;    -- association with Jordan in the final settlement.    The gist of the difference between the Likud and the  government is that we seek autonomy and not a state, while the  government seeks statehood and not autonomy.    Autonomy, by definition, isn't sovereignty. It is an  arrangement by which a national or religious minority can run  its affairs with minimal interference from a central government,  which retains such sovereign responsibilities as control of the  borders, external and internal security, and foreign relations.  Israel would thus continue to be the sovereign power, but it  would enable the Arab population to conduct most areas of its  communal life.    In a final settlement of Arab autonomy under Israeli  sovereignty, the overwhelming majority of the West Bank's Arab  residents who are currently Jordanian citizens should be able to  retain that citizenship. A suitable but necessarily different  arrangement would have to be negotiated for the Arabs of Gaza,  since, unlike the West Bank Arabs, they possess no citizenship.    The idea of the Israeli left, that any minority unsatisfied  with mere civic equality and demanding sovereignty should be  given an independent state, is patently absurd. Were it widely  accepted, Lithuania would have to grant an independent state to  its Russian minority, Slovakia to its Hungarian minority, and so  on, down the long list of countries which have unhappy  minorities embedded within national majorities.    Further, if Israel applies this principle to the Arabs of  the  territories, why stop there? Why not apply it to the Arab  minority living inside pre-1967 Israel, the Arabs of Galilee,  for example?    Such an approach necessarily leads to the resurfacing of the  1947 "Partition Plan," which the PLO says it will press from its  West Bank state. Enshrining the idea that the demands of  minorities for independence should be met is a surefire path to  the dismantling of the Jewish state, and of many other states.    Not surprisingly, autonomous arrangements are increasingly  being seen as the way to satisfy minorities' aspirations for  greater freedom without smashing entire countries into tribal  mini-states.    I am often asked: Would the Palestinian Arabs accept  autonomy? My answer is that they would accept it if they knew  Israel wouldn't give them an independent state.    This was precisely their understanding when they went to  Madrid to negotiate peace with a Likud government. But today,  they know there is no limit to what they can get from the supine  government in Jerusalem. Thus they have no reason to demand  anything less than independence.    When the Palestinians know there is a government in Israel  that steadfastly refuses to establish a Palestinian state, they  will agree to a compromise on autonomy. In such circumstances,  important Arab parties preferring autonomy to statehood will  undoubtedly emerge.    The present government in Jordan would certainly not want to  see a PLO state that endangers its future. Equally, Syria and  Saudi Arabia are likely to prefer the continuation of King  Husayn's nonthreatening regime to a Palestinian state aligned  with Baghdad or Tehran.    The Rabin government's mad rush to create a Palestinian  state  in Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza is reminiscent of the Carter  administration's peculiar cooperation in the rise of the  Khomeyni regime in Iran in 1979. Now as then, the results of  such a precipitous policy would be devastating not only for  Israel, but for the entire Middle East, and ultimately the  entire world.    Autonomy under Israeli sovereignty is the only political  alternative that can ward off the dangers inherent in the  government's bogus "peace" plan. It offers hope for a genuine  and durable peace between Israel and its neighbors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has denied foreign media  reports, which quote the ASSOCIATED PRESS, that the forces of  the oppressive gang of al-Ahmar have reached the al-Alam area,  30 km from the outskirts of Aden. The source said these claims  were totally untrue. They were the product of the delusory  imaginings of the military gang of the [word indistinct]  al-Ahmar gang, who had succeeded in feeding these false reports  to obfuscate the great defeats inflicted on their forces in  Abyan, Qa'tabah, Radfan, and Kirsh. The source said that the  remnants of the Amaliqah forces, which had claimed to have been  on the outskirts of Aden, are now scattered on the al-Arqub  after our heroic armed forces destroyed their main strongholds  in Zinjibar and Ja'ar. At dawn today our forces succeeded in  destroying the camp of the Amaliqah at Zinjibar completely,  burning all stores, supplies, and ammunition. They destroyed a  major portion of the Amaliqah vehicles and then pursued the  remnants of the force, which fled in the direction of al-Arqub.    The forces of the 30th Brigade, now deployed in their new  positions along the Lawdar-Mukayras axis, were able to join up  with the 20th Brigade in Mukayras this morning.    As for the military situation in Lahij, the 2d Armored  Brigade, which had been loyal to the bloody and oppressive  al-Ahmar gang, was successfully destroyed. The camp at Lahij  was captured. Many officers and other ranks were taken  prisoner, and some tanks and military vehicles were captured.  Most of them had been destroyed during the fighting in al-Rahah  in Radfan over the past few days. The defeat of the 2d Armored  Brigade made it possible to open the road between al-Dali and  Aden, and for our armed forces stationed at Radfan and al-Anad  to join up with the Abbud Brigade at al-Dali. The latter was  provided with supplies after it firmly withstood, with  exceptional heroism, an attack mounted on it by three brigades  from the al-Hamzah Camp, central security forces, and Republican  Guards from the Qa'tabah-ibb axis, in the heroic town of  al-Dali. The inhabitants of al-Dali had been subjected to a  mindless and indiscriminate artillery bombardment which lasted  an hour a day over three successive days.    The ground battles resulted in the destruction of tens of  tanks belonging to the security three force -- loyal to the  bloody al- Ahmar gang -- which attacked the town of al-Dali, but  their tanks and military vehicles were overcome and are lying on  the battlefield. The steadfast forces of the Abbud Brigade were  able to capture the positions of the attacking forces in the  [word indistinct] area of the town of Qa'tabah. The battles on  the al- Dali and Radfan fronts resulted in the failure of an  attack mounted by the 3d Brigade, from their positions in the  town of Taiizz, toward Kirsh. The attacking tank squadron was  destroyed, and many officers and other ranks were captured with  their arms and equipment by the (Dabuzah) Brigade, which is  deployed at Kirsh.</p>

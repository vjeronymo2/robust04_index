			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Britain's opposition Labor Party jumped to a 14-point lead over Prime Minister  Margaret Thatcher's governing Conservative Party among voters questioned in an  opinion poll. The survey follows the trouncing of the Conservatives by Labor in  recent European Parliament elections. Labor won its first national election  victory since 1974 in the June 15 vote. The Observer-Harris poll, conducted  last week, showed Labor with the support of 48% of those questioned and the  Conservatives with 34%. The environmental Greens party, which also scored well  in the European Parliament balloting, held the support of 8%, while the  centrist Social and Liberal Democrats fell to 6%.  </P></p>

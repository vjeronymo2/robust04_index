			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Foreign Demand for Labour Revives"] </F>   [Text] New requests for Chinese workers are pouring in as  the emerging labour markets in Hong Kong, Singapore and South  Korea pull themselves out of slumps.    An earlier Sino-British agreement for big-ticket financing  of  the new Hong Kong airport had given the go-ahead to Chinese  contractors, who virtually stopped their jobs because the two  governments were at loggerheads over the project's budget.    "The construction (by Chinese) is going on pretty well,"  said  Chen Yongcai, who oversees China's labour exports for the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation.    The Sino-British disputes were a major factor as the value  of  China's overall labour contracts shrank continuously through  June of last year.    Another reason for the slowdown was the restriction on  labour  imports imposed by Russia, a traditional market for Chinese  workers.    Unlike the Hong Kong airport issue, the Russian restriction  continues to cast a shadow over Chinese labour exports.    China and Russia have agreed on the export of l2,000 Chinese  workers to Russia, but only 2,000 have been allowed entry. The  remaining 10,000 are waiting on the Chinese side of the border.    Chen said the governmental contracts must be honoured.    The Russians are afraid that the influx of thousands of  Chinese labourers might unsettle the country's vast Far Eastern  region.    Some Russian reports have falsely claimed that at least 1  million Chinese labourers are in the region.    There may indeed be far more than 12,000 Chinese in the  region, but few of them are bound by governmental contracts.  There is little dispute that Russian authorities should stem  the flow of these unorganized individuals.    Most Chinese workers who go to Russia under bilateral  agreements are engaged in vegetable planting and home  construction.    Chen reaffirmed that Chinese labourers will never seek to  linger in other countries when their contracts are fulfilled.    Another Chinese official expressed the belief that the  difficulties in Sino-Russia trade are only temporary.    Despite a downturn in the Russian market, China's labour  export contracts in the first four months this year picked up  22.7 per cent over the same period last year to $2.05 billion.  Actual business turnover grew by 48 per cent to $1.44 billion.    Altogether 174,000 Chinese workers are overseas, 4,000 more  than a year earlier.    Chen said the increase was seen mainly in Hong Kong, Macao,  South Korea and Singapore.    He predicted that there soon will be more than 10,000  Chinese  workers in South Korea alone, as several thousand workers are  leaving for the country. Chinese workers there mainly serve in  small and medium-sized manufacturing enterprises.    Chen also revealed that China is ready to resume its labour  exports to Iraq as soon as the United Nations' economic  sanctions are lifted.    "And," he added, "we're ready to restore co-operation with  Yemen."    China withdrew all its workers, medical teams and teachers  from Yemen when war broke out there.</p>

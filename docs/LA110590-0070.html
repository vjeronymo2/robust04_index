			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOLDOVAN LEADER URGES CALM, SEEKS SOFTENING OF LAWS FUELING ETHNIC STRIFE  </P> <P> Moldova's president appealed Sunday for an end to street demonstrations and  urged his Parliament to reconsider laws that have stirred ethnic unrest and  violence in the republic.  </P> <P> The speech by President Mirca I. Snegur marked the first time that the ethnic  Moldovan leadership has accepted blame for separatist movements in the  Turkish-Christian Gagauz region of southern Moldova and in the predominantly  Russian and Ukrainian Dniester area in the east, lawmakers said.  </P> <P> It came one day after a meeting in Moscow with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev  in which Snegur and representatives of the separatist groups agreed to a  moratorium on acts that led to the ethnic crisis in the small Soviet republic.  </P> <P> Details of the moratorium have not been worked out. Lawmakers said it probably  would mean the Gagauz and Dniester regions would suspend their recent  declarations of sovereignty and planned elections.  </P> <P> In return, the republic's government would soften a language law that made  Moldovan the national language and required people in dozens of jobs, ranging  from doctors to hairdressers, to pass tests in the language by 1995.  </P> <P> The law has stirred resentment among Russian speakers and Gagauz residents, who  speak a Turkic language.  </P> <P> "We are not giving up our national rebirth, our language, alphabet, symbols and  so on," Snegur told lawmakers Sunday. "Simply, we must go back and look for  where, maybe, we have gone too fast for our fellow citizens."  </P> <P> The Moldova republic, formerly called Moldavia, was carved from territory  seized from Romania in 1940. The republic declared independence of Moscow in  July. The Turkic Gagauz minority declared a separate republic in August, and  the Dniester population declared a breakaway in September, claiming  discrimination by the Moldovan, or ethnic Romanian, majority.  </P> <P> In Romania, thousands of demonstrators on Sunday demanded reunification with  their ethnic kin in Moldova. About 2,000 Romanians marched to the Soviet  Embassy in Bucharest, shouting "We want Bessarabia back!" Bessarabia is another  name for Moldova. About 4,000 Romanians in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu  voiced similar demands.  </P> <P> Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who attended the meeting between  Snegur and Gorbachev, went on Soviet television Saturday night to warn that  Moscow would take tough measures if Moldova did not restore order.  </P></p>

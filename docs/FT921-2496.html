			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Securicor boosts parcels presence SECURICOR Omega Express's purchase on Tuesday of Federal Express's domestic UK parcel delivery business moves the group a small but significant step closer to the Post Office's Parcelforce, the dominant market leader. The Pounds 7.1m acquisition follows Federal Express's decision to withdraw from domestic European delivery services and concentrate on its intercontinental express services. Securicor Omega, a subsidiary of Security Services, is buying Federal Express's customer base, which last year had sales of Pounds 40m, and its computerised despatch system. Securicor Omega will not however, be responsible for any of the 3,400 jobs which are to be lost at Federal Express although the company will be increasing its own workforce by about 400. The acquisition could add about 3 per cent of the UK Pounds 1.6bn parcels market to the 12 per cent Securicor Omega already controls. But it leaves the group a distant second behind Parcelforce, which controls 33 per cent of the market. The new business will fit directly into Securicor Omega's existing network of 3,700 vehicles run out of 128 locations throughout the country. The company will also buy 250 of Federal Express's 3,000 vehicles. 'We are increasing market share with profitable business and are taking on Pounds 40m of business almost overnight,' said Mr Roger Wiggs, chief executive of Securicor, which owns 51 per cent of Security Services. Federal Express will retain the right to international collections and delivery inside the M25 orbital motorway around London. Securicor Omega will also deliver and collect all Federal Express's international parcels to and from destinations outside the M25. Mr Pat Howes, Securicor Omega chief executive, said that after buying into the UK in 1987, Federal Express failed to gain the critical mass for a nationwide domestic delivery service. It had rolled out its branch network too quickly in a market that was then hit by recession and the structure of its operations left it with very high overheads. Most of Federal Express's business was high margin overnight parcel delivery and not the lower margin two day service which currently makes up the majority of Securicor Omega's sales, Mr Wiggs said.</p>

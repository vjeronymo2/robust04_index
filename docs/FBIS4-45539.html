			<p>BFN     [Text] Two people were arrested for possession of  "capsules" of heroin, a case considered the first of this type  in El Salvador.    Juan Ernesto Vaengas Henriquez, 42, and Adrian Antonio Rodas  Guevara, 46, were arrested by the Narcotics Division of the  National Civilian Police and are accused of transporting 48  white, powdered pills encased in plastic. Upon analysis, these  pills were determined to be heroin.    The gross weight is estimated at 246.8 grams with an  estimated street value of 129,579 colones.    According to the police report, the arrest was made on 13  June when the individuals were traveling by motorcycle, license  plate No. M-25-171, down 79th Avenida Norte in the western  neighborhood of Escalon.    The police claim that the two had said they were involved in  drug trafficking and that international drug traffickers had  delivered to them the confiscated packages to be marketed in the  country.    Meanwhile, the detained have denied the charges, saying  "they  never had anything to do with that type of business."    Venegas has said he was an unemployed driver. He had on him  almost 300 colones when the seizure was made.    Rodas Guevara, who has held several jobs, a resident of San  Bartolo, Ilopango, had 30 colones in cash on him at the time of  arrest. Both individuals were placed at the disposal of the 5th  Penal Court of San Salvador.    According to chemists, heroin is a drug stronger than  cocaine  and is priced at an estimated $60 per gram as opposed to $25 per  gram for cocaine.    The main laboratories for the production of heroin in Latin  America are found in underground operations in Mexico, some in  Guatemala, and lately some in Colombia. The drug is extracted  from the plant know as poppy through very sophisticated  procedures. Addicts use it through injections, diluted in water,  or in special liquids.    This is the first time, as we stated, heroin has been  uncovered in Salvador.</p>

			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / International Company News: TWA makes further management reshuffle TWA, the seventh biggest US carrier, yesterday signalled the launch of an attempt to stave off a looming financial crisis and restore the struggling airline to profitability. Announcing the latest in a series of management changes, it said the new management team had 120 days to achieve three business goals: to produce a new business plan, secure new labour agreements with its unions, and to negotiate a restructuring of its debts. TWA emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November last year but has not made a profit since. All its credit facilities are drawn, virtually all its assets are pledged, and it has insufficient cash to repay Dollars 190m worth of debt falling due for repayment in January. Last week it announced that it was shedding 500 jobs immediately and up to 2,500 more within 30 days. It also announced the closure of its operations in Geneva and Zurich, Switzerland, and the suspension of polar flights between Los Angeles and Paris for the winter. Yesterday it said it had promoted Mr Jeffrey Erickson from chief operating officer to chief executive. Mr Donald Craib, previously chairman and chief executive, remains chairman. Mr Robert Peiser, a former TWA manager now working for a consultancy, returns to the vacant post of chief financial officer. Mr Erickson said the business plan inherited from TWA's Chapter 11 reorganisation was 'not realistic' and another would be finished within two weeks. The company was also involved in discussions with union leaders over new labour agreements. United Airlines of the US and National Airlines of Chile said they had signed a marketing agreement including code-sharing arrangements and joint frequent-flier benefits, initially applying to flights in and out of the Chilean cities of Arica and Antofagasta.</p>

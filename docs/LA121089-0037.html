			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> S. KOREA DEPORTS CHINESE STUDENTS ON FAKE PASSPORTS  </P> <P> Immigration officials deported 18 Chinese students to Japan on Friday after  they were found to be traveling with fake passports.  </P> <P> The students were sent to Tokyo about 17 hours after arriving at Seoul's Kimpo  International Airport last week with fake Argentine passports, airport  authorities said.  </P> <P> The students staged a hunger strike overnight at the airport after South Korean  immigration officials asked them to leave or go back to Tokyo where they had  been studying, airport officials said.  </P> <P> The students said they were going to Canada to seek refuge because they feared  punishment for having staged anti-government protests in Japan against the  brutal suppression of the pro-democracy movement in Beijing's Tian An Men  Square in June.  </P></p>

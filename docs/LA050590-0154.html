			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> NONSMOKING AREA INCREASED TO 60%  </P> <P> Despite a Chamber of Commerce plea that the marketplace should determine what  percentage of an eatery should be open to smokers, the City Council has voted  to more than double the amount of restaurant space that must be reserved for  nonsmokers.  </P> <P> As a result of the unanimous vote Tuesday, restaurants will be required to  increase their nonsmoking sections to from 25% to at least 60%. Bars and  outdoor areas can be excluded from the calculations. The ordinance was also  clarified to give restaurant owners the option of banning smoking entirely in  their eateries.  </P></p>

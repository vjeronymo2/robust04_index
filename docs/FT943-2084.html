			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Arts: The South Bank puts in its bids for lottery money The South Bank Centre, the UK's largest arts complex, re-launched itself yet again yesterday. It presented a new image in expectation that its Pounds 65m redevelopment plan for a brand new building (or rather the retention of most of the existing ones, but covered by architect Sir Richard Rogers in a transparent canopy) will be accepted as a worthwhile National Lottery funded millennium project. Research suggests that the very words 'South Bank' deter potential visitors, so in future it will stress its constituent parts, like the Royal Festival Hall and the Purcell Room. So welcome the abbreviated logo, SBC. The SBC will also persevere in broadening its range of music. Audiences have fallen from 80 per cent to under 60 per cent in the last two decades. In future there will be less classical music but it will be better themed and promoted. 'No bread and butter concerts - all jam', in the words of music director Graham Sheffield. To this end Pounds 150,000 will be spent on an advertising campaign aimed at building a new audience: there has been a sharp slide in regular concert goers. At the same time some of the outside bookings at the Festival Hall, which were scheduled by tradition rather than the expectation of a large audience, like youth orchestras and the annual NatWest concert, are being encouraged to switch to the smaller Queen Elizabeth Hall. Non-classical audiences are courted with jazz at the Purcell Room; all night concerts of Indian music; and six nights of Shirley Bassey in early October. Apart from the major Deutsche Romantik festival starting next week and a Purcell tercentenary season, the SBC is marking time until it knows the fate of its lottery bid. Sir Richard Rogers said yesterday that he aimed to create 'a people's palace. This is the obvious bridge joining the southern London community and the northern.' His reputation makes the SBC's application for Pounds 45m from the lottery much more feasible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A Gallup poll conducted in the first fortnight of  May shows that Workers Party presidential candidate Luiz Inacio  Lula da Silva continues to lead the race for the presidency.  With former president and incumbent Senator Jose Sarney  (PMDB-AP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Amapa] out of the  race, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who will stand as the Brazilian  Social Democracy Party [PSDB] candidate in the presidential  elections, is consolidating his position as runner-up in the  public opinion poll. According to the Gallup poll, 38 percent of  the people would vote for Lula while 23.5 percent would vote for  Cardoso.    The survey, published exclusively by O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO,  was conducted among 2,200 voters in 143 cities in 22 states  between 3 and 13 May. This was before Sarney decided not to run  for the presidency, but his name already had been crossed off  the list of the possible candidates submitted to those polled.  The survey shows that support for Lula's candidacy has increased  considerably since he had 31.7 percent in April. Nevertheless,  this support is still not sufficient to guarantee his victory in  the first round of the election. According to the Gallup poll,  Lula's opponents together garner 43.4 percent of the vote.    Cardoso's popularity has also improved a little. He had 20.2  percent in April. During a month in which he did not campaign  and spent most of the time in Brasilia trying to consolidate the  alliance that will field him as candidate, voters' support for  him rose from 11.9 percent to 17.9 percent in the northeast.  The main target of the alliance between the PSDB and the PFL  [Liberal Front Party] is to attract votes from the northeast.  Cardoso's candidacy is now weaker in the south.    Lula, who has been canvassing the country's interior for  more  than a year, fared best in the northeast, where 49.7 percent of  voters considered him their choice for president. His weakest  support was in the north and center-west regions, where he  obtained 34.7 percent. It was precisely in those regions where  Lula and his retinue spent more time on the stump. According to  the Gallup poll, he now has 40.3 percent of the vote in cities  with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants.    The other presidential candidates continue to fare poorly.  They all obtained better results in the public opinion poll,  but they still cannot muster 10 percent of the voters' support.  Leonel Brizola (PDT) [Democratic Labor Party], Orestes Quercia  (PMDB), Esperidiao Amin (PPR) [Progressive Renewal Party], and  Flavio Rocha (PL) [Liberal Party] together got 19.9 percent of  the vote. Unlike Lula, who entered an alliance with five small  leftist parties, and Cardoso, who formed a coalition with the  PFL and the Brazilian Labor Party, these four candidates will  run for the presidency on their own.    Cardoso only outstrips Lula among voters in the higher  income  bracket: Within Class A, he received 49.9 percent of the vote  and within Class B, 34.3 percent. He is at Lula's heels among  voters who are older than 50 and fares better in medium-sized  cities than big cities. There is a considerable number of  undecided voters: 18.3 percent of voters still are undecided  about who to vote for or do not like either candidate.  <H5>  Gallup Poll Figures </H5> <H5>  Voters'

Arsenis was accompanied by Mrs. Louka Katseli.    Speaking at the Municipal Committee's annual meeting,  Arsenis  said he is convinced that PASOK will win the two 1994 elections  and stressed that the government has the willingness and  experience to deal with the challenge of the Greek presidency  successfully. Referring to the government's foreign policy,  Arsenis stressed that Greece will regain its international  credibility and defend its national rights.    [Begin Arsenis recording] We proceeded with courage on the  Cyprus issue by announcing the joint Greek-Cypriot defensive  area. Without many words and much publicity, we have passed  everywhere the message that Greece is not joking, that we--the  government and the people--are ready to deal with the danger  from the East because we are not willing to give up even an inch  of territory, airspace, or sea to Turkey. We will defend our  national rights. [end recording]    Discussing the Armed Forces, the national defense minister  stressed that they belong to the Greek people and are not to be  used in anyone's feud. He added that the new law passed by the  government overturned New Democracy's injustices. [passage  omitted]</p>

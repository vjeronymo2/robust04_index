			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Major bolsters support among Tory backbenchers MR John Major significantly bolstered his support on the government's backbenches last night by condemning internal Tory 'squabbling' over Maastricht and issuing a powerful defence of his decision to press ahead with ratification of the treaty. In a plainly-put yet conciliatory performance that won compliments from all sections of the party, Mr Major said he would not 'rat' on Britain's commitment to its European partners to approve the accord. However, it remains unclear whether the prime minister's personal appeal to the loyalty of a packed meeting of the 1922 committee will prove enough to ensure that Wednesday's vote can be won by the government. Putting his integrity at the centre of the debate, Mr Major referred to the continuing impasse in international trade talks as grounds for pushing on with ratification. 'Why should we be able to tell France not to rat on Gatt, if we rat on Maastricht?' he asked. 'Progress on the Maastricht bill is to build confidence in the economy and strengthen the credibility and authority of Britain in Europe,' he said, adding that it was not 'a glorious posture' for the UK to hide behind the Danes. His blunt call for the support of party rank and file was said by several MPs to have re-established his leadership credentials and persuaded a number of potential opponents in next Wednesday's crucial Maastricht debate to swing behind him. Hardline Tory Euro-sceptics, however, said they would not be budged by the appeal. Mr Major said he would not try to 'ram' the Maastricht bill through the Commons, stressed the need for party unity and insisted the government's European policy was 'central' to achieving economic recovery. Party backing was also vital to the government in tough negotiations to come with Britain's European partners. 'There is an absolute necessity to remove the uncertainty of the European issue,' he said. 'Let us put aside the squabbling and get on with the discussing. We owe it to ourselves and we owe it to millions.' Mr Major also pledged that next month's Autumn Statement would include a package of economic measures that would raise the morale of the Conservative backbenches. He admitted to having learnt 'a salutary lesson' from the coal debacle. His speech came after the cabinet threw down the gauntlet to his Conservative Euro-sceptic rebels by opting unanimously for a head-on confrontation over the motion now set to be debated next week. Earlier the anti-treaty faction claimed that some 60 backbenchers are ready to defy the leadership and vote against the motion. Before the meeting, Mr James Cran MP, an unofficial 'whip' for the Euro-sceptics, warned: 'We are quietly confident that if the government is not careful it is heading for defeat.' Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman, also returned to the fray, using a speech to Henley Young Conservatives to call on the rebels to defeat the government or force a postponement of ratification until after the Edinburgh summit in December.

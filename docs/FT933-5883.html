			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Arts: Street Scene - Opera SECOND offering of the 1993-94 English National Opera season is an absolutely first-rate revival of Kurt Weill's Street Scene. The company has taken time to get under the work's skin - when first shown at the Coliseum, in 1989, this David Pountney production seemed disappointingly overloaded with staging tricks. Now these are scraped away, to reveal an operatic cityscape teeming with acutely observed character, and contained by an exact appreciation of Weill's multifarious musico-dramatic skills and single-minded purpose. In this 1946 'Broadway opera' the blending of his European and American styles achieves something entirely sui generis (not the less so for having Porgy and Bess in its direct line of ancestry). Rich in incident, with a knockout 'specialty number' in each act, the piece is actually a tightly unified examination of life at the raw end of the modern city. 'Why do we go on living in this sewer?' - the question framed by Sam Kaplan, the opera's conscience - is its theme. Street Scene is a work at once 'serious' and 'popular'; for me it is one of the masterpieces of 20th-century opera. Certainly, ENO perform it as though every member of the large ensemble subscribed with missionary enthusiasm to that belief. James Holmes, who conducted last year's revival, unfolds the tapestry with masterly tautness (which includes the knack of knowing where to relax his grip). Voices are occasionally covered (do I now detect amplification of the slighter singing voices, as well as of spoken dialogue?). In spite of this, every detail tells. Most of the current cast also took on their roles last year: the superbly in-the-blood accounts of Frank Maurrant (by Mark Richardson), Mrs Jones (Meriel Dickinson), Harry Easter (Richard Halton), Henry (Keel Watson), the song-and-dance duo (Philip Gould and Caroline O'Connor) - and too many others to list ' deserve a column of close-focused praise all to themselves. So does the lean, quicksilver Sam of Kevin Anderson (whose quietly reflective 'Lonely House' is a high point); in all her London appearances Lesley Garrett has done nothing better than this warm, candid, gutsy Rose Maurrant. But I cannot end without celebrating the new Mrs Maurrant, Josephine Barstow. She has already recorded the part (for Decca); now she adds it to her long list of ENO glories. Anna Maurrant is the opera's tragic victim; each of the company's previous incumbents - Kristine Ciesinski, Phyllis Cannan, Janice Cairns - brought something intense, illuminating, heartfelt to the part, and only a fool would want to claim latest as best. But Barstow's tremors and frailty, her brief moments of bruised tenderness, her soaring account of the Act 1 aria are the quintessence of her singer-actor's art. Sponsored by Woolwich Building Society; in repertory at the London Coliseum until September 28.</p>

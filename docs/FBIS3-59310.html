This is a strategic decision made by the  Communist Party of China in order to establish a socialist  market economy. However, how to implement the decision? This  question has aroused attention from all circles. On 19 November  this reporter interviewed Hu Ping, director of the Special  Economic Zone Office of the State Council, who was presiding at  the Fifth National WorK Conference on Economic Development Zones  held in Tianjin. Hu Ping used over two hours to brief this  reporter on 10 major trends in China's opening to the outside  world in the 1990s.  <H3>  Major Trend One: Objective of Opening to Outside World Is  Changing From External Orientation Based on Promoting Exports  From Coastal Regions Into "Neutrality" Centered on Keeping  Country's Imports, Exports in Equilibrium </H3>   China's exports, Hu Ping said, should continue to be  encouraged to compete on the world market and improve their own  standing continually. But if China only strives to encourage  exports, China will inevitably experience too many international  economic frictions. At the same time China cannot particularly  encourage imports. First, while there is demand, there is not  that much foreign exchange. Second, that course of action will  conflict with the overall goals of developing national industry,  adjusting economic structure, and establishing an independent  economic system. Therefore, with regard to the overall objective  of opening to the outside world, it is advisable to formulate a  "neutral" objective which neither particularly encourages  exports nor particularly encourages imports, so as to make it  possible both to maintain the market's attractiveness and to  enhance international competitiveness.  <H3>  Major Trend Two: Opening to Outside World Is Changing From  Moving in Forward Direction Into Moving in Both Directions </H3>   During the 1990s, while promoting domestic economic  development by making use of international economic forces, it  is necessary to employ a two-direction strategy, so as to  exploit the two markets, use the two kinds of resources, and  learn the two sets of skills in a comprehensive manner. In  addition to developing transnational business operations and  carrying out international trade, it is necessary to encourage  the carrying out of operations in Third World countries to  develop resource products in short supply on the Chinese market.  Such operations can simultaneously stimulate technology,  equipment, and labor service exports and increase the  availability of resources in short supply on China's domestic  market, thereby achieving several things with one stroke.  Comrade Xiaoping said that "it is necessary to adopt new ways to  increase South-South cooperation." To that end, the government  should provide support by adopting supporting policies on credit  funds, insurance, taxation, and the sale of products in China.  <H3>  Major Trend Three: International Economic Cooperation Is  Developing From Undiversified, Bilateral Level to a Higher,  Diversified and Multilateral Level </H3>   The development of the Tumen River proposed in recent years,  Hu Ping said, involves six Northeast Asian countries, China,  Russia, the DPRK, the ROK, Mongolia, and Japan, encompassing an  area of 30,000 square km. This area enjoys both geographical and  resource advantages, and, from a long-term perspective, has  great potential for cooperative development. The joint  development of the upper reaches of the Mekong River involves  the four countries of China, Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos.  Thailand is rather enthusiastic about it. Our Yunnan Province  has taken initial steps to open transportation routes to  Myanmar. This region is characterized by strong mutual  complementarity in hydropower, tourism, agricultural, mineral,  and other resources. Joint development, leading to the emergence  of a "golden square" in Southeast Asia, constitutes a new  situation in the opening to the outside world. With regard to  the western borders, Korgas Pass has also proposed a new line of  thought, calling for the establishment of a zone of border trade  cooperation between Xinjiang and Kazakhstan so as to create  channels of border trade between the two countries. Besides, the  Suzhou industrial zone to be jointly developed by the government  of Singapore and Jiangsu Province, a zone now in the planning  stage, will cover 8 square km in its first phase. All those  developments demand that we use political, economic, and  diplomatic means in a comprehensive way in an effort to produce  a new situation regarding the long-term effort to open up to the  outside world, a situation which is beneficial to us on a  long-term basis and based on international mutual  complementarity.  <H3>  Major Trend Four: Situation of Opening to Outside World Is  Turning From One Characterized by Development Centered on  Coastal Regions Into One Characterized by Deeper, More Extensive  Development Involving Border and River-Valley Regions </H3>   In the 1990s the "coastal, border, and river-valley"  strategy  will be expanded in terms of extending the geographic scope and  increasing the depth of development in the various industries.  Currently, foreign enterprises are not only cooperating with  state-owned enterprises, but have also created a new situation  characterized by the forming of partnerships with township  enterprises and private enterprises. The economic sector based  on public ownership can consolidate its status as the main actor  only through competition. Comrade Xiaoping said, "The further  reform and opening up proceed, the greater the capacity to bear  and withstand risks there will be." This argument is completely  correct.  <H3>  Major Trend Five: Opening to Outside World Is Extending From  Coastal, Border, and River-Valley Regions to Hinterland </H3>   There now exists, he said, a view that it is necessary to be  tilted in favor of some industries but no longer in favor of  some regions. This view has some merit. The opening up process  of the central and western regions should be appropriately  accelerated. When conditions are ready, it is necessary to add  some cities to the ranks of open cities. Investment policy  should be based on integrating industrial policy and regional  policy. With regard to guiding foreign investment, in addition  to following the established policies concerning the coastal  regions, it is also necessary to formulate some encouragement  policies in view of the unique strengths of the Northwest and  Southwest. For instance, it is necessary to study special  policies with regard to such matters as comprehensive resource  development, the development of the reservoirs area at the Three  Gorges of the Yangtze River, and the energy development in the  Southwest. With regard to the issue of the coastal regions'  helping the central and western regions in an effort to achieve  common development, it is also necessary to use economic methods  and adopt various forms such as partnership and cooperation in  accordance with Comrade Xiaoping's instructions, and create a  path in the 1990s.  <H3>  Major Trend Six: Construction of Development Zones Is  Changing From Separate Construction Into Group Construction and  Zones Are Turning From Being Unifunctional Into Being  Multifunctional </H3>   As director of the Special Economic Zone Office, Hu Ping has  special feelings for the development zone, a product of the  opening up to the outside world. After the cleaning up and  cooling down, he said, the remaining development zones across  the country which should get heated up will get heated up; that  is, it is necessary to act in such a way as capabilities would  allow, engaging actively in development while improving  efficiency. Those zones can thus become the new growth segments  of our country's productive forces and produce a new colony of  industry.    There is now a trend to form partnership relations among  development zones which are forming partnerships and carrying  out cooperation in the areas of information, planning,  designing, business promotion, management, personnel training,  etc. The development zones (including bonded zones) are  exploring the use of international practices for the deepening  of the development function so that they can develop in a  multifunctional and all-dimensional direction. The development  zones with the necessary conditions are exploring ways of  developing operations in the central and western regions or even  abroad. Many development zones have become windows of opening to  the outside world as well as bases for efforts to adjust  industrial structure, to promote the grafting of new  contemporary technologies onto old enterprises, and to make the  economy climb another step. As Comrade Xiaoping said, "The  development zones have a great hope."  <H3>  Major Trend Seven: Foreign Investment Is Changing From Being  Focused on Manufacturing of Exports Into Moving in Direction  Emphasizing Industrial Operations and Diversified Operations,  and Is Turning From Being an Investment Type Into Being an  Investment-Finance Integration Type </H3>   After 15 years of opening up to the outside world, foreign  investment has now reached a certain scale. The target area of  foreign investment has now extended to basic industries, basic  sectors, and some tertiary industries, and the trend is good.  Some large international corporations are making a strategic  shift toward China. It should be particularly noted that not  only is international capital inclined to invest in China, but  that it is also forming joint ventures with influential  enterprises in China on the basis of adopting the joint-stock  system and then having the stocks sold on the markets of  developed countries. The use of this practice indicates that our  country's industrial capital is being transformed into financial  capital and is moving from the domestic market to the  international market. According to the international financial  community, China, a "mountain-climbing tiger," will reach the  summit, and it is hard to estimate its international impact.  This development trend tells us that in using foreign  investment, it is not only necessary to focus on introducing new  technologies and developing new products, but also necessary to  carry out in-depth, multiangular, and comprehensive analysis and  formulate policies accordingly, so that the use of foreign  investment may develop in a direction which is both appropriate  to the new trends in international investment and more  beneficial to China.  <H3>  Major Trend Eight: Relations With Hong Kong, Macao, and  Taiwan, Once Based on Trade Cooperation, Are Developing in  Direction of Economic Integration </H3>   The years 1997 and 1999 are coming soon. After the problems  of resumption of sovereignty between the mainland on the one  hand and Hong Kong and Macao on the other are resolved, the  trend of economic integration encompassing the markets of Hong  Kong, Macao, and the mainland will further grow under the  general policy of "one country, two systems." Consequently,  capital and technology from Hong Kong and Macao in large  quantities will enter the hinterland market, and affect the  manufacturing sector, infrastructure, basic industries, tertiary  industries, and many other spheres on the mainland. The  semiofficial Trade Development Office of Hong Kong made Europe  and North America the focus of trade investment in the past, but  has carried out deep-going advances into the hinterland in  recent years by using the "uniform packaging" method. Recently  people in Taiwan have proposed that special zones, facing the  coastal regions of the mainland, be established in Taiwan. They  have cried out in alarm: "As Hong Kong has adopted the uniform  packaging method, what should Taiwan do?" Their idea of a  "Chinese economic sphere" has some sound elements. We should  provide adroit guidance in view of the circumstances, but should  not ignore the idea. It can be expected that there will be a new  trend in the economic and trade relations between the mainland  and Taiwan in the 1990s.  <H3>  Major Trend Nine: Opening Up to Outside World Is Extending  to Deeper Levels and Is Proceeding in a Comprehensive Manner </H3>   The expansion of opening to the outside world requires the  establishment of a set of new systems and mechanisms functioning  at all levels. The more deep-level problems the opening to the  outside world encounters, the more necessary it is to establish  an effective system of macroeconomic regulation and control. In  the future there will be fewer and fewer proposals to attract  foreign capital through preferential policies. Instead,  competition and service will constitute the key factor  determining whether one succeeds or fails. Therefore, it is  especially necessary to give emphasis to the construction of the  investment environment, including the construction of both the  hard environment and soft environment. The training of personnel  needed for the opening to the outside world is the fundamental  guarantee of the cause of opening to the outside world.  <H3>  Major Trend Ten: Opening to Outside World Is Changing From  Being Just an Economic Matter Into Developing in Direction of  Combining Economics and Culture </H3>   According to him, the integration of economics and culture  represents a worldwide trend at the present time, and cultural  strength is part of comprehensive national capabilities. The  integration of economics and culture is still in the phase of  coming into being in China. Promoting the combining of economics  and culture can give vitality, motive force, and attractiveness  to the economy being opened up to the outside world, and can  also provide a spiritual pillar and social constraining forces  contributing to the prevention of corruption in society, while  pushing China's fine traditional culture to a new high.    Hu Ping used a vivid, figurative saying, "the sea of  bitterness has bounds, but turning back will not lead one to the  shore," to describe the general trend in China's opening to the  outside world. The Chinese economy, he said, was on the verge of  collapse 15 years ago. During the past 15 years, the reform and  opening up have extricated China from the sea of bitterness.  Facts have proven that only by advancing bravely in the process  of reform and opening up will we be able to achieve the great  goal set for us by Comrade Xiaoping.</p>

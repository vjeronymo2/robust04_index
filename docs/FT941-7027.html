			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cautious recovery as UK bonds move higher - Market Report A steadier trend in domestic bond markets helped stem the setback in UK equities yesterday and the FT-SE Index managed to recover a fraction of the ground lost in the dramatic setback of the previous session. The recovery was fragile, however, and although market strategists sounded more confident on the outlook for European interest rates, they were resigned to a further tightening of policy by the US Federal Reserve in the near future. The bond markets continued to exercise powerful sway over equity trading. Firmness in short-dated UK gilts reinforced views that domestic interest rates are unlikely to rise in the near term, and there was a good recovery in longer dated government bonds which had fallen severely on Thursday. At the close, the longs were below the day's best levels with net gains of around  1/4 of a point, while the shorts had gained around  5/8 . Some traders detected the hand of the Bank of England as a buyer of government bonds. A rate cut in Belgium had little effect on sentiment in London. The Footsie traced an erratic path as the stock market kept a close eye on bonds. Early deals saw the Index down by 24 points as the last of the overnight seales passed through the market. Shares then turned smartly higher, only to fade as some continental European markets softened, before moving up afresh to touch the day's peak of 3,283.3 on the Footsie, a net gain of more than 15 points when first deals on Wall Street looked favourable - but for only a few moments. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 3,281.2, a gain of 13.7 on the day. The Mid 250 Index remained easier, shedding a further 3.1 to 3,919.9. Seaq volume increased to 792.5m shares yesterday from the relatively unimpressive 753.8m recorded during Thursday's heavy fall in the market. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail, or customer business, on Thursday was worth Pounds 1.7bn, not by any means a record figure. Last night also brought the end of a two-pressure week equity trading account which has seen the London stock market fall by about 2.9 per cent as it has become increasingly concerned by the signs that the US Federal Reserve is tightening credit policies. This week has seen the pace quicken and the Footsie drop by 101.4 points in the wake of testimony to Congress by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Analysts of the London equity market remained relatively favourable on the near-term outlook. Mr Marcus Grubb of Salomon International joined the ranks of those seeing this week's fall as signalling 'time to buy.' Among London's investment banks, NatWest Markets described recent events as 'A setback, not a bloodbath,' while SG Warburg commented, 'The froth blows off.' There was some weariness both in the market and among traders as dealing came to a close yesterday. The modest weight of selling in equities left marketmakers to take the brunt of the rapid fall in share prices. Coupled with increased activity in the derivatives sectors, this left the big trading firms struggling to get their dealing books in balance for the end of the trading account. Although nerves had clearly steadied, London's nervousness in the face of an uncertain opening in New York underlined the new, and less confident, mood in the marketplace.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Menem unveils Argentine Nazi files PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina signed a decree yesterday opening to the public secret government archives on Nazi war criminals in Argentina, John Barham reports from Buenos Aires. 'Argentina had hidden for 40 years a truth that the world wanted to know,' he said at an elaborate ceremony. He decided to lift the veil of secrecy on the eve of a state visit to the US last November after members of the American Jewish community called on him to release documents that might throw light on Argentina's role in harbouring wanted war criminals. Mr Menem has made great efforts to shed Argentina's reputation for anti-semitism and distance himself from the ruling Peronist party's pre-war Nazi and Fascist roots. He has also striven to improve relations with Argentina's 300,000-400,000 strong Jewish community and the Israeli government as part of his strategy of forging closer ties with western governments. Mr Menem invited Jewish leaders, the Israeli ambassador and ambassadors from the Group of Seven industrialised nations, as well as cabinet ministers and head of the armed forces, to witness signature of the decree. At least 15 prominent Nazis fled to Argentina after the second world war, including Adolf Eichmann and Josef Mengele, two of the most wanted Nazi criminals. They found a ready welcome from President Juan Peron. Jewish organisations say Peron issued Argentine passports to thousands of Nazis, and subsequent regimes protected war criminals from Israeli and German extradition attempts. Eichmann was captured by the Israeli secret service and executed in Israel in 1962. Mengele fled to Paraguay soon after, dying in Brazil in 1979. Josef Schwamberger, accused of murdering 5,000, arrested in 1987 and sent to Germany for trial, was the only Nazi Argentina ever extradited.</p>

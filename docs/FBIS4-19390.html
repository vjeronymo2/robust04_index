			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Larry Elliott: "Sutherland and Brittan Hail GATT </F> as Rescuing the World From Trade Turmoil"]    [Text] Marrakesh -- The culmination of the  seven-and-a-half-year Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation  talks in Morocco today has dragged the global economy back from  the brink of protectionism, regionalism and possible military  conflict, according to the director general of the GATT  organisation, Peter Sutherland.    In an interview with THE GUARDIAN, Mr Sutherland said that  the package cemented the extension of the market economy and  would prevent the interests of developing countries from being  marginalised.    Claiming that there would only be winners from the opening  up  of trade, he said: "It's notable that the strongest proponents  of the multilateral system have been the developing countries,  and the worst elements of protectionism have been in the  developed world."    Mr Sutherland said that he understood the sense of grievance  held by many developing countries who felt that the fate of the  Uruguay Round had been determined in Washington and Brussels.    He was critical of the attempts by the United States and  France to raise the question of labour rights in the last few  weeks.    "Profound anxiety has been expressed by a large number of  developing countries about this particular issue," he said.    Mr Sutherland said that no preparatory work had been  completed on introducing social clauses into the GATT agreement,  and that there was widespread fear among the poorer nations that  "protectionism lurked behind it."    The GATT director general, who was appointed last summer to  rescue the talks from potential collapse, said he believed that  the eighth and most bitterly divisive of the GATT rounds would  be the last. Future negotiations would be conducted on an  issue-by-issue basis by the new World Trade Organisation [WTO],  even though Mr Sutherland is unlikely still to be at the helm.    "I do not see a long-term career as an international civil  servant," he said.    He brushed aside fears that the poorer nations, particularly  in Africa, would lose out as a result of the deal. "There are  no losers and the biggest winners will be those who would be in  danger of being marginalised."    Like Sir Leon Brittan, the chief European Union [EU]  negotiator, Mr Sutherland considered that one of the great  achievements of the round had been the acceptance by the United  States that trade disputes should be settled through the WTO  rather than unilaterally imposing sanctions via America's Super  301 powers.    Sir Leon, in a separate interview, said Washington realised  that the WTO would "severely constrain the way it can have  recourse to Super 301."    He said: "It could only be used in those circumstances that  are not convered by the Uruguay Round, and there are not many of  those."    The European Commission vice president, widely praised for  his deft handling of the bilateral talks with the United States,  said that Brussels was pleased with the final package. "We have  secured a major reduction in tariffs reinforced intellectual  property rights, and created the WTO, which has substituted the  rule of law for the law of the jungle," he said.    "In addition, we have secured a deal on agriculture that  reinforces reform of the common agricultural policy but is still  something everybody could live with."    Sir Leon remains hopeful that the kudos gained from helping  to broker the GATT deal will win him support when the EU heads  of state choose a successor to Jacques Delors in June.    To that extent he has been trying to woo friends in all  parts  of the Union. He has been providing limited backing for the  French over the social clauses, yet accused Paris of "cutting  off its nose to spite its face" when it threatened to refuse to  sign the lucrative deal with the United States on public  procurement unless the Germans dropped its case at the European  Court over restrictions on importing bananas.    He also made it clear that the UK should understand the  determination among its EU partners to press ahead with monetary  union, adding that a single currency was still a possibility for  a "critical mass" of countries by 1999.    Unlike Mr Sutherland, who said: "I have no ambition and nor  am I a candidate for any other position," Sir Leon said that he  wanted the top job in Brussels.    He said that he had no regrets about leaving British  domestic  politics. "At the time, I was uncertain about whether to take  the job (as a European commissioner). Now it's difficult to  imagine I could have been," he said.</p>

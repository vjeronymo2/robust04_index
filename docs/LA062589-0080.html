			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 5 YEARS, ETHIOPIA JEWS FIND THAT ISRAEL ISN'T LAND OF MILK, HONEY  </P> <P> Five years have passed since Ayano Mamo abandoned his farm and began a  monthslong odyssey from the forests of Ethiopia to the Holy Land, where "all  would be bright and wonderful."  </P> <P> Now Mamo, like many of Israel's 16,500 Ethiopian Jewish immigrants, feels  disillusioned and alienated in a country where quiet, traditional Africans  don't quite fit in.  </P> <P> Their primitive farming methods are not needed, their lack of sophistication is  a cause for condescension, and their skin color is sometimes a target of  discrimination.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Even Faith Questioned  </P> <P> Even their Jewish faith has been questioned.  </P> <P> The Ethiopians' disappointment is all the greater because of their harsh  struggle to emigrate and their dramatic arrival from Sudan in the secret  "Operation Moses" airlift, for which the United States provided planes and  pilots. The operation was overseen by George Bush, then Ronald Reagan's vice  president.  </P> <P> Mamo's road to Israel was harder than most.  </P> <P> After leaving his village in 1984, he was detained by anti-government Ethiopian  rebels for a month. They beat his wife and stole his money.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Walked to Sudan  </P> <P> Let go, the family joined 150 other emigrants in walking to Sudan. It took a  month, and without adequate food and water their 2-year-old daughter died, one  of 10 who perished en route.  </P> <P> In Sudan, 25 more of the group died of malnutrition and disease, including  Mamo's aunt, uncle and three nephews.  </P> <P> "We had faith in the Holy One, blessed be He, that despite the suffering, He  was with us," Mamo said through an interpreter in his native Amharic at his  apartment in the southern coastal city of Ashkelon.  </P> <P> As he walked through the desert, Mamo said, he "thought about the Israel of my  dreams. All would be bright and wonderful. Even at night there would be  sunshine, after we gathered in from the exile."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unemployment High  </P> <P> Five years since the exodus, almost 30% of Ethiopians still live in  dormitory-style government housing centers. The National Council for Ethiopian  Jews says unemployment among the Ethiopian immigrants above age 35 is about  45%.  </P> <P> Mamo, 54, lives in a small government-supplied apartment with his wife and four  of his children. He has no job, partly because he acquired a blood disease from  drinking polluted water on the trek to Sudan and cannot do heavy work.  </P> <P> The apartment complex where he lives is filled with almost 2,000 Ethiopian  immigrants and is disparagingly called the "Ethiopian Ghetto" by unsympathetic  neighbors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Children Adapt Quickly  </P> <P> Israeli officials say they are making progress in settling the new immigrants.  The children have proved able to quickly adapt to the new culture, with more  than 400 Ethiopians enrolled in Israeli universities and many others serving in  elite army units.  </P> <P> But officials concede that the newest immigrants had more difficulties than any  of the Jewish communities that came from Europe, the Middle East and North  Africa as part of the in-gathering that began after the creation of Israel as a  nation in 1948.  </P> <P> "Most new immigrants spoke French or English and they had some skills," said  Uri Gordon, director of immigration and absorption in the Jewish Agency. "With  the Ethiopians, we had to start anew."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Intensive Hebrew Classes  </P> <P> He said Ethiopian immigrants are given intensive Hebrew classes and provided  social workers to help them acclimate.  </P> <P> The three-month "Operation Moses" airlift in 1984 brought more than 8,000  Ethiopian Jews to Israel, joining others who managed to flee earlier.  </P> <P> The new Ethiopian immigrants, many villagers who spoke only Amharic, found  themselves shunted aside in a society known for its chutzpah, a Hebrew word  meaning audacious to the point of rudeness.  </P> <P> "We left our culture and came here where they don't speak our language or  follow our customs, and now we find ourselves in poor jobs and gaining little  respect," said Mesfin Ambau, director of the Jerusalem-based Organization of  Ethiopian Immigrants. "There is a lot of pain inside."  </P> <P> The Ethiopians' first confrontation in Israel was with the nation's powerful  rabbinate, which ruled that the community, after 2,000 years of isolation from  world Jewry, had deviated in its religious practice and needed to undergo  symbolic conversions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Nothing Hurt Us More'  </P> <P> "Nothing hurt us more than that," said Ziv Sahelev, 20, an Ethiopian immigrant  who lives in a government absorption center.  </P> <P> The Ethiopians refused any type of conversions, and the rabbinate was forced to  seek a compromise that quieted the dispute.  </P> <P> Like more than a third of the Ethiopian community, Sahalev left behind close  relatives, in his case his father and three sisters, on the expectation that he  would return and bring them to the Promised Land.  </P> <P> But Ethiopia's Marxist government, which has no diplomatic relations with  Israel and has close relations with radical Arab states, halted the airlift  shortly after it was disclosed, and 15,000 Jews remain stranded in Ethiopia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Suicide Rate  </P> <P> Rahamim Elazar, director of the National Council for Ethiopian Jews, said  Ethiopian youngsters, many separated from their parents, have a suicide rate  five times higher than other Israeli teen-agers.  </P> <P> "There are so many who were left behind, and the children feel terribly  guilty," he said.  </P> <P> Sahalev said that since he came to Israel, he has given up hope of returning to  Ethiopia to bring out the rest of his family.  </P> <P> "I write to them every week, and after a month or two I get an answer," he  said.  </P> <P> Another problem for the Ethiopians is that they are virtually the only blacks  in Israel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Butt of Jokes  </P> <P> "Sometimes people joke with me and point at me and start saying, 'Look, he's  black,"' Sahalev said. "It makes me feel very uncomfortable."  </P> <P> In Kiryat Chaim, a residential area of small cottages near Haifa in northern  Israel, neighbors rose up in protest when the Jewish Agency moved four large  Ethiopian families into the area's only apartment complex in January.  </P> <P> "It's a quiet area, and people came to me and complained that the Ethiopian  children made noise at night, they didn't throw their garbage away," said Giora  Fischer, district head of Kiryat Chaim.  </P> <P> "In informal ways, they also made it clear to me that they felt their property  values were declining."  </P></p>

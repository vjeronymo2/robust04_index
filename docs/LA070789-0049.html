			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> A theatergoer in Pittsburgh found out first hand Wednesday night what it means  to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. During a fight scene in  the final act of the Three Rivers Shakespeare Festival's production of  "Hamlet," a dagger sailed into the third row and hit Mrs. Patricia Spahic. The  blade glanced her forehead, leaving a cut. Richard McMillan, who was playing  Hamlet, immediately stopped the show and asked if there was a doctor in the  house as the lights came up. A physician rushed to the woman's side and helped  the stage crew escort her to an ambulance. The play resumed within minutes.  Mrs. Spahic, 63, of Ambridge, was treated at a hospital and released. The  mishap occurred during the fight in which Hamlet and Laertes both die. As  Hamlet drew his dagger, it slipped from his grasp. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

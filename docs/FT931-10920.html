			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Lott sings Poulenc - Recital Felicity Lott and Graham Johnson, her regular piano partner, gave on Tuesday a Wigmore Hall recital devoted entirely to the songs of Francis Poulenc. This is perhaps a braver enterprise than at first glance it might appear. For while the world is filled with Poulenc-lovers - people convinced that his body of melodies comprises some of the richest, most vital and most 'personal' song-writing this century - there are also others who simply fail to 'get' him. In a recital presented as this one was - chronologically (songs from 1918 to 1961) - the programme was varied with highest expertise. And yet it did run an inevitable risk that the relatively small musical range within which Poulenc worked might be underlined - not to mention his adherence to a relatively small number of 'manners' (surreal-skittish, rueful-nostalgic, sly-witty) and even the personal tics (melting cadences, final-phrase use of upward-rising intervals) that can seem like mannerisms. Poulenc is not performer-proof. Style, carefully developed but lightly worn, is therefore of the essence in showing off in the best possible light the variety, emotional warmth and sheer delicacy of his songs. In this concert the style was caught, the light trained, with absolute mastery: I thought it one of the most perfectly planned and executed recitals I have ever been privileged to attend. Lott and Johnson were giving it at the close of a European tour (which included a Paris concert apparently rapturously acclaimed), and by Tuesday evening both had absorbed into their artistic fabric every note and word. The sense of rapport, of subliminal give-and-take that informed every song-performance went worlds beyond the usual well-prepared recital experience. It was a concert in which platform demeanour - the soprano a figure of extraordinary chic a l'anglaise dressed by Givenchy - was made one of the interpretative weapons. But never too prominently: the raising of an eyebrow or the flick of the wrist was allowed to speak volumes. Mainly, however, it was the exquisite silvery flow of the Lott soprano (in absolutely peak condition just now) and the conversational ease and beauty of her sung French that did the work. Pattering away in 'Reine des mouettes' (from Metamorphoses), floating with taut-drawn gentleness the ravishing quiet lyricism of 'Tu vois le feu du soir', or concluding with the bittersweet comedy of 'La Dame de Monte-Carlo', she seemed to tap into every current of poetic and musical feeling. This level of achievement is rare in any musical sphere: Lott and Johnson must have made legions of Poulenc converts-for-life across Europe.</p>

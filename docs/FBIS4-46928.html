			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kovalev, under the rubric "Problem": </F> "There Was Once Such a Profession as Defending the Motherland"]    [Text] As of today, 1,750 young residents of St.  Petersburg have refused to report to military commissariats.    Yesterday, Deputy Mayor Vladimir Putin held a conference at  the Smolnyy on the issues of military draft. It was announced  that the fall draft had not been completely finished until  March. In the process, 16,000 people from St. Petersburg were  drafted into the ranks of the Armed Forces. Participants in the  conference noted that the number of draftees without a secondary  education has increased sharply in the last three years. Some 35  percent "admitted they have used drugs." Strange as it may be,  only one-quarter of the total number of latter-day servicemen  "consume alcohol." Many young men are seriously ill; as a  result, one in three is found unfit for service.    Participants in the conference expressed their  dissatisfaction with "legal nihilism mounting" among young  people recently: As of today, 1,750 people have refused to  report to military commissariats. In conjunction with this, the  issue of coordinating the efforts of military commissariats, the  militia, the procuracy, educational establishments, and rayon  administrations was raised at the conference once again. These  structures intend to work out soon a concept in keeping with  which rules specifying the draft system in St. Petersburg will  be approved.    Representatives of the Leningrad Military District gave hope  to the draftees of St. Petersburg by informing them that there  is no threat of service far away from home, noting in the  process that "young people who already have their own families  will definitely serve in the vicinity of St. Petersburg." It is  planned that only servicemen who have served for no less than  half a year will be sent to the "hot spots" of our country, and  then only on a voluntary basis.</p>

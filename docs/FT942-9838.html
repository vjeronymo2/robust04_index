			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Price pressure clouds outlook for Mercury: The UK telecoms company's discount strategy is threatened Mercury, the god of commerce, is sometimes depicted holding a purse full of cash. The UK telecommunications company bearing his name could do with both the purse and his more customary winged sandals to aid it in the increasingly competitive UK telecoms market. A study of industry price trends published yesterday by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, highlights Mercury's predicament. It shows telecoms prices falling fast across Europe in the past five years; in Britain, Mercury's price differential with BT has progressively reduced. This raises questions about Mercury's future strategy, for until now it has essentially been 'BT-minus-about-10-per-cent'. Recognising telecoms as a commodity business, Mercury has sought to maintain a guaranteed discount to BT, making little pretense of offering a more advanced service. pressure on Mercury's price discount to BT can only increase. On the one hand BT is being forced to cut prices rapidly: its pricing agreement with Oftel, the industry regulator, obliges it to cut tariffs by 7.5 per cent a year after allowing for inflation. On the other hand, new entrants to the UK's long-distance telecoms market are targeting Mercury as strongly as BT. Re-sellers such as Worldcom, a US group, and Energis, the National Grid subsidiary which is erecting a fibre-optic network on the nation's electricity pylons, are aiming to enter the City of London, where Mercury is now the dominant long-distance carrier. The first six months of the current financial year saw Mercury's turnover rise by 24 per cent; but operating profit grew by only 5 per cent, notably less than the other companies in the Cable &amp; Wireless group of which it is part. Special factors - including the opening of a state-of-the-art customer service centre in Manchester - partly account for the squeeze, but leading analysts remain downbeat about Mercury's medium-term prospects. 'There is considerable uncertainty about the outlook for Mercury's profits in the next two years,' says Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst with Robert Fleming, the investment bank. He notes in particular Mercury's surprising decision last December to take Oftel, the industry regulator, to court over the inter-connection charges it has to pay BT. 'They would not take the regulator to court unless they felt seriously in need of regulatory relief.' Mercury's justification for the court case supports that view. It claims it needs a more flexible inter-connection regime, based on total capacity not the per-minute cost of connecting calls, to break free of BT's tariff structure. Implicit is the recognition that its ability to continue mimicking BT tariffs, while guaranteeing a discount, is finite. The nightmare for Mercury would be if BT mimicked Telecom New Zealand, which last year took on its main competitor - Clear Communications - by ruthlessly attacking its cost base and matching Clear's tariffs. Telecom New Zealand reacted to Clear's 18 per cent market share gained in barely two years. With almost 90 per cent of the UK market, BT is unlikely to take such action in the near future. Even so, existing pressures mean that to sustain growth Mercury needs to increase rapidly its market share while differentiating its product from that offered by BT. Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, emphasises a second dimension. 'There is a new game opening up, with telecoms companies selling not just a commodity but communications applications.' He divides the applications into two types: the management of quasi-private networks - outsourcing, in the jargon; and new services, such as personal telephone numbers which direct calls to their 'owner', made available by 'intelligent networks' software. Last month Mercury announced a Pounds 200m investment in 'Project Eagle' to upgrade its backbone UK network for the purpose. Both strategies command respect. Armed with the resources of Cable &amp; Wireless and Bell Canada (which owns 20 per cent of Mercury), Mr Harris is far from David on his own with Goliath. Mercury has been successful in branding itself. And it has also done a fair job of weaning customers from BT: in the past two years alone it has gained more than 600,000 residential customers, aided by the - mostly US - cable companies attacking BT's local monopoly and routing their long-distance traffic via Mercury. But Mercury's strategy remains problematic. The outsourcing market is largely speculative: recent surveys show companies reluctant to outsource central telecoms functions. As for next-generation 'intelligent networks' services, the capacity of any one company to gain a medium-term leading edge in the market is doubtful.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sam Rangsi, deputy chairman of the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and minister for economy and  finance of the two- headed government, said on 8 May: I am of  the opinion that we are not able to dissolve the Khmer Rouge  [KR] troops. Even the North Vietnamese troops were unable to  dissolve the KR troops. This is not only my belief; the  overwhelming majority of the Cambodian people also thinks so.  The people are fed up with war; no one wants to wage war to  bleed his own fellow compatriots. Since the entire Cambodian  people want peace, the king has called for a roundtable meeting  to restore peace with peaceful means, (?thereby making Cambodia  prosperous and glorious once again). This is not only my point  of view, it is also the opinion of the people in general.    Sam Rangsi further said that the king's statement is very  correct, because nothing can be resolved militarily. War should  be put to a halt. The Vietnamese, who attacked the Khmer Rouge  and harassed, persecuted, and oppressed the Cambodian people,  were not able to fight a successful war against the Khmer Rouge,  so why do we, the Cambodians, need to bleed each other? This  only damages Cambodia's interests and benefits foreigners. The  latter want us to bleed and kill each other to make our land  free, thereby allowing them to dominate and occupy our country.  This being the case:    1. Our common belief is that nothing can be solved through  military means and that a solution to achieve national unity can  only be found through peaceful negotiations.    2. Since all of us want peace, therefore, only the king is  able to restore national reconciliation to allow our nation to  recover independence and peace 100 percent.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland Independent plans March flotation Midland Independent Newspapers, publisher of the Birmingham Post and Mail and the Coventry Evening Telegraph, has decided on a March Stock Exchange flotation. The MIN board is believed to have taken the decision yesterday and an announcement is expected next week. The decision to go ahead with the flotation makes it very likely that Sir Norman Fowler, chairman of the newspaper group, will give up the chairmanship of the Conservative party later this year to concentrate on his business career. A chairman of a publicly quoted company is unable to be a Cabinet member. Sir Norman has committed himself to MIN for the forseeable future and he is therefore expected to give up the party chairmanship after the local and European elections. It is unclear exactly how much of the company, taken over from Mr Ralph Ingersoll by a management buy-out team led by Mr Chris Oakley in 1991, is going to be sold but it is likely to be between 30 per cent and 40 per cent. Since the purchase, for Pounds 125m, the company has been expanding throughout the Midlands. The flotation should make paper millionaires of the management team of six who organised the buy-out. The group publishes a total of 31 newspapers and a number of weekly specialist titles and regional magazines. In the six months to June it made operating profits of Pounds 7.8m on turnover of Pounds 37.7m. Turnover for the full year will probably top Pounds 70m. MIN has been considering going to the market for some time but was holding off because of uncertainties over the government's attitude to VAT on newspapers. Setting aside interest charges flowing from the original purchase, MIN has nearly trebled operating profit in the period since Mr Ingersoll sold the business. The group's four main paid-for titles are the Birmingham Post, the Sunday Mercury, the Birmingham Evening Mail and the Coventry Evening Telegraph.</p>

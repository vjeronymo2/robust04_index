			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETARIES ARE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT;  </P> <P> GREATER NEED AND GROWING SHORTAGE OF CLERICAL WORKERS HAS INCREASED THE  COMPETITION FOR THEM, DRIVING THEIR SALARIES AND BENEFITS SHARPLY HIGHER  </P> <P> Karen Jorgensen, a Glendale-based recruiter, accepted a daunting assignment  when she agreed to help Nylon Molding search for someone who would work closely  with its president on a variety of tasks.  </P> <P> "I thought the search would be time-consuming," said Jorgensen, president of a  firm that provides executive search and personnel management services. "There's  the worry that the person you find may not be right for the job."  </P> <P> The task could have been very difficult, but the search was aborted when a  promising purchasing agent already working for the Monrovia-based manufacturer  accepted the job. Nylon Molding had found its secretary.  </P> <P> It's no longer unusual for companies to ask recruiting companies for help in  finding secretaries. Nylon Molding and many other Southland firms are taking  note -- there's a severe shortage of applicants for secretarial jobs in  Southern California.  </P> <P> The shortage stems from a growing demand for secretaries, combined with a  diminishing labor pool. But inadequate education and the attraction of more  glamorous pursuits are also contributing to the lack of candidates. In  response, more and more companies are paying higher wages, offering perquisites  normally reserved for executives and providing flexible working hours to woo  and retain clerical help. In addition, they are luring away employees from  other firms and paying their own employees a finder's fee for successful  candidates.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth in Demand Predicted  </P> <P> Nylon Molding, which makes fasteners for aircraft and computer manufacturers,  attracted an in-house candidate for the position of executive secretary by  touting the job as a prestige position with high demands and a salary to match.  Lori Armstrong was given a raise when she moved from the purchasing department  to the secretarial post.  </P> <P> The shortfall of clerical workers is reflected in many recent reports. For  example, 225 California firms surveyed in June by the Los Angeles office of  Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler &amp; Krupman, a management consultant, found that  22% couldn't find enough adequate applicants for clerical positions.  </P> <P> A 1988 survey of 1,500 California firms by Thomas Temporaries, an Irvine-based  provider of short-term clerical help, predicted a dramatic growth in demand in  the Los Angeles area. In all, 40% of the respondents anticipated a need for  additional clerical workers during the first six months of 1989. In contrast,  only 27% of the respondents in a similar survey anticipated the need for staff  increases during the first half of 1986. The increase in demand comes during a  period of demographic change, said Jerrold Bratkovich, a Los Angeles-based  consultant at the Hay Group, a management consulting firm specializing in human  resources. The timing is unfortunate because of a decline in the number of  people 21 to 35 years old, the prime ages for secretaries, Bratkovich said.  </P> <P> "There's a general reduction in applicants for most entry level jobs and that  will continue for some years to come," he said, The pool of people available  for clerical work is also shrinking because more women are opting for other  occupations, according to Bonnie Nash, president of Thomas Temporaries. "Women  who might have gone into clerical work are finding opportunities in customer  services, sales and consulting," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seen as Dead-End Job  </P> <P> Many are avoiding the clerical field because it has a poor image, according to  Faye Baxter, president of the California division of Professional Secretaries  International, a Kansas City, Mo.-based association that tries to promote the  occupation.  </P> <P> "It's not a profession many men or women are going into because . . . it's seen  as a dead-end job," Baxter said. "Secretaries are looking for recognition for  their value as a team player and as a contributor to a company's growth and  success."  </P> <P> Many executives and secretaries alike say shortages also exist because area  schools are not giving students the skills necessary to handle jobs such as  letter writing.  </P> <P> "The situation in the schools is catastrophic," said Thomas P. Christie, vice  president and director of human resources at Pasadena-based Century Federal  Savings &amp; Loan Assn. "Some companies are giving remedial help with reading  and writing. Some secretaries can't spell. You ask some to prepare a letter and  find they can't write."  </P> <P> To attract candidates inside and outside the company, more firms are offering  incentives, Jorgensen said.  </P> <P> "The trend is to offer awards based on overall office production and individual  performance -- incentives similar to ones offered executives," she said. "Some  companies are offering profit sharing, stock and bonuses if certain objectives  are met."  </P> <P> As a result of the demand and bidding, wages for secretaries in Southern  California are 15% to 17% higher than pay levels in the rest of the country,  labor studies indicate. Wages for secretaries employed in downtown Los Angeles  are generally 4% higher than the pay levels in the rest of the Southland,  according to labor specialists. They say downtown employers generally must pay  more because people with secretarial skills need an incentive to work downtown  because they can find work near home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adjustments Necessary  </P> <P> "The more experienced secretaries are getting substantial wages," Jorgensen  said. "Companies have to pay secretaries more in this area."  </P> <P> The secretary shortage is forcing adjustments on employers and employees.  Sometimes employers and job candidates do not adequately conform to the  realities of the new job market. Management consultants cite these incidents.  </P> <P> An Orange County manufacturer, unable to find an applicant on the West Coast  for a high-level clerical position, found a candidate on the East Coast. The  candidate accepted an offer, agreeing to a wage and benefit package that  included free use of a company car.  </P> <P> During a cross-country drive to the new job, the prospective new employee began  to feel heady and stopped periodically to negotiate improvements in the  benefits. Company executives were concerned that they had hired a very  demanding new clerical worker, but agreed to the requests. Finally, when the  prospective new employee asked the company for assurances that the promised car  would be a convertible, the company withdrew the offer.  </P> <P> A prominent Hollywood company offered about $50,000 a year for an executive  secretary position. However, the company has been unable to retain an employee  in the position because the supervisor, unhappy about the secretary's  relatively high salary, is "too demanding."  </P> <P> The shortage of candidates for clerical positions has awakened an appreciation  of the value of the occupation among executives, some management consultants  say. However, some secretaries believe that attitudes are changing too slowly.  </P> <P> "Not many women want to go into this (occupation) if they're qualified to do  something else," said Sandra Shaw, a Glendale legal secretary. This causes  secretaries to change jobs often, added Shaw, who has been a secretary for 20  years. "They walk out of one job and into another and think it's going to be  different -- and it's not. . . . We're professionals and we should be treated  as professionals."  </P> <P> As the shortage grows, more companies are willing to lure valued secretaries  away from other firms, Christie said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Finder's Fees  </P> <P> "Raiding has become an ordinary part of the (personnel mangement) job at some  companies," Christie said.  </P> <P> While some companies rely on personnel managers to recruit, others are offering  their employees incentives to find job candidates for clerical positions. For  example, employees at First Federal Savings get $200 for recruiting an  employee, said Jeanette Parr, vice president and director of resources at the  West Covina-based institution.  </P> <P> Still, it sometimes takes time to find candidates, Parr said. She said an  administrative support position requiring typing and phone-answering skills  recently went unfilled for four weeks.  </P> <P> Parr said some potential candidates shy away from clerical positions because  the occupation has become more technically demanding. For example, more  secretaries are required to work on computers.  </P> <P> First Federal recently trained Robin Ogden to operate a computer. Ogden, who  primarily handles word processing chores for a variety of supervisors, said she  enjoys her work.  </P> <P> "I've often heard women say, 'I don't want to be just a secretary'," Ogden  said. "More prestige and responsibility has to be associated with the job."  </P> <P> Lori Armstrong, who made the unusual move from the purchasing department to  executive secretary at Nylon Molding, expressed a similar sentiment.  </P> <P> Armstrong, who had worked in clerical positions at other companies for four  years before a two-year stint in purchasing, said she took the secretarial  position because it involved a wide range of duties. She said she helps  executives coordinate trade shows and direct mail and advertising campaigns.  </P> <P> "It was definitely a step up," she said. "There's still a lot of typing and  copying, but . . . the president sometimes bounces ideas off me. I feel like  I'm part of the executive team."  </P></p>

The police believe that the motive of the murder  was nationalistic and are looking for eyewitnesses. The  assailant escaped, apparently with the attacked man's revolver.    Three more people were killed in the territories this  morning  in incidents with the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that a youth was shot inside a  mosque in Nabulus and two locals were killed in incidents in  Gaza and the al-Burayj refugee camp. There is rioting in  Nabulus and Gaza, as well as in the Jabalyah refugee camp.    Over 40 Gazans were wounded in rioting this morning. In  Jericho and Ramallah, police stations were stoned and the IDF  responded with fire and tear gas. In Jabalyah, a terrorist  tried to throw explosives, but they blew up in his hands. Four  border policemen were also wounded in the territories this  morning. The IDF spokesman said the forces have been beefed up  in the territories.    Thousands of Muslim worshipers are still congregated on  Jerusalem's Temple Mount, and many of them rioted and hurled  stones at police forces, the media, and the Western Wall. The  police used tear gas to stop the stone throwing. Large police  forces are concentrated around the Temple Mount to prevent the  rioting from expanding. Seven policemen were hurt in clashes on  the Temple Mount. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that  it seems that there are casualties among the Muslim worshipers  on the Temple Mount. There was also a riot by Muslim worshipers  near Nabulus Gate. These worshipers were eventually dispersed  and some of them detained. Our correspondent Mira Amsalem  reports that thousands are still congregated at the Nabulus Gate  and are not going home.    Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert sharply denounces the Hebron  murder. In an interview to Qol Yisra'el, Mr. Olmert called on  Jerusalem's Arab residents not to be incited into acts of  retaliation.    Qiryat Arba' and Hebron Jewish leaders conferred with the  Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza  Strip and issued a manifesto expressing regret for the Cave of  Patriarchs murder as well as condolences to the families of the  fatalities. The settlers hold the Israeli Government responsible  for the action, but urge avoiding any harm to innocent people.  In the meeting, the settlement leaders called on Major General  Mufaz, the IDF commander in Judaea and Samaria, to step up the  protection and safeguarding of Jewish residents in the  territories. Our correspondent Gil Litman reports from Hebron  that the town is generally quiet. The Cave of the Patriarchs  has been closed.    The Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs is  currently convened in a special session to discuss the  situation. Prior to the session, Prime Minister Rabin had called  for a special news conference in which he issued a condemnation  for the murder in Hebron. Our correspondent Karmela Menashe  reports that Peace Now activists are demonstrating near the  place where the committee is convened. They tried to break into  the prime minister's bureau, but police forces pushed them back.    Our correspondent Yo'av Aviv reports that commercial strike  was declared in many Arab Galilee villages, and mourning  processions took place in several of them.</p>

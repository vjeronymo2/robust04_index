			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BTP alters focus after Pounds 18.2m BTP, the specialist chemicals company, yesterday reported a marginal increase in profits over the previous record year, in difficult trading conditions. Mr Rob Martin, finance director, said the new year had started on a 'firm note,' mainly because of foreign markets, which will account for two thirds of sales this year. There was no sign of demand rising in the UK. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 18m to Pounds 18.2m on sales up 14 per cent at Pounds 175m (Pounds 153m). Margins in the chemicals division had come under particular pressure in the UK due to the recession and because growth had been concentrated in the less profitable overseas markets. Earnings fell from 15.39p to 14.81p, but the company proposes an increased final dividend of 5.75p (5.45p) giving a total for the year of 8.85p (8.4p). Due to the Pounds 28m rights issue in February, part of which was used to buy two French adhesive businesses, the year ended with Pounds 6.5m of cash, compared with Pounds 8m of debt last year. Mr Martin said benefits would increase from reducing dependence on the UK market. By the end of this year, the company would derive only a third of its sales from the UK, down from 38 per cent in 1991/92, with another third derived from continental Europe and 20 per cent in the US. Sales in the chemicals division rose 20 per cent to Pounds 91m but operating profits were only 10 per cent up at Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 10.2m). Industrial sales rose to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 46.7m) but profits fell from Pounds 4.58m to Pounds 4.08m following poor performances in the storage and coatings businesses. BTP shares fell 3p to 238p.</p>

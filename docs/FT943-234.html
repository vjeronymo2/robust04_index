			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / ICL formalises link with Virgin Virgin Group, which last year announced it was entering the personal computer market, has formalised an agreement with ICL, the UK-based computer company, to manufacture its range of desktop and notebook computers. The deal, which includes joint marketing and distribution, is thought to be worth about Pounds 5m to ICL in the first year and at least double that in subsequent years. The Virgin computers will be slanted towards the games and multimedia markets and marketed through both Virgin and ICL channels. ICL will also have the right to use the Virgin name on some equipment. The UK company, in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, believes the Virgin name may help it penetrate the home-office and small-office market in mainland Europe. ICL's own-brand computers are chiefly aimed at business markets. ICL has been assembling up to 1,000 Virgin computers a month on an informal basis since the leisure group entered the market. Virgin distributes its PC products through its shops, mail catalogues and a small distribution network.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Mobile Communications (17): US market faces challenge of AT&amp;T power - Martin Dickson looks at the implications of the fifth largest takeover deal in the country's history The immense potential of the mobile communications industry in the US has just been underlined by the Dollars 12.3bn agreed takeover bid for McCaw Cellular Com- munications, the biggest operator in the cellular telephone market, by Amer- ican Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the largest US long-distance carrier. The takeover deal, the fifth largest in US history and the biggest in the tele- communications industry, will create an extremely powerful force in the booming cellular market, combining McCaw's entrepreneurial approach to business with AT&amp;T's brand name and technological expertise. The full bid takes the place of a deal announced last November under which AT&amp;T was to have acquired a one-third stake in McCaw, with the option to take full control later, and the change reflects the difficulties that the two sides found in implementing the earlier plan and the commercial advantages of a full merger. AT&amp;T's eagerness to get into the cellular market through the McCaw acquisition, and its willingness to pay what the market considers a fairly full price, represents a powerful endorsement of the potential of wireless communications in both the US and around the world. Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T's chairman, has a vision of 'anytime, anywhere com- munications'. That will involve individuals having their own mobile personal communications numbers, which they will carry with them. They will be contactable wherever they are, thanks to a variety of new radio com- munications devices, including phones, personal pagers, fax machines, computers, video screens and devices combining several of these functions. However, this vision is still a considerable way from ful- filment and faces numerous potential problems. First, the US telecom- munications industry has yet to turn mobile commun- ications from a relatively high-priced business tool into an affordable mass-market one. Second, cellular telephony has yet to become a particularly profitable business. The industry faces a heavy capital expenditure burden - some Dollars 11bn in 1992 - as it expands its customer base and moves from analog to much higher quality digital technology. It also suffers high costs in acquiring new subscribers - anything from Dollars 500 to Dollars 1,300 - and suffers from a 33 per cent churn rate - that is, the number of customers who move, change carriers, or cancel service in a year. At the same time, its revenues per subscriber are dropping as it expands its customer base from deep- pocketed business customers into the much more price-sensitive consumer market. Average monthly bills have fallen from just under Dollars 100 five years ago to around Dollars 70 now. To boost profits, cellular companies may need to reverse this trend, or improve their operating efficiencies, or both. Third, it remains unclear to what extent the cellular telephone industry will be complemented or challenged by a new system of radio telephony, called personal communications services (PCS), which should be in operation in the US by 1995 to 1996. Fourth, a huge battle for dominance of the industry is developing between the various participants in the rapidly converging US telecommunications and television industries. Still, there is no doubting the promise of mobile com- munications. The US cellular market has grown from virtually nothing in 1984 to more than 12m subscribers currently and is adding 9,500 new subscribers every day. EMCI, a communications consultancy, reckons there will be 14.4m US cellular subs- cribers by the end of 1993, with 17.7m by the end of 1995 and 25m by the end of 1996. The country also contains some 14m paging subscribers, and 1.4m users of specialised mobile radio, which provides businesses with mobile radio services to meet internal communications needs. Several mobile satellite services are also in the offing, aiming to provide wireless portable phone services in areas not reached by cellular. AT&amp;T's entry to the cellular business has the rest of the telecommunications industry worried on several counts. First, it poses a challenge to direct rivals in the cellular business, especially the nation's local telephone companies - the seven 'Baby Bell' regional business and independent companies such as GTE. When the US government set up a cellular network in the early 1980s it gave out just two licences in each area - one for the established local telephone monopoly and one for a new, independent rival. McCaw, which build up a national presence by taking over many of these inde- pendents, is already a tough rival to local monopolies and the injection of AT&amp;T's expertise promises to make it even tougher. AT&amp;T has one of the best- known and respected brand names in the US, which could help counter the cellular industry's lingering reputation for uneven service; it will be able to package new services combining long-distance and cellular operations; and the computer intelligence embedded in its network should enable it to offer a more seamless and sophisticated national service. The local monopolies are also concerned that it will eventually be able to bypass their wires and link up cellular users with the AT&amp;T network, depriving them of the huge access charges that long- distance carriers pay to local phone companies for completion of calls. The takeover will therefore be bitterly opposed by the Baby Bells and other local telephone companies. It also poses a strategy challenge to MCI Commun- ications, the second-largest long-distance carrier, which has no cellular interests at present. MCI does, however, have a war chest of cash, thanks to British Telecom's decision earlier this year to take a 20 per cent stake in the group, and some of this could be used for a cellular alliance. An important new element in this struggle will be PCS, a new form of cellular commun- ications, using inexpensive handsets and low powered micro-cell transmitters in office buildings and neigh- bourhoods, which promises to bring wireless communications to the masses. It could tap a vast new market. A 1991 study by Arthur D. Little, the management consultants, estimated that 10 years after PCS becomes universally available in the US, it could serve as many as 60m subs- cribers, producing Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn in annual revenues - provided the service was priced reasonably. The Federal Communic- ations Commission is expected to decide this autumn on several key PCS questions, including the rules for auctioning franchises. It has expressed a bias towards excluding existing cellular operators from bidding in markets they already serve. The cellular industry seems bound to lose some customers to PCS, provided the latter service proves cheap. But PCS may well turn out to be complementary to cellular, rather than a direct rival, with the former used mainly by pedestrians and the latter by vehicle-based callers. The PCS industry may be more fragmented than cellular - some three to five suppliers could be licensed in each area. But the companies which already have commanding positions in cellular seem certain to also be among the major players in PCS, thanks to their technical and marketing expertise.</p>

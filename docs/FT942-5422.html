			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Lasmo/Enterprise Lasmo has now been forced twice in a week to modify extravagant statements that it has made in trying to fend off Enterprise's hostile bid. In the latest and most serious case, the Takeover Panel said Lasmo's allegations that Enterprise had breached accounting standards were stronger than it considered acceptable. Whatever spin Lasmo tries to put on it, investors will take a dim view of a management that shoots from the hip in this way. Still, the substance of Lasmo's allegations have hit Enterprise hard. Enterprise's decision to write down sharply the value of assets at the time they were acquired in the late 1980s has reduced depreciation charges and boosted reported earnings. This has reinforced the impression that Enterprise cannot really afford to pay dividends at their current level. The company's share price has suffered. At last night's close of 382p, its all-paper offer was worth only 124p a share compared with Lasmo's share price of 142p. This 18p gap is the most important indicator of how the bid battle is proceeding. Enterprise has sought to close it by arguing that it can add value to Lasmo's business. But these arguments carry no more conviction than they did at the start of the bid. That leaves Enterprise in the same bind. It needs to improve the offer, probably by offering significant amounts of cash, if it is to clinch Lasmo. But that would put its ability to maintain dividends to its own shareholders under even greater pressure.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Italy's ex-communists drawn into corruption probe Italy's former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), is facing a major corruption investigation for the first time. The investigation, which the PDS says is government-inspired, centres on public works contracts awarded in Sicily during the 1980s to communist co-operatives. Over the last two years magistrates in Sicily have arrested hundreds of businessmen and politicians on corruption charges relating to distribution of lucrative public works contracts. But this is the first time the PDS has been targeted. Mr Massimo D'Alema, the PDS leader, accused the government of orchestrating a campaign to discredit Italy's largest opposition party. Milan magistrates have undoubtedly singled out premier Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest business empire in their anti-corruption inquiries. Nonetheless, the PDS has always defended the magistrates' independence against accusation of political bias. The Sicilian investigation has unusual aspects. It stems from an anonymous denunciation and is being pursued by the carabinieri rather than the judiciary. On Friday the carabinieri asked PDS headquarters in Palermo for a list of all officials dating back to 1980, and co-operatives' offices for a list of all public works contracts in the same period. Earlier, Mr Cesare Previti, defence minister, had hinted the judiciary would soon be turning their attention to the 'red trail'. And at the weekend Mr Giulio Maceratini, head of the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance in the senate, invited the carabinieri to search the PDS' Rome headquarters. The Berlusconi government believes anti-corruption investigations since 1992 have focused little on the PDS and its predecessor, the Communist Party of Italy. Ms Tiziana Parenti, now a parliamentary deputy for Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, left the Milan magistrates' anti-corruption team because of a disagreement on this issue. The matter is one of the complaints against Milan magistrates now being investigated by a special team of inspectors from the justice ministry. These complaints mainly concern the handling of inquiries into the Fininvest group. Several members of parliament said yesterday in private they did not doubt that most public works contracts in Sicily had been subject to irregularities. But they suggested the move against the PDS was an attempt to ensure government and opposition were seen to be equally entangled in corruption inquiries. This would increase pressure for a political solution to end the investigations.</p>

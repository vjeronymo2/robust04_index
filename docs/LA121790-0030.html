The film,  originally slated for release last fall, "could have been a cool Christmas  present for my fans," he said, "to see the Diceman up there on the screen,  40-feet tall. I completely trusted the people at Fox, put my entire career in  their hands, which turned out to be my mistake." CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

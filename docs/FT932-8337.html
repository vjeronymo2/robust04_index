			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: Weak markets help drive Volvo to SKr331m deficit WEAK markets and higher interest payments led to an increased loss after financial items of SKr331m (Dollars 45m) for Volvo, the Swedish vehicle group, in the first quarter. The result, which compares with a SKr248m loss in the same 1992 quarter, came after a drop in sales of cars and trucks, mainly because of lower demand in western Europe. Group debt was SKr7bn higher at the end of the first quarter than a year ago, and interest expenses rose sharply to SKr388m from SKr123m. In the first three months, sales rose 14 per cent to SKr22.95bn, although excluding currency factors and acquisitions they were 2 per cent lower. The operating loss was much lower at SKr189m, against SKr347m. Although this reflected a positive SKr250m impact from an accounting change, operating losses in both car and truck groups were down, in spite of lower sales volumes. Car sales rose 15 per cent in value terms to SKr12.63bn, due to the weaker krona. However, sales dropped to 73,500 vehicles from 80,500. Volvo increased its share of the weak Swedish market, but lost share in the UK. However, it increased sales and market share in the US, and strengthened its position in Japan, south-east Asia and Russia. Truck sales were 12 per cent higher at SKr8.34bn, although deliveries were down 8 per cent at 10,800 vehicles. In Europe, sales fell 39 per cent to 3,600, while US sales climbed 25 per cent to 4,900 units, although market share was lower. The group's share of profits from Swedish food and pharmaceutical group Procordia increased to SKr596m from SKr124m. Income from Renault, with which Volvo has extensive cross-shareholding links, fell to SKr236m from SKr387m.</p>

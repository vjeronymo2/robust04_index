			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Nafta talks make steady progress TRADE officials from the US, Canada and Mexico wrapped up a week-long bargaining session recently with no word on how much progress they made in completing a North American free trade agreement. However, officials did agree to continue talks at a lower level this week. They said US trade representative Carla Hills and her counterparts from the other two countries would convene for high-level negotiations the following week. President George Bush's administration has been pushing to conclude the negotiation by mid-April. The April 6 date set for Ms Hills, Canadian trade minister Michael Wilson and Mexican commerce secretary Jaime Serra Puche to resume meeting could be a sign that negotiators believe enough progress is being made to reach final agreement next month. The Nafta is one of the few issues to attract enthusiasm on both sides of the congressional aisle. Although Democrats may baulk if a final draft fails to deal satisfactorily with the concerns for the environment and environmental and workers' rights, Congressmen Richard Gephardt, the House majority leader, may simply attach an amendment to the implementing legislation requiring US companies in Mexico to abide by US work and environmental rules. Energy is one of the thorniest issues at the bargaining table. The Mexican constitution prohibits foreign participation in strategic sectors such as oil, but the possibility of ultimately developing an affordable supply of energy for a self-sufficient North America has captured the imagination of many in Congress. There are benefits for all three negotiating partners. Mexican industry desperately needs US and Canadian investment capital and technology for its natural gas sector. US imports have soared from 2.3bn cubic feet in 1988 to 35.6bn in 1990. In the short term, the Salinas government seems willing to accede to the demands of its negotiating partners to develop a regulatory commission mechanism for rates and contract terms, transportation terms and the freedom of foreign companies to negotiate directly with its customers rather than going through Pemex, the Mexican national oil monopoly. Mexico also has been importing US electricity. Talks promoting trade liberalisation could provide cheaper, cleaner, more reliable electricity for both countries. 'California could provide electricity for the entire (Mexican) state of Baha,' said one congressional aide, who also talked enthusiastically about sales of US oil rigs and anti-pollution technology. Less easy is the question of US and Canadian investment in oil refineries and ownership of petrol stations. Joint ventures could be an acceptable alternative. Even more difficult is foreign investment in oil exploration. The Mexican government has shown a willingness to hire foreign companies on a contract basis to bring in drilling technology and turn over the oil found to Pemex. But this would fail to bring in the investment risk capital Mexico desperately needs. For all its potential, US energy companies recognise that Mexico will not fully open this protected sector in the current Nafta negotiation. However, they hope enough trust can be built to permit exploration and development later on to the mutual advantage of all.</p>

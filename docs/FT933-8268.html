			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Appeal Court rules on pension funds case - Legal Briefs The Court of Appeal last week refused to grant a stay on orders made by Mr Justice Vinelott in the Melton Medes pension funds case at the end of July removing the existing trustees and appointing Mr Neil Cooper and Mr Ipe Jacob, partners in accountants Robson Rhodes, as judicial trustees of the funds. This is the first time that judicial trustees have been appointed before the substantive case has been heard and underlines the distinction now being drawn by the courts between conventional trusts, where such an order would be impossible, and pension funds. The Appeal Court, however, granted the defendants a further stay on a pre-emptive costs order made by Mr Justice Vinelott giving the pension fund members the right to use pension fund monies to finance their action for breach of trust against the former trustees. The former trustees, Mr Nathu Ram Puri, Melton Medes chairman, and Mr James Philpotts, chief executive, have 28 days to appeal against the pre-emptive costs order.</p>

"There were no specific talks on macroeconomic  measures...and  we can't offer something new" regarding permanent tax cuts or  boosting public works spending, Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito  told a scheduled news conference. Saito was referring to an  earlier meeting he attended at the Diet between Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.    The government has promised to enact tax measures by the end  of the year. Steps envisaged include a permanent cut in income  taxes and raising indirect levies such as the consumption tax.  The government has also said it will consider boosting its  10-year 430 trillion yen public works spending program if  funding can be secured.    Takemura told a separate news conference that he wants to  include "direction" of macroeconomic measures in the March  package, but details will take until June to work out. But the  chief government spokesman said he "fully recognizes" the  ministry's "unchanged" cautious macroeconomic stance.    Saito said the meeting covered only "general discussions,"  adding, "you (reporters) shouldn't speculate."</p>

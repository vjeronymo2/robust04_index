			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading ROLLING forward of positions from the December contract into March was the main feature in stock index futures, although buying from a large US house helped to boost turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. After opening at 2,720, selling of the December contract on the FT-SE by independent traders led it to fall to 2,715 within the first hour of trading. Dealers, however, appeared to have been caught short, and together with good buying said to have come from one US house, December recovered to move forward for the rest of the session. The release of disappointing retail sales figures for November had little effect and instead led to some renewed speculation of a cut in interest rates. With only two full days to go before the expiry of the December contract, trading was again featured by extensive switching into the March version. December finished at 2,740, up 20 from the previous close and at a 9-point premium to the underlying cash market. Turnover in the December contract was 7,746 lots, while that in March reached 4,793. Volume in the traded options returned to more modest levels. Total turnover came to 29,456 lots, of which 9,339 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Asda was the busiest stock option with turnover of 6,252 contracts. It was followed by Rolls-Royce on 1,470 and Ladbroke on 1,346.</p>

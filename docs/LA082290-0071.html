			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GULF REFUGEES ADD TO WOES IN PHILIPPINES;  </P> <P> ECONOMICS: AQUINO'S GOVERNMENT FACES THE LOSS OF ITS BIGGEST OVERSEAS SOURCE OF  REVENUE -- LABOR.  </P> <P> Nestor Ilarde's tale of terror is emblazoned on his jacket: "Iraq War Victim."  </P> <P> Ilarde, a 35-year-old Philippine mechanic working in Kuwait, was caught in the  middle when Iraq invaded Aug. 2. He saw three Egyptian friends shot to death,  he had to walk 12 miles across the blazing desert when his car gave out and he  abandoned all he owned to save his life.  </P> <P> "Everything is lost," he said. "But I am alive."  </P> <P> Ilarde and the 266 other Philippine workers from Kuwait who flew into Manila  airport early today on a chartered jet from Saudi Arabia came back to a nation  facing economic and political crisis.  </P> <P> Reflecting the long reach of the Persian Gulf crisis, President Corazon  Aquino's embattled government faces steeply higher prices for imported oil and  the potential loss of its largest single source of foreign exchange.  </P> <P> About 500,000 Filipinos have been working in the Middle East, including an  estimated 60,000 in Kuwait, 4,000 in Iraq and 374,000 in Saudi Arabia. They  send home $1.3 billion a year through banks, and officials estimate that up to  $3 billion a year comes back through unofficial channels. That makes labor the  Philippines' most lucrative export.  </P> <P> "We get hit on both sides," said Alex Magno, a political scientist at the  Unviersity of the Philippines. "The price of oil goes up, and we lose  remittances by our workers. The consequences are dire, both politically and  economically."  </P> <P> The political impact is evident in the rumors sweeping Manila that an impending  oil price increase will spark another attempted right-wing military coup, which  would be the seventh in four years. Last Friday, citing warnings of a coup, the  armed forces went on red-alert status, the maximum state of readiness.  </P> <P> The economic impact is more certain, however. Officials said impending oil  price increases would slow the economy and spark a spiral of rising prices for  transport, labor, food and other necessities. Inflation, which reached 12.7%  last quarter, is expected to hit 18%. The peso already has dropped to historic  lows against other currencies.  </P> <P> "We will not only lose our oil and our workers in the gulf, we have to pay to  bring them back," a Finance Department official said. "And while they're here,  they're not doing anything."  </P> <P> So far, the government has used chartered jets and scheduled airliners to  evacuate about 1,240 Filipinos who escaped from Kuwait to Jordan and Saudi  Arabia. Officials said they are considering sending ships to the region because  evacuating everyone by air would cost more than $50 million.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia has offered to hire up to 40,000 displaced Philippine workers,  particularly trained technicians, doctors and nurses, according to Ruben  Torres, secretary of labor. But he said only a few hundred of the 60,000  Filipinos in Kuwait have managed to escape.  </P> <P> He said that about 4,000 have crowded into the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait and  that about 13,000 have asked for travel documents. Food is being rationed, and  chicken pox has broken out, he added.  </P> <P> "We really have to find ways to get food there," Torres said.  </P> <P> Another 530 Filipinos are in Amman, the Jordanian capital, awaiting evacuation,  according to Josefina Bilar, a Labor Department official. "We're trying our  best to get them back," she said.  </P> <P> So far, the United States has not acknowledged using its giant military bases  in the Philippines, Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Station, for the Middle East  mobilization. Aquino told reporters Monday she expects the United States to  "consult" with her government before the bases are used.  </P> <P> But Stanley Shrager, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said that under the 1988  bilateral bases agreement, permission need only be sought for "combat military  operations." And that, he said, is not likely, considering the distance to the  Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> He said Manila's permission is not necessary if the Pentagon uses the bases to  resupply or refuel planes headed to the gulf, or to resupply, refuel and repair  warships.  </P> <P> "That's certainly conceivable, possible and probably probable," Shrager added.  </P> <P> For now, attention is focused on the maids, cooks, mechanics and technicians  who have come home with their lurid tales of robbery and rape, bravery and  despair. The government has said it will file a formal protest with Iraq if the  allegations of rape and other abuses can be substantiated.  </P> <P> Marcello Costellas, a 39-year-old refinery worker, helped lead 62 people across  the desert in two large dump trucks.  </P> <P> "At the border," he said, "the Iraqis met us with eight armored cars. After we  talked, the officer said, 'OK, go.' "  </P> <P> Salvacion Lazarte, 27, a maid, said she hid in her room for three days after  hearing that other women had been raped by invading troops. She left everything  when she escaped.  </P> <P> "We had to choose our lives or our things," she said.  </P></p>

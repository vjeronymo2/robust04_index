			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Gianfranco Modolo report: "`The North Is the Leagues'"] </F>   [Text] Milan -- The political accord between the League and  Forza Italia is struggling to take shape, because of the sharp  disagreements and numerous hesitations on both sides. Yesterday  at Villa San Martino, [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi's  headquarters, a meeting, described as "technical and electoral,"  took place between the parliamentary floor leaders of the  League, Roberto Maroni and Francesco Speroni, and two Rooting  for Italy officials, Domenico Lo Jucco -- Marcello Dell'Utri's  assistant on Publitalia and the man in charge of finding and  selecting Rooting for Italy's candidates -- and Roberto Cipriani.    The purpose of the meeting was supposed to be an examination  and perhaps the drafting of the list of candidates that the  League- Rooting for Italy alignment would field in the  constituencies of northern Italy. Silvio Berlusconi himself  spoke at the meeting, which lasted eight hours, though he  declined to enter into technical details. [Northern League  Secretary] Umberto Bossi's presence "in spirit" was much  stronger; as the meeting was still in progress he issued a  provocative communique to the news agencies: "Berlusconi must  think about the Center and South; woe betide him if he thinks of  taking away our votes in the North." Berlusconi quipped in  reply, "a little local color is always pleasant," but this did  not at all alter the substance of the dispute.    Clearly, after their long-distance argument, Speroni and  Maroni (the latter still recovering from the incident with [Pact  for Italy leader] Segni) had to be cautious: "There is no  political agreement yet; it is necessary to surmount divergences  and mutual mistrust. But we are very close," they announced at  the end of the meeting. Later, in the evening, Bossi expressed  his thoughts on television, setting the conditions for alliance  with Rooting for Italy: "Berlusconi stood in parallel to the  old political system. We will accept him only if he helps us to  implement economic liberalism and to put an end to the abuse of  the welfare state. We will accept him, above all, if he  presents himself as a mediator between North and South, if he  succeeds in reconciling the country. In this role he does not  even need a party. Let it be clear, however that it is we who  are in the North -- not Berlusconi."    So, leaving aside all the "isms," Bossi's message is  tantamount to an ukase: Berlusconi can serve to bring votes  from the South, where the League's presence is small, but be  absolutely must not establish himself in the political fabric of  the North. Berlusconi owns television networks, newspapers, and  money, but according to Bossi, he does not yet enjoy any support  among the voters. "He wants to be a political leader," the  League's secretary said, "but that is for the voters to decide."    In other words, if Berlusconi wants to put forward a  blueprint on which basis to seek 50 percent of the candidates  that the new alignment will field in the various constituencies,  this would all take the form of a plan contrary, alternative,  and opposed to Bossi's. "We would pursue our own path.  Berlusconi would no longer be our mediator, and we would do  without him."    This is how the first "technical" meeting between the League  and Rooting for Italy ended -- with diktats and quips. Now  Berlusconi will have to impart substance to his capacity for  mediation in order to reassure his potential ally. But  yesterday there was talk about candidates, too: "Tiziana  Parenti was thinking of standing in Milan," Speroni said, "but  for magistrates there are considerations of geographical  incompatibility." It seems virtually certain, however, that  Bossi will stand as the League's candidate for central Milan.  The progressive bloc might field the writer, Umberto Eco,  against him.</p>

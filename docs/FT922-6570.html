			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Weak demand keeps Navistar in red NAVISTAR, the leading US manufacturer of medium and heavy trucks, yesterday reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 35m. It predicted that weak demand would keep it in the red for the third quarter. The loss, which worked through at 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 29m, or 15 cents a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 914m, down from Dollars 940m, while shipments dipped 17 per cent, from 21,200 units to 17,500. The company blamed the shipments drop on lower demand for school bus chassis. Navistar, which has a particularly large share of the school bus market, said some fleets had been deferring purchases. 'While there has been a clear, but selective, improvement in heavy truck demand,' said James Cotting, Navistar's chairman, 'we have not as yet seen the same signs of recovery in the market for medium trucks and school buses.' Navistar said it had maintained its position as sales leader in the North American retail market for medium and heavy trucks, with a 26.3 per cent market share in the first half. This, however, was down from 29.3 per cent for the same period of 1991. The company's backlog of orders for heavy trucks rose 41 per cent from levels of a year ago, but medium truck and bus orders declined 14 per cent. For the first six months, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 67m, or 32 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 67m, or 33 cents, in the same period last year.</p>

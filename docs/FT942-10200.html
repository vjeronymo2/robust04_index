			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / European Elections - June 9 and 12: Emu fans ready to move the goalposts - Spectre of economic and monetary union haunts next month's European parliament elections / EU politicians are preparing to alter Maastricht terms In Britain, the issue of economic and monetary union (Emu) has lit a fuse along the European election trail. In the rest of the continent, the subject is being given a lot less attention. None the less, the question of whether policies aimed at establishing Emu are consistent with efforts to bring down unemployment has explosive potential. Across the continent, the fiercest discussions over whether Emu will take place by the Maastricht target dates of 1997 or 1999 are taking place in northern Europe. Despite Britain's 'opt-out' from participation in a single currency, 'Eurosceptics' in the UK Conservative party this week have focused on the Emu plan in their calls for a referendum on the shape of Europe. In Germany and France, left- and right-wing anti-Maastricht parties are aiming for support on the somewhat contradictory basis that the Emu plan will undermine both German and French sovereignty. In France, support for the franc fort policy remains solid among the political establishment. Yesterday's  1/2 point cut in Bundesbank interest rates will give the Bank of France more leeway to bring down interest rates and speed recovery from France's longest period of economic doldrums since the second world war. On the other hand, if anti-Emu parties - including dissident conservatives led by Mr Philippe de Villiers, the right-wing National Assembly deputy - gain more than 20 per cent of the votes on June 12, that could unsettle France's pro-Maastricht stance. By contrast, public debate on Emu in southern countries is far more muted. In Italy and Spain - traditionally strong supporters of Emu but beset by domestic political uncertainties - Emu comes well down the list of election issues. The new government in Rome headed by Mr Silvio Berlusconi appears likely to take a more nationalistic line in promoting Italian interests in Brussels. Pushing for the lira's early return into the mainstream of European monetary integration is not expected to be one of them. Nevertheless supporters of Emu across the continent have recovered their poise after setbacks caused by the ERM exit of Britain and Italy in September 1992 and the emergency widening of fluctuation bands to 15 per cent last August. By deterring speculators, wider ERM bands have reinforced currency stability. Since last summer, ERM central banks have lowered interest rates only gradually rather than resorting to competitive devaluations. 'The spread (of interest rates) between Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France and Germany is now so small that we are virtually in a monetary union,' says one central bank governor. One problem is that the Maastricht treaty limits Emu participation to currencies which respect 'the normal fluctuation bands for two years.' However, in coming months European finance ministers are expected to agree a generous interpretation of this condition. They are likely simply to apply the test of whether exchange rate movements have been minimal. The European Commission has set up a study group to prepare the change to the Ecu as a new European currency. An advisory report is due by the end of October. Commission officials say they are using Britain's 'exemplary' decimalisation in 1971 as a model for a single currency. A large stumbling block is, however, the slow recovery from recession. Sluggish economic performance and rising government borrowing and debt levels have seriously impeded EU states' ability to fulfil some of the most important 'convergence criteria' set down at Maastricht to determine countries' eligibility to take part in Emu. The treaty lays down four numerical criteria determining countries' Emu suitability, concerning inflation rates, budget deficits, interest rates and debt levels. No EU state last year fulfilled all four criteria, although four - France, Ireland, Luxembourg and the UK - satisfied three of them. For watchers of the Maastricht criteria, Germany is a worry. Germany satisfied only two of the criteria last year, and German public sector debt will exceed the target of 60 per cent of GDP in 1995 because of extra debt stemming from German unification. Even for some low inflation countries, rigid adherence to the Maastricht debt targets will be very difficult. An analysis by Belgium's finance ministry shows Belgium would need a primary budget surplus (the budgetary balance before interest charges) of 6 per cent of GDP a year for the next 15 years to reduce public sector debt to 60 per cent of GDP by 2009. The Maastricht treaty does allow for a liberal interpretation of whether member states comply with the criteria. Countries deemed as tackling their deficits seriously would have a chance of joining Emu if they can prove that their public finances are moving in the desired direction. But to supporters of Emu, Belgium remains a natural candidate for a 'hard core' currency club, despite its high government debt. This point was made in Paris last month by Mr Alain Lamassoure, the French minister for European affairs, who said forcefully the convergence criteria had to be 'complemented by political considerations'. Public statements like this, however, can be counter-productive. In the light of public worries in Germany about the replacement of the D-Mark by a European currency, politicians in Germany are allergic to suggestions that the convergence criteria could be diluted. In a ruling firmly backed by the Bonn government, the German constitutional court laid down last October that Emu could go ahead only on the basis of strict adherence to the criteria. One senior German politician says in private: 'Anyone who thinks he can circumvent them (the criteria) by political considerations will have to go before our High Court' - a sign of the political battles over Emu in store.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Governments in trouble over Mastricht convergence  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Target          France (3)     Ireland (3)    Luxembourg (3)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation A           2.1*            1.4*              3.6 Deficits B            5.9             3.0*              2.5* Interest rates C      6.8*            7.7*              6.9* Debt D               44.9*           92.9              10.0* Political  Position    Right split before    Coalition        Elections                 May 1995           government       next month              presidential poll    riding high  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Target      Netherlands (2)         UK (3)       Belgium (2)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation A           2.1*            1.6*              2.8* Deficits B            4.0             7.6               7.4* Interest rates C      6.3*            7.5*              7.2* Debt D               83.1            53.2*            138.4 Political  Position   Difficult coalition   Major under      Precarious                 talks after       attack over      coalition                  elections         Europe          government  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Target          Denmark (2)    Germany (2)       Spain (1)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation A           1.3*            4.2              4.6 Deficits B            4.4             3.3              7.2 Interest rates C      7.2*            6.5*            10.2 Debt D               78.5            48.9*            55.6* Political  Position     Election due by   Kohl faces battle  Gonzales in                  December          in October      trouble over                                     elections      corruption  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Target           Greece (0)      Italy (0)    Portugal (0)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Inflation A          14.4             4.5              6.5 Deficits B           15.4            10.0              8.9 Interest rates C     21.2            11.4             12.5 Debt D              113.6           115.8             69.5 Political  Position       Papandreou      Uncertainty over   Elections due                   ailing           Berlusconi     October 1995                                     policies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All figures for 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: European Commission, natural statistics. *Mastricht targets fulfilled.

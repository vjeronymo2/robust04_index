			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 5 Apr (NA) -- Radical Civic Union  [UCR] leader Raul Alfonsin this evening stated that, together  with economic stability, "political stability is also of  paramount importance." He asserted that he had never before  acted "with such overt disinterestedness," as he was not  aspiring to any office. He made it clear that he intends  "consolidating in 1994 what we began back in 1983."    During a 15-minute speech broadcast by "Cronica TV,"  Alfonsin  pointed out that "we want to ensure for the benefit of posterity  a Constitution that will be a guarantee of justice, security,  appropriate institutional order -- a Constitution that will not  only be in force during the life spans of all those of you who  are now listening to me, but surely those of your children and  your children's children as well."    Alfonsin, who is running as first UCR candidate for Buenos  Aires in the Constituent Assembly elections, reiterated that he  is not pursuing "any sort of personal interest." He put an end  to any possible speculations by stating that he would in no case  run for the presidency on the UCR ticket in 1995.    Underscoring the value of political stability, Alfonsin gave  the example of "what is happening in other countries" that are  torn by social upheavals "despite the fact that everything  seemed to be going like clockwork," thus alluding to the  situation in Mexico.    First, Alfonsin defended the idea of "pacts" in political  life. He pointed out that this word derives from the word  "peace," and stressed that some pacts "have been instrumental in  solving many fundamental problems confronting countries from  Latin American and other latitudes."    To that effect he recalled the Fixed Point [Punto Fijo] Pact  in Venezuela following Perez Gimenez's dictatorship, the Pact of  Bogota after the death of Gaitan, the Pacts of La Moncloa in  Spain in the wake of Francisco Franco's death, and the pact made  in El Salvador between guerrillas and the government, which led  to the 3 April elections.    He also referred to Argentine history in recalling the  "preexistent pacts" mentioned in the 1853 Constitution, which  "were not made between people who voted for different parties at  the polls, but rather between people who had charged one another  with lances; between warlords commanding irregular armies of  gauchos, who decided to organize our nation."    Alfonsin upheld the argument that our country had been in  "great danger" some months ago, a danger which could have ended  with the reinstatement of the "incompatible refusals and  tremendous confrontations" that generated the "climate ripe for  coups d'etat" that had disrupted the constitutional order.    Alfonsin asserted that the federal government "accepted the  proposals" made by the UCR, which opened the door for the first  constitutional amendment by consensus of the century.    Among the most significant achievements of the agreement  reached through the Olivos Pact, he highlighted the attenuation  of the presidentialist system "to preclude any hegemonic  pretension, any authoritarian slant, any encroachment upon the  judiciary or upon Congress."    Alfonsin emphasized the figure of cabinet chief, who "will  be  in charge of the administration, the implementation of the  budget, the appointment of public servants, and the management  of administrative resources, and will have to report -- as in  any parliamentary system -- to Congress at least once a month."    Alfonsin added: "We have also limited the power of issuing  urgent and necessary decrees and the possibility of issuing  partial vetoes and carrying out an intervention in the provinces  when Congress is in recess. We have also prevented the transfer  of powers from the legislative to the executive branch that  would have excessively overloaded our presidential system."    Alfonsin also emphasized the achievement of having changed  the system to appoint judges through the formation of the  Council of Magistrates and the mechanism for their removal  through a judgment jury.    "There is nothing that bothers a nation more than  corruption," Alfonsin indicated, approving a preventive role in  this area. This will involve assigning a constitutional status  to the Office of the Comptroller General, which will be headed  by a man or a woman appointed by the main opposition party.    Alfonsin also explained the necessity of attempting to  secure  "a majority of UCR Constituent Assembly members" as "there are  15 approved points of paramount importance" on which there are  disagreements with the proposals raised by the Justicialist  Party.    Among these disagreements, Alfonsin emphasized the federal  system, municipal autonomy, environmental protection, defense of  users and consumers, and the forms of semidirect democracy such  as, for example, the referendum.</p>

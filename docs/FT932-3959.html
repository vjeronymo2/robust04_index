			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Observer: Revolving door Sounds as if the World Bank has finally found a chief economist to fill the gap left by Larry Summers who quit many months ago to be under-secretary of state for international affairs at the US Treasury. Michael Bruno, the former governor of the Bank of Israel, is expected to step up to the plate next week. Bruno had been offered the World Bank job back in February but turned it down in favour of a similar post at Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, saying he wanted to be closer to his home and family in Jerusalem. Then he backed off EBRD because he was unhappy with the EBRD's staffing and budgetary constraints. He stresses that it had nothing to do with Attali. In going to Washington he follows a fairly well-worn path. Jacob Frenkel, former chief economist at the IMF, replaced Bruno as head of the Israeli central bank. Moreover Stanley Fischer, who was Larry Summer's predecessor at the World Bank, has taught at Jerusalem's Hebrew University where Bruno is currently Melchior Professor of International Economic Policy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aissa G. Garcia] </F>   [Text] Havana, 29 Apr (PL) -- After two days of  discussions and announcements that were more or less unexpected,  a group of emigrants meeting with government representatives  expressed their optimism and satisfaction with the first steps  in the process to normalize relations.    Max Lesnick, a member of the Cuban Change [Cambio Cubano]  group and one of 215 participants in The Nation and Emigrants  Conference, which is scheduled to conclude here today, views the  measures to ease migration policies as positive and beneficial  for the entire overseas community.    "My presence at the meeting," Lesnick told PRENSA LATINA,  "is  indicative of my belief that we Cubans must solve our problems  without foreign interference. I hope that every step we take  will be with mutual respect and with a view toward what is best  for Cuba."    Foreign Minister Robert Robaina announced yesterday the  adoption of several measures to facilitate communication between  the emigrants and the country. These measures include  eliminating the five-year waiting period required of those who  left the island legally before they can visit the country.    It was also decided to create an office for emigrant issues,  to publish a magazine specializing in migration issues, and to  allow emigrants to stay with relatives (instead of having to  reserve hotels), and to allow them to study in their country of  origin.    Businessman Roberto Solis told this news agency of his  satisfaction with the decision to allow "our children to study  at Cuban universities" and to create an office responsible for  looking after and understanding the community.    That specific measure, he added, gives us legal support as  immigrants in the United States and represents a significant  accomplishment to those of us who came to have these discussions.    In his opinion, the process of to normalize relations  between  Cuba and the overseas community got off to a good start because  a door was opened that will lead to further communication  between both sides.    To commentator Marcos Castellon, expectations are high for  this meeting because even before the debates ended, concrete and  significant results had already been announced.    Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said on Saturday that  the "process must proceed without haste or pressure and in the  most clear-cut manner possible."    According to Roberto Carballo, former mercenary of the  failed  1961 invasion of Playa Giron and member of the Cuban Committee  for Democracy, so far they have made some very significant  achievements, but "there is still room for more."    Carballo supports a continuation of the process but believes  that whatever happens "will depend on solving problems as well  as on the United States' lifting of the blockade, which greatly  harms the Cuban people."    According to Carballo, despite the public rejection of the  conference in Miami, "many (he did not mention names) called me  to say that they supported my decision to participate because  they realize that dialogue with the government is the only thing  that can be done."    There is a silent majority over there. When they see moments  of genuine sincerity to seek solutions, they express their  willingness to accept and even to participate in them, he added.    One common denominator of this meeting has been the support  for statements by the Cuban foreign minister regarding the  willingness of authorities "to examine all legal provisions that  will ease the way to a normal relationship between the emigrants  and the nation."    The conference, described by the participants as the first  link in a chain, concludes today at the Havana Convention  Palace, where the emigrants, government officials, and reporters  stand in the corridors and reflect on how the debates are  progressing.</p>

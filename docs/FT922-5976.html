			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / India needs to double output of electricity over 15 years INDIA MUST increase its electricity generating capacity by 50 per cent in the next five years and double it from existing levels in the next 15 years if it is to stand any chance of keeping pace with demand, a senior Indian government energy official said yesterday. Mr Shri Kalp Nath Rai, minister of state for power, told the Financial Times Asian electricity conference that an unprecedented boost in private power generation was the only way these targets could be achieved. State electricity expansion targets have had to be sharply curtailed because of lack of funds and an ambitious legislative reform programme has been put in place to improve the role of the private sector in supplying electricity. India had a total of 70,000MW of electricity supply capacity, but a further 48,000 needed to be added in five years and 142,000 in the next 15 year if energy shortages were to be eliminated, he said. But the recently completed eighth five-year plan had had to be revised downward to provide for a capacity rise out of state funds of just 31,000MW. The rest would have to be made up by a fast expanding private sector. Mr Rai said that India was better placed to meet the electricity supply challenge because, unlike most Asian nations, its power sector was already mixed between federal, state and private sector power utilities  - the last represented by such companies as Tata Electric and Calcutta Electricity Supply, among others. But until last year, the private sector was severely hampered from expansion by the Indian electricity supply act, which protected state power companies. This has now been changed to allow widespread expansion, including up to 100 per cent foreign equity participation in private power projects. The government was now considering private sector proposals to add more than 9,000mw, equally divided between the Indian private sector and foreign investors. Mr Rai's call for private sector investment was matched by that of Mr Shahd Nafeez Ahmed, Pakistan's private sector director water and power. Pakistan's electricity supply policy had been virtually turned upside down in the last year, a move which will mean more independent power producers being able to set up in Pakistan to operate alongside the Water and Power Development Authority, the state utility, and the eventual breakup of WAPDA itself, Mr Hafeez Ahmed said. Pakistan now had 8,312MW of capacity, which was l,800MW below what was needed to avoid regular blackouts. To end this, several private sector build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects were now about to be implemented or were being considered. Chief among these was the 1,292MW Hab River oil-fired power project outside Karachi. Start up of work was expected in July, but only after more than four years of negotiations between a Euro-Japanese consortium and the Pakistan government.</p>

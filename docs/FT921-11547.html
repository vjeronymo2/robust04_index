			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Property Market: The new centre of discontent The shopping centre developers who laid their plans in the balmy days of the 1980s consumer boom are opening their malls in an arctic climate. For every centre which is performing better than anyone dared to hope, there is one staring failure in the face. Even those centres - a majority - which will succeed eventually are struggling to find tenants. Mr David Watt, a director of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnock, property advisers, says that many schemes may take 30 months to let, and even then the developer will not make any money. The outlook for one in 10 of the new schemes is even worse. 'The very worrying cases are those which are not getting up to 60 per cent let. Are they going going to be white elephants?' he asks. Developers cannot afford to allow their malls to stand half empty. They can easily get locked into a downward spiral when a lack of tenants breeds a lack of customers and thus mounting difficulties for the dwindling numbers of remaining tenants. The recession, combined with the large supply of new space, is forcing landlords to compete for tenants which they would not have even considered in better times. Retailers are being offered Pounds 50-Pounds 100 per sq ft or more as an incentive to open shops. A new generation of niche retailers - such as cosmetics retailer Body &amp; Face, Haagen Dazs, the ice cream maker, and tea and coffee seller Whittards of Chelsea - are expanding on the back of the incentives, prime positions and keen rents offered by developers. The capital contributions from developers can give the newcomers an enormous advantage over their predecessors, many of whom had forced up rents in their feverish competition for space in the 1980s. 'We used to have space bandits, now we have capital bandits,' says Mr Graham Chase of Clive Lewis, chartered surveyors. But the trend towards giving up-front capital incentives presents dilemmas for landlords. Is it worth paying a retailer to set up shop, if there is a risk that it will not be able or willing to stick with a 25-year lease? 'There are circumstances where pulling in tenants even if they are only there for a year is a worthwhile exercise. It puts some life in the centre,' says Mr Stan Perry of Eagle Star, the insurance company. Eagle owns the Alhambra in Barnsley, northern England, which has let about one in 10 of its shops since it opened in October, excluding its anchor store, the Co-op. Agents and tenants report that developers are becoming less willing to provide capital contributions. In some cases, this is due to their own financial pressures. In others, it is because they have become disillusioned with their fledgling tenants. From a standing start in November 1990, Creative Crystal, a gift retailer, opened 30 shops last year in shopping centres throughout Britain. Half these shops now stand empty and the company is struggling for survival. 'We are teetering on the brink,' says Mr Arthur Brown, a director. Creative Crystal's rise and fall is as much a measure of the state of the shopping centre market as it is of the recession. The company admits that it would not have expanded so fast without incentives. And with hindsight, it believes it should have moved at a slower pace. It is not alone. Mr Brown can point to four other undercapitalised independents which are in a similarly precarious position after rapid expansion. Most struggling shopping centres will batten down the hatches and ride out the storm. But what will happen to those that do not make the grade? One possibility is a change of use. Sibec's failed Winter Gardens development in Southport, Merseyside, has been bought from the receiver by Safeway, the grocery superstore. Safeway is seeking permission to build a superstore on the site. Another prominent example of change of use is Tobacco Dock, the shopping centre which was built in an old tobacco warehouse in the London docklands. Being well off the beaten track, it failed to attract enough shoppers and went into receivership in 1990. The receivers are hoping to complete a sale to Mr Paul Kempin, a Leicester-based investor, who wants to turn it into a tourist destination with a 'sea life centre'. In some cases, a change of ownership may be enough to revive a centre. A pension fund may be hampered by its reluctance to treat an investment as a business requiring active management. A entrepreneurial landlord who is prepared to bully tenants into paying their rents and help them attract trade may get better results. The most striking example of this is the Trocadero in London's Piccadilly, which was built by Electricity Supply Nominees (ENS) as an upmarket shopping mall on the advice of Richard Ellis, the surveyors, which ENS subsequently sued. The Trocadero's fortunes and rent roll increased sharply when Brent Walker and Power Group, a property company, bought it and the adjoining island site from ENS for Pounds 105m in 1987. (The site was valued at an eyebrow-raising Pounds 250m at the end of 1989.) The new owners took the Trocadero down-market in a way that had been barred by ENS's trustees. Are the developers of this crop of disasters to blame? Or are they merely victims of an unforeseeable change in circumstances? In Mr Watt's view, the problems largely date back to the unusually buoyant conditions of the consumer boom. 'Developers did their homework in a snap-shot,' he says. The developers were egged on by the retailers. Obsessed by expansion, they started to look at towns with populations as low as 20,000. Now the credit-led spending bubble has burst, the centres' catchment area may be too small to sustain profitable stores. Similarly, stores built in large towns that already have a centre, face too much competition for comfort. But unlike previous gluts in retail property, only in a minority of cases is the poor design of centres to blame for their failure. Mostly, developers have learned from the poor location, layout and appearance of some of the 1960s shopping centres. Even the worst of this current crop of shopping centres is an improvement on Birmingham's Bull Ring or London's Elephant &amp; Castle - the most enduring eyesores of the 1960s.</p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Colgate-Palmolive back in the black in third term COLGATE-Palmolive, the US consumer products group, yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 128.8m for the three months to end-September, on sales of Dollars 1.83bn. The figure compares with a Dollars 197.4m loss in the same period of 1991, but the previous year's results were depressed by a one-off restructuring charge of Dollars 340m before tax. Colgate said with this excluded net income would have shown a 34 per cent increase year-on-year, and earnings per share a 15 per cent rise to 78 cents. Mr Reuben Mark, Colgate's chairman, said all four geographical regions showed higher sales and profits in the third quarter. For the group overall, unit volume was up by 12 per cent, although the advance partly reflected the purchase of the Mennen business in the US. Without Mennen, there would have been a 5 per cent unit volume increase. The third-quarter results bring Colgate's net profits for the first nine months of 1992 to Dollars 367.1m, compared with Dollars 38m - after the restructuring charge - in the same period of 1991.</p>

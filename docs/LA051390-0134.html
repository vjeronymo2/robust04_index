			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> PETS;  </P> <P> SMART CAT TRICKS  </P> <P> WHAT? YOUR CAT doesn't know how to sit and stay or give you five? Then your  feline is no graduate of The Cat Connection, the unique training class taught  by veteran animal behaviortrainer Sandi Wirth, who discovered cats could "do  more than anyone ever knew" while working with them on TV ads. And her own cats  are living proof; among the four, they've mastered 67 behaviors, including  hissing, crying and removing Wirth's glasses, all on command.  </P> <P> Seven brainy cats recently graduated from Wirth's 10-week course -- her first  ever for felines -- and there is a waiting list for her future classes. Using  food and a comforting scratch at the base of the tail as positive-reinforcement  tools, Wirth can teach her students a variety of behaviors, from walking on a  leash to playing Frisbee. Classes are attended by cats (no dogs allowed, but  bunnies and a star-student Siamese rat are) and their owners, some of whom want  to make their kitties stars, others who hope to create a second bonding by  working together. Why settle for a cat that just purrs?  </P> <P>  The Cat Connection, Sandi Wirth; (818) 712-0656.  </P> <P> NICOLE YORKIN  </P></p>

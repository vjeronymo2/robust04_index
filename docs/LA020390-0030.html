			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDAINING OF HOMOSEXUALS  </P> <P> Luedtke's column was right on target. However, her arguments "for greater  tolerance, the fundamental beliefs of love and brotherhood" should include the  Missouri Synod Lutheran Church's position on women in the church.  </P> <P> After a lifetime of hearing sermons on the "inclusive" nature of Christianity  in the Lutheran Church, I'm still waiting for the power structure to actually  practice it. I'd like to rephrase Luedtke's question: And how long will it take  for the Missouri Synod Lutheran Church to accept practicing homosexuals and  women among its clergy?  </P> <P> JUNE BAAL BICKFORD  </P> <P> Anaheim Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Letter: Age-related national insurance Sir, Your editorial 'Second best pensions' (June 30) highlights the cost implications of an ageing population. The comments on defined contribution schemes are correct but incomplete. It is possible to change the investments towards retirement, for example, to move from equity-based investments to gilts and index-linked stock so as to match the changes in annuity rates. Action needs to be taken over the high commission rates paid on personal pensions and it is disappointing that the latest proposals on investor protection appear to be against the disclosure of commissions. An important point that needs addressing is how to ensure that those in employment do save for retirement. Younger employees do not believe they will ever retire and have more immediate calls on their income. One approach would be for age-related National Insurance contribution rates to be introduced and the reduction made to younger employees to become a mandatory savings scheme.

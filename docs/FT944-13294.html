			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Union concern over BT disposal British Telecommunications is next week expected to announce the sale of its off-shore cable laying division - BT Marine - to Cable &amp; Wireless, one of its main international competitors. The deal is likely to have implications for C&amp;W's industrial relations policies. BT Marine - which employs about 450 people, owns six ships, and has a record for technical innovation in the field of cable laying - is fully unionised and covered by collective bargaining. But in many of its worldwide operations C&amp;W does not recognise unions. The main union in BT, the NCU communications union, opposes BT's policy of selling off peripheral businesses and is not likely to be happy about a sale to C&amp;W. However, C&amp;W is currently seeking to improve its image with unions as it attempts to establish more joint ventures with many of Europe's national telecommunications groups. All of those groups are strongly unionised and in many countries the unions have considerable influence over corporate decision making. Last year the Communication Workers Union in Ireland lobbied hard to stop Telecom Eireann signing a joint venture with C&amp;W. Mr David Begg, CWU general secretary, said yesterday that the decision to oppose C&amp;W was taken partly on strategic grounds and partly because of the company's world-wide record on union recognition. A spokesman for C&amp;W rejected the allegation that C&amp;W was anti-union. 'In 50 per cent of our 60 companies around the world we recognise a trade union or staff association. We tend to adopt the local custom and practice,' he said. Union officials claim that C&amp;W prefers not to recognise unions, but will do so where it has to. It recognises the ships officers union, Numast, for example. C&amp;W is unlikely to de-recognise the NCU within BT Marine in view of the sensitivity of the union issue. Although it is possible that the union might be de-recognised for collective bargaining but allowed representation rights. Mercury, the BT rival which is owned by C&amp;W, does not recognise the NCU but recently had talks with the union about the possibility of establishing some formal relationship. Final details of the BT Marine deal have yet to be negotiated, but C&amp;W is expected to pay about Pounds 10m for the Pounds 60m turnover division. Neither company would comment yesterday on the deal. The NCU, which has several hundred members in Mercury, has not yet had an official reply to its request for recognition, but is expecting one soon. Mercury seems highly unlikely to offer full scale recognition for collective bargaining, but it might offer a lower level right of representation which would allow unions to represent members in disciplinary matters.</p>

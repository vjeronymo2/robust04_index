			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Rates close firmer ACTIVITY in both the sterling cash and futures markets was thin yesterday, even though the currency fell to a new low of DM2.50 against the D-Mark in the day's trading. In the absence of any clearly formulated UK government policy, sterling seems fundamentally weak. But the money markets are still being buffeted by different indications on whether another base rate cut is in the offing. On Tuesday, the Governor of the Bank of England suggested that sterling would have to retain some kind of exchange rate target, implying that the Chancellor could not cut rates with impunity. Mr Lothar Muller, a Bundesbank Council member, also suggested that there would not be another cut in German rates for another six months. Both statements would have made dealers bearish about the prospects for another UK base rate cut. Others cling to the view that there could be base rate cut at next week's conservative conference to boost the standing of the government in general. 'I think it would be wrong to rule out a cut,' said one discount house dealer. One argument in favour of a cut is the continuing presure in the European exchange rate mechanism. Although the French franc was still comfortably hovering at around FFr3.38 against the D-Mark yesterday, well above its floor, the French government is still unable to meet the commitment it made to cut French rates if France voted Yes to the Maastricht treaty in its referendum. December French franc futures yesterday tumbled from 90.90 to a low of 90.37, reflecting fears that the currency may yet weaken. This may put more pressure on the Bundesbank to cut rates tomorrow. In the sterling cash market, 3-month money closed at 9 1/16 per cent on the offered side,  1/8 per cent up on the previous close. One-month money remained unchanged at 9 1/4 per cent offered. In the futures, December sterling closed unchanged at 91.78. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 900m at the start of its operations. In early operations, it bought Pounds 500m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and 210m in a repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent. The forecast was then revised to Pounds 700m.</p>

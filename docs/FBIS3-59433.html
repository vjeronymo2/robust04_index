The new laws are part of sweeping legislation agreed to this  week that is designed to establish a legal framework for law  enforcement activities in postcommunist Hungary. Agreed to after  months of debate, the proposed law attempts to balance a respect  for civil liberties with a need to create an effective police  force able to combat a growing crime problem.    "It is a philosophical dispute," said Hungarian Democratic  Forum MP Fabian Jozsa, under secretary in the Interior Ministry.  Conservatives had sought to give more police more authority,  while liberals fought for more individual liberties.    The compromise is viewed by many analysts as a step forward,  bringing Hungary in line with Western law enforcement standards.    Law enforcement is an issue that many emerging democracies  are grappling with. Under communism, Hungary and other Soviet  bloc countries were virtually police states, where laws  regulating wiretaps or sting operations were secret. In other  words, police had extraordinary powers and citizens had little  recourse.    After the political changes, police were confused about  their  roles and had difficulty in dealing with crime without specific  guidelines. The proposed legislation will also set parameters  for a variety of undercover operations, such as setting up dummy  companies, opening mail and conducting secret searches.    Government and opposition MP's clashed over how best to  control police activities. The government, taking a tougher  law-and-order approach, originally argued that prosecutors  should be able to authorize secret actions. But the liberal  position, court authorization for wiretaps, prevailed.    The bill requires a two-thirds majority to pass since it  deals with basic rights. The bill could be passed as early as  February.    The legislation also attempts to decentralize police  control,  but in a very limited way. During the communist era, the police  force was tightly controlled by the national government and  local authorities had virtually no police powers.    The bill would maintain the national police force, but would  give local towns and villages the ability to control police  services and personnel within the local areas. For example,  local governments could obtain specific services and additional  personnel by paying the national police for them.    Opposition MPs sought to give self-governments the authority  to select local police commanders, but the government rejected  that proposal.    "This could bring a political influence into the police,"  Jozsa said.</p>

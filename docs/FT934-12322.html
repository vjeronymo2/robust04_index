			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: European Leisure plans debt conversion European Leisure, the disco and snooker hall operator, is planning to convert some of its debt into a combination of new ordinary and preference shares, writes David Blackwell. Mr Ian Rock, chief executive, said that negotiations with banks were at an advanced stage. Details would be announced, along with full-year results, 'sometime next month.' The group last March reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 54,000 on turnover of Pounds 35.3m for the six months to end-December. Net debt was Pounds 76.6m, giving gearing of 227 per cent. Distributable reserves were inadequate to pay dividends. Mr Rock said that the restructuring proposals were not a crisis move. The group already had in place banking facilities to the end of next July.</p>

			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BLOODY POETRY' FROM BRENTON  </P> <P> Rebels, given enough time, can look ridiculous even to their most natural  allies.  </P> <P> Poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and George Byron, the top artistic anarchists of  their day, would seem to have a perfect dramatic biographer in Howard Brenton,  who remains Britain's toughest radical playwright. Yet there is always a part  of Brenton that doubts his own beliefs, and it's that side of his brain that  makes "Bloody Poetry" interesting.  </P> <P> It is far from Brenton at his best, and a curious choice for London City  Theatre to bring to the Beverly Hills Playhouse. But, at its sharpest, "Bloody  Poetry" does make Shelley and Byron seem a little ridiculous.  </P> <P> This also rescues Roxana Silbert's production (dressed in designer Annie  Kelly's alternating black-and-white, floor-to-ceiling drapes that fail to  coordinate with the uncredited costumes) from the hell of museum theater. Many  tableaux -- the poets in studied, romantic poses, their women in consternated  profiles -- come close to parodying the notion of young, rich rads on the  continent, yet not close enough to suggest that parody is in mind. Clues to the  deconstruction of the Romantics lie elsewhere.  </P> <P> Michael Kingsbury's Shelley and Nigel Miles-Thomas' Byron are wonderfully --  and dangerously -- childlike, yet perfect opposites of each other. The blond,  unblemished Kingsbury stresses Shelley's pre-adult nature, youth on the cusp of  a maturity never to come. Miles-Thomas' ruddy face framed by long sideburns is  matched by his finely-tuned vocal engine, which makes Byron's ragings all the  more propulsive: He is the adult stuck in gear, never quite able to get over  the clap.  </P> <P> The poets don't stick to their roles, though: child Percy is in a "three-way  marriage" with Mary, author of "Frankenstein" (Lise Bruno) and Claire  Clairemont (Xanthe Gresham), while adult George resists all commitments.  </P> <P> The trio, of course, cannot last, despite Shelley's calls for "a new society."  Here again -- and this is Brenton's problem -- we laugh at the utopian  flapdoodle while also wondering how a playwright can think his character can  talk like this. If this is comedy, it's through very muddy water.  </P> <P> The poets' hanger-on and would-be biographer, Polidori (Anthony Wise), reminds  us that these were the rock stars of their time, even while he's trying to cash  in on their fame. Wise, more than most of the cast, lets every word drip with  its sarcastic possibilities.  </P> <P> The play seems unfinished, perhaps due to Brenton's skeptical relationship to  foolish renegades. His distance from them, out of fear of identifying too  closely with emotionally stunted but great writers, gives "Bloody Poetry" a  paradoxical bloodlessness -- which follows from a work wrapped in paradox.  </P> <P> "Bloody Poetry," Beverly Hills Playhouse, 254 S. Robertson Blvd.,  Friday-Sunday, 8 p.m.; matinee Saturday, 4 p.m. Ends Sunday. $12; (213)  855-1556. Running time: 2 hours, 5 minutes.  </P></p>

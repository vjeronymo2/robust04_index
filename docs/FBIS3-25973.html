In early spring, about 130 Spanish economic figures came  with  their Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, who was the first foreign  government leader to visit China in the year.    Then, within several months, more entrepreneurs came with  the  Singaporean prime minister, Philippine president, Malaysian  prime minister and Thai prime minister.    A 50-member economic delegation accompanied Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin on his China tour, and many leaders of  world- renowned corporations came in the company of German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Delegations with the prime ministers from Austria and New  Zealand and the president of Mexico were also well stocked with  people from their economic circles.    Observers noted here that so many economic delegations came  to visit China along with the top leaders of their countries was  a new development in recent years, last year in particular.    The development, they said, indicated that the economic  circles of foreign countries attached greater importance to the  Chinese market, and that Sino-foreign exchanges are becoming  more pragmatic.    During their visit, foreign entrepreneurs saw for themselves  the achievements China has made in the reform and opening drive,  and this helped enhance their interest in investing in China.    They made extensive contacts with people from the Chinese  economic circles, and signed many documents of cooperation.    Several cooperative agreements were reached between China  and  Spain; with the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia, China signed  nine, ten and 30 agreements, respectively; over 20 Sino-German  agreements were signed last year, worth 2.8 billion U.S. dollars.    More important, the visits indicated that China's trade  partners, such as Thailand and Malaysia, the Western developed  countries and the Latin-American countries are attaching great  importance to developing bilateral trade and economic ties with  China.    Their governments also encouraged their economic circles to  invest in China. Almost all leaders expressed such intention  during their stay in China.    Prime Minister Gonzalez told Chinese and Spanish  entrepreneurs that investors should choose regions where  long-term economic growth could be maintained, and China is such  a region.    "The Spanish Government is aware of it, and will support  investment in China," he said.    According to Goh Chok Tong, Singaporean prime minister, his  government encourages its people to invest abroad, and China is  the place to which "they should give priority".    Fidel Ramos, president of the Philippines, said that his  government wants every Philippine businessman to see China  personally and get to know China's economic achievements of  recent years.    Chancellor Kohl also said that Germany is "very interested"  in developing relations, especially economic and trade  cooperation, with China.    On the other hand, the entrepreneurs got pledges from the  Chinese Government that the country will stick to its reform and  opening policy.    Premier Li Peng told visiting Spanish entrepreneurs that  China will open wider to Western countries, including opening  markets previously restricted in China.    When meeting with German economic figures, Premier Li Peng  said that the socialist market economy should be connected with  the world economy, and he expressed his hope that foreign  investors would put their investments into construction in the  fields of infrastructure, such as transportation, energy and  telecommunications.    Observers said that the visits by such a large number of  entrepreneurs with heads of state or government showed that  Sino-foreign economic and trade cooperation will develop further  in the years to come, and such cooperation will be of mutual  benefit.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THANKS, GREENBERG  </P> <P> I would like to paraphrase the headline of Peter Greenberg's Jan. 21 article  from "High Praise for a Pilot Who Knew, etc." to "High Praise for a Writer Who  Knows."  </P> <P> In my years of travel and travel reading, I have never read a person who is  more knowledgeable than Peter Greenberg. My file cabinets are full of his  articles, and it's evident that he does much research on whatever he writes  about. His articles touch on subjects no one else writes about, and are of  great use to a traveler.  </P> <P> DOROTHY KEARN  </P> <P> Rancho Mirage  </P></p>

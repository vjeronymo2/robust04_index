			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Signs of slower growth steady prices WALL Street tried to shrug off renewed worries about inflation last week, but it was only partially successful, which raises questions about the strength of the bond market's long winter rally. The inflation spectre popped out of the shadows on March 12, when a much larger than expected increase in the February producer price index knocked almost 1 1/2 points off the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue in a single day. The uneasy tone continued into the first half of last week. However, prices then rallied and the long bond ended on Friday night with a yield of around 6.81, down 5.5 basis points on the week, in spite of a retreat in prices earlier in the day. Market sentiment was helped, particularly at the short end, by Thursday's Bundesbank move to lower the German discount rate by half a percentage point to 7.5 per cent, which attracted overseas buyers into US debt. But the market rally came in spite of a second disturbing inflation report on Wednesday, in the form of the consumer price index for February. This showed a 0.3 per cent increase, in line with most analysts' expectations, though more worrisome was a 0.5 per cent rise in the the core inflation rate  -which excludes food and energy - for the second month in a row. Many economists brushed the figures off as statistical freaks. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, acknowledged in Congressional testimony that inflationary trends were off to a 'less than auspicious' start to the year. But he dismissed the consumer price statistics as an aberration and pointed out that labour costs - the 'most fundamental' driver of inflation - were still under control as corporate productivity rose. At the same time, recent demand statistics suggest that the economic recovery has lost some of the momentum witnessed in the fourth quarter, when GDP rose 4.8 per cent, and many economists are forecasting first-quarter growth in the 2 to 3 per cent range before a rebound later in the year. Ms Susan Hering, of Salomon Brothers, argues that contributory factors to the slowdown in final demand include consumer retrench-ment from the spending spree of last year's final half; a shortfall in personal tax refunds; stormy winter weather; and a mildly negative response to President Bill Clinton's economic package. This growing perception of slower short-term growth has helped steady bond prices over the past week, yet the re-emergence of the inflation spectre could start to change the dynamics of the market. Few economists yet see escalating inflation as a serious threat, though Mr Erich Heinemann, of Ladenburg, Thalmann, warns that 'if inflation continues to accelerate through the spring and summer, there will be shock waves in both Wall Street and Washington.' However, the statistics of the past two weeks will at the very least erode the perception that inflation may still be ebbing. And if the market comes to believe that inflation has reached the bottom of the cycle it may prove hard for long bond prices to make much further progress, without a touch of tightening from the Fed. No one is expecting any early move by the Fed. The bank's policy-making Open Markets Committee, which meets this week, seems certain to keep monetary policy on hold while it weighs the strength of the recovery and inflation. But the potential for some lively internal Fed debates over the next few months seemed to be underscored on Friday when Mr Lawrence Lindsey, a Fed governor, said the economy was 'closer to full employment than we might expect'.</p>

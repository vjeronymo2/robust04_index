			<p>BFN     [Text] Refugees entering from Burundi are required to  surrender their weapons to the head of their respective camps  immediately, in order to ensure their security and that of their  countrymen. This was a directive issued yesterday by Kibondo  District Commissioner (Thomas Kingi), when he was explaining to  refugees at (Kamomba) Camp that they are required to respect all  of this country's laws when they arrive. Ndugu (Kingi) said  that the refugees who decide to return to Burundi will be given  their weapons back, after they satisfy their respective refugee  camp heads that they acquired those weapons legally. The  district commissioner also said that refugees who want to go out  of their camps and return later, and those who decide to go back  to Burundi, should report to the heads of the camps instead of  running away. Those found to be violating the law shall be  prosecuted.</p>

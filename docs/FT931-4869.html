			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Alliance &amp; Leics ahead to Pounds 122.5m ALLIANCE &amp; Leicester Building Society yesterday announced a 23 per cent increase in pre-tax profits last year, from Pounds 99.5m to Pounds 122.5m, after reducing provisions on its troubled commercial lending book from Pounds 117.4m to Pounds 49.5m. The society reduced its overall provisions for bad loans to Pounds 203.6m (Pounds 215.1m). The reduction in commercial provisions was offset by a rise in provisions on residential lending to Pounds 128.6m (Pounds 69.7m) because of house price falls. It made a steep cut in mortgage lending to Pounds 1.26bn (Pounds 2.74bn), which it said was due to maintaining a 'prudent' lending policy to protect itself from a 'step-change' in the level of risk attached to residential lending. One of the strongest contributors to profit was the Girobank subsidiary, which contributed Pounds 64.4m (Pounds 48.8m). The profit was helped by growth in money transmission and a 20 per cent reduction in staff. Mr Peter White, chief executive, said the society was gradually reducing its exposure to commercial property and lending fell to Pounds 570m (Pounds 500m). It ceased commercial lending except to develop and sell properties. Mr White said the society expected to develop its personal banking business aided by Girobank's money transmission facilities. It would try to develop current accounts, and cross-selling of products such as life assurance. He said the society, which increased its total assets marginally to Pounds 20.5bn, was in the first year of a three-year recovery phase. It had dealt with its commercial lending problems and was well-provisioned against housing losses.</p>

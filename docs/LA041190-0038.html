			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS DISTRICT GROWTH LIMITS MOVE FORWARD IN CANOGA PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council took the first step Tuesday toward controlling  development in Canoga Park's business district, approving a motion by  Councilwoman Joy Picus to begin preparing a specific plan for the busy  commercial strip along Sherman Way.  </P> <P> Specific plans are city ordinances that can range from banning certain types of  businesses to regulating architectural styles.  </P> <P> In other areas of the west San Fernando Valley, such as Reseda, the council has  imposed temporary building moratoriums to allow time for the specific plans to  be prepared and approved.  </P> <P> Picus said she does not anticipate a building moratorium in Canoga Park "for  the time being." She said she plans to appoint a citizens committee to  recommend the Canoga Park restrictions relatively soon, so that a plan might be  ready by the end of the year.  </P> <P> In general, specific plans have been employed by the Planning Department to  impose controls on development, whether they be limits in booming areas such as  Ventura Boulevard or incentives for more development in aging commercial areas  such as Reseda.  </P> <P> In the case of Canoga Park, Picus was reluctant to say that Sherman Way needed  revitalization.  </P> <P> However, she said she hoped a specific plan would bring about "a fresh face for  Sherman Way."  </P> <P> "It's healthy economically, and it has been for some time," she said of the  strip, which includes a renowned row of antique stores, as well as pornographic  businesses, thrift shops and a pool hall.  </P></p>

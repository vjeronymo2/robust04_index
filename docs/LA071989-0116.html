			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE COUNCIL PASSES LAW TO PROTECT OZONE  </P> <P> A sweeping city ordinance, thought to be the most comprehensive law in the  nation restricting chlorofluorocarbons and other compounds destroying the  globe's protective ozone layer, was passed Tuesday night by the Irvine City  Council.  </P> <P> The ordinance, passed by a vote of 4 to 1, will affect businesses that use or  produce chlorofluorocarbons -- or CFCs. That includes the electronics industry,  installers of insulation, fast-food packaging firms, air conditioners and  refrigeration repair firms, as well as those who test fire-extinguishing  systems.  </P> <P> Irvine Councilwoman Sally Anne Sheridan, who cast the dissenting vote, accused  the city of a "Big Brother mentality." She criticized the ordinance as being  fraught with problems that will unfairly penalize Irvine residents and  businesses. Residents will be unable to find air-conditioner repairmen willing  to invest in costly recycling equipment, required under the law, and small  businesses will not be able to compete with others who are not restricted by  the costly requirements, she said.  </P> <P> But Mayor Larry Agran, who championed the ordinance with Councilman Cameron  Cosgrove, countered that the depletion of the ozone is of global concern and  that local cities can and should lead the way. With Irvine's large  concentration of high-tech industries using CFCs, it is especially fitting that  the city enact this law, he said Tuesday night.  </P> <P> "We make a significant contribution to the problem. We ought to make a  significant contribution to the solution," Agran said.  </P> <P> Answering one businessman's argument that federal and international agencies  are addressing the problem, Agran hotly retorted, "If we wait until all these  people take action, we might as well kiss off the future of the globe."  </P> <P> The ordinance severely restricts the use of chlorofluorocarbons, Halon and  other substances that research has shown deplete the Earth's ozone layer, which  protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation. It also creates a  position of environmental program coordinator to work with businesses affected,  help them find alternative compounds and, where appropriate, grant exemptions.  </P> <P> About 20 people addressed the council during the three-hour hearing, the second  held on the controversial ordinance. Most represented businesses who opposed  the ordinance, mostly on the grounds that the July 1, 1990, deadline for  compliance was unrealistic or that no suitable alternative compounds were  available.  </P> <P> The ordinance was amended Tuesday to provide for an exemption procedure in an  effort to respond to criticisms of business representatives at the first public  hearing June 29.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Flood of Exemptions'  </P> <P> "I believe you will have a flood of exemptions," said Keith Lamb of ICI  America, representing producers of CFCs. He asked that methyl chloroform -- a  solvent not allowed under the ordinance -- be removed from the banned list  because it is a good substitute for CFCs and has a lower ozone depletion level.  </P> <P> Scott Byington, an air-conditioning serviceman, said the ordinance will  increase the price of home air-conditioner repairs by $140 to $200.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Western Digital said that if methyl chloroform is not allowed,  his firm -- which is building a $100-million facility in Irvine -- will lose  its manufacturing capability "and its leading edge in the world market,"  despite the fact that the company meets all state and federal regulations.  </P> <P> "If this passes, we will be unable to run our facility," said Kasiuisuanatha  Soundaranathan.  </P> <P> But Agran responded: "The ordinance will not put you out of business. Just  apply for an exemption, which puts the burden of proof on you."  </P> <P> Opposition was not confined to business representatives. Bela Lengyel, a  retired university physicist and Irvine resident, said the effect of the  ordinance on the globe's ozone "would be too small to be detected by any known  scientific method."  </P> <P> The council, he said, is attacking "a global problem which can only be solved  by international agreement. . . . I respectfully request the council to turn  its attention to city business."  </P> <P> But another scientist warned the council to not be too free with exemptions to  the ordinance because they will dilute the effect. If Irvine's ordinance is  copied by other cities and agencies, he said, "this ordinance could make a  difference."  </P> <P> And Livio F. Davanzo of the International Technology Corp. told the council  that the protesting businesses are saying that "bottom-line profit is more  important than the health of people."  </P> <P> Republicans voting for the Moynihan amendment were Sens. William S. Cohen of  Maine, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire and  Arlen specter of Pennsylvania. Sen. Howell Heflin of Alabama was the only  Democrat voting against it.  </P> <P> The Senate is not expected to pass the overall foreign aid bill until later  this week.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROTECTING THE OZONE  </P> <P> The proposed Irvine restrictions on ozone-damaging chemicals --  chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and tetrafluoroethylene polymer (Halon) -- would  take effect July 1, 1990. The provisions would:  </P> <P> Bar the manufacture of any ozone-depleting substance.  </P> <P> Bar sale, purchase or use of food-packaging materials made of any  ozone-depleting substance.  </P> <P> Bar installation of building insulation containing any ozone-depleting  substance.  </P> <P> Restrict removal of ozone-depleting substances from construction to proper  recovery and disposal (specifics yet to be determined).  </P> <P> Require refrigeration and air-conditioning repair facilities to recycle and  prevent release into the atmosphere of ozone-depleting chemicals.  </P> <P> Bar sale of ozone-depleting coolants for refrigeration or air-conditioning  units, unless buyer has certified recycling system.  </P> <P> Bar disposal of any ozone-depleting chemical from refrigeration or air-  conditioning unit without recycling.  </P> <P> Restrict use of Halon in fire extinguisher testing or training to instances  required by law or to those with proper city permit.  </P> <P> Require fire extinguisher service and repair facilities to recycle any Halon.  </P> <P> Exceptions include licensed health-care facilities using these chemicals for  sterilization, research on the effects of these chemicals and research on  alternative technologies.  </P> <P> Fines would be up to $50 for first violation, up to $100 for second violation  and up to $250 for each additional violation. Each day of non-compliance would  be a violation.  </P> <P> Source: City of Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Clifford pins hopes on Japanese crumbs CLIFFORD FOODS, the dairy products and fruit juice company, yesterday reported a 20 per cent fall in profits but said it had high hopes for Japanese crumbs. The company has spent Pounds 2.5m, including ovens imported from Japan, to make breadcrumbs to sell to makers of breaded poultry and fish. Mr Brian Lambe, finance director, said Japanese crumbs were better quality and generated higher margins. 'They tend to be splintery type crumbs rather than ball crumbs,' he added. Clifford announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 6.65m to Pounds 5.3m in the year to December 31. This was due to price cutting among companies supplying milk to supermarkets, an activity which generates about 27 per cent of Clifford's turnover. Price cutting by competitors lost Clifford margin and business, although some custom has since been recovered. The company is also talking to customers about a price rise in a bid to restore margins to levels of a year ago. Turnover fell 5 per cent to Pounds 140.6m. Interest charges were lower at Pounds 655,000 (Pounds 1.38m), reflecting lower interest rates and capital expenditure. Gearing fell from 26 per cent to 20 per cent on net borrowings of Pounds 7m. Earnings dropped to 21.99p (26.26p). Directors are recommending an improved final dividend of 7.1p to make a total of 11.5p (11p). Clifford is converting its Kidlington dairy into an automated carton milk unit and concentrating all milk bottling at another site. The changes at Kidlington will involve write-offs and redundancy payments, the company said. About 30 staff are likely to be laid off.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to what King Norodom Sihanouk said on 12  April, popular audiences will be held once a week to solve  various issues on which there is a conflict of opinions between  people and officials.    The second popular audience, expected to be held on 21  April,  will solve various problems that are still pending. It is to be  specified that at the 12 April popular audience, four major  issues were solved and accommodated. Of all the four problems,  one seemed to have remained contentious. That was the issue of  the Olympic market. Despite this, the king intervened to end  the conflict by proposing that the Thai Bunrong company  recognize that the Olympic market is 50 percent owned by  traders. The king of Cambodia further said that this does not  mean that the Thai Bunrong company or the government bow to  traders, but it would achieve compromise and social stability.  He further said that many foreign companies plan to invest in  Cambodia, and the obstacle blocking this is the Khmer Rouge [KR]  group.    King Norodom Sihanouk also specified that if all Cambodians  agree to compromise regardless of their party affiliation,  Cambodia will quickly develop, and many foreign investors will  bring a lot of capital to invest in Cambodia.</p>

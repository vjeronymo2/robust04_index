'Drug treatment reduces criminality, it's just that simple,' added Vice-president Al Gore. The administration plans to increase spending on international drug programmes such as promoting alternative crops, but will cut the money spent on anti-drug patrols. 'The best long term approach to reducing the flow of drugs across our borders is to reduce the demand for drugs within our borders,' the administration's budget says.

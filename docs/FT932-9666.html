			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Deciphering Fiat's code of ethics: In the battle against corruption, some fronts remain unopened THROUGHOUT Italy's political corruption scandal one vital question has gone  -and may remain - unanswered: were company executives simply unwilling instruments in a network of kickbacks to politicians and parties, or were they the corrupters? The 'code of business ethics' unveiled by Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, this week, does not reveal anything about the past. But it goes some way towards eliminating the question in the future. In three pages, Fiat's lawyers have written a code of conduct governing behaviour in dealings with the government, civil servants or public-sector companies. The message is clear. In no event shall employees provide 'money or goods of any kind to promote or favour the interests of one or more group companies, even following illegitimate pressure'. The ban covers both cash and other kinds of 'favours', which have cropped up in the leaked testimony of managers and politicians who have been interrogated. Although Fiat, which is alleged to have paid L2.4bn (Pounds 1m) for a posh Rome apartment for a senator, is not exhaustive, its list includes 'any form of aid or contribution, disguised as sponsorship, assignments, consultancies, advertising, etc'. The document is as forthright on monitoring and enforcement. All employees, 'considered because of their company duties to be most affected by the principles of the Code', will have to sign. Fiat will immediately suspend business with any public functionary who tries to obtain favours. Any such attempt must be reported to an employee's superior or directly to the chief executive and legal division. Sub-contractors or freelances working for the group must make the same commitment. Chief executives of group subsidiaries will have to report annually to Fiat's managing director on compliance, providing details of any attempts to extort bribes or favours. The sanction in the event of violation is clear; an employee 'shall be deemed to terminate the relationship of trust existing between the company and the employee concerned, with the appropriate contractual and legal consequences on the employment relationship'. Tough talk. But does Fiat, which has seen almost a dozen of its executives in jail, under house arrest or having been briefly detained, mean what it says? The question is particularly pertinent given the group's size, status and prestige. Last month, Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director, who has testified twice voluntarily before Milan magistrates, exhorted fellow executives to follow Fiat's example of speaking out against corruption in future. Other companies are also re-considering their business ethics. Eni, the state-owned energy and chemicals group, which has been implicated even more deeply than Fiat, will introduce its own code soon. In spite of the new mood of co-operation between business and the magistrates, some doubts remain that the change of heart by Fiat and other companies may be partly cosmetic. Fiat's new code leaves a number of stones unturned. It governs relations only between the company and the public sector. Although the corruption scandal has so far involved only public-sector orders, it is not clear why Fiat is not demanding the same standards from staff when dealing with private companies. Moreover, the code only covers Italy. Until now, magistrates have focused their attention on allegations of domestic corruption. However, kickbacks on foreign business, so far restricted to Italy's state-sponsored foreign aid programme, have also been alleged. Without broadening the code to foreign countries, Fiat leaves itself open to accusations, often levelled against some big Italian companies by their foreign competitors, that contracts abroad have sometimes been won with bribes. Many US multinationals, particularly those operating in the developing world, have codes of practice similar to that of Fiat, but with the focus more on foreign operations. Italian companies are particularly defenceless against claims by their competitors of unfair competition as the country has no law against paying bribes abroad. The only legal sanction, now being increasingly used by magistrates, is to press charges of falsifying company accounts. Fiat says its code will be extended abroad in time. First, it must be approved by the boards of the group's roughly 1,000 subsidiaries. Then the code must be checked against laws in foreign countries in case amendments are needed. The group says relations with other private companies are already largely covered by an existing 'internal' code of practice, which governs matters such as conflicts of interest. Every new manager has to sign a declaration of agreement with the code. However, the new code, for all its worth, does not mask a lingering ambivalence on the part of the company towards corruption. Addressing fellow industrialists at a meeting of the Confindustria employers' federation in Venice last month, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, recognised the group's involvement in political corruption, but attempted to distinguish between two different types of behaviour. First were companies, like Fiat, which may have been caught up in 'episodes' of corruption, but were fundamentally involved in 'industry'. The second category comprised unspecified companies which had based their success entirely on privileged relations with politicians. The distinction, not easy to maintain, has been only partly clarified by Fiat's new code.</p>

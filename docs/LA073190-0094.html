			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREIGN MINISTRY DENIES PAYING REPORTERS FOR PRO-ISRAELI STORIES  </P> <P> Two journalists alleged Monday that some radio reporters working free lance for  foreign stations accepted money or favors from the Foreign Ministry to do  pro-Israel stories packaged as independent news items.  </P> <P> The two, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the free-lancers worked out  of a Jerusalem recording studio that has close ties with the ministry.  </P> <P> The ministry denied the allegations Monday but said it suspended all ties with  the studio lest "some aspects of the current arrangements . . . be misconstrued  as involving a conflict of interest."  </P> <P> The New York Times reported Monday that ministry officials secretly channeled  money to the studio to pay the reporters' salaries. It also said that Israeli  diplomats abroad helped the free-lance reporters recruit radio clients.  </P> <P> One Jerusalem-based radio reporter told the Associated Press that the ministry  paid the studio fee of $75 per hour for some free-lance reporters who otherwise  would have to pay the fee.  </P> <P> In return, "sometimes they (ministry officials) ask the reporters to publish  certain information," the reporter said.  </P> <P> Another broadcast journalist said some colleagues working for foreign stations  accepted money from the ministry in exchange for stories favorable to Israel  packaged as independent news reports.  </P> <P> The ministry said it has worked with the studio for years, commissioning  programs that are distributed by Israeli embassies abroad.  </P> <P> The ministry claimed that it decided to suspend ties with the studio on July 18  -- 10 days before it was first asked by the New York Times about the  relationship.  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ministry was concerned that some  journalists who worked for the studio also free-lanced for clients abroad.  </P> <P> But Avi Yaffe, owner of the studio, said the suspension was a result of the  media inquiries.  </P> <P> Yaffe said that nearly half his business came from the Foreign Ministry, but he  denied allegations of a covert link.  </P> <P> He said more than 10 free-lance reporters use his studio to produce programs  for foreign radio stations, including two major U.S. networks.  </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: EFM rises by 15% to Pounds 4.78m PROFITS OF Edinburgh Fund Managers rose from Pounds 4.16m to Pounds 4.78m pre-tax for the year to January 31. The 15 per cent improvement was achieved on the back of a near 20 per cent rise in turnover to Pounds 9.26m. Operating profits rose by 53 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. The rise mainly reflected a 19 per cent increase in fund management income, with a rise in costs of only 7 per cent. Funds under management totalled Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.4bn). Mr Colin Ross, chairman, said the upward momentum had come from falling interest rates rather than corporate profits which had generally been in decline. He added that the continuing sluggish trend in share prices led the directors to view EFM's income prospects for the current year with a degree of caution. Earnings emerged at 18.6p (15.9p) and a proposed final dividend of 8p makes a 13p (12p) total.</p>

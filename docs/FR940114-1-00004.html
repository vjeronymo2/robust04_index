			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940, subpart G, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91&hyph;190, an Environmental Impact Statement is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Civil Justice Reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order (E.O.) 12778. It is the determination of FmHA that this action does not unduly burden the Federal Court System in that it meets all applicable standards provided in section 2 of the E.O.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The information collection requirements contained in these regulations have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. Chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB control numbers 0575&hyph;0141, 0575&hyph;0085, 0575&hyph;0083, 0575&hyph;0090 and 0575&hyph;0133 in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). The proposed rule does not revise or impose any new information collection or recordkeeping requirement from those approved by OMB.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published for comment not withstanding the exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. FmHA is publishing this proposed rule with a 15-day comment period. This proposed rule relieves the restriction of taking a lien on all assets at the time of loan making. Furthermore, the Agency has concluded that the need to provide immediate assistance to farmers who have suffered severe production and physical losses as a result of natural disasters also justifies the shortened comment period under 5 U.S.C. 553(d) as discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major agricultural disasters during the 1993 crop year, including extensive flooding and rainfall in 9 Midwestern States and drought in 3 Southeastern States will result in a significant increase in demand for FmHA direct loan assistance. Requests will not be limited to emergency loan applications. In the 9 flood states alone, over 8 million acres of crops were lost or not planted in 1993. Estimates indicate that the 1993 floods were the second costliest weather disaster in the history of the United States. Preliminary estimates are that as many as 10,000 of the affected farmers may require financial assistance from FmHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Frequently, other lenders are willing to provide part of the farmers' credit needs, in combination with some FmHA assistance. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the existing FmHA loan security requirements would preclude many lenders from continuing to provide credit to these farmers. FmHA does not have the staff or financial resources to cope with this situation without participation from private sector lenders. The need for a change in the regulations is immediate. Most farmers are now concluding 1993 operations, consulting with their lenders, and planning for 1994. FmHA is receiving loan requests at an increasing rate. The Agency wants to give the public an opportunity for input on the proposed change but FmHA needs regulations in place for spring planting, so a reasonable compromise was the 15-day comment period. Because of the scope of the situation and the impact on local, regional, and national economies, the Agency believes that an amendment to the regulations after a shortened comment period is the only way to assure that affected farmers receive the assistance they need on a timely basis to recover from these disasters. Any further delay in the timing of this amendment will reduce the Agency's ability to meet the needs of those affected, thus imposing additional hardships on those who have already suffered substantially from flood or drought, and jeopardizing individual and community financial recovery from these disasters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1989, the General Accounting Office (GAO) submitted a report (GAO/RCED&hyph;89&hyph;9) to the Senate Committee on Agriculture addressing FmHA's loan making policies and practices. One of the concerns noted was FmHA's eroding security position on many loans and the significant dollar losses being projected (and realized). One of GAO's recommendations addressed the need for a change in FmHA collateral requirements. The report recommended additional security be taken when servicing loans, including obtaining the best security interest available on all of the borrower's assets. In an effort to reduce loan losses and protect the public interest, FmHA published a proposed rule on February 15, 1991, requiring a lien on all assets when loans are made. A final rule implementing this policy was published on April 30, 1992. On April 30, 1992, the Agency also published an interim rule requiring a lien on all a borrower's assets when loans are restructured. This policy had been issued as a proposed rule on October 23, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement for a lien on all assets at the time a loan is made was intended to assure that FmHA had a security interest in all of a borrower's property, reducing the potential for program abuse and loan losses. However, this policy has proven unwieldy, imposing an excessive burden on FmHA borrowers and requiring an excessive amount of FmHA staff time. When FmHA acquires a security interest in property owned by a borrower, that security must be serviced in accordance with all FmHA regulations applying to the type of security property involved, regardless of the purpose of the loan. For example, under existing regulations, the recipient of an FmHA FO loan must pledge not only real estate, but all chattel property as well to secure the loan. The borrower must account to FmHA for all farm products sold, even though FmHA's primary interest in the sale is for payment of the FO loan installment coming due, not the disposition of loan security. This requirement imposes a major burden on borrowers, especially on those who sell farm products on a frequent basis. Also, FmHA employees must spend a significant amount of time completing the necessary documentation for release of its security interest for such sales. This time is a precious resource that the Agency believes would be better spent providing advice and counsel to those borrowers under the most severe hardship who could benefit most from FmHA credit supervision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

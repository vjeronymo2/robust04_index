"As far as I know CIA representatives are still in Russia.  They have met heads of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service  to discuss professional and technical issues. It seems the  sides have managed to reach mutual understanding in some  aspects," a veteran staffer of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service who used to work in the United States told CRIME PRESS  on Friday.    Commenting on the "Ames case" Russian intelligence officials  remind that in similar situations Russians seldom make fuss.  Last year twenty people were arrested in Russia on espionage  charge, according to First Deputy Director of the Russian  Counter-Intelligence Service Sergey Stepashin. However, there  were no scandals, demarches or loud protesting, as professionals  can control their emotions.    Speaking to CRIME-PRESS on Friday, spokesman for Russian  Federal Counter-Intelligence Service Aleksandr Mikhailov  suggested an example of such sustained reaction the recent  arrest of a major agent working for "a Western secret service"  reported earlier this year by service Director Nikolay Golushko.  As a result, attempts to recruit a number of high-ranking  Russian officials have been prevented while the officials  removed from their posts.</p>

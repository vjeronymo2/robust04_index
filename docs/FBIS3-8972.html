			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party </F> (National Salvation Front), PD(FSN), at the meeting of the  PD(FSN) Steering Collegium in Bucharest on 12 March: "In Times  of Distress Democracy Is Impossible Without a Solid National  Consensus"]    [Text] I would like to remind you that last November,  after a number of speeches I had made on the same subject, I  stressed the idea of a national pact, which meant the opening of  talks and a dialogue with the Social Democracy Party of Romania  [PDSR] and the continuation of the dialogue with the Democratic  Convention of Romania [CDR]. I initiated this action,  proceeding from the realization that the reform was blocked and,  what is more, the whole Romanian economy was in a state of  blockage, something that is still being felt today by both our  economic units and the population as a whole. This is something  I was able to ascertain wherever I went during my visits through  the country. From my discussions in various enterprises, I  realized the meaning of this economic blockage, particularly for  the citizens in the street, who are desperate since they can no  longer cope with their daily needs. The danger of this  situation must be obvious to everyone. We are witnessing some  of the most aggressive manifestations of demagoguery -- an  almost incredible thing four years after the revolution -- from  the extremist and nationalist left-wing forces, which have begun  to eulogize the communist regime, especially the Ceausescu  regime, with a kind of shamelessness, which I no longer thought  possible in our days. Their demagoguery relies on a very simple  statement: "We gave the people work."    It does not really matter how we have reached such a  situation and whether it has anything in common with the 1989  revolution. The fact is that we are faced here with a most  dangerous kind of demagoguery. On the one hand, there is the  danger of public opinion moving toward their choice, which would  be a disaster for Romanian society, and, on the other hand,  there is the inherent need to think out what we can do to  maintain the idea and process of reform in our country and to  move closer to the developed and civilized world. Moreover, as I  have said on other occasions, too, it is known that in times of  distress and hardship -- as the period of transition is --  democracy is impossible without a solid national consensus. You  will find this statement in any manual of democracy, you will  find this statement in any serious political analysis of the  embarrassing moments that each democracy has had to go through.  This supplements perfectly what I have just said about the  danger of sliding off the course toward progress and  modernization. We must fill up the huge void inherited from the  former regime as far as the modernization of the economy and the  ability to be competitive in economic, technological, and  scientific matters are concerned. I raised this matter for the  first time last August. It was concretely embodied in the  national pact formula, while the national pact was, in its turn,  concretely presented in the letter you are all familiar with,  namely the open letter sent to Romania's president, which  specified the content of this pact in three spheres: political,  economic, and social. This was the basis of our strategy,  which, on the one hand, meant to convince the CDR of the  usefulness of this idea -- an endeavor that crowned with  success, as can be seen from the statement signed by all  opposition parties on 14 January 1994 -- after which we launched  this initiative toward the PDSR. The PDSR was obliged -- part  of that party probably wanted to do it anyway -- to engage in  negotiations with the two components of the parliamentary  opposition. Therefore, our proposal was for tripartite  PDSR-CDR-PD(FSN) talks.    Of course, the ugly and unqualifiable maneuvers of the  current parliamentary majority, made up of the so-called  pentagon, have never ceased to manifest themselves in this  period. Despite these maneuvers and the fact that the PD(FSN)  has concretely been the target of these attack, we started these  talks. Our delegation had two rounds of meetings with the PDSR.  As far as the CDR is concerned, things were clarified with them  through the signing of the 14 January convention.    The fact is that the latest governmental reshuffle took  place  at a time when we were in the process of discussing ways and  means to come to an agreement on certain matters. I honestly  tell you that, even now, I still cannot rationally find any  explanation for this reshuffle. If I go beyond the boundaries  of the rational and enter the backstage corridors of the  political game, then I might find an explanation. However,  there is no need to speculate at a time when we want to keep the  door of the dialogue open, since we are categorically opposed to  the principle "the worse it is now, the better will be for us  later."    This reshuffle does not ring true. It raises several  question marks. First of all, the act as such is outside the  spirit of the Constitution. We cannot imagine that there can be  two categories of ministers: those who are approved by  Parliament, and those who are not. Likewise, it is at least an  inelegant gesture, as far as the chosen moment is concerned,  that is exactly at the time of the start of the inter-party  negotiations and without any kind of consultations. We are  referring here to the replacement of General Spiroiu, thus  giving satisfaction to some very well-known calls.    Spiroiu has been engaged in a very active dialogue with  NATO.  The first thing I am asked in my capacity as NATO rapporteur is:  What is your opinion on this or that? Well, in this respect, I  can either say that I have no opinion or that it is a serious  thing. By that, I can endanger our effort to draw closer to  this organization. Therefore, some level of concern with  promoting our national interests should have been shown. There  should have been a minimum effort to explain the reasons for the  reshuffle and its meaning, the wrong things done by the replaced  people, and the qualifications brought by the new ministers for  making the governmental act more efficiently. The absence of  all this proves that the state of blockage has turned into a  true state of chaos. We have thus reached a situation whereby  the administration acts contrary to the country's laws, by  abusively imposing the government's arbitrary will, without it  actually solving anything, other than further complicating the  process of reform. This blockage is extremely dangerous for the  overall situation in which we find ourselves.</p>

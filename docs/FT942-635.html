			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: GAN poised to replace chief ahead of sell-off Mr Francois Heilbronner, chairman of GAN, the state-owned French insurance group, is set to be replaced by Mr Jean-Jacques Bonnaud, head of the company's international operations, according to government officials. Mr Bonnaud, whose appointment is expected to be confirmed within the next few days, will be faced with the task of preparing GAN for privatisation. The company is one of 21 public-sector groups slated for sale, although its privatisation is unlikely this year and must await the sale of Assurances Generales de France, a rival state-owned insurer. The change at the top of GAN is prompted by the expiry of Mr Heilbronner's mandate. But it also follows the relatively poor performance of the group, which has seen profits decline sharply over the past few years. From net profits of FFr2.32bn (Dollars 424m) in 1991, results at GAN fell to FFr402m in 1992 and remained flat at FFr414.3m last year. The decline in profits partly reflects GAN's exposure to France's troubled property sector, which forced it to restructure its banking operations and transfer FFr18.4bn of non-performing property loans from its balance sheet earlier this year. Following the restructuring measures, Mr Heilbronner said that the company was on course for 'very strong' growth and should be ready for privatisation later this year. Mr Bonnaud's appointment has been strongly supported by Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister. According to officials, Mr Alphandery is in favour of an internal appointment to head the group, as opposed to the series of external appointments which have taken place at other public sector companies. Mr Bonnaud, 59, joined GAN in 1979 and has been managing director responsible for international operations since 1986.</p>

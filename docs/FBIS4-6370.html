			<p>BFN     [Text] On 15 and 16 of April, the party organization of  the Vietnam Civil Aviation Department held their party  representatives midterm conference.    Comrade Nguyen Hong Nhi, secretary of the party committee,  delivered the report of the party standing committee, in which  he pointed out that in the past two years the Vietnam civil  aviation sector has recorded new progress in its effective  operations and has enhanced its prestige both domestically and  internationally. The sector has started to reform its  technology, means of transportation, and equipment, and has  upgraded many of its facilities, thus effecting a change for the  better in the air transport business.    The Vietnam civil aviation sector has stood firm despite  fierce competition. It has developed its network of air routes  covering purely neighboring markets to include some more complex  routes further afield.    The conference set up targets for the next few years, which  include overcoming the risk of lagging further behind compared  with world and regional aviation services, further developing  the level of transport services, constructing and upgrading the  infrastructure, and stepping up training in parallel with  ensuring safety and efficiency for flights.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Taxing time for shares Wall Street's 83-point fall on Tuesday was a sharp reminder of what can happen to equity markets when governments decide to take decisive action on budget deficits. It remains nervous even though investors quickly remembered that the tax increases would actually have to be passed by Congress and that the measures would, in any case, have little impact on growth this year. London is not trading on quite such a high multiple, but UK share prices could also become sensitive to the threat of fiscal discipline on March 16. All the more so since the government has talked itself into such a corner that hopes of lower interest rates are fading. Indeed, the equity market is starting to look bereft of supportive background factors. With over Pounds 2bn in rights issues so far this year, institutional cash is getting rather tight. That could explain why unfashionable stocks find it so difficult to attract support. Glaxo, for example, fell a further 3 per cent yesterday, despite Thursday's favourable results. At least the first report of the seven wise men is some consolation, though its policy impact remains uncertain. By choosing a panel of such widely varying views, the Treasury has left itself a wide degree of latitude. But none of the experts expect tax increases of more than Pounds 4bn in this budget. Six of them think no tax increases at all should take effect in 1993. It would be difficult for Mr Lamont to announce any significant tightening without explaining why he has rejected the panel's advice.</p>

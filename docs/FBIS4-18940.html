			<p>BFN     [Text] "The absurb and delirious threats made by Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, whose presence in Strasbourg seems out-of-tune and  gauche, do not intimidate us."    These were the words of Defense Minister Fabio Fabbri, who  was replying to statements made by the Russian ultra-nationalist  leader condemning the raids on Serb positions in the town of  Gorazde, which were carried out by two F-18 [as received]  bombers belonging to NATO forces. The planes left from Aviano,  in Friuli.    "Italy," stressed Fabbri, "guarantees its participation in  all legitimate NATO and UN operations that protect UNPROFOR  units and avert the massacre of civilians."</p>

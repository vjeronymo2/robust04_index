			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Intl Food Machinery at Pounds 878,000 SHARES IN International Food Machinery, which came to the market last December, jumped 9p to 80p yesterday after the company reported a surge in pre-tax profits to Pounds 878,000 for the first half of 1993. This compared with Pounds 292,000 last time which was after Pounds 128,000 losses from discontinued activities. Turnover of this food processing and refrigeration equipment concern grew to Pounds 4.84m (Pounds 3.39m) and earnings per share reached 5.98p (1.68p). An interim dividend of 1.4p has been declared. The company said that following its attendance at an exhibition in Iran, a substantial number of orders were taken for which deposits had been received. However, because of the time taken to complete these transactions, profits on these would arise in the second half. Turnover in Australia had increased considerably and orders achieved and anticipated from a major trade show in that country were likely to have a very positive effect in the current year.</p>

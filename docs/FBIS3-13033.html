			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Uri Binder, Shefi Gabay, Hemi Shalev, and </F> Avino'am Bar-Yosef]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Israeli political sources  yesterday said that Israel will not make any more gestures  toward the Palestinians unless there is an explicit PLO promise  that such gestures will lead to a resumption of the talks. It  has been learned that in such a case, Israel will agree to push  forward the implementation of some parts of the Gaza-Jericho  first agreement.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday said that the  Gaza-Jericho first agreement can be implemented in "half the  time" stipulated in the Declaration of Principles. Meanwhile,  political sources yesterday denied reports on contacts aimed at  organizing a Rabin-'Arafat summit in the near future.</p>

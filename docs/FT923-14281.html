			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: Employment tip Did you know that Bengt Dennis, governor of the Swedish Riksbank - the oldest central bank in the world - is one of the most lowly paid members of his fraternity? He earns a mere 55,000 crowns a month (Pounds 5,230) from his employment in Stockholm. But he manages to double his annual earnings as a result of plentiful emoluments from the Bank for International Settlements, of which he is currently president - a mandate which runs out at the end of next year.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 500 EXPECTED IN CHARITY TAVERN RUN  </P> <P> More than 500 participants are expected Sunday for the 13th Annual Bar-to-Bar  Christmas Charity Run in San Pedro, a community tradition in which joggers  dressed in holiday costumes raise donations at local taverns for the harbor  area's disabled youth.  </P> <P> The event, beginning at 8:30 a.m., spans four miles and costs $5 to enter.  </P> <P> Organizer Carmen Trutanich said this year's goal is to raise at least $5,000 in  donations for four local organizations, including the Harbor Area Retarded  Children's Foundation. In addition, he said, canned goods and other food will  be collected for Toberman Settlement House.  </P> <P> The event began on Christmas Eve, 1977, when Trutanich and five other joggers  ran through San Pedro singing Christmas carols. The following year, with more  runners, the group stopped off at local taverns to sing carols and collect  money. Over the years, the event has drawn hundreds of runners -- dressed as  Santas, elves and even Christmas trees -- and raised thousands of dollars in  contributions.  </P> <P> The run will begin at the intersection of 9th Street and Grand Avenue and will  be followed by a holiday dance party at the same location.  </P></p>

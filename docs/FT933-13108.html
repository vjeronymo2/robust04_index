			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unionist deal may hinge on EC aid for province NORTHERN Ireland's Unionist MPs yesterday gave the strongest hints yet that they are prepared to strike a deal with ministers which could help avoid a government defeat over the social chapter on Thursday. The nine Ulster Unionist MPs reckon their votes may well determine whether the government is defeated. But the expectation at Westminster is that no agreement would be reached until hours before the vote when the government would calculate if it was worth brokering for the support or abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs. The government's campaign to secure Ulster Unionist support may be linked to a complex agreement struck with Brussels over Northern Ireland's share of special EC assistance funds. Security policy and a Commons committee on Northern Ireland may also be part of any deal. In the early hours of yesterday morning the UK government mounted a desperate effort to preserve Northern Ireland's share of special EC assistance reserved for poorer areas of high unemployment. EC officials said the UK campaign appeared driven less by a desire to secure extra money to sweeten the Ulster Unionists, but more by a fear that Northern Ireland's position could be squeezed vis a vis Ireland. Ireland is the biggest per-capita beneficiary of the Community's special Objective One assistance. In the previous round, Dublin received two to 2 1/2 half times more funds per head than Greece, Portugal and Spain, who make up the EC's 'Poor Four'. This amounts to around Ecu1,000 per Irish head over the past five years - more than double Northern Ireland's share. The UK argued, apparently successfully, that the gap between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was likely to grow even further as a result the 1994-99 EC budget deal which includes an Ecu15.5bn Cohesion Fund for the Poor Four. Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, agreed to take account of the UK demands to preserve Northern Ireland's position. He offered assurances that the UK would receive 2bn, the bulk of which is to be divided between the poorest regions: the Highland and Islands, Merseyside and Northern Ireland. Unionists are also looking for and more powers for local councils in the province, better scrutiny of Northern Ireland legislation in the Commons and a commitment on Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Although there appears to be no formal 'shopping list', the party's MPs had little inhibition in setting parameters for any deal. The Rev Martin Smyth, MP for south Belfast, said that for his colleagues to expect any movement by the government on the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement  - hated by Unionists because of the role it gives Dublin in Northern Ireland - was probably 'too high a price' and could 'hamper their own negotiating position'. Mr James Molyneaux, UUP leader, has deliberately kept a low profile over the past week, doing little to dampen speculation that he is looking for a deal. Three UUP MPs are due to meet Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, tomorrow before the voting beings. But any deal is more likely to be agreed in private negotiations between Mr Molyneaux and Mr Richard Ryder, the government chief whip, and Mr John Major.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yi Sung-chol] </F>   [Text] The ROK and the United States decided that if North  Korea changes the atomic reactor fuel rods at its five  megawatt-class atomic reactor without the presence of an  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection team, they  will suspend the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.    At the high-ranking government and party policy coordination  meeting held on 7 May, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said: "The  issue of the IAEA's presence when North Korea changes its fuel  rods is one of the preconditions to continue the DPRK-U.S.  dialogue." He added: "The government is currently  strengthening cooperation with allies, including the United  States, for a smooth resolution of the North Korean nuclear  issue. We will work to make North Korea realize the seriousness  of the current situation by using the DPRK- U.S. channel and the  Chinese channel."</p>

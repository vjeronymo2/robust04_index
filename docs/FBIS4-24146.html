			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Trevor Manuel by </F> SABC announcer Leslie Mashokwe in Cape Town; date not given;  from the "Newsline" program--recorded]    [Text] [Mashokwe] Do you think that this budget is really  going to make you realize the dream of a better life for all  South Africans?    [Manuel] It certainly provides a fairly important start.  Where do you look? Firstly, the 2.5 billion rand which the  president raised in his state of the nation address as a  contribution towards the RDP [Research and Development Program]  is a small sum. But within all of the budget, within each of  the programs, certainly where I sit within trade and industry,  what I need to do is to stimulate those areas that the RDP asks  of me. Every budget line must be reexamined, and you've got to  look at issues that relate to the quality of life of people. In  that way we can address the RDP.    It's not going to happen in one year. It's certainly a  process more than a single event. But I think we're well on the  way. So clearly within the budget there's sufficient room to do  that. Take account of the fact that to draw up a budget takes  about 14 months. You've had your election just two months ago,  and so all of the inputs aren't there, but within the big  picture I think there's enough room.    There are certain things that we believe are important as  well. You would have found that in the ANC election manifesto  there were taxes for people earning less than 4,000 rand a  month, would be one example. The very unfair burden placed on  women, especially married women in respect of taxation would be  another example. Now with this once-off levy to pay for the  transition costs, and they were fairly high, you would find  special relief for those two groups of people, so the terms are  in place.    [Mashokwe] Let's look at one relief, one particular relief  that we think ANC used very strongly -- zero rating on foods  stuffs. Nothing is coming out of this budget in that regard, and  one would have expected an ANC government to pioneer at least  something along those lines?    [Manuel] Okay, clearly it is an omission for the moment. But  in looking at the overall tax structure it's important that you  don't just do things piecemeal. You don't want to zero-rate  bread and add 2 percent on the price of the jam that will go on  that bread.    And so the commission that was set up on taxation under the  chairpersonship, Professor Michael Katz, is actually going to be  important. All South Africans across the board can then make  input into that commission. And that commission will advise  government on a new system of taxation.    Overall it will take account of pay-as-you-earn, SITE  [standard income tax on employees], corporate tax in the longer  term sense, but certainly also VAT [value added tax]. It is  important, and I say that unless democracy puts more food of a  better quality on the tables of the majority of South Africans  we wouldn't have achieved anything. So that is why the zero  rating, increasing that basket of goods that could be zero  rated, is an important issue. But it will come, and I'm sure  that it would be announced even before the next budget.    [Mashokwe] The reason why I'm asking you this is because  when  you were not in government you were calling for the scrapping,  the zero rating of foodstuffs, and now you're not saying  anything about it. You're saying to me that it's coming?    [Manuel] I'm saying it's coming. I'm saying that it needs to  be done in the context of complete revision of the tax structure  that obtains -- that commission was announced today -- Michael  Katz, Dennis Davis, a few other people on that commission, I  think it will hear what South Africans want, and make the  necessary input, so government can be advised on the new tax  system.    [Mashokwe] You said earlier that where you sit in trade and  industry, this budget is of importance. In what way? Import  surcharge being canceled, what does that mean to me?    [Manuel] Well, it means a fair amount to any South African.  Firstly, the way in which corporate tax, or company tax is now  structured so that you have a reduction to 35 percent, and then  the secondary tax on companies which effects dividends  primarily, being increased, is an important signal to small and  medium business people because they are the major beneficiaries  out of this.    But what all South Africans need is an economy that grows,  and clearly this is an investment budget. At a corporate rate  of 35 percent, investments, new investments are encouraged,  dividend pay-outs are not encouraged, and so more investment,  more jobs, all of those issues become important.    [Mashokwe] What about reduction of tax on individuals,  people  who made an X next to ANC?    [Manuel] Yes, I'm saying that one would expect the terms of  reference of the commission established on taxation to include  issues of personal income tax.</p>

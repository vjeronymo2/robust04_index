			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> USC;  </P> <P> OLIVER HAUNTED BY HIS FATHER'S DEATH  </P> <P> Freshman cornerback Jason Oliver said in an interview this week that he  sometimes cries himself to sleep, wondering if he contributed to the death of  his father.  </P> <P> Marvin Oliver, highest-ranking black officer in the Kern County Sherriff's  Dept., died Oct. 18 of respiratory failure.  </P> <P> Three days earlier, his son and two other USC football players were charged in  the alleged sexual battery of a 23-year-old female student.  </P> <P> "I didn't think his health was that bad," Oliver told Lisa Nehus Saxon of the  Riverside Press-Enterprise. "But now I have to face that maybe because of me,  maybe that's why my dad died. He wasn't going too bad, and then all of a  sudden, he died. He died a couple of days after it came out in the paper that I  had been charged. I never even got to talk to him about it. I called him, and  he was too sick to talk to me. . . .  </P> <P> "I read in the (Bakersfield Californian) where my dad was tired and had too  many worries on him. They said that the fact I had been accused . . . might  have weighed heavily on him, making him feel bad and be down. They said it may  have caused him to give up. . . .  </P> <P> "I just hate to think that I may have been a contributing factor to my own  father's death . . . but I have to face that."  </P> <P> Oliver's mother, Juanda, died of cancer on Sept. 22.

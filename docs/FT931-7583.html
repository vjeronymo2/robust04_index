			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / AT&amp;T in venture with Beijing AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, moved yesterday to establish a much stronger presence in the potentially huge Chinese market by signing a memorandum of understanding with the Beijing government's state planning agency for joint development of the country's communications infrastructure. Mr Randall Tobias, vice-chairman of AT&amp;T, said that projects contemplated in the partnership were 'potentially among the most extensive in our company's history'. The putative projects include local manufacturing and research and development in at least 10 areas, ranging from network management to customer premises equipment and cellular communications systems. The first stage of the partnership would be the establishment of a joint venture to make AT&amp;T's advanced 5ESS switch in China. This would require US government approval. However, no difficulties are expected as AT&amp;T already sells switching and transmission systems to China. AT&amp;T said the agreement could lead to billions of dollars in revenues. But it will face fierce competition for contracts from European and Japanese equipment manufacturing rivals, notably Alcatel of France, which is believed to be the largest supplier of switching equipment to the Chinese market.</p>

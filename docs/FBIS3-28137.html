			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Foreign Ministry spokesman's news conference in </F> Hanoi on 3 February]    [Text] In Hanoi on 3 February, the SRV Foreign Ministry  spokesman Mrs. Ho The Lan held a regular news conference with  the participation of a large group of domestic and foreign  reporters.    Regarding the rumor that the U.S. will lift its trade  embargo  on Vietnam, Mrs. Ho The Lan said:    [Begin Ho The Lan recording] A REUTER correspondent asked:  Does Vietnam expect the United States to lift the embargo in the  near future? And does Vietnam want President Clinton to take  action in line with the 27 January U.S. Senate vote in favor of  lifting the embargo? Moreover, correspondents from the  Australian ABC, ITAR-TASS, and KYODO asked about Vietnam's  reaction to the CBS and CNN reports on 1 February that President  Clinton has decided to lift the embargo against Vietnam and that  an official announcement will be made on 4 February. In answer  to these questions, I would like to repeat that in recent days  there were many rumors about the United States planning to lift  the embargo soon. I would like to say that I would welcome  President Clinton's decision to lift the embargo on Vietnam  because it is a decision that suits the actual situation and the  aspirations of the two peoples and the world community, and it  is a decision that is expected by world public opinion. I also  received a telophone call from a NEW YORK TIMES correspondent  asking whether lifting of the U.S. embargo would be good news to  Vietnam and the United States. I answered that it would be good  news, because it is not only good news for both Vietnam and the  United States but for the entire world community, too. The same  correspondent further asked if, following the lifting of the  embargo, U.S. companies would be welcomed in Vietnam. I  answered that Vietnam always welcomes U.S. companies and those  from other countries to do business and invest in Vietnam on the  basis of equality and mutual interests. [end recording]    At the same news conference, correspondents from AFP,  REUTER,  and ITAR-TASS asked about Vietnam's reaction on the U.S. State  Department report on human rights dated 1 February. The  Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that to ensure  human rights in each nation is the authority and responsibility  of that country. In Vietnam, although the country is facing  numerous difficulties, the Vietnamese Government has made great  efforts to satisfactorily ensure the Vietnamese citizens' rights  in the economic, social, cultural, civil, and political domains.  Based on our efforts, I may say that the 1 February U.S. State  Department report on human rights was not objective enough.    Correspondents from ITAR-TASS and the VIETNAM INTERNATIONAL  RELATIONS journal asked for comments on the news report that  China and Taiwan are cooperating in exploring areas around the  Spratly Islands and that Taiwan has planned to build an airport,  a seaport, and a lighthouse in area of these islands; our  Foreign Ministry spokesperson said: The Spratly and Paracel  Islands belong to Vietnam, and as a result, Taiwan's bilateral  act has violated Vietnam's sovereignty and has further  complicated the situation in the region.</p>

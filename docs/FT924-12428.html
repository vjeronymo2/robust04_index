			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Marine Midland maintains recovery MARINE MIDLAND Bank, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's US subsidiary, yesterday reported third quarter net earnings of Dollars 29.9m (Pounds 17.3m) compared with losses of Dollars 56.9m in the same period last year. The latest results represent the third consecutive quarter of profits and lift nine month net earnings to Dollars 73.5m compared to net losses of Dollars 166.2m for the first nine months of 1991. Mr John Bond, Marine Midland's president and chief executive, said the bank had continued to make 'solid progress' in the third quarter, especially given that second quarter net earnings of Dollars 41m were bolstered by some non-recurring recoveries from the group's problem asset portfolio.' Total interest income in the third quarter was Dollars 274.6m, down from Dollars 348.9m. Operating expenses, excluding restructuring and credit-related costs were Dollars 171.6m, compared with Dollars 173.8m in the second quarter and Dollars 191.7m a year ago. Credit related expenses, including a Dollars 10.2m provision for loan losses, were Dollars 44.8m, down from Dollars 96.3m in the 1991 third quarter. Non-accruing loans fell by 19.3 per cent to Dollars 759.8m or 7.84 per cent of loans outstanding from Dollars 942m or 8.03 per cent a year earlier.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Magnolia Ruiz; from the "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The gringos that are camped out in Juanchaco have  certainly brought weapons, reported Tulua Mayor Gustavo Alvarez  Gardeazabal today. They have enough weaponry to seize half of  Colombia, he said.    [Begin Alvarez recording] The U.S. presence is a presence of  foreign troops. Those people brought weapons, but Admiral Jose  Ignacio Rozo [commander of the National Navy Base at Malaga Bay]  has their weapons stored in a container that is under the  custody of a Colombian soldier. The admiral is executing strict  orders based on an agreement, but a foreign Army is undoubtedly  being lodged at a Colombian naval base; therefore, it was  necessary to request the Senate's permission. [end recording]    The great doubt of why prevails. What is the reason? What  explanation will be given concerning a large weapons shipment  under the custody of a Colombian Navy member if they reportedly  came to cooperate with Colombia and build projects in the zone?    [Begin Alvarez recording] I met with a commission from the  Prosecutor General's Office, which is investigating the case. I  suppose the same will be done by the commissions being sent this  week by Valle Department's assembly, Buenaventura's council, the  Senate of the Republic, and many journalists from different  media, who will witness how enough weapons to seize half of  Colombia were transferred to build a small school and a health  post.

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Protests hit S African black 'homeland' Riot police fired live ammunition on demonstrators in the nominally independent black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana yesterday as strikes and anti-government protests swept the capital, increasing political pressure on President Lucas Mangope. In the capital, Mmbatho, and its twin town of Mafikeng, security forces for a second day fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators. Earlier in the day riot police stormed the broadcasting centre after the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation's chairman - Mr Eddie Mangope, son of the president - was locked in the building by striking workers. The occupation of broadcasting centre and demonstrations were part of a growing series of protests against Mr Mangope, who is resisting South Africa's transition to black majority rule and has refused to register for next month's all-race elections. The protests began with a civil servants' strike, sparked by demands that their pensions be paid out before the April elections, after which Bophuthatswana will cease to exist as it will be reincorporated into South Africa. Civil servants feared the homeland would use their pension fund to pay government expenses if financial transfers from Pretoria - which account for about one-third of Bophuthatswana's budget - were cut to put pressure on Mr Mangope to take part in elections. The Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body which oversees South Africa's transition to democracy, believes it has the power to cut off funds to Bophuthatswana, though this has not yet been tested. Since then the strike has widened into generalised demonstrations against Mr Mangope, encouraged by the African National Congress which wants him to accept the elections, having failed to negotiate the regional powers which Bophuthatswana and other right-wing groups wanted in exchange for poll participation. Mr Mangope has so far refused to allow campaigning in the homeland. ANC President Nelson Mandela said it was only a matter of time before action was taken against him. The ANC has urged President FW de Klerk's government to halt all financial aid and supplies to Bophuthatswana to force it to participate in the elections.</p>

Bobrakov, under the "Political  Prognosis" rubric; place and date not given: "It Isn't All  Gloom: Zhirinovskiy Will Not Be President and The Communists  Will Not Return to Power"]    [Text] At times of trouble people readily turn to all  sorts of prophets -- from astrologists to those who read the  future from playing cards. Today's guest, Doctor of Historical  Sciences Sergey Vladimirovich Volkov, does not resort to  supernatural forces. Nevertheless, his predictions are  distinguished by their remarkable accuracy.    His opinions have usually been at variance with the chorus  of  commentators and "forecasters" of the most diverse views.  Admittedly, his predictions are not widely known because, being  "different" from everyone, he appeared most often in  small-circulation publications and until recently, like a  dissident of the Brezhnev era, he has been published mostly in  foreign emigre newspapers.    Back in January-February 1991, when everyone began talking  about Gorbachev's "coup" (some in exultation, others in panic),  he claimed that such a thing was impossible, that the country's  disintegration was just a few months away, and that after the  transfer of real power by Gorbachev into the hands of the  republic authorities he would inevitably become redundant and be  dropped. Despite the widespread convictions that "the Army will  not let itself and the country be destroyed" he was sure that it  could not do anything about it.    At the end of 1991, when everyone, including experts from  the  CIA, was expecting -- some with fear, others with hope -- that a  "social explosion" would follow the release of prices, he  expressed the conviction that Yeltsin could sleep easy in his  bed because the Communists' hopes of coming to power at the head  of a "people's uprising" were absolutely groundless.  Conversely, at the time of the complete "obedience" of the vice  president and the Supreme Soviet, the author of this forecast  said that the real danger to the regime could only come from a  section of its own structures which would form a compact with  the opposition or evolve into national-bolsheviks.    [Bobrakov] Nevertheless, Sergey Vladimirovich, why are your  forecasts so astonishingly accurate? After all, you predicted  the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly with an  accuracy of within 5 percent.    [Volkov] To assess a specific political situation you simply  have to know, first, how in principle people of a certain  outlook will behave in situations of a certain type and second,  what that given person's outlook is and what that type of  situation is. I cannot know a great many specific situations  (because I am not one of the "initiated") but if I have at least  60 percent of the significant information for any given  situation I can hardly go wrong. You have to know how to  compare reliable facts, which by no means everyone can do  properly, not even those who possess the full set of  information. The most important thing here is not to succumb to  emotion or to extrapolate from one's own political preferences,  something which more than 90 percent of people who presume to  judge events are clearly incapable of doing.    [Bobrakov] What role does your profession as an historian  play in the way that you view the situation? I have heard, by  the way, that you were virtually the youngest ever doctor of  historical sciences....    [Volkov] That is probably right. I defended my thesis  when I was 34, but I am a historian mainly in terms of my way of  thinking. History for me has been a natural pastime since  childhood. It contains the key to the understanding of all  things. After all, people have not changed in millennia....  But I became a professional historian quite by chance. As a  writer once said, "I wrote simply because the sorry times  prevented me from acting."    [Bobrakov] You correctly predicted the results of the  elections to the Federal Assembly. How did you envisage the  breakdown of social forces in the country in mid-December? Did  any surprises emerge for you in this respect during the voting?    [Volkov] It was quite obvious 12-18 months ago that in any  even remotely free elections the greatest chance of success  would belong to those who are associated with the "third force,"  that is, neither the "democrats" nor the "Communists." The  organizers of the elections did everything possible to prevent  the participation in the elections of those parties which could  have a real claim to that kind of image. The requirement to  collect 100,000 signatures in just two-three weeks was aimed  precisely against them because those parties were still very  weak organizationally or had only recently been created.  Consequently, the only contender for the role of the "purely  patriotic" party was the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  [LDPR] which won the votes of all those who did not want to vote  either for the democrats or the Communists. Some people thought  that if the patriotic idea seemed to be a base caricature people  would not vote for it. These were vain expectations. The very  idea is so natural and appealing that they even voted for the  caricature. The argument "down with everyone" was fairly  widespread.    I have always said (including in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA a year  ago) that the patriotic idea would sooner or later prevail, its  victory was inevitable because it is at the basis of any normal  statehood. And if the present regime cannot identify itself with  it, someone else will do so and, furthermore, the best chance  will belong to those who are customarily called the  "red-browns." What is surprising about that: If you do not  want to be patriots yourselves, if you say nothing and prevent  the "civilized" patriots from appearing "in public" -- well,  that is how you get Zhirinovskiy....    The LDPR's "own" constituency comprises not more than 10  percent and not less than 5 percent, the rest has been handed to  it by the authorities. There are no surprises here. The  democrats' tactics -- to run in several blocs rather than  pooling everything with Gaydar and his "Choice" -- produced the  expected success. Had they pooled everything with Gaydar, such  a unified bloc would have hardly gained more that 30 percent of  the votes; but in the event they gained twice as much because a  sufficient number of people were successfully persuaded that the  other democratic parties were something different from the  extremely unpopular "mainstream" democrats. (One of the most  comical results have been the expressions of regrets about the  "split" among democrats.) Yeltsin himself is one thing, the  "democrats" are something quite different. Yeltsin would win a  presidential election right now, because he enjoys the support  of about 30 percent of the total population and of about 40-50  percent of those who go to vote. Without Yeltsin, the  "democrats" can count on just about 20 percent of the total  population and on about one-third of its active section, but  when the question of the threat of communist restoration is  raised, this number may double because the overwhelming majority  of the population are, of course, in principle "in favor of  reforms" (but not in favor of "the democrats"). But  Zhirinovskiy is also in favor of reforms....    [Bobrakov] What political maneuvers can be expected in the  immediate future from the leaders of parties and movements?  What will be the final disposition of forces in the new  parliament? What will be the future of parliament in general?    [Volkov] This is not a very interesting subject to discuss  because, under the Constitution which was adopted (thanks,  incidentally, to Zhirinovskiy), parliament will hardly mean  anything. There will be a lot of noise, there will be  merriment, and many are already preparing for some decent  amusement. It is obvious that, without the LDPR, the Communists  will be unable to block a single decision. As regards the LDPR  itself, provided it displays loyalty to Yeltsin (unless he  behaves the way the mass media did in the first few days after  the elections), Zhirinovskiy is hardly likely to fall out with  the president. So far he has been on Yeltsin's side at the most  critical times -- on the question of disbanding the Supreme  Soviet, on the question of the Constitution -- and people prefer  to bashfully "overlook" this.    As a matter of fact, Yeltsin gained the most from the  election results. Some people were getting ready to write him  off and contest the presidential seat, but now it is obvious  that they would not get anywhere without him, he remains their  sole protection.    Of course, not a single democrat would be willing to  cooperate with the LDP, but this is what will happen objectively  if they want to pursue the reforms and if the reforms are indeed  the main issue for them. The Communists will be against,  whatever happens. There are virtually no issues on which the  democrats could unite with today's Communists against the LDPR.  But there is nothing to prevent Zhirinovskiy uniting with the  reds. And he will certainly do so if the campaign against the  LDPR does not cease.    [Bobrakov] How about trying to look a little further into  the future? How do you, in general outline, imagine the  development of the system of the country's political  administration, and the future of Russia as a whole?    [Volkov] I am convinced that if Russia remains in existence  it will, sooner or later, return to the path of natural  development, and that legal continuity as regards historical  Russia will be restored.    Proper political activity is only just beginning. Genuine  figures and parties, unassociated with the Soviet past, are only  just emerging. I do not think that they could be "benched" for  any length of time in the conditions of a normal democratic  process. After the third of fourth election they will succeed in  gaining a fitting place in the political spectrum and will  determine Russia's state development. They do not even have to  win the majority of votes -- if we assume that the "democratic  Russians" win 40 percent and the "red-browns" win another 40  percent, the decision in each specific instance will actually  depend on the remaining 20 percent.    But if this process is thwarted and an "executive authority"  remains in power over the next 15-20 years, the return to the  natural path of development will be secured by someone from that  environment (maybe even faster than through the sequence of  parliamentary elections). Because, as a rule, the realization  of the need for such a return dawns more quickly on would-be  "autocrats" and the victor is the one who manages to effect it  earlier and more successfully.    At the risk of dissociating myself from the panic chorus, I  would dare to assert that Zhirinovskiy will never become  president and the LDPR will never gain more than 30-40 percent  of the votes, just as the Communists will never regain power  peacefully, running under their own name.    At present, there are three possible options:    1. The presidential power will learn the lesson it has been  taught, it will realize what are the population's more or less  true feelings, and it will find it better to evolve in the  direction of more appropriately meeting the country's state  interests, without letting itself be overtaken by the  "patriotic" horse.    2. It will succumb to pressure from the "democratic  Russians" and will ostentatiously back the bankrupt "Russia's  Choice" as the sole "correct" party, bringing itself face to  face with the need to disband parliament again, considerably  reducing in the process its chances of enjoying the Army's  support in the event of fresh actions by national-bolsheviks.    3. It will let the radical democrats in parliament sort  themselves out with the LDPR and the Communists, while it relies  on pragmatic-patriotic elements in the government.    The third option is most likely to succeed, because at  present the government circles contain the largest number of  realistic people whose position was also objectively  consolidated as a result of the elections, and there has been a  significant enhancement of their role as a balancing force.</p>

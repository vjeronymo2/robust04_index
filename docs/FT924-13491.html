			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Koc to float shares in brown-goods subsidiary KOC HOLDING, Turkey's largest manufacturing concern, is to float shares in Bekoteknik, its brown-goods electronics subsidiary, in the latest move to divest the company of family-owned shares. The company said yesterday that 10 per cent of the stock of Bekoteknik's trading operation would be sold to the public on October 19 through Koc American Bank, the parent group's banking arm. The stake, worth around Dollars 3m, represents the latest move by Koc to reduce the family-owned holdings and spread the share ownership in anticipation of a full public listing. The company said the money would be used for new investments. Bekoteknik recently failed in a bid for a privatised east German television producer, which was bought by Samsung of Korea. Exports were worth Dollars 65m in 1991, representing 27 per cent of total sales. Bekoteknik produces brown goods under license from Toshiba and Hitachi of Japan as well as its own brand name, and accounts for around 20 per cent of Turkey's exports.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Stanley falls 46% in second term Morgan Stanley yesterday reported a 46 per cent decline in second-quarter profits to Dollars 121m, becoming the latest Wall Street securities firm to post sharply lower earnings because of deteriorating conditions in US and international financial markets. The firm reported earnings per share on a primary basis of Dollars 1.31, less than half the Dollars 1.77 a share in the same period a year earlier. Revenues were Dollars 2.2bn, down from Dollars 2.49bn in the same quarter of 1993, with the biggest declines in revenues from trading (down 42 per cent to Dollars 300m) and investment banking (down 34 per cent to Dollars 211m). The weak second quarter, coming on the heels of a difficult first period, meant that Morgan Stanley's profits for the first half of 1994 totalled Dollars 238m, well down on the Dollars 423m earned in the first half a year ago. Several factors were behind the drop in revenues and profits, said Mr John Mack, president. 'Rising interest rates in the US and Europe resulted in an overall decline in client activity which negatively impact revenues from debt and equity underwriting and fixed income and foreign exchange trading.' There were some bright spots, however, said Mr Mack. 'Partially offsetting these declines were strong results from trading in equities and commodities and continued growth in the asset management and global custody businesses.' The firm also yesterday announced plans to buy back Dollars 200m worth of its own shares.</p>

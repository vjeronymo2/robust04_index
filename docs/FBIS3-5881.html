The message from the French minister to his interlocutor was  very clear: France says "No" to any unilateral trade measure of  this type. The minister also expressed his concern to obtain  fairer treatment in European-Japanese trade relations. After  the reinstatement of the Super 301, Toyota declared that it was  ready to import U.S. spare parts worth $6 billion, a prospect  which worries the French minister. Yesterday, he expressed this  worry to French car component manufacturers operating in Japan,  and today he is going to raise this issue with Toyota President  Tatsuro Toyoda. "I fully agree that Japanese manufacturers buy  products in the United States, but this should not be done to  the detriment of others," he stressed.    In this respect, Gerard Longuet announced the organization,  this year in Paris, of a seminar involving Japanese purchasers  and French car component manufacturers. He also let it be known  that, in the current dispute between the United States and  Japan, Europe could play a "mediating role." Yesterday in  Brussels, Leon Brittan proposed the creation of a trilateral  body involving Europe, the United States, and Japan which would  establish macroeconomic targets for the Japanese with a view to  pressing them to reform their economy, rather than imposing  targets expressed in exact figures for each sector, as the  Americans do. For the first time, Mickey Kantor found the idea  interesting.</p>

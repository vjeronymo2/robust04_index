			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Books: Saviour of the soul of France THE LAST GREAT FRENCHMAN by Charles Williams Little Brown Pounds 25, 544 pages CHARLES DE Gaulle was one of the most remarkable figures on the European, indeed the world scene, during the 20th century. An obscure soldier with very little active service experience, apart from being taken prisoner on the Western Front in 1916, a brief interlude in the Polish Russian war of 1920 and a disastrous failure at Abbeville in 1940, he somehow became the voice of France in the second world war. In his younger days the protege of Petain he repudiated all that the old Marshal stood for after 1940. Despite Roosevelt and Churchill who disliked him acutely, he established himself as the symbol of French patriotism. President briefly in 1946 he retired for 12 years, returned by acclaim to deal with Algeria though he did it in precisely the opposite way to that expected by his supporters and apparently endorsed by him. He got away with it and established the Fifth Republic, which has lasted longer than any but one of its predecessor regimes since 1789. He blocked British entry into the EEC - he hated Britain  -and he took France out of NATO - he had no love for America. But nations can have too much of single-minded patriotism. In the end just as Britain became weary of Margaret Thatcher, so did France of de Gaulle, who lost the 1969 referendum and then bowed out with dignity. It is an extraordinary story, and Char1es Williams has told it with admirable clarity, scholarship and understanding. This is the most comprehensive life since the three volumes by Jean Lacouture (1984-6) and it is the best book in English to have appeared so far. It will not easily be superseded. It has the advantage of many new sources - papers and memoirs released by the celebration of the centenary in 1990 of de Gaulle's birth. It is very readable and highly perceptive. De Gaulle's family background was not at all typical of fin de siecle France  -minor nobility, monarchism, Jesuit upbringing, narrow puritanical northern Catholicism. His father, who taught at a Jesuit school, believed that every regime since 1789 had been an usurpation. Family life was dominated by discussion of the Dreyfus Case, which shook the Army to the core and the Fashoda Incident, which impressed itself 'on the young Charles's mind as a supreme example at one and the same time of French political impotence and of deep British treachery'. During all his dealings with the British over some 30 years he never forgot Fashoda. From time to time he needed to be reminded not to hate his allies even more than the enemy. The Free French forces which de Gaulle created did not make much difference to the war. It would have been won by the Western Allies at about the same time anyway. As for the French Resistance which de Gaulle strongly supported, its courage was immense but its effect at best marginal. What mattered was that he saved the soul of France and gave the French a sense that they were, despite the fiasco of 1940, a great people. True they showed little gratitude in the aftermath of war. When he pressed, quite rightly, for a constitution which would not repeat the defects of the Third Republic, they plumped for one which, though not identical, was equa11y unstable and he promptly resigned. One of his liabilities was that, although 'a certain idea of France' had for him a semi-mystical quality, he had remarkably little knowledge of the French. In the 50 years before he left for Britain he had had an insulated life in Lille, Paris and military stations at home or abroad. Churchill, too, had only the remotest idea of how most of his fellow countrymen lived, yet both men could sound a clarion call which was unforgettable and both came back after political defeat. De Gaulle returned after a longer interval and in more sensational circumstances. His political achievement was remarkable. No one could 'solve the problem' of Algerie Francois, but it could be removed from the agenda of politics in Paris; that was what de Gaulle did at great risk to himself (The Day of the Jackal is by no means fanciful) and at the cost of lasting hatred by those who felt themselves betrayed. He also established a new and so far reasonably effective republican constitution. It is something to have rehabilitated a nation, rid it of its most disruptive threat and given it for the first time in 170 years a stable and pragmatic system of government. 'The Last Great Frenchman' is a well justified title for this excellent biography.</p>

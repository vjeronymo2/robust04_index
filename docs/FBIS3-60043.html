			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["B.T."-signed report in the "Budapest Supplement" section: </F> "Drug Users Are Caught Every Month"]    [Text] All kinds of drugs including hemp, LSD, and cocaine  are now available in Budapest. The buying and selling usually  takes place in night clubs open to young people. The sides  usually firmly conspire but the business is almost completely  open in some places.    Prices naturally vary from product to product. A marijuana  cigarette can already be bought for 200 forints, approximately  one gram of amphetamine ("speed") costs 5,000 forints, a gram of  LSD is between 600 and 1,000 forints, and heroin addicts can get  their daily dosage for as little as 500 forints. Cocaine is the  most expensive drug, one dose is between 12,000 and 13,000  forints at the moment.    Major Bela Harman, head of the Budapest Police Headquarters  [BRFK] Youth Protection Section, said that, since it is against  the law, there are not any records on drug users in Budapest.  However, it is certain that the drug users are almost all young  people. Officers of his section have been visiting the infamous  entertainment places of the inner districts for two years and,  as we learned from Lieutenant Zoltan Kurucz, a permanent member  of the force, a drug user group is discovered almost every  month. The BRFK's biggest catch this year was 15 kilograms of  marijuana and a 30-piece LSD stamp collection, and one month  ago, a whole Mexican wild hemp plantation was found in  Budakalasz. The lines from the latest drug case in Budapest led  the youth protection officers from a well known notorious club  to the Ujpalota blocks of flats. The procedure has been going  on for a little more than two weeks now. During the  investigation, the police confiscated almost 400 grams of hemp  derivatives.    According to estimates, some 20 tons of drugs crossed the  country in 1993, and some 200 kilograms of this was confiscated  by the Hungarian police. According to a youth protection  officer of one of the foundations, we still cannot talk about a  drug mafia in Hungary. In Sandor Farago's view, it might still  be possible to achieve with adequate means--and a much broader  preventive work--that Hungary is preserved as a relatively calm  island in the center of Europe.</p>

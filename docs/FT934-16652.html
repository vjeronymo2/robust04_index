			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / International Company News: SAS reaffirms Alcazar project THE directors of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) were forced yesterday to reaffirm their support for the Alcazar project to combine forces with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines following media reports in Scandinavia alleging opposition to the alliance at the highest levels in SAS. SAS said the Alcazar negotiating team, led by Mr Jan Carlzon, who resigned as SAS president and chief executive last week, had the full support of the board and new management. 'SAS's position in favour of Alcazar is unchanged. The organisation changes made by SAS last week combine the purpose of completing the Alcazar negotiations in a manner satisfactory to SAS and the purpose of improving SAS's profitability,' SAS said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Cavaco Silva and Antonio Guterres  [Socialist Party leader] were in Parliament, face to face,  exchanging criticisms today. The topic of discussion was the  European Union Treaty. Cavaco Silva called for everyone's  commitment to the building of Europe. He also explained the  government's strategy for the next few years. Guterres spoke  after [the prime minister] to stress that Portugal is not taking  advantage of the opportunities provided by the European  Community. It was a heated debate in Sao Bento [Parliament  seat], Tiago Rebelo reports.    [Begin recording] [Rebelo] After praising Parliament's  commitment to European matters, Cavaco Silva went on to list the  three main strategic objectives for the 90's.    [Cavaco] Firstly, the development of our economic and social  structures with a view to reaching average European levels by  the beginning of next century. Secondly, a greater presence of  Portugal in the world through a strengthening of the heritage of  our past, namely, the Atlantic ties and the special relation  with Portuguese-speaking countries. Thirdly, a guarantee of  security and peace within a framework of cooperation, of which  NATO is an essential pillar, but which will be increasingly  based on an effective European defense and security identity.    [Rebelo] Cavaco Silva's address fully supported the European  Union, from the Economic and Monetary Union to the question of  foreign policy. Antonio Guterres, taking on the role of  opposition leader, did not waste any time in accusing the  government of lacking a strategy for the defense of Portugal's  interests in Europe. The secretary general of the Socialist  Party quoted as an example of this, what he considered to be a  permissive policy with regard to economic competition with  Spain. As for economic policies, Cavaco Silva is a  fundamentalist -- Guterres said in order to blame the head of  government for the economic crisis.    [Guterres] It is necessary to find in Portugal a prime  minister, who despite generous EC support, has led this country  into recession, unemployment, and high interest rates -- he is  here today in this room, it is not necessary to make prophetic  assumptions about the future.    [Rebelo] The CDS [Social Democratic Center Party] demanded  that the government clarify whether we are heading toward  European federalism. The prime minister responded by saying  that the CDS's worry did not make any sense, because that  question did not apply to Europe and it will not do so for many,  many years.

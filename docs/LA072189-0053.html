			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLEASE, NO MORE 'DEVELOPMENT'  </P> <P> As a homeowner in the San Fernando Valley for 38 years, I wish to protest the  building of more apartments and condominiums in this Valley. What we need is  more open space and less crowding.  </P> <P> In 1974, when I become a volunteer for this city, I heard our city fathers  talking about putting a moratorium on growth to preserve open space. What  happened to those plans? The developers somehow convinced the city/county that  "more is better."  </P> <P> Most developers don't care about quality. If they did, they wouldn't build  right up to the sidewalk and on every inch of space so children have no place  to play and so high that the mountain views are gone for everyone else in the  area.  </P> <P> It has to be greed that causes them to build ugly, minimum quality apartments  and condominiums, while living services are deteriorating, such as play areas,  streets, sewers, schools and health services. We are being gobbled up by greed  and the city/county fathers are helping the builders and developers swallow us.  </P> <P> What have been the results of this overbuilding and consequent overcrowding?  Freeways jammed, sometimes 14 hours a day.  </P> <P> No subway, tram or train, elevated or otherwise is going to solve the problem.  Two or more passenger lanes and direct route lanes on the present freeways will  bring a little relief.  </P> <P> That won't solve the emission-polluting problem. Every day the air we and our  children breathe is making us sick, only to send us to the overcrowded  hospitals and doctors' offices.  </P> <P> The trauma centers and clinics are closing and more and more people are forced  to do without needed care. Overcrowding of our schools contributes to student  dropout, which leads to mischief, crime and gang violence. Jails and juvenile  centers cannot handle the overflow.  </P> <P> My prediction is, if nothing is done, the greed of the builders will destroy  the city I have come to love, Los Angeles. Without halting the rapid building  and consequent overcrowding, I predict that this city will become a wasteland  with unhealthly air, land and ocean.  </P> <P> JYNNY RETZINGER  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

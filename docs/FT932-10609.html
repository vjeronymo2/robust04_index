			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo loses 1.4% in first session after holiday break LATE program sales pushed equity prices near intraday lows amid choppy trading and active volume after the Golden Week holiday, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed down 297.15, or 1.4 per cent, at 20,622.03, after trading between 20,611.48 and 20,941.97. The Topix Index of all first section issues ended 9.46 lower at 1,611,33 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.49 to 1,269.01. Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 600m shares, compared to Friday's 699m. The market was closed between Monday and Wednesday. Advancers ahead of decliners at 594 to 480, with 111 issues unchanged. Brokers said that market sentiment remains bullish in spite of the day's declines, regarded largely as a natural correction to the 6.7 per cent gains of last week. One analyst at a UK brokerage said that some domestic institutional investors await further stability in the yen's movement against the dollar before committing new capital into the stock market. Market participants added that the session's turnover was slightly exaggerated because brokers executed some cross trades. Profit-taking pushed Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Y23,000 lower to Y961,000. Large capitalisation issues in the iron and steel sector lost ground. Nippon Steel dropped Y12 to Y402, Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y374 and Sumitomo Metal Industries Y10 to Y350. Investors took profits on heavy electric issues. Hitachi retreated Y24 to Y913, Toshiba Y22 to Y752 and Mitsubishi Electric Y9 to Y620. But foreign market participants pushed up the shipbuilding sector. Mitsubishi Heavy Industies rose Y8 to Y717, Mitsui Engineering and Shipbuilding Y3 to Y460 and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Y12 to Y523. In Osaka, the OSE average ended 36.21 higher at 22,664.29, in volume of 32.9m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed. Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore were closed. AUSTRALIA surged as investors bought banking issues and gold stocks continued strong, on expectations of a higher bullion price. The All Ordinaries closed 17.2 ahead at 1,691.9. in turnover of ADollars 391.9m. Westpac rose 12 cents to ADollars 3.62 in volume of 8.43m shares with US pension funds said to be active buyers on the view that the banking sector is undervalued. TAIWAN stocks ended higher and turnover rose on hopes that the central bank would ease monetary policy, though late profit-taking reduced gains. The weighted index, which was up more than 80 points at one stage, finished 43.16 higher at 4,492.48. SEOUL fell 1.2 per cent on a wave of selling that flooded the market after the composite index breached the 720 level. The index closed with a loss of 9.03 at 710.80, although turnover was a relatively thin Won397.27m. BANGKOK returned to work after Wednesday's holiday and shares rebounded as institutions bought bank, finance and construction-material stocks. The SET index rose 17.03 or 2.1 per cent to 845.13 in thin turnover of Bt3.24bn. Prices had been falling sharply since last week amid allegations of share price manipulation. But at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, a deputy minister who had sparked the latest rush of allegations, agreed to stop talking about the issue. HONG KONG lost ground as local investors shifted funds from blue chips to second and third tier issues. The Hang Seng index declined 33.81 to 6,795.52 as foreign fund managers refrained from building new positions on blue chip issues. Turnover remained almost flat at HKDollars 4.6bn against HKDollars 4.5bn. Traders said that some institutions were switching to other Asian equity markets ahead of the Sino-British talks on May 21. MANILA eased on profit-taking after hitting a record high on Wednesday. The composite index fell 10.89 to 1,643.50, sliding from the day's high in the morning. Turnover fell to 489.5m pesos. NEW ZEALAND closed almost flat on low turnover, as cautiousness set in. The NZSE-40 index edged up 1.54 to 1,579.09.</p>

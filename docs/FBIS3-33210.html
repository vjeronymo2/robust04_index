			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] The first political alliance was presented today  before the Electoral Tribunal Secretariat. It is called the  United People [Pueblo Unido], and it comprises the PRD  [Democratic Revolutionary Party], the Labor Party, and the  Liberal Republican Party.    According to Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential  candidate  for the alliance, the purpose of this electoral merger is to  present a program to resolve the country's most pressing  problems. Perez Balladares also stressed that the possible  reentry of the former military into politics would pose danger  to the country.    [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I respect the right  that  members of the military or former members of the military have  to participate in politics and party politics. Nevertheless, I  must call attention to the fact that it is dangerous if they  unite as a power bloc or somehow again become a determinant  force. Even though this may only be the start of what could be  the return of such a force, I must draw attention to it, because  the desperation to attain power could lead someone to resort to  something we all wish to forget and leave in the past.    [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, is the  purge, so to speak, which evidently has been taking place within  the PRD, designed to ensure that civilian forces lead the party?    [Perez Balladares] I believe we have instituted an internal  democracy, which is very evident to the great majority of the  Panamanian people. This internal democracy has caused  individuals or people who disagree the party's main ideals to be  cast aside by the very dynamics of democracy. I do not think we  have had... [pauses] I do not like the term purge, but we have  had a continual influx of internal democracy. This is also  proof positive that we have pledged to maintain this internal  democracy and to make it effective nationwide the day we come to  power. [end recording]</p>

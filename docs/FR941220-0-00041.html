Those individuals required under Federal law or regulation to have periodic medical examinations were also required to undergo a drug test at the same time. The drug testing required by the rule applies to some persons located outside of the United States. However, the rules provided that they would not apply outside the United States in any situation in which application of the rules violated foreign local laws or policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time, the Coast Guard stated that the DOT and other elements of the government would enter into discussions with foreign governments to attempt to resolve any conflict between our rules and foreign government laws or policies. The Coast Guard stated that if, as a result of those discussions, it was found that amendments to the rule were necessary, timely amendments would be issued. An amendment was issued on December 21, 1989, and published on December 27, 1989 (54 FR 53286). Under that amendment, drug testing for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government was scheduled to begin by January 2, 1992. A Final Rule was published on April 24, 1991, delaying the implementation date to January 2, 1993 (56 FR 18982), and another Final Rule was published on July 14, 1992, delaying the implementation date to January 2, 1995 (57 FR 31274). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the past few years, discussions with other countries have been held, and the difficulty of achieving effective bilateral agreements has become clear. Although the Coast Guard could allow its regulations to take effect in foreign waters, the Coast Guard continues to recognize that: (1) It would be difficult for U.S. carriers to effectively implement the regulations without cooperation from foreign governments; (2) in response, foreign governments could impose restrictions on U.S. operations; and, perhaps most importantly, (3) there are distinct advantages to be gained in aligning foreign measures and U.S. measures, especially as they relate to international transportation operations. For these reasons, the Coast Guard is continuing to consider whether it would be appropriate to apply the requirements of part 16 to operations in waters subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government in the event that agreements with other countries are not reached. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to allow time to further consider these issues and formulate a decision, the Coast Guard has again determined that additional time is necessary. Another additional delay of approximately one year should provide sufficient time. Accordingly, the Coast Guard has determined to postpone again the date by which testing programs would commence for persons onboard U.S. vessels in waters that are subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

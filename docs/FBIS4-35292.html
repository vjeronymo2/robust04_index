			<p>BFN     [Text] Minister of Development and Planning 'Abd-al-Karim  al-Iryani has threatened that Sanaa will close the door to  dialogue with moderate and unionist leaders of the Yemeni  Socialist Party if the UN Security Council [UNSC] intervenes in  the Yemeni crisis.    He said Sanaa is awaiting a political message from Aden but  did not disclose its contents.    Al-Iryani said one the reasons that military communiques  have  not been released since Tuesday is because the situation on the  front is calm.</p>

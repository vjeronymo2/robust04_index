			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: Policymakers take a long hard look at Emu THE European Community's economic and finance ministers have just spent the weekend in Oporto, Portugal, discussing growth, budgets and employment in the EC. But although they heard a progress report on moves towards economic and monetary union, there was no critical evaluation of the EC's blueprint for Emu and the implications that it might have for the economic well-being of the community. This is a pity, because, five months on from last December's Maastricht summit, the EC's Emu treaty is coming under increasingly sceptical scrutiny among policy makers and analysts. Interest in the possible negative consequences of Maastricht is also growing on the other side of the Atlantic. Indeed, the US administration may yet use perceived defects in the treaty to reinforce its criticism of Europe's slow growth at the Group of Seven world economic summit in Munich in early July. Last week, Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank governor and current chairman of the EC central bank governors' committee, lifted the lid on some worries about Emu preoccupying EC policy makers. The Emu provisions of the Maastricht treaty were, he said, 'weaker than appropriate'. Giving the City University Business School's prestigous Mais lecture, Mr Hoffmeyer specifically criticised the skewed relationship between monetary policy making, which under Emu will be handled by an independent European central bank, and fiscal policy, which will remain the responsibility of 12 national decision making units. Similar worries have been expressed by Professor Peter Kenen of Princeton University in a paper* just published by the Group of Thirty, the Washington-based think-tank of eminent persons from finance, business, policy making and academia around the world. The Maastricht blueprint, says Professor Kenen, is 'imperfect and incomplete'. The fiscal provisions are too narrow, and pay insufficient attention to the need for the Community to fashion a suitable fiscal stance for Europe as a whole. In addition, he argues that the mandate of the planned European central bank is too restricted and that it should be involved in prudential supervision to safeguard the stability of the EC's financial system. He observed the Emu negotiations at first hand while holding a six-month Bank of England fellowship. His criticisms therefore have some claim to be taken seriously. He is also concerned that: Greece, Italy and Portugal could face real problems meeting the economic convergence requirements for Emu. Emu could make it harder for the G7 countries to agree policies affecting exchange rates, so leading to volatility in exchange rates between Europe, the US and Japan. The preconditions for joining Emu that relate to exchange rates and long-term interest rates are of little practical use, and There could be problems before the new Europe central bank establishes its counter inflationary credibility. This latter point worries the US Treasury. Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, has spoken of a 'possible bias' in the Emu treaty that 'might mean a highly conservative stance on growth policies over a period of time'. Translated, this means that the US Treasury fears that the monetary institutions set up in the third and final stage of Emu will have to be 'more German than the Germans' and push up interest rates more than would be the case under current rules to establish credibility with the financial markets. The unequal responsibilities put on monetary and fiscal policy under Emu raise two dangers. On the one hand, Emu, once established, might need to be propped up by unnecessarily high interest rates and so have a deflationary bias. Alternatively, Emu, shackled with such inefficiencies, would be less capable of delivering price stability than the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS. Both are worrying possibilities, which will have to be addressed by EC finance ministers before too long. Inflation fears Virtually all market pundits are expecting Britain's annual inflation rate will move upwards from March's 4 per cent rate when the retail prices index for April is published on Friday. But some are now warning that the rise will be more than a blip and that Mr John Major's boast of last year that inflation in Britain was 'licked' will turn out to have been premature. One inflation bear is Mr Peter Warburton, chief economist of Robert Fleming, a monetarist whose views are treated with respect by senior Treasury officials. Mr Warburton believes that the annual rate of RPI inflation could be 4.8 per cent on Friday (against the consensus view of 4.4 per cent) and that inflation will then move erratically upwards to 5.6 per cent by the end of the year and 6.2 per cent in March 1993. Mr Warburton argues that the non-traded goods and services sectors will experience a new inflationary upsurge once monetary policy is eased. He believes fiscal indiscipline has stacked up inflationary pressures in the public sector. Capacity destruction during the recession will have limited the scope for non-inflationary growth. Concentration of market share among a few large retailers and lack of competition among utilities also bode ill for falling inflation. He also believes commodity prices will be less likely to stay low, especially in the food sector. Admittedly, this is just one man's view and much will depend on the pace of UK recovery. But Mr Warburton's warnings merit some attention, if only because last week's cut in base rates to 10 per cent anticipated an uneven decline in UK inflation to the end of the year. *Emu after Maastricht by Peter Kenen, Dollars 20 plus Dollars 3.00 p&amp;p (Dollars 4.50 outside the US), from The Group of Thirty, 1990 M Street NW, Suite 450, Washington DC 10036, USA.</p>

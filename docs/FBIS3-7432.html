Suwit Wangli, the chairman of the Thai Chamber of Commerce,  said after discussions with Cambodian Economic and Finance  Minister Sam Rangsi the Cambodian Government had confirmed the  agreements would be honoured. But there may be some alterations  to bring them in line with the Government's policies, he said.    Thai businessmen have invested heavily in logging and  gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border, much of which  is under Khmer Rouge control. Such trade has caused chronic  problems involving allegedly excessive profits and has been  attacked by foreign newspapers over the years, said Mr Suwit.    "Thai investment in the central region of Cambodia does not  generate similar problems and the ruling Government agrees to  support those investors. At present, several drafts, including  civil and criminal laws, investment laws and mortgaging and  pledging laws are being globalised," said Mr Suwit.    "Besides, Thai investors have been requested to invest in  labour-intensive industries, such as textiles and precious  stones, to help relieve unemployment in Cambodia. The  regulations and legislation ruling financial institutions under  the central bank are also being strengthened," he said.    "Each day, at least two foreign institutions apply to open  in  Cambodia but the Government has not approved any since last  year. It has decided to do so once the country's central bank is  stabilised and well-monitored."    Prida Tiasuwan, the deputy chairman of the Jewelry and  Ornament Association of Thailand, said the Cambodian Government  charged only 1 percent and 20 percent for sales tax and  corporate income tax respectively, while Thai law required sales  (value added) tax of 7 percent and corporate income tax of 30  percent. As a result, more and more Thai investors were  attracted to Cambodia. But some obstacles are yet to be  overcome for smooth mutual trade in the future.    Gemstone mining along the Thai-Cambodian border has not been  legalised. Any trader can mine and take out stones at will as  there is no legislation preventing them doing so which caused  several problems in the mining areas.    Mr Rangsi agreed to take this matter into consideratlon.</p>

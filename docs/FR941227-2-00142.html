Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PHILADEP and SCCP are amending Article IV, Section 2 of their respective By-Laws to remove the requirement that the two vice chairmen of the board of governors of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'') serve as ex-officio members of their boards of directors. The amendments install the chief operating officer of the PHLX both as an ex-officio member of both of the boards of directors and also as the vice chairman of the boards. The amendments reduce the requisite number of PHLX governors who must serve on the PHILADEP and SCCP boards of directors from a majority of the fifteen to seventeen directors to six of the directors. The amendments also change the term of office for the boards of directors to synchronize the term of office for the chairman of the PHLX's board of governors with his terms of office on the PHILADEP and SCCP boards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHILADEP and SCCP also are amending Article III, Section 4(a) of their By-Laws which currently require that each nominating committee consist of five ex-officio members of the board of directors and two other persons appointed by the chairman of the board. Under the amended rules, each nominating committee will consist of four ex-officio members of the board of directors and three other persons appointed by the chairman of the boards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PHILADEP and SCCP Boards of Directors will continue to provide the PHLX, as the sole shareholder of both PHILADEP and SCCP, with adequate representation. The PHLX will be represented by both senior exchange staff personnel and by members of the PHLX board of governors, who typically also represent PHILADEP and SCCP participant firms. In accordance with PHILADEP's and SCCP's amendment processes delineated in By-Law Article XI, the Chairman of the PHLX board of governors, as agent for the sole shareholder and parent corporation, has signed a unanimous consent in lieu of a special meeting to effectuate the foregoing changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Section 17A of the Act and specifically with Section 17A(b)(3)(C). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Section 17A(b)(3)(C) requires that a clearing agency assure fair representation of its shareholders or members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. As stated above, the proposed rule changes provide the PHLX with continued fair and adequate representation in its capacity as the sole shareholder of both PHILADEP and SCCP. The proposed rule changes also afford fair representation to the participants by continuing to require their representation on the boards of directors and nominating committees of both PHILADEP and SCCP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q(b)(3)(C)(1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> It is therefore ordered,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos.

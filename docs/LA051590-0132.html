			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS PARK AT TOP OF THE WORLD  </P> <P> In spite of last-minute appeals from residents, City Council gave final  approval Monday to plans for a 8.5-acre hilltop park with a regulation-size  baseball field and six tennis courts.  </P> <P> Opponents of the park, planned for the north end of Alta Laguna Boulevard in  the Top of the World neighborhood, say they now will take their case to the  state Coastal Commission, which will consider the park in July.  </P> <P> The proposed Alta Laguna park has from the beginning been a source of  controversy. While athletic boosters maintain that the recreation facilities  are needed, some residents have said the park is too big for their  neighborhood.  </P> <P> On Monday, Robert May, a Top of the World resident, filed an appeal of the  design review board's approval of the park. Another appeal had been filed by  the city staff, who anticipated a last-minute appeal by park opponents and were  eager to obtain a hearing before the Coastal Commission as soon as  possible.LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

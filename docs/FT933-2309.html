			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Hopes rising that deal can be saved EC FOREIGN, agriculture and trade ministers will today try to refine French demands for a renegotiation of last year's Blair House deal on farm trade into a package Brussels can feasibly negotiate with Washington, but without re-opening the original accord. France's threat to veto Blair House means that the European Commission and current Belgian presidency of the EC have three priorities for this extraordinary, potentially stormy, and almost certainly lengthy meeting, due to be attended by 35 ministers. They must at all costs avoid a vote, prevent any time-wasting manoeuvres which would wreck chances of meeting the December 15 deadline for concluding the overall Uruguay Round world trade reform process, and insist that the Commission retains its mandate to negotiate with the EC's trading partners without further constraint. Hopes are rising that several of the French demands, supported by Spain and Ireland, can be accommodated without reopening Blair House. 'I don't think there's that much room for manoeuvre, but there is some,' Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, told the FT last Thursday. France's main objective appears to be to safeguard its food - and particularly cereals - exports, from Blair House's 21 per cent cut over six years in the volume of subsidised exports. In addition, Paris will eventually need to present to French farmers hostile to the accord what looks like an extensive list of concessions. The reformed Common Agricultural Policy aims - through big price and production cuts - to get EC cereals prices down to world level by a 1997 target. If it succeeds, food could be exported without subsidy, and therefore without reference to the Blair House restraints. Most of France's demands are aimed at ensuring this target is met. Politically, however, a strategy to boost competitiveness through price and production cuts is not something Paris can easily sell to its farmers. French negotiators will again, therefore, insist that nothing can be agreed within the world trade negotiations which goes beyond the CAP reform. The Commission for its part will underline that Blair House protects the CAP from challenge by its trading partners. The full compensation to EC farmers for the CAP price cuts are not treated by the deal as subsidies, and it also contains a 'peace clause' through which signatories would refrain from attacking each other's farm regimes. France's robust stand will ensure every effort is made, particularly by its traditional ally Germany, to try to find a solution. But Germany's own demands, for further protection for its farmers against a rising D-Mark, risks additional complications. Until the August 2 decision to float EC currencies within 15 per cent fluctuation bands of the exchange rate mechanism, every realignment since 1984 had pushed up farm prices to follow the movement of the strongest currency. This was designed to protect German farmers, since the chief revaluing currency was invariably the D-Mark. The German currency thereby achieved a 'weighting' in the 'green' European currency unit which gives the farm Ecu a value now 21 per cent greater than the market Ecu. With realignments now off the agenda, because of the huge fluctuation bands set on August 2, Bonn wants the mechanism restored to pacify its farmers. This would require potentially large new EC budget outlays, when the farm budget is aleady up against its mandatory ceiling. It would also tie French farm competitiveness to a rising D-Mark, nullifying part of the CAP reform price cuts, which freed French agriculture from prices set for German productivity some 20 per cent lower than its own. Speculation that Paris and Bonn will press jointly for each other's demands therefore looks shaky, and the UK is leading other northern countries flatly opposed to breaking the farm budget to satisfy the Germans and sweeten any eventual Blair House deal for France.</p>

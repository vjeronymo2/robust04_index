			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: No Man's Land - Theatre Harold Pinter returns to the British stage after 24 years, showing he can act as well as write. He takes the lead alongside Paul Eddington in his fine, perplexing No Man's Land (1975) at the Almeida Theatre and his acting teaches how to watch Pinter, cast off bafflement and put on enlightenment amid silences and the sense of important happenings: take each scene separately and trust your instincts. No Man's Land follows Betrayal, Mountain Language, and Party Time into the Almeida since 1990. There is drama which builds models of the world, telling you what to think; and then there is drama like this, which leaves everything to you. Pinter excels in the latter. Hirst and Spooner meet in a Hampstead pub, and return to Hirst's house. Hirst drinks, his attention strays; he takes Spooner for a stranger, then an old friend. Foster and Briggs make up Hirst's household, occasionally running it or run by it. The play unfolds in exchanges between these four. A scene shifts with a gesture or silence; by turns one character appears in charge, then cedes to another. Given that No Man's Land is about not knowing what is going on, and the sense of dislocation that comes from that, the best hedge against confusion is to trust your reactions. Parts of No Man's Land are extremely funny, the matter without the form of farce: mistaken identity, confusion, repetition. Pinter, like Oscar Wilde, uses the tension between the logical and the emotional import of the words. At the end of No Man's Land, Hirst says: 'Let us change the subject. For the last time. What have I said?' Foster replies: 'You said you're changing the subject for the last time.' - 'But what does that mean?' - 'It means you'll never change the subject again.' Pinter merely invites us to recreate the world in which this exchange is accurate: straight from AJ Ayer to Zen. Bob Crowley's black interior helps David Leveaux' direction keep the action gloomy; the actors move deliberately between the set's totems - drinks trolley, door, light, chair. The sense of significance hangs everywhere, sporadically crossed by moments of despair. The evening is made by the acting. Eddington plays Spooner superbly. He delivers faded truths with a tilt of the head, tweedy awkwardness with a tug at the sleeve, Champagne confidence with a hand in the pocket. Opposite him, Pinter's fine Hirst, also stuck in no man's land, is plain and desperate, taking each sentence as it comes. Hirst says: 'You find me in the last lap of a race . . . I had long forgotten to run.' Spooner quips: 'A metaphor. Things are looking up.' Almeida Theatre (071 359 4404) until December 19</p>

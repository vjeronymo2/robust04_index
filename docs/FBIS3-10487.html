			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Ernesto Samper and Andres Pastrana are tied in their  bid for the Presidency of the Republic. According to the latest  poll by the National Consulting Center, the two candidates, who  lead the surveys, are still neck and neck for the first and  second round of elections.    Samper and Pastrana are advancing neck and neck in their  quest for the Presidency. For the first time in history, no  bets can be made for either candidate in the electoral process.  The polls have revealed such a small difference that it can be  said technically they are tied.    Figures speak for themselves. For the first electoral round  Samper obtained 38 percent of the support over 37 percent for  Pastrana; forty-five percent of those polled in the second round  have said they would vote for Andres Pastrana and 44 percent for  Ernesto Samper.    Regardless of from where it comes, the opinion sector or the  campaign team, the fact of the matter is in May each vote will  be decisive. There are eight weeks before the election,  however, and the result of the consultation within the Liberal  Party and the reallocation of forces after the legislative  elections can change things substantially.</p>

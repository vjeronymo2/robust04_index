			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz February 2 TASS -- The South Ossetian  parliament adopted today an appeal to the Russian president,  asking him to "work out security guarantees of the Republic of  South Ossetia, of its free and democratic development before  signing the Russian-Georgian treaty."    Members of parliament adopted as well an appeal to the  Federation Council and the State Duma of the Russian Federation,  asking them to "refrain from the ratification of a full-scale  treaty between Russia and Georgia until a complete settlement of  Ossetian-Georgian relations and not to regard the republic of  South Ossetia as part of the Republic of Georgia."    In its turn, the Information and Press Committee of South  Ossetia circulated today a statement of the republican  parliament, which pointed out that the signing of the  Russian-Georgian treaty "while the problem of the status of  South Ossetia has not yet been resolved, is direct violation of  the previous four-party agreements. This infringement on the  rights of the Ossetian people will inevitably lead to the  escalation of violence in the Republic of South Ossetia and  around it."</p>

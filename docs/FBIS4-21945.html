			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Diethart Goos: "Four RAF Members Escaped Police"] </F>   [Excerpts] Schwerin -- During the police operation of Bad  Kleinen in June 1993 against leading Red Army Faction [RAF]  members Wolfgang Grams and Birgit Hogefeld, the security  authorities obviously uncovered another four suspected  terrorists. However, they were not arrested for "tactical"  reasons in connection with the investigations. This was  confirmed yesterday by Herbert Helmrich, justice minister of  Mecklenburg Western Pomerania, in an interview with DIE WELT.  [see item AU0104091894 in previous Terrorism Report] [passage  omitted]    Justice Minister Helmrich told DIE WELT that an observation  group of the Wiesbaden-based Federal Office of Criminal  Investigations [BKA] was in Bad Kleinen in early June, about 2  weeks before the police operation. The BKA had information  according to which several top terrorists of the RAF's command  level were planning to vacation in Mecklenburg. With  remote-controlled cameras -- one was installed in a trash can,  another one in a Volkswagen van -- a suspicious couple was  filmed. The cameras provided surprisingly clear pictures. The  suspected terrorists were not rounded up because the BKA wanted  to get more information.    On 27 June 1993, some 90 minutes before the shoot-out at the  station, apart from Grams and Hogefeld, another couple was being  observed as behaving conspicuously. According to information  from Schwerin, this couple has been identified. They were not  rounded up either for tactical reasons. The two young people  managed to disappear. [passage omitted]</p>

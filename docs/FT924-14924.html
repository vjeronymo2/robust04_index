			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Better values to chew over Sir, Observer's patronising missive about Singapore ('Home truths', October 1) simply ignores the values offered by the country which for most families have a higher priority than Cosmopolitan, chewing gum and the dubious merits of western television. Families who move to Singapore enter a life with a significantly enhanced disposable income, greater responsibility for their affairs and their actions, excellent and improving health and education facilities, clean, safe streets and mainly polite, happy inhabitants. Singapore is a miracle of the age and Lee Kuan Yew the mastermind of that miracle. What he has produced is a far greater testament to family values than citizen's charters and the American dream] Instead of carping criticism, we could do much worse than adopt some of the policies which have enabled Singapore to succeed. My family has two Singapore-born members and we have very happy memories of our four years there. John Pitts, 3 Fellows Yard, Plumtree, Nottingham NG12 5NS</p>

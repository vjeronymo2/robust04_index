			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Two former government officials announced that they will seek to qualify an  initiative for the 1990 ballot that would limit to eight years the time anyone  could serve in the Legislature. Jerry Partain, a former director of the state  Department of Forestry, and John E. McDonald, a former assistant legislative  counsel, said they are sponsoring the measure to remove career politicians from  office and encourage the election of "citizen legislators." If successful, the  measure sponsored by the two Republicans could substantially reduce the  influence of the Democratic Party in the Legislature, because the Assembly and  Senate are now controlled by Democrats.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRADCO SYSTEMS INC. REPORTS $28.6-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS  </P> <P> Gradco Systems Inc., battered by the loss of its largest customer, reported a  $28.6-million loss for the fourth quarter ended March 31. It also said a group  of Japanese investors had agreed to buy a 27% stake in its pivotal Japanese  subsidiary.  </P> <P> The Irvine-based manufacturer of sorters for copying machines and printers also  disclosed that it had filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Xerox Corp.,  which with its two foreign affiliates had accounted for more than a third of  Gradco's business. Xerox now manufactures its own sorters.  </P> <P> Gradco's poor fourth-quarter performance resulted in a $28.1-million loss on  revenue of $89.5 million for the fiscal year, contrasted with $5.6 million in  net earnings on revenue of $115.1 million in the previous year. The loss was  due largely to a one-time, $23-million fourth-quarter charge from a major  restructuring.  </P> <P> The reorganization, which followed a failed effort by Gradco Chairman Keith  Stewart to take the company private in a leveraged buyout, resulted in the  shutdown of a Santa Ana manufacturing facility and the transfer of all  responsibility for copier products -- which account for 70% of the company's  business -- to Gradco Japan. Gradco said the $26.5-million investment in Gradco  Japan would come from a group of Japanese institutional investors led by Japan  Associated Finance Co. (JAFCO).  </P> <P> Stewart called the deal "another step in the process of taking Gradco Japan  public on the Japanese over-the-counter market."  </P></p>

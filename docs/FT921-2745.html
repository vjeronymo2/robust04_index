			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hillsdown mushrooms in the Netherlands HILLSDOWN HOLDINGS, the food processing group, is buying Holco, a Dutch mushroom and asparagus canning and bottling business, in a move which will make it one of the largest mushroom processors in Europe. The seller is Albert Fisher, the fresh produce distributor. Hillsdown is paying Fl 37.5m (Pounds 11.7m) cash - a price thought to be at about asset value. Hillsdown has emphasised its strategy of making small acquisitions which fit easily with its main business, and Holco will be combined with its Jeco Conserven Horst mushroom and asparagus business. Mr John Jackson, deputy chairman of Hillsdown, said Holco had a modern facility which was working at about 70 per cent capacity. Jeco's management would run the combined operation and its retail packing side would be moved to Holco while Jeco's plant concentrated on catering packs. Mr Jackson said the European mushroom market had been hit in 1991 by an influx of cheap mushrooms from Poland, but now that some producers had left the market profitability was improving. Hillsdown shares rose 2p to 176p, and Albert Fisher's shares were unchanged at 67p.</p>

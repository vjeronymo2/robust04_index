			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Strong demand for KPN flotation The partial flotation next week of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the Dutch telecommunications and postal company, is nearly three times oversubscribed, with strong demand from foreign and domestic investors, lead manager ABN Amro said yesterday. With 138.15m shares on offer, investors had put in applications for about 390m shares by the time subscriptions closed early yesterday afternoon. Allocation of shares will be determined over the weekend, with an announcement expected on Monday, clearing the way for the first trading in KPN shares on the Amsterdam stock exchange later that day. The government, which offered small private investors a discount to encourage broad participation in the issue, had said earlier that private shareholders would receive unspecified preferential treatment in allocations. Details must still be worked out by the banking syndicate, the Dutch state and their advisers. The flotation, which will raise a minimum of Fl 6.9bn (Dollars 3.7bn) for the Dutch state and which values KPN at Fl 22.9bn, is the country's biggest share launch. The state is selling a 30 per cent stake in this first tranche, with a second tranche scheduled to take place before the end of 1997. The shares were priced at Fl 49.75 each on Monday. Private investors will receive a discount of Fl 2.50 per share, up to a maximum of 75 shares. The strong demand makes it likely that the banking syndicate will exercise its option to buy an additional 20.7m shares over the next 30 days to meet heavy demand. This would raise a further Fl 1bn for the Dutch state. ABN Amro declined to give a breakdown of demand, saying the precise number of applications would not be known until today. However, the government's aim has been to sell half of the shares at home and half overseas. It wanted to encourage wide participation among private investors. Experienced private investors began filing applications as soon as subscriptions opened on Monday, but first-time share investors had tended to wait until Wednesday to take part, the bank said.</p>

			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Spain calls for solution on Gibraltar DISAGREEMENT over Gibraltar was now the only important obstacle to better relations between Britain and Spain, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said in London yesterday. He said Madrid was waiting for London to make a move to solve this 'historical anachronism'. The Spanish leader stressed after talks on Tuesday with Mr John Major, the prime minister, that London and Madrid were in broad agreement on the future economic and monetary development of the European Community. Both governments considered it would be a mistake to rush into full monetary union before achieving greater convergence between the economies of members. There were continuing differences over the organisation of European defence. Although Spain agreed with Britain that Nato should not be undermined by any new European defence arrangements, Mr Gonzalez said he could not imagine a common European foreign policy that was not complemented by a common defence policy. Although Mr Gonzalez declined to give any details of his discussions with Mr Major on Gibraltar, he made clear, both in an interview with the Financial Times and at a press conference, that Spain was not prepared to wait indefinitely for a solution to the problem. Spain has a long-standing demand for sovereignty of the Rock. The Spanish prime minister indicated that he was looking for step-by-step progress, starting with the joint use of Gibraltar airport. Mr Gonzalez issued a thinly-veiled warning that Spain might take retaliatory measures if Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's prime minister, went ahead with plans to establish a modern off-shore financial centre on the Rock and to reclaim land on its east coast. He hinted that Spain could neutralise the tax advantages Gibraltar offers on investments in Spain channelled through the Rock.

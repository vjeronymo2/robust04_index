			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Isam 'Abd-al-Jawad in Asyut] </F>   [Text] Some 400 people in Asyut have received weapons and  ammunition as part of the militia that security services in the  governorate had organized to confront terrorism.    But only one month after the unprecedented move, differences  erupted among the services that were behind the idea. Some say  a number of citizens took the weapons to defend themselves  against a backdrop of tribal revenge actions, and others stress  that some of those who received the weapons sold them to  terrorists, bullies, fugitives from justice, and highway robbers.    ROSE AL-YUSUF has also learned that those volunteers have  not  received antiterrorist training. The security agencies gave  them weapons and ammunition without telling them what places to  guard. The volunteers were only asked to attack extremists  wherever they see them--something that did not happen, even in  Upper Egypt, which is known for acts of revenge.    Those militias were not assigned to guard government  facilities or take part in antiterror operations. Indeed, the  security services denied that the militias existed, and that  only added to the militiamen's confusion.    Some People's Assembly and Consultative Council members, and  members of local councils in Asyut protested to Asyut Governor  Major General Samih al-Sa'id and Security Director Major General  Majdi al-Basyuni over the formation of the armed militias, some  of whose members have abused the use of their weapons.    An official security source told ROSE AL-YUSUF that the  security services are now working out a high-level plan to  change the dynamics of antiterror operations in Asyut. Most of  the equipment and individuals used in these operations have been  withdrawn and replaced by forces highly trained in antiterror  techniques. A number of police cars have also been replaced  with modern vehicles that can easily move in agricultural areas  and on mountains where terrorists hide.    The source said the plan seeks coordination between Asyut  and  a number of neighboring governorates to cut off the supply lines  for the terrorist groups in Asyut.    On the role of the militias in Asyut, the source denied they  play any role. The source even denied they exist, although ROSE  AL-YUSUF stressed it had seen them and named some people who had  actually received weapons.    The recent killing of Brigadier General Taha Tu'aymah in  Dayrut and the subsequent arrest of terrorist Ahmad Diya' from  Suhaj Governorate revealed a new development in the tactics of  the terrorist groups in Upper Egypt. Diya's participation in  that operation showed that elements from neighboring  governorates, especially Suhaj and al-Wadi al-Jadid, are  involved in Asyut attacks. Those governorates are used as  supply sources for terrorist groups in Asyut, and Asyut  terrorists flee and hide there. Ordinary citizens in Asyut are  increasingly talking about this, especially since Asyut has the  biggest regional university and thousands of students from  various governorates, especially in Upper Egypt, go to study  there.    The attack against Brig. Gen. Tu'aymah was the first of its  kind in which terrorists from different governorates took part.    In another development, an Interior Ministry team spent five  days in Asyut drafting an integrated plan for coordination with  neighboring governorates to raid terrorists' hideouts in Asyut,  al-Minya, Suhaj, and al-Wadi al-Jadid, and to guard the eastern  side of Asyut to prevent infiltration of terrorists via the Red  Sea.    In the al-Rahmah mosque in Asyut the Friday before last, the  Islamic Group members said prayers without making any  announcements or statements as they usually do. The mosque  preacher asked members of the group to leave the mosque after  prayers in small groups to avoid clashes with the heavy security  force around the mosque. Not many people attended the prayers.    Shops owned by members of the terrorist groups continue  their  trade activity in Asyut without security interference, although  a number of the shops were built along pedestrian streets  without a license. The Asyut municipality avoids arguments with  the owners and collects taxes in a friendly way, although some  of them refuse to pay taxes because they believe it is against  shari'ah.    Meanwhile, a curfew atmosphere still dominates the cities of  al-Qusiyah and Dayrut although the security services lifted the  curfew and told citizens they could go out.</p>

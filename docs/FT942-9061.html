			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Italy's privatisation plan set to go ahead: Government has ruled out delay in flotation of insurance organisation Italy's new government has given its strongest signal yet that it will honour the country's wide-ranging privatisation programme by pressing ahead with the flotation timetable of Ina, the insurance institute. Shares are due to be placed on the market at the end of June. This emerged from a meeting yesterday between Mr Lamberto Dini, Treasury minister and former director-general of the Bank of Italy, and Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, budget minister. Complex problems surrounding the privatisation of Ina have led to speculation about delays. Though aware of the difficulties in meeting the June 26 date set for Ina by the previous government, the Treasury-led privatisation team is anxious to demonstrate the new government's commitment to privatisation. They are playing down statements by the populist Northern League, a key partner in Mr Silvio Berlusconi's government, that there should be a month's delay in all privatisation plans to assess strategy. Two of the three ministries responsible for privatisation - budget and industry - are controlled by League ministers. But both have distanced themselves from the party's call. Both, however, are anxious to avoid repeating the concentration of control achieved directly and indirectly by Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, in the sale of Banca Commerciale Italiana and Credito Italiano. The neo-fascist MDI/National Alliance, Mr Berlusconi's other main government partner, has so far refrained from imposing its long-standing 'corporatist' ideas of state ownership. The privatisation process in fact seeks to dismantle many of the institutions, including Ina, which were set up during the fascist era. Mr Berlusconi, in outlining his government's policy programme to the senate on Monday, promised to accelerate privatisation in the first 100 days of his government. He singled out Ina, Stet (telecoms), Enel (electricity) and Eni (oil and gas). All were on the former government's privatisation list, with Enel and Stet scheduled for the autumn after the latter has reorganised the state's telecommunications assets under one holding, Telecom Italia. The opposition has latched on to the omissions in his programme. He mentioned nothing, for instance, about Alitalia, the national airline, which has just begun to discuss a radical restructuring programme with the unions involving cutting a quarter of the workforce and a L1,500bn (Pounds 626m) capital injection. Alitalia will test the government's unity both over any confrontation with the unions and on privatisation. The League and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia are happy to see the airline privatised with the government retaining a golden share. The MSI regards the airline as a strategic asset and would be extremely hostile to significant foreign stake. The objection to foreign control could apply to Krupp's move to bid for the special steels side of Ilva, the state steel group. A broader issue to be tackled within the next few days is the fate of Iri, the giant state holding. The government's enthusiasm for privatisation renders Iri increasingly obsolete. Prof Romano Prodi, brought back as chairman a year ago, is reportedly ready to resign because of differences over the holding's future. He was noticeably absent from discussions earlier this week on the reorganisation of Telecom Italia, which is a key part of the Iri empire and accounts for an important part of its debt. The Iri board tomorrow considers the 1993 accounts, which are expected to show a loss of L10,000bn and debts of L75,000bn.</p>

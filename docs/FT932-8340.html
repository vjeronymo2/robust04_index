			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Capital Exchange bonds plan PLANS for a market in bonds issued by small and medium-sized unquoted companies have been launched by the Capital Exchange, a small company which is attempting to increase the supply of capital to small firms. Companies which have been trading for at least three years would be able to issue what would be known as SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) bonds for amounts of between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 5m. Capital Exchange hopes to launch the Private Syndicated Funding Scheme later this year, but will have to obtain approval from the Securities and Investments Board. The scheme is intended to make capital available to smaller companies which face the prospect of the possible closure of the USM and the ending of the Business Expansion Scheme at the end of this year. In January the Capital Exchange launched the Capital Exchange Gazette, a bi-monthly magazine intended to form a meeting place for small businesses seeking finance and private investors and larger companies looking for investment opportunities. The magazine has 400 subscribers, but Capital Exchange hopes to increase this to 50,000.</p>

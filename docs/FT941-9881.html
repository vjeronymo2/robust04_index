			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Generators in deal to sell plant and reduce prices Britain's largest electricity companies reached an agreement yesterday with Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, to try to sell off some of their power stations and reduce their prices in the wholesale electricity market. They have avoided being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Under the deal outlined yesterday, National Power agreed to dispose of between 3,000 and 4,000MW of its generating plant within two years. PowerGen agreed to dispose of 2,000MW of capacity. Prof Littlechild said the combined total of 6,000MW was equivalent to six large power stations. He said that unless the generators delivered on their undertakings there might still have to be an MMC reference. Both companies are to consider hiving off some of their generating plant into separate quoted companies. They also agreed to price capping measures which Prof Littlechild said would reduce prices in the wholesale electricity pool by 7 per cent and were worth Pounds 500m over the two years they are intended to last. It also emerged yesterday that Nuclear Electric, the state-owned utility, is likely to suffer more than National Power and PowerGen as a result of the agreement, in which it was not involved. Analysts believe its profits could be hit by up to Pounds 250m over the two years as a result of the price capping arrangements. The combined effect on the profits of National Power and PowerGen is likely to be about Pounds 100m . Mr Ed Wallis, PowerGen chief executive, said one option for the plant disposals was a demerger under which shareholders could be offered equity in a new company containing the amount of generating plant mentioned in the agreement. One advantage was that shareholders could be certain they were being offered value for money. Mr John Baker, National Power chief executive, said his company was also considering the creation of a separate company which would have quite separate management. Another option was an auction of plant. Mr Baker said the company had been involved last year in serious negotiations with two prospective buyers of plant. These had been put on hold during the more than six months of Prof Littlechild's deliberations. The level of plant disposals tentatively agreed to represents between 10 and 15 per cent of the companies' generating capacity. The disparity between the effects of the pool price reductions on Nuclear Electric and the other two generators arises because the state-owned company depends more on pool prices for its income. National Power and PowerGen have more hedging contracts in place which effectively protect them from vagaries in the pool price. Nuclear Electric said it still intended to be profitable before taking account of the nuclear levy by 1995-96 but 'that's a tougher challenge than it was'. Imperial Chemical Industries said the price cap would save it between Pounds 4m and Pounds 5m a year. Prof Littlechild acknowledged that reductions for domestic consumers would be small. Yesterday's agreement will enable the government to go ahead with plans to realise more than Pounds 4bn through sales of its remaining 40 per cent stakes in National Power and PowerGen.

			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BASEBALL APPEALS COURT DECISION IN ROSE CASE  </P> <P> Baseball's lawyers today asked an Ohio appellate court to suspend a judge's  ruling that postponed Pete Rose's hearing before Commissioner Bart Giamatti,  saying the lower court's restraining order "threatens the very reputation of  major league baseball."  </P> <P> In a 220-page request for the suspension of the temporary restraining order  granted Sunday by Commons Pleas Judge Norbert A. Nadel, baseball called the  ruling unprecedented.  </P> <P> "For the last several weeks, the charges against Pete Rose have focused  enormous public attention on gambling and the possible corruption of the game,"  baseball said in asking that the temporary restraining order be suspended. "Now  that Pete Rose has aired these charges by bringing suit, it has become critical  for the commissioner's office to act promptly to maintain public confidence in  the integrity of the game.  </P> <P> "If every action of the commissioner to investigate and determine matters  affecting the integrity of the game were to be subject to court intervention  and delay, the commissioner's ability to safeguard the integrity of the game  would be destroyed. The action of the court . . . threatens the very reputation  of major league baseball and deprives the commissioner of the power to protect  the integrity of the game."  </P> <P> A three-judge panel of the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals will decide  baseball's request after receiving a response from Rose's lawyers, which is due  by 9 a.m. Wednesday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Nadel scheduled a meeting this afternoon in his chambers with  lawyers from both sides. And Nadel also had until 5 p.m. today local time to  respond to an order from the Ohio Supreme Court that he show cause why the  report on Rose from baseball investigator John M. Dowd should not be made  public.  </P></p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Companies in clash over Skoda shake-up A SPLIT has developed between the Volkswagen-controlled company that is taking over imports of Czech-built Skoda cars to the UK and Skoda (GB), which has handled them for the past 27 years. Skoda (GB), owned by Motokov, the former Czechoslovak state foreign trade organisation - itself being privatised - is refusing to allow its 250 dealers to sign contracts with the new company, Skoda Automobile UK, while negotiations continue on whether Skoda (GB) should continue to play an operational role in the import and distribution of the cars. About 10,000 Skodas are sold in the UK each year. Mr David Wilks, of Skoda (GB), said yesterday the company had expected that the import and preparation centre it had operated for many years in Kings Lynn, Norfolk, would continue to process the cars under contract to Skoda Automobile UK. Instead, VW is planning to set up its own import and distribution arrangements, in keeping with its intention to expand Skoda sales greatly. It hopes to quadruple sales - to 40,000 a year - by as early as 1996. VW already has management control of the Czech manufacturer and is building a 70 per cent stake. Skoda (GB), while refusing to release dealers from their franchise contracts, said it had temporarily freed them from their obligation to buy cars exclusively from Skoda (GB) - in effect allowing them to take supplies from the new company while negotiations continue and when Skoda Automobile UK starts making its own shipments. With the UK new car market still in recession, most dealers are believed to have sufficient stocks to last through protracted negotiations. The cooling in relations between the two sides comes as a setback after 13 months of mainly amicable negotiations over the transition. More than 29 Skoda (GB) personnel have already transferred to the new company. However, the impasse over the Kings Lynn import centre has led to 44 people being made redundant there. Skoda Automobile UK formally took over as the UK importer on January 1 and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Skoda Automobilova. VW already holds 31 per cent, with the balance in the hands of the Czech government. Its managing director, Mr Robin Woolcock, is a former managing director of MAN Volkswagen Truck and Bus, the UK importer of Volkswagen and MAN commercial vehicles. Mr Woolcock has been managing the negotiations with Skoda (GB) and the creation of the new company, which has just set up offices in Milton Keynes. The expected leap in sales is based on a significant investment programme for Skoda vehicles. The DM8bn (Pounds 3.3bn) programme will lead to new models and is designed to more than double Skoda's capacity to 460,000 cars a year by the mid 1990s.</p>

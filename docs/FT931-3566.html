			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Italy's Corruption Scandal: Magistrates hold key to unlocking Tangentopoli - They will set the investigation agenda OVER the weekend the Italian media felt obliged to comment on a non-event. No new arrests had taken place in any of the country's ever more numerous corruption scandals which centre on the illicit funding of political parties through bribes on contracts. Such arrests are now such a part of daily life that it is an occasion when nothing happens. But this is only a pause. The anti-corruption drive has gone too far to be halted easily and is now attacking the heart of the post-war politico-economic system. The traditional balance of power has altered and the politicians no longer control the judiciary; or rather that part of the judiciary which matters, the investigating magistrates. A weak government and a fractious parliament have tried, and failed, to impose a political solution which would limit the scope and consequences of the corruption investigations. As a result the magistrates, particularly those in Milan, are setting the agenda. The speed and scope of the investigations will be determined for the foreseeable future by the ability and willingness of the magistrates to proceed. The public is firmly behind them. Anger is rising as proof accumulates of what has been little short of the rape of the state during the last two decades. The need for a political solution, which prime minister Giuliano Amato began to explore last month, was and remains real. If Italy's system has been so permeated by corruption, the very institutions of democracy risk being weakened if the judicial surgery is too abrupt and all-embracing. Second, there is the issue of how guilt is apportioned in such a corrupt system, and whether individuals are to be punished or whether society as a whole should be blamed. Finally, the sheer volume of work at both the investigative, prosecution and the appeal stage threatens to bring an already torpid and bureaucratic judicial system to a standstill. Italy cannot afford to have the corruption scandals carried through the courts for the next six to 10 years without political instability and serious economic disruption. Already, Italian companies are worried about their image abroad. It is now clear that the scope for investigation is limitless. What started out a year ago with Milan being dubbed Tangentopolis (literally bribe city) has become Tangentopoli (bribe cities). Large and small cities alike have seen their favourite sons indicted or their reputations ruined. Milan, Naples, Turin and Rome - the four biggest cities - are without political guidance as the ruling coalitions have been decimated by a combination of arrests and alliances broken in the fall-out from corruption scandals. In northern and central Italy the political elite is on the retreat, if not disappearing. Political control of the public sector, through state companies and thousands of municipally owned entities, which has been the central element in the corrupting process, has been undermined. To some extent all the big state concerns are involved - Iri, the state holding company; Enel, the electricity authority; Efim, the industrial holding company in liquidation; Eni, the state energy company and Anas, the roads authority. The enormous bounty of power station contracts in Enel's patronage is emerging as a key source of bribes paid by contractors to the political parties. But Eni is rapidly becoming the centre of attention. Last week, Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the Eni chairman, along with the heads of the company's four main subsidiaries, was arrested on charges of illicit party funding and falsifying accounts. Magistrates are investigating three main areas of Eni activity: The involvement of Eni with Banco Ambrosiano prior to the latter's collapse in 1982, and the payment into a Swiss bank account of money for the Socialists; The reorganisation of the chemicals industry with Ferruzzi's Montedison in 1989-90; The use of Eni's subsidiaries in providing funds to parties based on foreign contracts (such as gas supplies from Algeria) and the profits derived from dealing in oil and other hydrocarbon commodities through Swiss associates. All these promise explosive revelations concerning the scale of money taken by individuals and the parties through manipulation of state companies, as well as exposing the 'Swiss connection' in Italian business dealings. The issue of individual enrichment in taking kickbacks has not been touched. At least 30 per cent of the L5,000bn - L6,000bn (Pounds 2.7bn) believed to have been taken annually in 'commissions' went not to political parties but to individuals in kind or cash. Milan magistrates have left this issue to one side. Other areas which have yet to fall within the magistrates' net include government investment and procurement for the railways, which is planning massive investment in a high-speed train network, and the defence sector. The civil service itself is only just beginning to be touched with investigations into public works, overseas aid controlled by the Foreign Ministry and export credit guarantees. Equally, the investigations remain essentially a phenomenon of north and central Italy. This is because the grip of the Christian Democrats and Socialists remains strongest in the south and the judiciary there is more susceptible to political pressure. In the south, too, the thrust of magistrates' energy tends to be directed at organised crime. The party most visibly affected has been the Socialists, but smaller parties have also suffered. The only parties to emerge with a clean sheet so far are the communist splinter group, Reconstructed Communism, La Rete (The Network, the Sicily-based reform movement), the neo-fascist MSI and the Lombard League, whose rise to power derives precisely from its opposition to the corrupt old system in the north. These are calling for the corrupt to be punished and would probably be the main beneficiaries if elections were held under the present system of proportional representation. Yet even they recognise that the old system is unworkable in the long term. Only a new parliament elected on a fresh set of electoral regulations is likely to have the moral authority to deal with the issues raised by Tangentopoli.</p>

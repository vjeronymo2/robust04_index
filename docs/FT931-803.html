			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Gardening: The Cherry Choo-Choo UNDER THESE amazingly blue skies, garden-watchers are having the spring of a lifetime. Magnolias are standing out like batteries of white candles; trees are exhaling blossom everywhere and primroses have never looked happier. It makes us all want to travel and see it; but where there is travel, there are customs. I think our wise men are missing a chance. With a slight encouragement of our national habits, the season could be turned to the national advantage: it might help with everyone's problem, however, to sell British Rail. In the Far East, they have already made the connection. In Japan and Korea, this week and next are the season of blossom-viewing, when crowds shuffle to and fro on public transport to gaze at cherry trees, admire their evanescence, drink too much and take the memory home. In Korea on Thursday, huge crowds will be converging on the south-eastern town of Chin Hae. There, 40,000 cherry trees are expected to be flowering in the suburbs in the yearly festival which brings viewers on long train journeys. Where the Far East is today, should not Britain be tomorrow? We are supposed to love gardens; our blossom is fantastic; why not pilot a cherry-viewing festival, shepherd the crowds on to trains for a special Blossom Break and pack them off to get mildly drunk before clouds of Prunus pissardii of late March and April? With the year's notice, British Rail could probably cope with the surge. The design concept would need BR's usual flair but might I suggest the Cherry Blossom Choo-Choo, fanning southwards into Kent, the Garden of Britain? There is what British Rail might call a 'hazzard' in this copycat scheme for Korea. It involves real trees, whereas the management feels much safer with artificial substitutes, as you can still see on their London stations. It also involves unpredictability. Near Chin Hae, the unpredictable elements are the cherries, which are sometimes too late for the festival, although tradition has fixed it on April 1. In Britain, I will explain how we can be more flexible about our prunus: the problems, rather, are the trains. Here, some of our cherry blossom is remarkably short-lived, often looking its best for no more than five days. Setting out on the blossom run, would British Rail arrive in time? I wish we could be confident. Knowledge, however, helps to circumvent problems and this year we have been shown the way forward. Gardeners who avoid prunus trees usually give three reasons: their season is much too short; after flowering, the leaves are boring; and too many of their colours are a vile sugar-pink. Each complaint is narrow-minded and no season has done more to expose them than 1993. Since January, cherry blossom has been continuous, hopping from one variety to the next and promising to stretch to the end of May. It makes me keen to plant a selected cherry calendar and to tie up with Blossom Network South-East. As ever, my top Number One tree in Britain is the winter cherry, prunus subhirtella autumnalis, which has been in flower from November until now and is just going out in a haze of pale pink-white as the pretty young leaves emerge. In February, I would suspend briefly the ban on deep, brash pink and follow up with one of two British selections, based on Japanese blood; prunus Okame or, even better, Kursar. After Kursar, I would avoid all varieties of prunus with purple leaves. Admittedly, the pale clouds of blossom on the popular little pissardii have looked marvellous in our garden suburbs, where Richmond's side streets are surpassed only by Oxford's Woodstock Road. In a garden, though, this tall variety is second rate because the leaves are so drab after flowering. Instead, I would choose Umeniko; its large, white flowers are short-lived but the leaves are fresh green on a manageable upright tree. In April, I have a soft spot for the Sour Cherry, prunus cerasus Rhexii; its double white flowers are large and showy at a time when the family is swamped with pink. Our native Geans then take over: first the single prunus avium and then, a week or so later, its double-flowered sister. As May begins, it is then time for Tai Haku, the broad-spreading beauty which is the queen of all the large-flowered whites. Be warned, however, that her eventual width is very large: she is not a tree for a small garden. Across five months, therefore, we could surely cope with problems of time-tabling. Individual cherries are here and gone but, with a seasonal Blossom Basic, you could be confident of seeing something in this versatile family. Where there is pilgrimage, there is always a profit: add in a Blossom Blessing Sunday and the train-loads of pilgrims might raise the attendance figures of two declining institutions, all for the price of a single ticket.</p>

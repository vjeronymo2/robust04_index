			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A skull found by a hiker near the Lafayette-Orinda border has prompted an  investigation into whether it is that of murder victim Luis Reyna, whose  headless body was found in the same area last year, Contra Costa County  sheriff's officials said. Reyna, a popular waterfront commissioner, disappeared  July 18, the same day he told family members he was going to meet commission  colleague Enrique Zambrano, who vanished the same day as Reyna. Zambrano had  been charged with the attempted murder of a UC Berkeley professor and his wife  early last year.  </P></p>

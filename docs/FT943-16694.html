			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Argentina's lapse foils strategy Betting-wise, my strategy of backing Latin America plus Romania in the World Cup was looking really brainy, until Argentina messed me about by not winning their group, Michael Thompson-Noel writes. Colombia - spit, spit - were a mistake. Their exit cost me Pounds 77 (Pounds 70 stake plus 10 per cent betting tax). But two of my other three teams, Brazil and Romania, won their first-round groups. Even the Argies were cruising nicely until losing to Bulgaria. They still qualified, but only in third place. I have backed Romania at 25-1 and 33-1: two bets of Pounds 10 each-way (Pounds 10 to win plus Pounds 10, at half-odds, to reach the final). I found the 33-1 by shopping around after they had beaten Colombia. To biff the bookies, you have to shop for odds. At present, victory for Romania would yield a net profit of Pounds 635 on total stakes so far (all four teams) of Pounds 275 ('net' meaning profit minus all losing bets and tax). If the Argies win, the profit would be Pounds 275. Brazil: a net loss of Pounds 35. To date, I have been treating Brazil as a saver. Trouble is, since the start of the competition Brazil have slumped from 3-1 to less than 2-1 - excessively ungenerous. Am I worried by the impact on Argentina of Maradona's expulsion for drug-taking? Not a lot. A betting strategy based on a single player would be a ridiculous one indeed. What is really irritating is that Argentina and Romania now meet in the second round, and that only one of my three teams can reach the final. All extremely wretched. But the bookies aren't safe. I am preparing Plan B.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yuriy Nekrasov, member of the Criminology </F> Association, under the heading "Business under the  Criminological X-Ray": "Let He Who Speaks Be Heard"]    [Text] Let us ask, as they say, a point-blank question: Has  the Criminology Association, which organized the international  seminar "For Honest Business" at the beginning of January,  succeeded in its undertaking? Did they not waste the first work  week of the year--scholars and practitioners in jurisprudence,  staff of various protection services, and finally,  entrepreneurs, who, as one may guess, have an extremely high  stake in this--by gathering in the conference hall of the  Russian Academy of Management?    Of course, skeptics will also have something to comment on  in  the seminar. First, the thesis "two jurists--three opinions" has  not been refuted by a long shot. Differences of opinion  sometimes produced a heat akin to rally frenzy. Second, is there  a guarantee that in this debate, contrary to the experience of  thousands of others like it, the truth indeed will be born?  Finally, was it worthwhile to convene this gathering in order to  once again state the obvious: business is being overrun by crime?    As an objection to the hypothetical skeptic, I will probably  begin with the latter: stating the obvious. There are different  ways to state things. One can stun the audience with murderous  (frequently in the literal sense) statistics and "finish off"  the listener with the eternal question: What are they doing  about it--the procuracy, or the militia, or anyone else except  the critic's own agency. Or one may calmly present the same  figures on the basis of a scientifically validated analysis. One  can, on the basis of the same analysis, produce a clear  forecast; or, finally, propose a package of well-considered  measures.    For the sake of fairness I want to say that this approach  was  the prevalent one. Thanks to a large extent to the fact that the  presidium, headed by the association President Azaliya  Dolgovaya, tactfully but firmly nipped attempts at rally style  in the bud.    Now the main point. Despite the divergence of opinions that  is traditional for the legal profession, the seminar  participants practically agreed on the definition of three, if  one may put it this way, "predicaments" of modern business in  our country. A useless legal base of reforms; obvious  shortcomings in the practice of privatization, banking, and  other strategic directions of economic renewal; and finally, a  corrupt bureaucracy--this is what accompanies the current, to  put it mildly, adverse situation. A special topic was the hasty  and unreasoned reform of the law enforcement system. Does this  mean then that the seminar was a complete success?    I would wait before answering this. I would wait, despite  being fully convinced that this seminar was necessary, despite  all the respect for the work the organizers have put into it.  One will be able to call it a success only when the alarms rung  by criminologists are heard in the power structures; when people  who do professional research in criminology are brought into  norm-creating work (which, I should note, in civilized countries  is altogether unthinkable without the expert opinion of  criminologists).    As to the discussion at the seminar per se, today we are  publishing its principal sections. We are publishing it, of  course, without smoothing out the sharp aspects in the dialogue,  without retouching the sometimes polarized viewpoints. Despite  all this, we hope that the reader will get an objective picture  of not only the proceedings at the seminar, but also (and this  is most important) an idea of the crime situation in the sphere  of business.</p>

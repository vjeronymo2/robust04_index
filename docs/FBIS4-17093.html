			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister </F> Vitaliy Churkin by program announcer Nikolay Svanidze on 20  April; place not given; from the "Details" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Svanidze] Today, Russian Deputy Foreign  Minister Vitaliy Churkin gave an exclusive interview for the  "Details" program.    You sensationally changed your position in relation to this  situation. This happened literally yesterday, as far as I  understand it, right? You gave this statement yesterday. What  led you to do this, what did the Serbs do to make you believe  that they are deceiving Russia, and that it is now difficult to  continue talks with them?    [Churkin] But I have not changed my position. I believe that  I did what was necessary, proceeding from the position that I  have been following over practically the last two years. My  position was a very simple one. That is that the great Russia  -- so long as the Serbs ask for it -- can truly help the Serbs  if they travel the path toward peace. We will help to point out  that path to them. But if they travel a different path then  they cannot expect the great Russia to help them.    But I was forced to make this statement, and I made it quite  consciously, although in some comments now, especially in  Serbia, they are saying it was an emotional one and that Churkin  was speaking out, and so on. I was there for nine days and I  received the quite distinct feeling that the Serbs are on the  brink of a catastrophe, and not only the Bosnian Serbs, but all  the Serbs. First and foremost, they will themselves end up in a  catastrophic situation, and the whole of the rest of the world  would be pushed into very grave events. Of course, I did not  reckon that this statement would lead to some kind of turning  point in policy, but still, I hope that for many Serbs this  statement would make them think carefully, and, apart from that,  in the practical sense, I felt that something had begun to move  there.    [Svanidze] Who made you promises and broke them? Who, in  your opinion, deceived you? You have in mind Radovan Karadzic?    [Churkin] Well, today I would not really want to name names,  but I had the main conversations with Karadzic, although a  totally dramatic situation developed on that day when the plane  was shot down, and a massive bombardment, as it were, and great  difficulties were threatened, and the election campaign was  going on there somewhere, and I was, literally, as it were,  trying to get a decision from anyone. I rang President  Milosevic and talked to other Bosnian Serb leaders. There was  even one moment when, in a telephone conversation with President  Milosevic, I cried out in amazement: What, am I supposed to  proclaim myself president of the Republic of Serbia so as to  make a decision, as it were, on the issue?    [Svanidze] Vitaliy Ivanovich, you have a reputation with the  country's leadership -- and with the president particularly --  for being an expert on the region. What steps do you recommend?  Are you recommending that our policy in the region should be  radically altered?    [Churkin] No. I set out from the position that we would  continue to follow the policy of Russia as a great power.    [Svanidze] All the same, we have been openly supporting the  Serbs. What is going to happen now?    [Churkin] I do not agree with that view. Russia was a  communications channel for the Serbian side. When the Serbs  were saying that the world community did not understand them,  and relations between the Serbs and the world community really  were complicated, Russia tried to use its unique communications  channel, operating in conjunction with other members of the  world community. At the same time, since we were taking an  objective, balanced approach, we did not only maintain contact  with them. Nearly every time I was in Sarajevo I met the Muslim  and Croatian leaderships, as well as the Bosnian leadership. We  will continue to take the view that if the Serbs find the  strength to turn to peace, then Russia will go on playing its  part, but if they do not, if this drama goes on and a small  group of people, God forbid, manages to drag the Serbian people  into disaster, then Russia must not...[pauses] The tail should  not be wagging the dog. It is really quite simple. Then we  have our own interests and our own positions, too.    [Svanidze] If I have understood correctly, then, you are not  recommending that we give up on peacemaking efforts in  Yugoslavia.    [Churkin] Of course not, of course not. I think that it is  very important now for us to get out of the crisis in Gorazde.  The situation there is like this: The Serbs have only to make  one false move in Gorazde or anywhere else on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the thing I have been warning them  against will break out. So my conscience is clear. But events  may take a different course. I do, in spite of everything, hope  that we will manage to settle the Gorazde problem, and then the  political efforts will definitely be resumed. We are actively  involved with other countries on this.    [Svanidze] But if everything does, for all that, follow the  scenario that you have outlined -- in other words -- if the  Serbs do not change their position, and that leads to the result  that you have spoken about -- a tough result -- what will  Russia's reaction be? Or is that too hypothetical?    [Churkin] The question really is too hypothetical because  there are different degrees of toughness.    [Svanidze] As a politician, you have scored a lot of points  in recent months inside the country -- among the soft and the  hard opposition, particularly. Even Zhirinovskiy has left you  alone, apparently saying that this is because you are just about  the only minister not to sell yourself to world Zionism. Well,  now you have changed your position by making such an important  statement. Are you not afraid that the credit you have gained  will now be lost?    [Churkin] Well, I do not take account of credit. I do not  see myself as a politician. I have absolutely no political or  other ambitions. One thing concerns me: My personal worthiness  as a professional and as a person. On the whole, I have had to  make decisions two or three times in Yugoslavian affairs that  were very difficult. But I always hold that if I get into such  a situation, I must make the decision that I believe is needed.  Otherwise, why bother? Let someone else do it -- if I am not  capable of making serious decisions. So that is the way I work.  [passage omitted]    [Svanidze] But tomorrow morning, President Yeltsin will find  a modest, four-page printed note written by Vitaliy Churkin and  approved by Andrey Kozyrev on his desk. It will lay out various  possible developments of events in Bosnia and it will give  certain political recommendations. The president will have to  make a critical decision. [passage omitted]</p>

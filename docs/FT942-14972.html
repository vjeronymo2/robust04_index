			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Earning credibility The not-so-new format for reporting company profits has now had a year to bed in. In general, the system is working well, but the abolition of extraordinary items has had the expected effect of making reported earnings more volatile. Investors still want to get a picture of underlying company performance. Most use the Institute of Investment Management Research standard as a guide. It excludes from earnings those capital items which have no impact on continuing operations, but includes costs which are related to mainstream businesses. The underlying earnings picture is still less easy to spot, and investors are looking for other ways to track company performance. In part, that is what the reforms were intended to achieve, since investors had come to rely too heavily on a single crude measure. Earnings are a proxy for distributable cash flow, and if the proxy is failing it makes sense to look at cash directly. More estimates of future cash flows are being produced, and there is a good deal of work going into discounted cash flow modelling. There is also some attention being paid to dividends, since although they do not provide much information about companies' growth prospects, they do hint at management's confidence about the future. Perhaps the most interesting line of attack, however, is in deconstructing analysts' models of company profits to assess where the risks of errors lie. Correctly identifying whether earnings are likely to be higher or lower than consensus forecasts is the kind of deeper analysis that should make institutions money.</p>

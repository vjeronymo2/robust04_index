			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Gunmen fire on supporters of Gamsakhurdia: Georgia's acting prime minister says ousted president will be allowed to remain with family in Armenia GUNMEN in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, opened fire on crowds demonstrating yesterday in support of President Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who fled the country on Monday. Two people were reported wounded. The opposition military council, which has taken control of the republic, said it gave the order to disperse the 3,000-strong gathering. Last week, at least two people were killed when masked gunmen fired into another pro-Gamsakhurdia crowd. The ousted president is believed to be in Ichevan, Armenia. Mr Tengiz Sigua, Georgia's acting prime minister, said he had spoken by telephone to Mr Levon Ter-Petrosyan, the Armenian president, and they had agreed Mr Gamsakhurdia and his family could remain temporarily in the country, but would not be allowed to leave. About 100 supporters who fled with the president, many of them armed, were to be sent back to Georgia. Yesterday's shooting incident was another blow for the military council, which is attempting to establish control in the republic. But Mr Jaba Iosseliani, one of the council's two leaders, was unrepentant. 'I gave the order for the crowd to be dispersed, and I will do the same tomorrow and the day after if necessary.' He said the council had imposed the 'absolute minimum' of restrictions on Tbilisi residents, asking only that a curfew and a ban on public meetings be observed. Mr Iosseliani, who denied anyone had been hurt in the incident, said his men had fired blanks. But in an apparent indication of disagreement between himself and the council, Mr Sigua said the identity of the gunmen was unknown. He insisted the use of firearms to disperse demonstrations had been prohibited. He also contradicted the assertions of the council that the rest of Georgia had been reports of groups of Gamsakhurdia supporters seizing sections of railway line in western Georgia, and tearing down a television tower in Abkhazia, in the north-west. Regional prefects appointed by Mr Gamsakhurdia were being replaced by men from the council, Mr Sigua said, and were attempting to confiscate weapons and maintain order in the republic. There were unconfirmed reports of meetings elsewhere in the country in support of the former president. Travellers arriving in Tbilisi said they had heard shooting around the town of Kutaisi, 200km from the capital. Mr Sigua said he was appealing to the council to annul its order last Thursday to dissolve the Georgian parliament, which he hoped would meet again by January 15. Law and order agencies, including the Interior Ministry, the militia, and the Georgian KGB, were yesterday being run by the council, while a temporary government of 10 ministers appointed by Mr Sigua was said to be supervising economic and other matters. The military council has said it will hand over all its powers to the provisional government as soon as the situation stabilises. NATO yesterday agreed to establish formal links with the newly independent republics of the former Soviet Union by inviting them to join the east-west North Atlantic Co-operation Council set up in Brussels last month, writes Robert Mauthner, Diplomatic Editor. Nato foreign ministers are expected to hold a special meeting with their opposite numbers from the Commonwealth of Independent States and east European nations in Prague at the end of this month to endorse the new relationship with the former Soviet republics.</p>

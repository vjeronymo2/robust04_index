			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Technology: Voiceovers for the visually impaired - Worth Watching Visually impaired television viewers could soon be given 'voiceover' commentaries during breaks in the dialogue to help them follow events on the screen. The Independent Television Commission of Winchester, has contracted Portset Systems to develop a way of compressing and coding this commentary into a digital signal to be broadcast alongside the programme. The signal is decoded into speech by a box which sits on the TV set. The Audetel (audio description of television) equipment should be ready in about a year. ITC: UK, 0962 848647.</p>

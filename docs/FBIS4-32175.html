			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 19 (CTK) -- The national council of  the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement (MKDH) told CTK  today it agreed with the formation of a coalition with the  Egyutteles movement, but still supported the idea of creating a  coalition of three along with the Hungarian Civic Party (MOS).  In its statement adopted yesterday and given to CTK today, the  MKDH said it had confirmed the powers of a commission to  represent it in talks on the coalition of three.    The MKDH and Egyutteles have a total of 14 out of a total of  150 parliamentary seats. The MOS is an extra-parliamentary  party. Early parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place  on September 30-October 1. About 560,000 (11 per cent of  Slovakia's population) ethnic Hungarians live in Slovakia.    The idea to form a coalition of three, which is promoted  particularly by the MKDH, has not met with much support from  Egyutteles, which would prefer a coalition of four, including  the Hungarian People's Party (MLS, extra-parliamentary). But  with the elections drawing near, the movement is ready to  discuss the "close coalition."    Miklos Duray, Egyutteles chairman, told CTK recently that  the  "fundamental conditions" for the formation of such a Hungarian  parties' coalition are: creation of a joint group once they are  represented in parliament, common policy in local elections  along with common slates in mayoral elections, and a common line  on Slovakia's foreign policy.    According to a June poll carried out by the Statistical  Office, the present MKDH-Egyutteles coalition would be supported  by 8 per cent of voters. The parliamentary border is 5 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zhan Videnov, chairman of the Supreme </F> Council of the Bulgarian Socialist Party, by Dora Chichkova in  Sofia on 22 March: "Attack on Lev Has Been Mounted by Foreign  Currency Speculators"]    [Text] Zhan Videnov celebrated his 35th birthday on 22  March. He spent his birthday attending a four-hour session of  the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] Executive Bureau and having  two-hour meetings with Professor Todor Vulchev, Bulgarian  National Bank [BNB] governor, and Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni  Matinchev, and then found time to give an interview to DUMA  before setting off to his next working meeting.    [Chichkova] Is the BSP leadership worried by the state of  the foreign exchange market, and how is it planning to react?    [Videnov] We are seriously concerned about the lev's  weakness. There are no objective reasons for the market to have  passed the barrier of 50 leva to the dollar. The people and  business circles have real fears connected with the forthcoming  taxation reform, the price rises for energy and postal and  communication services, and certain difficulties arising in the  foreign debt negotiations. However, all these fears have been  deliberately played upon to create a psychosis and to enable  dishonest people to reap financial and political dividends.  This can only be countered in one way -- by coordinated efforts  on the part of the BNB and Council of Ministers, assisted by  parliament, to create an atmosphere of security, clarity, and  greater confidence in the institutions.    [Chichkova] Which circles have exploited the situation?    [Videnov] I am certain that the attack on the lev was  specially mounted by foreign currency speculators. They have  already gained hundreds of millions in profits. The worst thing  is that some circles want this situation to continue, not simply  to obtain fresh profits, but also to cause hyperinflation. The  people who want this are banks that hold considerable amounts of  bad debts, holders of large amounts of foreign currency (mostly  in foreign bank accounts), and middlemen who have "blocked" the  sale of the large state enterprises so that they can buy them  for a song. And last but not least, there are political circles  in Bulgaria and abroad that for months have been trying to  destabilize the country. Everyone knows who they are.    [Chichkova] Nevertheless, is there a risk of hyperinflation?    [Videnov] Hyperinflation can only be provoked artificially.  Neither the budget, the policies of the BNB, and the taxation  system, nor the realities of the domestic economy provide  preconditions for this. The measures that the Council of  Ministers and the BNB should take are well known; I refer to  strong foreign exchange controls, collecting the budget revenue  to the last stotinka, closely monitoring prices and providing  timely compensation for the incomes of the weakest social  groups, and adopting a much tougher approach in the foreign debt  negotiations. At a series of meetings that I have had these last  few days with Ministers Georgi Tanev, Stoyan Aleksandrov,  Valentin Karabashev, and Evgeni Matinchev and with BNB Governor  Todor Vulchev, I think that we have reached agreement on what  measures are needed.    [Chichkova] Is a cabinet crisis possible?    [Videnov] It can only be caused by factors outside the  government, especially by irresponsible domestic and foreign  politicians. Some of them want to cover over the traces of  their deals in 1992, while others want to make up for their lack  of action in 1993. The best thing now is to support the Council  of Ministers and the BNB and not allow the sabotage plotted  against them to succeed.    [Chichkova] What do you think about the insinuations that  the country's salvation lies in a new cabinet, and a caretaker  cabinet at that?    [Videnov] This is utterly ridiculous. The present  parliament cannot produce a new government, and it would be a  crime to restore the former cabinet. The only other solution is  immediate elections, which would take us years back into the  past. A caretaker government could only prepare for such  elections. Anyone who thinks that this solution can save  Bulgaria is an open enemy of the country.</p>

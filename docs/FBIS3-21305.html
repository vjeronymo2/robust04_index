			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-Ashhab in Rabat] </F>   [Text] A call from Moroccan opposition parties to end the  house arrest of Shaykh Abdessalem Yacine has raised questions  about the kind of relationship anticipated between these parties  and Islamic groups in Morocco.    With the exception of the traditionally-inclined Istiqlal  [Independence] Party, which has previously called for the  absorption of these groups, the other opposition parties,  especially the Socialist Union and Democratic Action, have  viewed with discomfort the growth of the role of the Islamic  groups. Their political bases in Moroccan universities,  especially in Fes and Casablanca, have clashed with Islamic  movements, while the Party of Progress and Socialism (formerly  the Communist Party) has not ceased calling for resistance to  these groups, which had virtually overwhelmed Morocco's  universities, in return for a drop in the influence of the  traditional parties. Its leader, Ali Yata, brought up this  question in political and official meetings, demanding an end to  the exploitation of the universities by extremist Islamic  groups. The same is the case with the imams of some mosques, who  oppose the existence of a communist party in the country.    While the opposition parties' campaign in defense of Shaykh  Yacine is part of the process of bringing up the problem of  human rights conditions in the country, and to obtain the  political and financial support from these groups in support of  opposition aims, it is noteworthy that some political parties  have recently raised the issue of working together with the  Islamic groups. Their condition is a commitment to a political  plan based upon legality. According to opposition politicians,  there are dozens of Islamic organizations in Morocco at work  raising religious awareness. Some of them bear a political  stamp, which imposes a formula for dealing with them,  particularly as the Islamic groups have shown their presence in  the large demonstrations held during the Gulf crisis and in  labor holiday festivities.    The Socialist Union's acting leader, Mohamed Yazghi, said  that these groups had voted for the opposition parties in the  recent legislative elections in major cities such as Rabat,  Sali, and Fes. Lawyers affiliated with opposition activities  have defended members belonging to the Justice and Charity  Society led by Shaykh Yacine in several trials in 1990. This was  not the case in the 1984 trials, when a plan to disturb the  country's security, led by extremist groups linked with foreign  parties, was uncovered.    In this context it may be mentioned that the Moroccan  Government is formulating a plan for confronting the extremist  Islamic groups, typified by its ban on mosques engaging in  political activity. It has stopped the imams of some mosques who  had been engaging in these activities. The Ministry of Islamic  Affairs undertook the opening of a dialogue with the Islamic  groups committed to admonition and guidance rather than forcing  themselves into political controversy. It is noteworthy that the  leaders of Islamic movements in several Arab and Islamic  movements participated in demonstrations held in Casablanca as  part of what was known as the Islamic Awakening Community. It  has been decided that Morocco will, in the coming weeks, host a  conference of ministers of Islamic affairs from the Arab and  Islamic worlds, to discuss the idea of coexistence and  reconciliation among Islamic sects.    The Islamic Awakening Community will focus, in a conference  to be held this month, on studying this question and other  related problems, in cooperation with Islamic groups.    Concerned persons believe that the call of the opposition  parties, whose agendas diverge from the direction of the Islamic  parties, has to do with putting political pressure on the  government, by putting thorny problems before the  recently-created Ministry of Human Rights. The least of these  would be the studying of the conditions of detainees belonging  to Islamic groups, and urging international organizations to  show renewed concern for the state of human rights.    Those who follow these developments say that the political  goal in raising this issue appears obviously through their  presentation in Parliament, where it was possible for the  Consultative Council on Human Rights, concerned with the defense  of human rights, to study it. Opposition party circles  themselves do not hide their discomfort at this trend, which  could backfire on the opposition itself, as the affiliates of  the Islamic groups mistrust the role of the traditional parties,  and go farther than they do in the field of implementing Islamic  law. There is nothing indicating the possibility of agreement  between the agendas of the two sides, though they both agree in  opposing the government.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1357.15(m)&blank;Services Coordination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;1357.15(m), we propose to implement sections 432(a)(3) and 422(b) of the Act which require that the plan provide for coordination of services under the plan with the provision of services or benefits under other Federal or federally assisted programs serving the same populations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have not mandated a specific service coordination process because State, local, and Tribal needs and circumstances vary. In addition, many States and Indian tribes have a number of existing processes and coordination efforts already in place to carry out this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have mandated in paragraph (m)(1), however, that the State's on-going coordination process must include representatives of the child and family services provided by the State agency as well as other service delivery systems providing social, health, education, and economic services to children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose in paragraph (m)(2), that the State's CFSP must describe how services under the plan will be coordinated over the five-year period with services or benefits under other Federal and federally assisted programs serving the same populations to achieve the goals and objectives in the plan. Additionally, we propose that the description must include the participants in the service coordination process and examples of how the process led or will lead to additional coordination of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to Indian tribes, in paragraph (m)(3), we propose that the Indian tribe must include in the coordination process representatives of other Federal or federally assisted child and family services or related programs as appropriate to their circumstances. The Indian tribe's CFSP must describe how services under the plan will be coordinated over the five-year period with services or benefits under other Federal or federally assisted programs serving the same populations to achieve the goals and objectives in the plan. For example, the Tribe may coordinate family preservation, family support and/or child welfare services provided by the Indian Health Service and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, if these agencies are providing services within the Tribe's jurisdiction. They may also coordinate services with public schools receiving supplemental education funds which may provide support services. The description must include the participants in the process and examples of how the process led or will lead to additional coordination of services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of services and programs are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Within the State agency: existing family support and family preservation; child abuse and neglect prevention, intervention, and treatment; foster care, and reunification, adoption, and independent living services;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Other public and nonprofit private agencies, including community-based organizations, which provide Federal or federally assisted services or benefits. (These programs may be administered within the State title  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IV&hyph;B agency, by another State agency, by private nonprofit agencies and organizations, or by a combination of public and private support.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of major programs are: the social services block grant; title IV&hyph;A (income maintenance, child care, employment and training); title IV&hyph;A (emergency assistance); child support; maternal and child health; title XIX (Medicaid, EPSDT); mental health and substance abuse services; child abuse prevention (Children's Trust Funds); transitional living; runaway youth and youth gang prevention; education; developmental disabilities; juvenile justice; early childhood education and child development programs (Head Start); domestic violence; housing; nutrition (Food Stamps, Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC)); child care and development block grant and other child care programs; the community services block grant; Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities program (EZ/EC); education (school-based services); and justice programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that the ultimate purpose of service coordination is to improve the well-being of children, youth and families. Focus group participants, and others, emphasized that effective coordination of a broad spectrum of services provides a holistic approach to serving children and families and increases the likelihood of matching families' needs with appropriate services rather than merely providing available services. Their view was that, in isolation, individual services are not likely to address the needs of children and families; many families need support and services that transcend any single agency mission; no one agency has the resources to meet all needs of all families; vulnerable families with multiple needs are less likely to independently access and integrate all the services they need; and service systems which view families' needs categorically reduce the likelihood of overall family improvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

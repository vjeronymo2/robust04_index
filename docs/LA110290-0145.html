			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> FDIC Rejects Bid for Continental Stake: The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has  rejected a $112-million bid by investors and management for the federal  agency's 26% stake in Continental Bank Corp., the bank firm said.  </P> <P> The FDIC acquired all of Chicago-based Continental when the bank failed in 1984  and has slowly been selling it off. The 26% stake is its last chunk. FDIC  spokesman Alan Whitney said the FDIC board voted 4-0 to reject the bid because  it "was not in the best interests of the FDIC." He declined to say why.  </P></p>

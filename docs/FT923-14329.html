			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Fury over call for US quota on Japanese cars AMERICAN car importers and foreign car manufacturers yesterday attacked as 'boldfaced protectionism' trade legislation to be discussed today which would force Japan to negotiate a quota of 1.65m imports or face US retaliation. The amendment to this year's House trade bill is sponsored by Democratic Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. Despite Bush Administration insistence that the legislation would be vetoed, opponents say it will be difficult to defeat because the House Democratic leadership wants to use it as a campaign issue at next week's Democratic convention. Opponents are also fighting a requirement that Japanese 'transplants' - factories in the US - increase their use of American-made parts to 70 per cent in the next two years. They argue that such restrictions are the type of barriers to trade and investment the US is seeking to eliminate in the Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks. Mr Walter Huizenga, of the American International Automobile Dealers Association, yesterday said the legislation would have 'a chilling effect' on investment in the US. About 32,000 US workers are employed by Japanese 'transplants'. Even as the importers and 'transplants' were sending lobbyists around Capitol Hill, congressmen have been digesting a recent report, issued by a joint US-Canada panel, established under the Free Trade Agreement. It says that unless the North American industry improves its competitiveness, 100,000 jobs could be lost in the next five years. The report warned that US costs were rising, while Japanese costs had declined. 'As a result, the Japanese industry appears to possess a major advantage over its North American rivals in internally generated funds available for capital investment and to enhance competitiveness.' Capital requirements are likely to increase during the 1990s - almost Dollars 600bn (Pounds 314.1bn) will be spent on product development for the North American market through to 1996. The report called on the US government to negotiate with Japan several measures to reduce the automotive trade imbalance, including elimination of formal and informal barriers to the Japanese market.</p>

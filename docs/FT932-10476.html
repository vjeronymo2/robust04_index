			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Management changes sought at Tiphook - Institutions dissatisfied with recent performance TIPHOOK, the transport rental company, is under pressure from institutional shareholders to make a number of changes to the way the company is managed. Some institutions, disappointed by the company's recent performance, are pushing for the appointment of stronger non-executive directors and are suggesting the separation of the roles of chairman and chief executive, presently held by Mr Robert Montague, the company's founder. Mr Montague and Mr Roger Braidwood, finance director, are due to fly to the Middle East on Tuesday to discuss these and other issues with the company's largest shareholder, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which holds 9 per cent of the shares. They are then due to meet with Tiphook's largest UK institutional shareholder, Scottish Amicable with 5 per cent, on Friday. Tiphook will also be asked to change its remuneration policy for top directors. Some shareholders are concerned that last year's remuneration for Mr Montague and Mr Braidwood, of Pounds 842,000 and more than Pounds 500,000 respectively, are too high for a medium sized company outside the FT-SE 100. Tiphook has four non-executive directors on its nine-man board, including Sir Charles Powell, former private secretary to Mrs Margaret Thatcher. According to stock market analysts, institutional shareholders have been concerned about Tiphook's trading performance and volatile share price since the company's rights issue in 1990. So far this year, TSB, Fidelity and Gartmore have each reduced their shareholdings to below 3 per cent. These shareholders have been replaced largely by US investors, who now hold at least 18.7 per cent through an ADR facility. Some UK institutions have raised the issue of corporate governance with the company in the past, but concern mounted following a profits warning last week. One large shareholder was annoyed that news of the warning may have leaked out into the market early. This led to allegations of insider dealing, which the Stock Exchange is now understood to be investigating.</p>

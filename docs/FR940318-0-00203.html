			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Tire patch adhesives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCF is no longer commonly used in the following adhesive applications where its use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was once widespread:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pressure sensitive adhesives (tapes, labels, etc.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Flexible packaging adhesives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Aerosol-propelled adhesives; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Shoe repair glues and other consumer adhesives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In manufacture of coatings and inks, MCF usage rose steadily throughout the 1980s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principally because of the VOC problems with other solvents. It began declining in the early  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1990s because of the ozone depletion issue. In 1989, the consumption of MCF used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coatings and inks was 18,480 MT, six percent of the total 310,000 MT of MCF consumed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S. The 1991 consumption in the coatings and inks sector was estimated to be 23,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MT. This consumption figure has likely declined even more for the same reasons as cited in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the adhesives section. MCF is the only ozone-depleting substance currently used in coatings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and inks formulations. As with uses in adhesives, MCF has replaced some of the applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in coatings and inks which previously used VOC solvents and now the trend is reversing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current use of MCF in coatings and inks applications occurs in four use areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Flexographic and rotogravure printing inks;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Wood stains;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Metal coatings; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Aerospace coatings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Substitutes in the Adhesives, Coatings, and Inks Sector  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Methyl chloroform-based adhesives, coatings, and inks can be replaced by either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute solvents or alternative application technologies. In most instances, the alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are expected to perform as well as products containing MCF. Factors that determine which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular alternative is best in a given situation include physical and chemical properties,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement chemical costs, capital investment costs, and product performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary substitutes to replace methyl chloroform in adhesives, coatings, and inks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Petroleum hydrocarbons;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Oxygenated organic solvents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ketones, esters, ethers, alcohols);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Chlorinated solvents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Terpenes;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Water-based formulations;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;High-solids formulation; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Alternative process alternatives;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Powder formulations; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Hot melts; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Thermoplastic plasma spray coatings; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Radiation cured; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Moisture cured; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Chemical cured; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Reactive liquids.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These substitutes can be grouped into four basic categories: Solvent substitutes, water-based formulations, high-solids formulations, and alternative processes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Solvent substitutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petroleum hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons fractionated from the distillation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum. These compounds are loosely grouped into paraffins (six carbon chains to ten  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon chains_hexane, heptane, etc.) and light aromatics (toluene and xylene), and come in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various levels of purity. These compounds have good solvent properties, cost about half as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much as MCF, and are readily available from chemical distributors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oxygenated organic solvents such as alcohols, ketones, ethers, and esters dissolve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wide range of polar and semi-polar substances. These compounds are relatively inexpensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compared to MCF (about half the cost) and are readily available. They function well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvents and dissolve most resins and binders used in adhesives, coatings, and inks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chlorinated solvents such as perchloroethylene and methylene chloride are chlorinated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrocarbons. These chemicals can be used to replace MCF used in adhesives, coatings and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inks. These solvents are commercially available from chemical distributors at prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparable to those for methyl chloroform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chlorinated solvent compounds are chemically similar to MCF and thus are able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitute directly for MCF with minor changes in the formulation of the product; product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality is expected to remain unchanged. Manufacturers can use chlorinated solvents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing equipment with minor changes, resulting in low capital costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

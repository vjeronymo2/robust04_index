			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Budapest, February 21 (MTI) -- "Our talks focussed  on laying new foundations for bilateral economic relations,"  Foreign Ministers Andrey Kozyrev of Russia and Geza Jeszenszky  of Hungary told journalists at their joint press conference  following talks in Budapest on Monday [21 February].    Indicating the importance of bilateral economic relations,  Jeszenszky said Russia is currently Hungary's second most  important trade partner, while Hungary is in 8th place among  Russia's economic partners. The signing of new economic  agreements, most probably this spring, is in the interest of  both countries, they said.    Kozyrev said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is  preparing to visit Hungary. He and the Hungarian prime minister  will sign the new agreements, including ones on investment  protection and the elimination of double taxation.    Discussions were also held on important issues involving  Europe. Jeszenszky said European integration is of fundamental  importance for Hungary, and the primary emphasis is not on  becoming members in individual institutions. In other words,  the first priority is not for Hungary to become a member of  NATO. The Euro-Atlantic organizations are of equal importance  for Hungary. However, Hungary calls for accelerating the CSCE  process.    The Balkan crisis was an important topic of discussion. They  had no major differences in the evaluation of this, the foreign  ministers said.    Minority issues, which are of utmost importance from the  point of view of Europe's future, were also discussed.  Jeszenszky said the two countries follow common principles in  this, as was expressed in the joint statement issued during the  visit of President Yeltsin to Hungary in November 1992.    As regards cultural relations, Jeszenszky said it is  important for church dignitaries to also hold regular meetings.  He noted that Russian Orthodox Patriarch Aleksey II will be  visiting Budapest shortly.    The Russian foreign minister said he hopes the new Russian  Parliament will ratify the Hungarian-Russian basic agreement,  including the paragraph condemning the 1956 Soviet intervention  in Hungary.    With respect to the CSCE summit to be held in Budapest at  the  end of the year, the foreign ministers said a genuinely  effective mechanism for creation of peace and the protection of  national minorities should be worked out, whether it be in the  Baltic regions or elsewhere.    In answer to questions on NATO's Peace Partnership plan,  Jeszenszky said the existence of international forces that are  capable of deterring anyone from aggression is an important  element of the programme, in the spirit of conflict-preventive  diplomacy.    Kozyrev stated flatly that Moscow will not give in to  nationalistic pressure. "We have no hegemonistic, aggressive  efforts, we are ready for friendship," he said.    The main point of Yeltsin's foreign policy is that Russia  wants to create a "good-neighbour zone" with all countries with  which it has historical, spiritual, human relations and economic  interest connections, he said.    Kozyrev added Russia is ready for cooperation in the  framework of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council and the  Peace Partnership. He said he will use his current tour to  disperse the anxieties related to the Russian threat. In his  view, a democratic Europe should unite against nationalism.    With respect to the Bosnian crisis, Kozyrev said the most  important point is to create an administrative control zone for  the withdrawal and the cease-fire, and to somehow ensure  conditions for peaceful life. Kozyrev mentioned Mostar and  Tuzla being among new security zones.    However, the long-term goal is to settle the Bosnian  situation itself. In this process, Moscow particularly counts  on the participation of the United States, the European Union  and Germany, he stated.</p>

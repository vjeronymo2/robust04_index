			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Kaa Eneberg report: "Proposal for Nordic Union Raised Too </F> Early"]    [Text] Ytterjarna -- A Nordic league with a common  security policy and good relations with the European Union [EU].  This could be the alternative the Green Ecology Party offers  the voters in this fall's election instead of Swedish EU  membership.    The delegates, however, rejected such a proposal at the  party's congress that ended in Ytterjarna yesterday.    Instead, the party executive was given the task of looking  into deeper Nordic cooperation as one of several alternatives to  the EU.    The investigation will be headed by party pioneer Asa  Domeij.  For personal reasons this party superstar has chosen not to  remain on the party executive or run in the Riksdag election.  But the party leadership was swift to seize on her promise to  continue to work for the party. It is expected that with her at  the head of this sensitive work there will not be much unrest in  the party ranks.    One godparent of the idea of a confederation of the Nordic  states is Armed Forces Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson,  another is Johan Galtung. As an established green politician  and EU critic, the Norwegian peace researcher had been invited  to the congress. He outlined 10 alternatives to EU membership  and dismissed as lunacy any suggestion that Sweden would be able  to remain neutral as an EU member.    Norway's tiny Green party is as categorically EU critical as  the Green Ecology Party, which describes itself as the only  party in Swedish politics with 100-percent support for  opposition to the EU.    Birger Schlaug, the Green Ecology Party's "mouthpiece," took  the defeat at the party congress calmly, as did Per Gahrton, who  heads the party's massive opposition to the EU.    Birger Schlaug pointed out that the idea of a Nordic league  is by no means new and that these ideas have been given further  nourishment by Supreme Commander Bengt Gustafsson.    The supreme commander's positive remarks concerning a Nordic  defense league have irritated Prime Minister Carl Bildt. But  Birger Schlaug said proudly that the supreme commander's remarks  in Finland a few months ago came at the right time for the Green  Ecology Party. Bengt Gustafsson has even been invited to a  meeting of the party executive to expand on his remarks.    At what otherwise was a harmonious congress that ended here  yesterday at the anthroposophists' impressive headquarters, the  proposal for a Nordic league was the only notable defeat for the  party executive. The proposal was thought to be too  far-reaching, involving a common currency and security policy,  for the congress' taste.    "There can never be any suggestion of a mini-EU. That is  something we do not want. Instead we want a confederation of  states in which every state retains its sovereignty and is in  favor of increased involvement in the UN of which all countries  are members. A certain amount of supranationality is possible,  in the field of environmental threats that cross national  boundaries," Per Gahrton explained.    Both the party's "mouthpieces," like the majority of  delegates, were satisfied with the party congress that had  clearly been kept in its place in order not to jeopardize the  election campaign. Everyone is hoping, and expecting, a return  to the Riksdag this fall on a 5.5-percent share of the vote.    One sign of the efforts not to create convulsions or  personal conflicts in the party was that only a few opted to  vote for changes to the role of the "mouthpieces." Calls for  changes were to be found in a number of motions that had  received the backing of the party executive. But the party  executive had clearly become frightened and rejected these  motions. This happened at the last minute before the congress  so that there was time to add corrections only to some of the  conference material.    One motion calling for the immediate appointment of a party  leader received only a weak defense from its proposer, Bo  Thunell.    The party executive's Ewa Larsson advocated that the party  should retain its two "mouthpieces" using the argument that the  party has always been a "pathfinder" and that other parties are  now beginning to copy this model. She did not mention New  Democracy, with its two leaders. She did mention, however, the  more active role of Social Democrats and party secretary Mona  Sahlin as an example of an attempt to follow in the footsteps of  the Green Ecology Party.    "We are in agreement in the party and no longer have any  personal conflicts," Birger Schlaug said by way of summing up.    Veteran Eva Goes chose, however, to go home halfway through  the congress and decline reelection to the party executive  without telling anyone other then the party election committee.  In the past she shared the "mouthpiece" role with Birger  Schlaug, but there has at times been open confrontation between  the two.    Former "mouthpiece" Jan Axelsson tried to create a little  more unrest by writing articles critical of Birger Schlaug's  leadership methods and trumpeting his resignation from the party  in a press statement. However, Eva Goes is staying. But with  the lower profile for these two, the group of "fundamentalists"  in the party is thought to have shrunk.    "I hope that not all the fundamentalists will disappear.  They are needed. I myself am a fundamentalist, but a realistic  one," Per Gahrton joked before leaving the congress.    The party congress gave its backing to a proposal that in  the  next parliamentary period the party should work for a 35-hour  workweek. An allergy cleanup program was also adopted. This is  seen as an argument against EU membership because, according to  the party executive, it is hardly likely to meet with much  sympathy in Brussels.    Using equality as an argument, a call for the formation of a  women's organization was rejected.</p>

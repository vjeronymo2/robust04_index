			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Prize winner in motorway safety Safer motorway crash barriers have been developed from a rope technology originally designed for restraining landing aircraft on aircraft carriers. The Brifen four-rope safety fence has won the 1992 Prince Michael road safety award for technical innovation for its developer, Bridon Ropes, of Doncaster. The system comprises four ropes each made from 21 wires of high tensile carbon steel which individually can lift the weight of a typical saloon car. The ropes are woven between posts which collapse upon impact, absorbing the kinetic impact of the vehicle. Bridon Ropes: UK, 0302 382412.</p>

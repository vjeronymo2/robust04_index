			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> MIDEAST CRISIS HITS HOME;  </P> <P> ENERGY;  </P> <P> GAS PRICES RISE AS OUTLOOK FOR OIL DIMINISHES;  </P> <P> EFFECTS: COST FOR A BARREL OF CRUDE ON THE MARKET REACHES A FIVE-YEAR HIGH. IN  CALIFORNIA, CONSUMERS ARE FINDING INCREASES OF UP TO 15 CENTS PER GALLON AT THE  SERVICE STATION.  </P> <P> Oil prices reached their highest levels in five years Monday and gasoline  prices continued to spurt upward as uncertainty in the wake of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait fueled fears of shortages.  </P> <P> Prices could go as high as $40 or $50 per barrel if a worldwide embargo  succeeds in eliminating Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil from world supplies, analysts  added.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract price of the  benchmark U.S. crude oil grade, West Texas Intermediate, continued its  stratospheric climb, closing Monday at $28.05 a barrel, up $3.56.  </P> <P> It brought the price of the crude grade to near its all-time high of $30.15,  reached in 1984 during the Iran-Iraq war.  </P> <P> "Prices are moving further and faster than any of us have given them credit,"  said Peter Beutel, a trader with Merrill Lynch Futures in New York.  </P> <P> At the gasoline pump, the average cost of self-serve unleaded gasoline jumped  7.1 cents per gallon over the weekend, the American Automobile Assn. said  Monday. In California, some areas reported price increases of 12 to 15 cents  per gallon, the association said.  </P> <P> The increases were the fastest since those in the two-week period following the  March, 1989, oil spill in Alaska, when prices rose nearly 12 cents a gallon,  the association said.  </P> <P> The AAA's Fuel Gauge Report, which is based on a spot check of 1,400 service  stations around the nation, showed self-serve unleaded gasoline averaging  $1.186 per gallon nationally, up from $1.115 on Friday and $1.075 on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The price hikes were driven largely by fear and market psychology, as well as  by demand to beef up oil inventories, even though current stocks of oil remain  ample, analysts said.  </P> <P> Prices could go even higher if real shortages develop as feared. Experts say  prices easily could peak at $40 to $50 a barrel before demand would fall  sharply. An increase of oil prices to $40 per barrel could boost the price of  gasoline by 25 to 60 cents per gallon.  </P> <P> All guesses would go out the window if a shooting war breaks out in the Persian  Gulf, or if Iraq invades Saudi Arabia. "You'd be in uncharted waters," said one  economist.  </P> <P> Shortages could develop under the move by virtually all major consuming nations  -- and a vote Monday by the U.N. Security Council -- to bar imports of Iraqi  oil. If strictly enforced, a worldwide embargo would eliminate from world  supplies Iraq and Kuwait's combined oil production of 4 million to 5 million  barrels per day.  </P> <P> That likely would push up prices to $30 per barrel in the next two or three  weeks, barring some action to counteract the shortfall. Gasoline prices could  be expected to follow, increasing by 2 to 5 cents per gallon for every $1 per  barrel increase in crude.  </P> <P> Such an embargo would likely require a military blockade of Iraqi ports and  pipelines that cross Turkey and Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> The embargo is already having an effect: Iraq shut down one of its twin oil  pipelines running through Turkey to the Mediterranean on Monday, and curtailed  flow through the other, in the face of dwindling demand for its oil.  </P> <P> Price shocks would be dampened if other oil producing countries take up the  slack. But the Middle East Economic Survey, a weekly newsletter, reported that  current excess capacity by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  Countries amounted to only 3.5 million barrels of oil a day.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, President Bush so far seems unwilling to tap the United States'  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, whose 590 million barrels would provide 3.5  million barrels a day of oil for about 170 days. Energy Department officials  said over the weekend that the SPR was not intended to be a "pricing  mechanism."  </P> <P> Oil prices, experts said, would go off the chart if Iraqi President Saddam  Hussein invades Saudi Arabia, provoking a military response from the United  States.  </P> <P> "Picture a car speeding along at 65 m.p.h. in a foggy tunnel, where you know  there's a brick wall ahead of you somewhere, but you just aren't sure where,"  Beutel said. "That's what we're dealing with."  </P></p>

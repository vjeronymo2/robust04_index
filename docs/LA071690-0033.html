			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CANYONS SEEN AS DUMPS -- OR AS PARKLAND;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: COMPETITION IS GROWING BETWEEN THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS  CONSERVANCY AND THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS, TWO AGGRESSIVE  AGENCIES WITH CONFLICTING PURPOSES.  </P> <P> To some people, deep canyons are refuges for wildlife, buffers against sprawl,  places to take a hike. To others, they are ideally suited to provide a basic  service as receptacles for trash.  </P> <P> This conflict of needs and values has spurred a land rush between two  aggressive public agencies with vastly different goals. One is the Los Angeles  County Sanitation Districts, which disposes of waste water and trash for 78  cities in the county, and now is prospecting in the Santa Clarita and northern  San Fernando valleys for remote canyons to use as landfill sites.  </P> <P> The other is the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state parks agency that  covets some of the same real estate for parks and trails.  </P> <P> "It's a lot like a race and frankly, I hope the conservancy wins," said  Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar).  </P> <P> "It seems like everywhere we go, they show up," said Joe Haworth Jr., a  Sanitation Districts spokesman. Because parks and landfills both "involve open  space, we're bound to bump into each other sooner or later," he said.  </P> <P> Lately they've been bumping into each other with regularity, which could prove  a political problem for the smaller and less potent conservancy.  </P> <P> The conservancy's collision with the districts could affect an ambitious  proposal to raise money for improving county parks, beaches and museums. The  proposed $816-million bond issue includes about $90 million for the  conservancy, and county supervisors must decide by early next month whether to  put it on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Angered by the turf battle, Supervisor Deane Dana has insisted that there be  language in the measure barring the conservancy from spending bond funds for  land wanted by the districts. Even if that restriction is included, Dana has  not said whether he will support putting the proposal before voters.  </P> <P> The fallout has spread to Sacramento, where the conservancy and its legislative  allies recently were forced to scale back trail-building plans under pressure  from the districts.  </P> <P> At issue was a proposed expansion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor, including  lands surrounding Elsmere and Towsley canyons, both potential landfill sites in  the Santa Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The corridor is a zone in the local mountains where the conservancy has  authority to create horse and hiking trails. It has no power to restrict  landfills or other projects there. Still, the districts feared the corridor  designation could be ammunition for anti-dump forces in future landfill siting  battles. Areas around Towsley and Elsmere were dropped to avoid risking a  legislative committee veto of the expansion.  </P> <P> But the conservancy's efforts to acquire land sought by the districts have won  kudos from many officials, particularly those facing the prospect of new  landfills in their jurisdictions. "People . . . are going to be desperate for  recreational land in this growing county," said Carl Boyer III, a city  councilman in Santa Clarita, where officials fear environmental damage if  landfills are developed. "I think the conservancy has basically done their best  under a very, very tough situation."  </P> <P> The Sanitation Districts "have never seen a canyon that they didn't want to  fill up with trash," said Hunt Braly, chief of staff for Sen. Ed Davis (R-Santa  Clarita). As for the conservancy, "they continue to do an exemplary job," said  Braly.  </P> <P> Despite their skirmishing, sanitation and conservancy officials speak of each  other with a measure of respect.  </P> <P> "I don't have any desire to try to characterize what they're doing," said  Donald S. Nellor, chief of planning and engineering for the districts' solid  waste management department. "They're a public agency attempting to fulfill  their mandate . . . and so are we," he said.  </P> <P> "Rare in government, they have long-term objectives," said Joseph T. Edmiston,  executive director of the conservancy, referring to the Sanitation Districts.  "Unfortunately, their goals were pretty much decided in the late '50s," he  said.  </P> <P> The districts plan to create at least two big landfills from among four  candidate sites: Elsmere, Towsley and Blind canyons in the Santa Susana  Mountains above Chatsworth, and Mission-Rustic-Sullivan, a network of three  canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Due to objections by conservationists and influential Westside residents, the  canyons in the Santa Monicas are almost untouchable, which has increased  pressure on Elsmere, Towsley and Blind.  </P> <P> An environmental impact report on the suitability of the four sites will not  appear in draft form until at least next month. But the districts have wasted  no time in trying to lock up all of the land they can.  </P> <P> For their part, conservancy officials say they are out to preserve parks, not  block landfills. However, their pursuit of that goal appears to have knocked  the Blind Canyon site out of contention.  </P> <P> In April, the conservancy stunned the Sanitation Districts by reaching an  agreement with entertainer Bob Hope to purchase his 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch, of  which Blind Canyon is a part. Conservancy officials said the acquisition  preserves a vital wildlife corridor linking animal populations in the Santa  Susanas, Simi Hills and Santa Monica Mountains.  </P> <P> Sanitation Districts officials had been negotiating with Hope for years and are  thought to have offered substantially more than the below-market $10 million  the conservancy will pay. The deal is contingent on approval of a big golf and  residential project on Hope's Jordan Ranch property in eastern Ventura County.  But for now at least, Blind Canyon is beyond the Sanitation Districts' reach.  </P> <P> However, the districts have the upper hand at Towsley on the other side of the  Santa Susanas. They have optioned about 900 acres in Towsley, while the  conservancy -- which wants Towsley for the proposed Santa Clarita Woodlands  State Park -- has been unable to obtain land in the canyon proper.  </P> <P> However, the conservancy has acquired 145 acres near the mouth of the canyon,  in effect blocking the best access road for trash trucks.  </P> <P> "They are in the way of what we believe to be probably the most suitable  access," said Nellor, adding that an alternative access route is possible.  </P> <P> The competition between the agencies began last year over the other two sites,  Elsmere and the Santa Monica Mountains canyons. Los Angeles city and county  officials were negotiating creation of a landfill at Elsmere, to be run by the  Sanitation Districts. The conservancy did not try to snap up the Elsmere site,  but insisted that the destruction of Elsmere be mitigated by transferring to  conservancy ownership the three canyons in the Santa Monicas, which are owned  by the county and the districts.  </P> <P> The conservancy joined forces with BKK Corp., a private waste disposal firm  that held land and options at Elsmere, in an effort to enhance each party's  bargaining strength. BKK ultimately accepted a lucrative buyout offer from the  city and county. The city and county, however, also agreed to preserve at least  two of the canyons in the Santa Monicas if Elsmere becomes a landfill.  </P> <P> Larry Berg, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC, said the  conflict suggests the need for regional government to resolve land-use  conflicts. "You've got to have landfills and . . . you need parks as well," he  said. Following their legal mandates, both agencies are "looking to solve one  of these problems and not all of them," Berg said.  </P> <P> At the same time, according to Berg, area sanitation officials have been slow  to inaugurate recycling and waste-reduction programs, thus aggravating the  problem. "They've got to get far more aggressive in trying . . . to cut this  waste stream drastically," Berg said. "They never really liked to do that, and  I understand that it's difficult, but come on, this is a new world."  </P> <P> At the headquarters of the Sanitation Districts in Whittier, however, the word  is that recycling is not a magic wand to make the problem vanish. There will  always be stuff left over, Nellor says, and hence a need for landfills.  </P> <P> Through a window in his office looms a towering terrace of trash. It is the  districts' Puente Hills landfill -- one of the two largest landfills in the  country and a good backdrop for a gloomy scenario.  </P> <P> By late 1991, Nellor said, trash could be piling up on sidewalks. This could  happen if expansion of existing public and private landfills, including  Sunshine Canyon above Granada Hills, is not approved. Remaining dumps will  still have years of capacity, but with fewer sites available, trash trucks  could face long lines and collection could become less regular.  </P> <P> Over the long haul, Nellor said, a state law requiring at least 50% of waste to  be diverted from landfills by the year 2000 should help out a lot. Even so, he  said, population growth and shrinking dump capacity require at least one new  landfill by the year 2000 and another by 2010.  </P> <P> It is not the most popular work, Nellor acknowledged. "I think it's obvious  that park development is an easier type of project to implement than the public  service provided by a landfill," he said.  </P> <P> "We need parks. We need places to dispose of our refuse," he said, "and the  same people that need the parks produce the refuse that needs to be disposed  of."  </P> <P> A lean, cautious engineer, Nellor's personal style, along with his mission,  contrasts with that of the more free-wheeling and passionate Edmiston.  </P> <P> On a recent sweltering afternoon, Edmiston four-wheeled into Towsley Canyon,  bumping along a rutted road to a point where the high canyon walls narrow to a  gorge.  </P> <P> "This is a breathing space, OK?" he said. "We're giving future generations an  option about what to do. If this canyon is filled in the next five years, there  won't be an option in 30 years to decide."  </P> <P> Besides, it is not his job to back off "so that people can throw away as many  McDonald's . . . containers" as they want "and not worry about it," Edmiston  said. "That lifestyle has been pretty much discredited."  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN LOSES DAVILA FOR THE SEASON;  </P> <P> COLLEGE SOCCER: DEFENDER SUFFERS SECOND FRACTURE IN RIGHT LEG IN AS MANY YEARS.  </P> <P> Three days after celebrating his recovery from a leg fracture by scoring the  first and only goal in Cal State Northridge's brief Division I soccer history,  Teddy Davila is out for the season after again sustaining a broken leg.  </P> <P> With two minutes remaining in Monday's 2-0 loss to UC Santa Barbara, Davila, a  sophomore defender, collided with a Gaucho player in a race for the ball. Pain  shot through his right shin but the former Reseda High standout did not think  it was serious.  </P> <P> After the game, as a precautionary measure, Davila was taken to Kaiser  Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills by his brother and teammate Terry, and  his father Tony, a CSUN assistant soccer coach.  </P> <P> X-rays revealed a partial break that will require a walking cast once the  swelling goes down. It is not as serious as the multiple fracture Davila  suffered in a game last October that restricted him to a hip-to-toe cast on his  right leg and initially bound him to a wheelchair.  </P> <P> Doctors will check Davila for a calcium deficiency, but they don't believe that  was the cause.  </P> <P> "The break had completely healed," Davila said. "They told me it would have  happened no matter what."  </P> <P> "I'm shocked, really," Davila said. "It stinks. I hate sitting out another  year. Last year was probably the worst time of my life.  </P> <P> "It's so hard watching and now they are going on these trips to Portland  (University of Portland on Saturday and at Oregon State on Sunday) and Indiana  (Evansville tournament Sept. 28-30)."  </P> <P> CSUN Coach Marwan Ass'ad said he immediately will request a medical redshirt  for Davila.  </P> <P> "I'm going to take it to court if I don't get it," Davila said. "That would be  even more disappointing."  </P> <P> Davila should qualify because he has appeared in only 9.5% of CSUN's matches.  An NCAA official said that players who appear in less than 20% of their matches  are eligible for a redshirt.  </P> <P> "I feel so badly for the kid," Ass'ad said. "He was having so much fun. . . .  We have so much respect and sympathy and empathy for him. We will miss him."  </P></p>

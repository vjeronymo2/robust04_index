			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Brierley set to sell 28% holding in publisher Brierley Investments, the New Zealand based hotels and investment company, said yesterday it would sell a 28 per cent stake in newspaper publisher Wilson and Horton, but only if Wilson and Horton could find a suitable buyer willing to pay the right price. Brierley said in a statement it had told the Wilson and Horton board that it acquired its 28 per cent stake in the company early (in November) . . . with the intention of becoming a 'long-term, supportive shareholder'. However, 'the board of Wilson and Horton considers it would be in the best interests of the company to have a media industry participant as a strategic shareholder.' Brierley's purchase of a stake in Wilson and Horton, costing NZDollars 280m (USDollars 177m), prompted speculation about an imminent takeover bid. Horton family interests, which control the company, subsequently maintained they had sufficient support to block any bid by Brierley for the newspaper group. Instead, Brierley has agreed to sell its holding in Wilson and Horton if a buyer can be found willing to pay a price that reflects the 'strategic value' of its stake. 'In the light of the Wilson and Horton board's view, Brierley is allowing Wilson and Horton an opportunity to identify a suitable purchaser for its holding,' Brierley said. A number of overseas media industry participants have already expressed an interest in buying the stake, Brierley said, and discussions were continuing with these, and other, prospective buyers. Wilson and Horton directors initially accepted Brierley as the new majority shareholder, but subsequently reversed this position in a campaign led by its chief executive, Mr Michael Horton, a great grandson of the founder of the 127-year-old company, and his son, Matthew, the business editor of a Murdoch-controlled Australian tabloid, the Telegraph Mirror. The prospect of another bid for Wilson and Horton surfaced late last week when a mystery bidder bought 3.6 per cent from UK shareholders for NZDollars 36m. Both Brierley and Wilson and Horton, who between them control more than 50 per cent of the shares, say they do not know the identity of this buyer. On the New Zealand stock exchange yesterday, Brierley's shares closed down 1 cent at NZDollars 1.17 Wilson and Horton's were unchanged at NZDollars 9.15.</p>

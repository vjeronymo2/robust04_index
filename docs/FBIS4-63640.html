			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 97 (587) </F> compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy and edited by  Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] In President Heydar Aliyev's words, the Azerbaijani  leadership persistently continues to search for peace in  Karabakh.    As he has reported at a meeting with refugees from that  region, "consultations are underway with CSCE and Russian  leaders on a reliable ceasefire and measures to eliminate the  aftermaths of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict."    On the opposition's reaction to Azerbaijan's signing of the  Bishkek protocol, Aliyev declared: "The leadership did the  right thing, having signed the accord. For Baku, the protocol  meant only one thing -- a ceasefire."    At the same time, he criticized opposition lawmakers for  deserting parliament a few days ago and for trying to hold a  rally in Baku on Saturday. "Instead of organizing rallies and  other mass protests, political parties should consult  authorities and be in close touch with them," he stressed.    IF Note: Azerbaijan's National Resistance Movement, which  includes 14 opposition parties, planned a rally on the Freedom  Square in Baku on Saturday in protest against a possible  introduction of Russian or CIS troops in Azerbaijan as a force  that would disengage the Armenian and Azerbaijani troops.  Nearly one hour before the start of the gathering, the whole  square was sealed off by up to 1000 policemen, who beat people  who were on their way to the square with truncheons. By eye  witnesses accounts, scores of protesters were detained and  driven by police vans away to an unknown destination.    Aliyev reported that lots of cables and telephone calls had  been coming in the last few days from people across the  republic, mainly in areas near the front, asking to let them  come to Baku to crush the opposition.    He said the opposition should not fear Russian military  presence in the republic. "Russian troops will not be  introduced in Azerbaijan", he assured.  IF Note: The deployment of a peace force in Karabakh is  envisaged by a protocol, discussed at a meeting in Moscow last  week by the Karabakh Army Commander, the defence ministers of  Armenia and Azerbaijan and their Russian opposite number who  acted as a mediator at that conference. All but the Azerbaijani  ministers signed the document. Baku links its signing to the  conclusion of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement in  Karabakh, providing for the liberation of the captured  Azerbaijan lands, the return of refugees, and regional economy  reconstruction.    Talking to an Interfax correspondent, a spokesman for the  National Independence Party (led by Etibar Mamedov) Rauf  Mirgadyrov suggested that "by his statement Aliyev has in fact  made it impossible to come to terms with the opposition."</p>

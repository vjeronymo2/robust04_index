			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Technology: Information on the fast track - Worth Watching Companies which shift large amounts of voice, data and video traffic between offices are now offered a more efficient way of sending the information - ATM (asynchronous transfer mode). Whereas in the past large amounts of data had to be sent in parcels of pre-determined size, ATM enables data to be sent in the most effective way. So, video-conferencing could be allocated a pre-determined chunk of capacity on the line for the period the service was needed and then the other voice and data calls slotted in as needed. Netcomm, of Basildon, has launched its DV2 ATM switch to allocate capacity on these large networks. The device will be sold in the US by Netcomm's partner, General Datacomm. Netcomm: UK, 0268 534228. PictureTel, of Boston, Massachusetts, has launched a low-cost, colour, video- conferencing terminal which can be wheeled from office to office and plugged in at any socket which offers ISDN business phone services. The units cost Pounds 15,600 each, and more sophisticated functions can be added at extra cost. PictureTel: US, 508 762 5000; UK, 0753 673000.</p>

Bela Kadar, Hungary's minister of international economic  relations, noted that Japan recently offered 1 billion yen to  support environmental programs in the Eastern European region.    Kadar, who is promoting Hungary's transition from a command  economy to a free market structure, visited Japan to attend a  conference on Japan-U.S. aid to former Soviet satellite  countries.    Kadar said at a press meeting in Tokyo that Eastern European  countries are small and their economies are heavily dependent on  a stable global economy. "The relationship between Japan and  the U.S. is very important from such a viewpoint."    He said that former Soviet bloc countries "must clean up the  environment, otherwise they cannot hope to attract foreign  investors," Kadar said.</p>

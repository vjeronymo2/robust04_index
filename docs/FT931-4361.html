			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Ford attacks Japanese rivals: UK job losses blamed on 'transplant factories' as staff back strike JAPANESE motor companies with plants in Britain were partially blamed yesterday by Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK's chairman and managing director, for his company's threat to make compulsory redundancies. His strong attack, in written evidence to the House of Commons employment committee, coincided with a vote yesterday by Ford's white-collar staff to authorise a strike if compulsory redundancies go ahead. Leaders of manual unions meet Ford management today to discuss how compulsory redundancies will affect their members. If Ford refuses to back down, the manual unions are also expected to ballot for strike action. Mr McAllister told MPs: 'With the growing presence of Japanese transplant assembly facilities in Britain operating with the advantages of a greenfield site and extremely low levels of engineering and manufacturing integration, it should not be surprising that an established company such as Ford must shed labour to ensure its future competitiveness and prosperity.' He warned of future job losses in the UK motor industry be-cause of Japanese companies, ac-cusing them of 'creating excess capacity which, given a market of finite size, is likely to displace equivalent jobs in existing producers', as well as 'having generally lower local content levels which displaces jobs at both manufacturers and suppliers'. He said: 'Their products and components are wholly designed and developed in Japan and must give rise to real concerns for the UK's technological base.' Mr McAllister said that in what he called the 'Japanese transplant factories', the 'integration levels for design and manufacture are significantly below those of established producers'. Under questioning from MPs, he warned of the danger of a technological brain-drain to Japan. 'Within a few years, the technical expertise which exists today in the UK supply base may no longer be capable of supporting the long-range research and development requirements of the motor industry. The suppliers will become no more than 'makers' of Japanese design parts.' In oral evidence to MPs, Ford's senior management said 262 more staff jobs had to go by April 16, of 2,100 called for in December while 318 more manual workers were required to accept voluntary redundancy out of the 1,180 originally needed. This suggests Ford might reach its manpower cut target without the need for compulsory redundancies. In the ballot of Ford's 10,000 white-collar staff at its 21 UK plants, 50 per cent of 6,500 members of the Manufacturing, Scientific and Finance Union voted - 64 per cent supporting the strike call. The vote among white-collar members of the TGWU general union was much narrower - 53 per cent were ready to back a strike. Staff union officials will meet Ford on March 23 to discuss the issue.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Fishing votes - Ballot Box Labour is pitching for the angling vote. David Clark, the party's agriculture spokesman, left a press conference in Cardiff and headed straight for a meeting in Brecon with the local angling society. 'Britain's 3m anglers will have a key role to help improve water quality and monitor pollution,' he told them. Clark is pro-fishing but anti-hunting. Killing fish is a sport, he said, but hunting is 'cruelty'. Was he not for one sort of killing, and against the other, because more Labour voters are to be found on river banks? 'Only a cynic would accuse me of vote-catching,' he said.</p>

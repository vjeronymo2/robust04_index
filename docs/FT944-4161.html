			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / SG Warburg and Morgan Stanley: Consummation could spark further marriages - The background to the investment banking industry's biggest leap yet The birth of the international investment banking industry has not proceeded smoothly in the past 15 years. Many initiatives have proved disastrous - the ill-fatedmoves by US commercial banks like Citicorp and Chase Manhattan into the London stockmarket in the mid-1980s, for instance. But the proposed combination of Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg would be the industry'sbiggest leap yet. A consummation of the deal could also spark mergers and acquisitions among other investment and commercial banks, according to industry executives and analysts. The growth of international investment and cross-border takeovers - and a general belief that, given the heavy costs involved, there is only room for a small number of banks with global reach - lie behind the move. 'There are likely to be only a handful of banks dominating international capital flows,' says Mr William Hartman, until recently a New York-based investment banking analyst with JP Morgan. 'They want to get a headstart on the rest of the world.' The logic in combining a US and a European bank has been apparent for some time, and has led to serious debate in recent years. UBS is understood to have discussed a takeover of Lehman Brothers, but backed off partly out of a concern about the culture clash that might result from absorbing a pushy US investment bank. Barclays revealed recently that it is looking to expand in the US, either through an association or by takeover. Warburg's name has frequently been linked in takeover rumours with JP Morgan, the US bank which was forced to part with Morgan Stanley by the 1933 Glass Steagall Act. There are some obvious reasons why Morgan Stanley and Warburg might consider the timing for such a deal is finally right. First, international capital flows - and in particular overseas investment from the US - have picked up fast in the past two years. Wall Street's so-called 'bulge bracket' firms, long used to making their profits in the US markets, have found that the trading technology and skills developed in the US can be exported profitably to other markets. Morgan Stanley is estimated to be making around 60 per cent of its profits overseas. Second, recent poor results at Warburg have highlighted a strategic dilemma the bank has faced for some time. Though generally acknowledged as the leading home-grown investment bank in the UK, it has lacked both the capital base and the trading skills - particularly in the bond and derivatives markets - to compete internationally with its bigger US rivals. The US banks, meanwhile, have invested a large slice of what until this year were strong domestic profits in building their international presence. This has resulted in a massive build-up of resources by US banks in London in recent years: Morgan Stanley, for instance, employs nearly 2,000 people in Europe's financial centre. The third explanation for the timing resides in Morgan Stanley's own financial position. In common with its main rivals, the bank's capital base expanded fast in the early 1990s on the back of record profits. Putting that capital to productive use has become something of a challenge. At the end of last year, Morgan Stanley's shareholders' funds stood at Dollars 4.5bn, half as much again as two years before. With weak financial markets, it has been hard to earn a good return on this bigger capital base  -though at around 10 per cent, the bank's post-tax return on equity still puts it ahead of most competitors this year. Only Merrill, at over 15 per cent, has done better. A big investment overseas would provide Morgan Stanley with a higher profile in more overseas markets. By contrast, the relative weakness of Warburg's capital base and revenue stream has been seen by analysts as one of the factors preventing it competing with US firms. Warburg had shareholders' funds of just over Pounds 1bn at September 30. Although this amount is enough to run existing businesses, it meant it would have had difficulty expanding by acquisition. 'This was inevitable,' said a partner at one of Warburg's US-based competitors. 'They were trying to build an international investment bank without an international bank's revenue base.' For all the success of its UK and European equities business, Warburg found it hard to generate profitsto match the US banks, in what is still a highly fragmented market. 'This says that Warburg believes its strategy is not ever going to succeed,' said the chief executive of one UK-based investment bank which has also pursued an integrated approach, albeit on a more modest scale. 'They had no hope of ever overtaking the Americans in their own backyard,' he added, noting that without a significant sales and trading presence in the US, it is impossible to be a global bank. But the merger also represents a reversal of strategy by Morgan Stanley. Both firms have invested substantial amounts in each other's markets in recent years. Warburg, for instance, has built up a 300-strong US equity business in New York in the past two years, and bought a Chicago-based derivatives company. There are even bigger overlaps in the London operation. Although Morgan Stanley has a far bigger presence in the non-sterling fixed income markets than Warburg, many of the two banks' activities are similar. Referring to London, one person close to the deal says: 'It's obvious where the biggest redundancies are going to be'. However logical the deal, there remain many questions about how effective it would prove in practice. The most prominent: how would the bank be run, and how easily would the two banks' cultures combine? There are considerable challenges in bringing together businesses with different cultures and pay scales. 'It will be a hell of a force if they can pull it off, but the first year or two will be spent sorting out all the places where they are doubled up, and that will divert quite some energy,' said one chief executive of a UK investment bank. Given their respective sizes, it seems inevitable that the new group will be dominated by Morgan Stanley. According to one executive close to the deal, the objective is to integrate the two banks' businesses, rather than to run them as separate geographic entities. This echoes the trend among other investment banks of organising global operations around business lines, such as equities or bonds, rather than around geographic regions. But it would also tend to leave the bigger shareholder in firm control. 'This is not a takeover of Warburg by Morgan Stanley,' says the executive. Some of the enlarged bank's operations may end up being run from outside the US. Indeed, the head of Morgan Stanley's equity business is based in London already, and the bank's board occasionally meets outside the US. But such arrangements will not disguise where the true power in the merged firm lies.</p>

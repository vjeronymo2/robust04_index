			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chilean copper producers braced for fresh storms THE WORLD'S two biggest copper mines, located in Chile's Atacama desert, were bracing themselves for a further spell of bad weather and possible production losses yesterday as storms that lashed central Chile at the weekend moved north. The warming of the cold Humbolt current off Chile's Pacific coast has provoked violent storms in the centre and south of the country and brought rainfall to the Atacama - which is reputed to be the driest desert in the world. The storms have closed Valparaiso, Chile's biggest port, and left 18,000 people homeless. At Chuquicamata, the world's biggest open-pit mine, an official said that three hours of rain last Thursday had caused a slow-down in operations. He denied, however, that mining had come to a halt, as certain news reports suggested. Chuquicamata, owned by the state copper corporation Codelco, produces about 6 per cent of the world's copper - 641,429 tonnes last year. Reports of the alleged shutdown lifted copper prices last Friday. Managers at La Escondida, the second-biggest copper mine in the Atacama desert, said that snow and strong winds had forced miners to adopt extra precautions but that production had not been affected last week. La Escondida, owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ of the UK and a group of Japanese smelting companies, produces the equivalent of 320,000 tonnes a year of refined copper in the form of concentrates.</p>

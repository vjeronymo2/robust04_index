			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Counting the cost of a Dollars 2bn troubleshooter: Eastman Kodak's loss of financial officer Christopher Steffen HE was called 'the Dollars 2bn man'. That was the tag attached to Mr Christopher Steffen in January when this corporate troubleshooter was named chief financial officer of Eastman Kodak, as the appointment sent the company's share price soaring and added more than Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) to its market capitalisation. This Wednesday the magic went into reverse when Mr Steffen quit Kodak after just 11 weeks because of a dispute with the company's management. Wall Street knocked more than Dollars 1.5bn off the company's valuation in a single morning. The stock market had regarded the appointment of Mr Steffen, a man with a reputation for turning around troubled companies, as the most positive sign that insular, conservative Kodak was at last beginning to tackle its deep-seated difficulties. His departure therefore poses a serious credibility problem for the company's board and, in particular, for its chairman, the cautious Mr Kay Whitmore, who has headed Kodak since 1990 and spent 35 years with the company. Can they deliver the shock therapy which many analysts and dissident shareholders believe is necessary, and which Mr Steffen seemed likely to provide? And if not, will yet another proud old giant of American industry, fat and complacent by success, follow the examples of International Business Machines and General Motors and undergo major boardroom bloodletting? The company's earnings and share price record over the past decade has been lacklustre and four restructurings during that time have failed to improve matters. In an era of increasing shareholder militancy, such mediocrity is no longer enough. 'The market thinks the wrong guy resigned,' says Mr Ralph Whitworth, president of the investor activist group United Shareholders Association. Mr Whitmore clearly got more than he bargained for when, under shareholder pressure to inject fresh blood into the business, he lured Mr Steffen from his job as chief financial officer of controls group Honeywell. Mr Steffen, who played key roles in the turnround of Honeywell in 1989-92 and carmaker Chrysler in the mid-1980s, has a reputation for careful, sometimes ruthless cost-cutting and a willingness to divest poorly performing parts of a business. One of his guiding principles is that 'change has to be all-encompassing, all at once'. That evidently did not go down well at cautious Kodak, where he and Mr Whitmore seem to have disagreed over how quickly and extensively to restructure the business. The normally genial Mr Whitmore also seems to have been unhappy at the degree to which the 'Dollars 2bn dollar man' was upstaging him. According to Mr Whitmore, Mr Steffen left 'not because we disagreed on what needs to change, but because we could not agree on the process for making that change happen'. Certainly, Mr Whitmore had begun to set change in motion well before Mr Steffen's arrival - though largely under pressure from shareholders restive at Kodak's recent history. The 104-year-old company, the largest photographic equipment company in the world, was hit in the 1980s by a slowdown in the growth of this 'imaging' market, and fierce competition from companies like the innovative Fuji Photo Film of Japan and America's 3M, which is making inroads into Kodak's market share with inexpensive, store-brand film. For years Kodak wrongly assumed that the slowdown was temporary, and planned accordingly, with a cost structure based on annual revenue growth of 6 per cent to 8 per cent. In a sharp change of stance, Mr Whitmore announced early this year that the company would plan for photographic revenue growth of around 3 per cent a year and 'view the world as it is, and not as we might it to be'. He announced cutbacks in the imaging group's extremely generous research budget. He also ordered extra scrutiny of capital spending and eliminated 2,000 jobs - Kodak's first significant redundancies in years. However, many analysts say the pruning needs to be more radical than this and should involve the sale of some or all of Kodak's other leading businesses, which now account for around two thirds of group sales but only around 40 per cent of income. The most obvious candidate for disposal is Kodak's office copier business, which has annual sales of Dollars 2bn but is losing money. But a more radical management could also consider selling Sterling, a pharmaceuticals company bought for Dollars 5.1bn in 1988 and folded into a joint venture with Sanofi of France two years ago; or Eastman Chemical, a commodity chemical manufacturer which might fetch more than Dollars 4bn; or household products group Lehn and Fink. Analysts say a substantial reduction in Kodak's heavy Dollars 9bn debt burden - much of it taken on for the Sterling acquisition - will require some big asset sales but could leave Kodak as a more sharply focused business, with a substantially higher share price. One of Mr Steffen's declared aims was to cut debt-to-capital ratio from 59 per cent to between 30 and 40 per cent. Mr Whitmore has sold off some peripheral interests, such as Atex, makes computer systems for newspapers. In his Wednesday talk with investors he declined to name the big divestiture being planned. He also said the group's latest restructuring plans would be unveiled by September - a timeframe which may not satisfy militant shareholders looking for more urgent remedies, and who may vent their frustration at next month's annual meeting.</p>

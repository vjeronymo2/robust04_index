			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Putting public finances back in the public eye UNTIL five-year-old Jennifer Bennett captured the headlines last week, the state of Britain's public finances was shaping up as a promising election issue. Allegations of a Pounds 11bn 'hole' in the government's finances and concern that the Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing requirement budgeted for 1992-93 might be an underestimate, fuelled fears of an emergency Budget this summer, irrespective of which party would be in power. But should the state of the public finances give rise to such concern? It is, after all, still less than three weeks since the Treasury's 1992 Budget projections were published. Although the forecast deficits of Pounds 28bn for 1992-93 and Pounds 32bn for 1993-94 upset the City, the government's medium-term projections envisage a steady decline in the PSBR to a modest Pounds 6bn or just 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product in 1996-97. However, in the hot-house atmosphere of the election campaign, the Treasury's PSBR projections already appear old hat. One City commentator, Mr Bill Martin, chief UK economist of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, has gone so far as to suggest that 'there is now more than a whiff of Budgetary crisis in the air'. He believes that next year's Budget will have to incorporate a Pounds 5bn net tax increase and that the PSBR - minus privatisation receipts - could be more than Pounds 50bn in 1993-94 and Pounds 70bn by 1996-97. Mr Martin's is an extreme view. But other commentators have been scaling up their PSBR expectations. Mr Michael Saunders, Salomon Brothers' UK economist in London, forecasts a Pounds 30bn deficit in 1992-93 rising to Pounds 38bn in 1993-94 and 1994-95, before settling back to Pounds 28bn in 1996-97. Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist of Goldman Sachs in London, expects the UK's annual borrowing requirement will stay above 3 per cent of GDP, or about Pounds 20bn in today's money, throughout the life of the next government. The PSBR is notoriously difficult to forecast. The Treasury's own 'Red Book', published on Budget day, shows that the average error of official PSBR forecasts over the past 10 years has been Pounds 6.25bn, or 1 per cent of GDP. Predicting the PSBR has become even more hazardous in recent years. The rapid shift from a Pounds 14.7bn budget surplus in 1988-89 to a deficit of similar ending suggests that its 'cyclicality' has grown, meaning that it is more prone to wild swings in line with changes in business conditions. A big increase in self employment in the 1980s has made income tax receipts more volatile. The changes to corporation tax introduced in the mid-1980s by the then chancellor, Mr Nigel Lawson, have also affected the PSBR. By moving from 100 per cent investment allowances in the first year to 25 per cent allowances on a declining balance depreciation system, Mr Lawson's reform ensured a big increase in corporation tax receipts in the years immediately after its introduction. But companies' allowances have gradually built up since the mid-1980s, diminishing receipts. This trend coincided with the transition from boom to recession that has depressed the profits on which corporation taxes are levied. On the expenditure side, social security outlays have risen more than might be expected from the increase in unemployment during the recession. Government spending on disability and single parent benefits is rising faster than anticipated. There is, however, no reason so far to believe that the tax base has shrunk because of the Lawson tax changes or the recession. Therefore, the wide variation between the assessment of the Treasury and some private sector economists of future PSBR trends has to have another explanation. To some extent, City economists are more sceptical about the ability of the next government to keep public spending under control. A more important consideration is the future path of economic growth. The Treasury's Red Book expects real growth of 2 per cent in the UK in 1992-93 and growth at an annual rate of between 3.25 and 3.75 per cent in the four financial years that follow. Although the growth rates for 1993-94 and after appear ambitious, the length and depth of the recession will mean that average annual growth over the business cycle will almost certainly be below trend. Mr Martin, by contrast, believes that growth is likely to stay below 2 per cent a year in the medium term, because of insufficient productive capacity in the economy that will lead to a severe balance of payments constraint. Mr Martin's analysis is at present a minority view. Certainly nothing since the Budget is likely to have persuaded the Treasury that its assessment of the economy is wrong. It is highly unlikely that officials will be telling the next chancellor that he must have an emergency Budget this summer. But he will be urged to keep a close eye on evolving trends. Away from the hustings, both the Tories and Labour are conscious that their room for manoeuvre in economic policy will be very limited. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has made clear that it could take longer than the next parliament to establish the new 20 pence tax rate as the basic rate of income tax. 'Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, insists that his priority is to get the economy on a sound footing. I'm very keen to see increased social expenditure, but it must be done at the level which we can sustain,' he said last week. Mr Saunders says the winner of the election will be 'on a Budget tightrope' while Mr Davies believes that the next government has 'about a year's grace' to bring borrowing under better control. 'It's not a crisis but it is also not comfortable,' is how Mr Saunders sums up the present state of the public sector's finances. This year's autumn public expenditure round will therefore be very tough for whichever party holds office. Its outcome could determine whether the UK budgetary problems will turn into a crisis.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Andrey Kozyrev and </F> Margaretha af Uglass Meet in Pskov; Negotiations Conducted in  the Context of Russia's Regional Policy"]    [Text]  <H5>  Diplomacy </H5>   The "private setting" of the visit to Pskov of Swedish  Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, where Russian  Minister of Foreign Affairs [MFA] Andrey Kozyrev conducted  negotiations yesterday within the framework of an official trip,  was disturbed by a "newspaper phantom" that appeared the day  before in the Russian media. A Xerox copy of a "directive of the  president of the Russian Federation," which was provided by an  official of the MFA and which came to Smolensk Square from  Latvia and became a startling incident (including if not most of  all for the Russian MFA), directed, "for the purposes of  guaranteeing the security of the Russian Federation and the  states of the Commonwealth" (the Latvian Republic also was on  the list of well-wishers), the dispositioning of military bases  on the territory of the CIS states and Latvia. This directive  from the office of the president became the subject of Andrey  Kozyrev's morning meeting with Russian Minister of Defense Pavel  Grachev, the result of which, it must be assumed, enabled the  diplomat to make the comment: "The appearance of this directive  is very reminiscent of version number 1..." After evaluating the  "newspaper phantom" as an attempt to verify the degree of mutual  understanding between the president and the government, and  between the Russian Ministry of Defense and the MFA, Kozyrev  expressed the view that similar startling events are not able to  influence the style of work of the Russian Foreign Policy  Department. The negotiations with Swedish Minister of Foreign  Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas, he said, are occurring within the  context of the regional policy of Russia, just like the  creation, with Russia's well-known efforts, of the Baltic Sea  States Council and the "Barents-Council." Given the  participation in the negotiations of Vladislav Tumanov, the head  of administration of Pskov Oblast, the Russian side proposes as  a subject of negotiations the construction of housing and the  creation of new jobs for settlers from the Baltic region and  other regions of the former USSR, and also housing of the  contingent of troops that is being pulled out. According to the  ecology program, it is proposed to build a series of  purification facilities and extensive processing of silt residue  within the scope of the ecological program for the protection of  the Baltic Sea basin. Projects in the sphere of the development  of the foreign economic potential of the Russian province  pertain to the participation of Swedish entrepreneurs in the  establishment of a joint-stock company, Pskov International  Trade Center. The development of transport communications within  the scope of the program Via Baltika with respect to Pskov  Oblast supposes the establishment of regular cargo, passenger,  and tourist runs, with the joint use of the Pskov international  airport and international highways that are being planned on the  territory of the oblast. Considering the data of the export  fund, according to which about 10 percent of Russian exports  transited through bordering Pskov Oblast, it is proposed to  establish a network of freight terminals on the border with  Belarus, Latvia, and Estonia. The program also proposes to  expand and intensify contacts in the spheres of health services,  culture, and tourism. The investments of the Swedish business  world in the economy of the oblast should involve extensive  processing of timber and peat beds, the processing of  agricultural products, the establishment of enterprises and  highly technological products in the area of machine building,  electronics, and light industry. Individual paragraphs discuss  close regional cooperation in the sphere of joint operations in  the processing of flax.    At the conclusion of the negotiations, in a news conference  arranged for domestic and foreign journalists, Russian Minister  of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev said that the meeting of old  friends (that is the way he introduced his relations with the  Swedish colleague) was taking place within the context of  Russia's regional policy. The idea was expressed in the reply of  Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas that  Sweden, expecting to become a member of the European Union on 1  January of next year, hopes that it will be able through its  authority to make a contribution to the cause of strengthening  stability in the Baltic region. "It is necessary to build a new  Europe together with Russia," the head of the foreign policy  department of Sweden is convinced. Concerning the territorial  claims of Estonia and the hypothetically possible role in them  of Sweden, Ugglas said that Sweden recognized Estonia within the  framework of the existing borders. But border questions, in her  opinion, can be resolved within the framework of practical  contacts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb 2, IRNA -- The Iranian Air Force, in  complete control and fully vigilant, would not allow any  aggression on Iranian territory, said Air Force Commander  Brigadier General Mansur Sattari in an interview with the  English morning daily TEHRAN TIMES today.    Speaking to the daily, the top Air Force official referred  to  the last Friday's Turkish air assault on Iranian border areas  and noted that the attack was not aimed at Iranian territory as  the Islamic Republic forces were in full control of the borders.    "It was by mistake that the Turkish missile landed in  Iranian  territory and 28 of our citizens were martyred or injured,"  Sattari said, "No Turkish fighter plane entered Iranian  territory,... The Turkish pilots were not experienced or mature  enough to avoid the tragedy."    The general also denied reports that the Turkish planes  violated Iran's airspace and said that the recent incident  occured because Iran's residential areas were too close to the  borders.    Gen. Sattari also stated that the Air Force at the moment  was  totally freed from its previous intense dependence on the U.S.  and that it was not only run by an all-Iranian personnel, but  also provided educational services to some of the Islamic  countries.    As for the Persian Gulf security, the paper quoted the  official as saying "we are not appalled by the presence of  foreign warships in the region, in fact we are fully ready to  counter any suspicious move and our warplanes are at all times  guarding the country's airspace."    Commenting on the post-war reconstruction of the Air Force,  he said that the reconstruction had reached completion. The  goal of self-sufficiency, he said, was now within the reach of  the Air Force. The Air Force experience in achieving  self-sufficiency could serve as a model for other governmental  bodies, he said.    Earlier in the day, Sattari visited the Air Force exhibition  in which the latest achievements of different divisions within  the Air Force were put on display.</p>

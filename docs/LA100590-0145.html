			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: SHE'S LIVED ON THE EDGE AND SURVIVED  </P> <P> Actress Debbie Reynolds is very much in the public eye these days. "Postcards  From the Edge" -- a film made from the partly autobiographical novel by her  daughter, Carrie Fisher -- is playing at a number of Orange County theaters,  and Reynolds plans to visit here early in November as the centerpiece of a  fund-raiser for the candidacy of Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) for the  office of lieutenant governor of California.  </P> <P> There's been a lot of acrobatic backing-and-filling by both Fisher and her  mother to make it clear that the boozy, sometimes self-righteous character  played by Shirley MacLaine in "Postcards From the Edge" is not drawn from  Debbie Reynolds. All of this has brought back in rather vivid Technicolor a  surrealistic evening I spent with Reynolds more than a decade ago, when I was  covering Hollywood for several national magazines.  </P> <P> I did half a dozen "scrapbooks" of entertainment luminaries (Bob Hope, John  Wayne, Lucille Ball, among others) in which I collected a pile of personal  photographs from a mixture of sources, then flashed the pictures on the people  I was writing about. They invariably responded with a warmth and depth that  probably couldn't have been tapped in any other way.  </P> <P> I did one of these scrapbook articles on Debbie Reynolds. In the process, I  hung out with her while she was putting together a nightclub act in a Los  Angeles rehearsal hall and also at the house she shared with Harry Karl.  </P> <P> But the evening with her that came vividly to mind when I saw "Postcards From  the Edge" took place in Reno. I had already been through the photographs with  her, and I had gone to Reno to watch the nightclub act I had seen evolve in  rehearsal.  </P> <P> I watched her work the audience at a dinner show and marveled at the waves of  love that came back to her. She kissed bald men and called them Charley and  their wives Mary, and she walked across table-tops talking to children and  picking up names to use later in her act. And then she went back to the stage  to work -- singing, clowning, dancing, mimicking. God, how she worked.  </P> <P> Afterward, I picked my way through a cluttered backstage, past a hard-eyed man  I later discovered was her bodyguard, into a neoplastic dressing room where she  had changed to a robe and was sipping consomme. I remember her as tiny and  still Dresden-pretty but also surprisingly tough, with authority in her voice  and hard lines around her eyes when she thought on certain things.  </P> <P> After two hours of talk, she got back into her sequined dress -- "boobs up,  stomach in" she told herself -- for the midnight show and invited me to wait in  her dressing room for more talk.  </P> <P> She was back at 1:15, and three hours later, Debbie Reynolds -- unwinding over  a now-dead bottle of wine and chain-smoking furiously -- was still going  strong. The theater had long since emptied out and the bodyguard was dozing on  a chair outside her dressing room. And although I was totally wiped out, I had  seen some layers peeled back on the last of the Girl Scouts in the high-octane  world of cabaret entertainment.  </P> <P> I still have my notes of that conversation, although I ran out of tape about 2  o'clock, and after that the notes are sketchy because we were two people  talking over a bottle of wine. And her vulnerability, so carefully protected  most of the time, had been allowed to emerge cautiously and finally to sit in  almost casually on our conversation.  </P> <P> She told me about the poverty of her childhood and adolescence, about selling  awesome amounts of Girl Scout cookies by walking five miles to the neighborhood  in which Bing Crosby and Bob Hope lived, about slugging her only date in high  school when he tried to kiss her, about her shock at winning a Miss Burbank  contest (she just wanted to be a gym teacher), which got her a movie contract  when she was 16.  </P> <P> She insisted that no studio mogul ever made sexual demands on her ("maybe I  wasn't sexy enough") and still feels the pain of the 18-hour rehearsal days  when she had to hold her own with Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor in "Singin' in  the Rain."  </P> <P> When the studio gave her "vitamins" to keep up her strength, her parents  stopped it. "They were vitamins all right," she told me, "with speed in them.  They already had Judy Garland hooked, and they would have had me if my parents  hadn't stepped in."  </P> <P> Early in the evening, she talked almost dispassionately about her marriage to  Eddie Fisher and the pain of her humiliation when he left her with two small  children for Elizabeth Taylor. She married a shoe tycoon named Harry Karl on  the rebound because he was "wise and strong and kind," and she ended up raising  his children and then losing her savings and working a Herculean schedule to  pay off his gambling debts after she divorced him.  </P> <P> She tried TV first, but quit a series rather than work for a cigarette sponsor  (partly because she was addicted to smoking, herself). Then she resurrected an  old chestnut of a show called Irene and made it work, before turning to  nightclubs, which was where I found her in Reno.  </P> <P> Even early that evening, her talk was straight, but only after the theater  emptied and the wine took hold did she allow some of the bitterness and anger  she felt into the conversation.  </P> <P> "My kids have gone through it all with me," she said "I've never shielded them.  They were on the road with me all during Irene and saw their mother go to 96  pounds. They didn't think I'd make it, but I told them I would -- and I did.  They were my support. Without the children, I don't think I'd have wanted to  make it. But if I'd given up, where would they have been? Their father  certainly wouldn't have taken them. What kind of example has he been?"  </P> <P> She admitted some head-to-head confrontations with Carrie when Reynolds offered  advice that often wasn't sought. She recalled telling Carrie when she took off  with Gucci luggage on her first acting assignment: "It's everything you told me  you didn't want. You said you were leaving here because all your friends were  Beverly Hills Gucci Pucci. So remember that line -- and take my speckled black  luggage and be understated for a change."  </P> <P> She told me about other, similar, incidents that seem to provide an undertone  for "Postcards From the Edge."  </P> <P> This is caught most powerfully in the movie when the daughter (played by Meryl  Streep) is asked to sing at a party, and when she finishes, she throws the  spotlight to her mother, an aging actress. The crowd cheers as MacLaine sits on  the piano, hikes up her skirt to show off some fine legs, and sings Stephen  Sondheim's "I'm Still Here" from Follies:  </P> <P>  Good times and bum time, I've seen 'em all, and my dear,  </P> <P>  I'm still here.  </P> <P>  Plush velvet sometimes, sometimes just pretzels and beer,  </P> <P>  But I'm still here.  </P> <P>  I've stuffed the dailies in my shoes, strummed ukuleles,  </P> <P>  Sung the blues,  </P> <P>  Seen all my dreams disappear, but I'm here.  </P> <P>  Black sable one day, next day it goes into hock,  </P> <P>  But I'm still here.  </P> <P>  Top billing Monday, Tuesday you're touring in stock,  </P> <P>  But I'm here.  </P> <P>  First you're another sloe-eyed vamp, then someone's mother,  </P> <P>  Then you're camp,  </P> <P>  Still someone said, "She's sincere," so I'm here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> That had to be written for Debbie Reynolds.  </P> <P> As dawn began to break over the Nevada hills behind Reno that morning 13 years  ago, I wrote down Debbie Reynolds' parting words: "Success can either destroy  you or make you a better person. But you have to be very strong. If you don't  have your own inner strength, you can't make it. You just can't. You go insane  or become a drunk or get on pills and drugs. I watched them all. I was there.  But I was never chewed up by it.  </P> <P> "I'm still doing what I've always done, only more so. I think it's just  self-will, self-determination. My parents were like that. So is Carrie. I never  want to be poor again. So now I'm 45 and I don't have $20,000. You think I  haven't learned the hard way? I've lived it. But I want to survive. I'm going  to survive."  </P> <P> Prophetic words from a tough Girl Scout. I haven't talked to her since that  night in Reno, but I think I saw a lot of Debbie Reynolds in "Postcards From  the Edge."  </P> <P> I'd like to add a small clarification to my column of Sept. 28 about the plight  of the Grove Shakespeare Festival. I quoted some remarks of director David  Herman that I said were made before the Garden Grove City Council when they  were actually delivered at a meeting of festival supporters that followed the  council session.  </P> <P> There were also some semantic complaints from Councilman Raymond T. Littrell  (who was not identified in my column). He said that funds were denied, not  withdrawn, that the denial of funds didn't directly force the company to close  down, and that his comment about Garden Grove being a hard-hat community was  made earlier and not at the meeting in question.  </P></p>

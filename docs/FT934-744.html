			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Political Notebook: Return to the real world There is an important lesson to be learnt from 1993 by those of us interested in British politics. The wider electorate does not share the preoccupations and judgments of Westminster's chattering classes. Yet it is how Mr John Major's policies play in the country, not in the clubs of SW1, that will determine the future of his government. The above may seem an obvious thought but it is too often overlooked even by sophisticated practitioners of the black art. Take just a few examples from these two, very separate, worlds of politics during the past 12 months. During more than half of it politicians and commentators were obsessed by ratification of the Maastricht treaty. At one dramatic point Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd were set to resign if MPs had voted for something called the social chapter. The voters were completely indifferent to such shenanigans, save that they reinforced their contempt for politicians so distracted from the real world of economic recession. More recently there has been Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget. The combination of the most draconian spending squeeze for a decade and another hefty round of tax rises left Conservative MPs howling with delight. Newspaper leader writers praised it as a masterly political manoeuvre. And the voters? They hated it. The opinion pollsters could find nobody on the Clapham omnibus willing to describe the prospects of a cut in take-home pay, a rise in their heating bills and longer hospital waiting lists as a 'skilful package'. Mr Major's government has yet to pay the price. Nor is the electorate as stupid as often assumed in the political world of Westminster. Remember the Newbury by-election back in May. The government fought it on the basis that economic recovery was under way (technically, it was). Weighed down with negative equity and fearful of the dole queues, the voters were enraged by such presumption. The Conservatives were kicked out. Mr Norman Lamont followed a few weeks later. The Christchurch debacle told a similar story. Mr Major said we would hardly notice value added tax on fuel. Anyway, it was environmentally sound. The biggest by-election swing against the Conservatives in 50 years provided the voters' response. Labour was not immune from flights of fancy. For Mr John Smith the biggest event of 1993 was his confrontation at the party conference with the trade unions. It was about something called 'one-member-one-vote', and had to do with trades unionists selecting Labour candidates. As the drama was played out in Brighton the more Neanderthal union leaders said there was a dreadful threat to the historic links between party and workers. Mr Smith somehow managed to tell journalists he was determined to break free from his paymasters while assuring union bosses they would get an even bigger say under his new system. The row filled the evening news bulletins. The voters switched channels to Neighbours. Next year though, it will be different. The two worlds of politics will converge during the summer when the electorate gets its chance to pass judgment. The local elections in May and the European elections in June will provide the most important test of public opinion during the present parliament. They will follow hard on the heels of the first tranche of promised tax rises. It was the crushing defeats on Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government in the same elections back in 1989 that started to pull down the curtain on her premiership. So the conventional wisdom among the chatterers is that the outcome of next year's polls will decide if Mr Major stays in 10 Downing Street. This time they are probably right. Ministers are already rehearsing arguments to soften the impact of defeat. The local elections - this time concentrated in the big cities  - will provide an unreliable guide to sentiment across the country. The European elections, they add, always have a low turnout. And all governments, of course, suffer from mid-term blues. The voters - unlike the pundits - are unlikely to pay much attention to such excuses. They will see the elections as an opportunity to pass judgment on Mr Major and his government. By supporting, or withholding support from, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats the electorate will have the chance also to tell us whether Mr Smith offers a credible alternative. The real world of politics promises a fascinating 1994.</p>

In utter disregard for the 11 years' services rendered to  the  US in Afghanistan, the Clinton administration turned down all  offers made by the Pakistan Government to get or even buy the  ammunition worth millions of dollars.    US experts are now strictly monitoring the destruction of  ammunition which includes mortars, rockets and artillery gun  fire.    It is better to destroy them here than to give it to the  country which has no strategic value for us now, seems to be the  US message. The US, on the face of it, has refused Pakistan's  offers in the name of the Pressler Amendment which bars all  kinds of military aid to Pakistan.    The Afghans, on the other hand, have refused to return what  they think is rightfully theirs now. This ammunition dumped in  various areas of Afghanistan has been confiscated by local  commanders in Afghanistan.    Sources in the Foreign Office were farious that the 11 years  in which Pakistan watched US interests in the region, even at  the cost of risking its security, has not won the ammunition  which should be peanuts for a superpower like America.    This ammunition was the last of what remained in the  pipeline  after the stoppage of US supply somewhere in 1990. The supply  was stopped when the US felt that the mission had been  accomplished after the withdrawal of the Soviet troops. The  agencies involved in the exercise were asked to freeze the  supply immediately. The ammunition in the pipeline was dumped  in various areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Americans,  realising that the cost of its transportation back to the US  would be too much decided to destroy the material here. But  when the time came the local commanders in Afghanistan refused  to oblige despite various pressures exerted by the Americans.  Pakistan being an ever obliging country has allowed it without  any resistance.    Interestingly, the US is not very keen about getting back  ammunition from Afghanistan because it fits in the US scheme of  things in this region. The US knows that this ammunition will  be used in Afghan infighting which serves a better purpose for  the Americans, says the source.    But what worries it the most are the lost Stingers which,  the  Americans fear, might land into loan and other Muslim countries.    A massive witch-hunt is on to trace these Stingers in  Afghanistan. Price ranging from Rs [Rupees] 4 million to Rs 12  million is being offered through various agencies to get back  these missiles. But this missile retrieval exercise is not so  easy a job. An American was severely injured recently when one  of Bara-made missiles exploded. In the presence of these fakes,  in which ordinary explosives are packed in original body, the  Americans are now more careful when they buy them.</p>

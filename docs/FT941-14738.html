			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / People: Halifax Building Society James Crosby, a general manager with Scottish Amicable life company, has been chosen by HALIFAX building society to be managing director of its life operation which it plans to set up next year. Halifax, the UK's largest society, announced last September that it was planning to end its relationship with Standard Life, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, and would set up its own life company. The society, which used headhunters in its search for a managing director for the life operation, says that Crosby emerged as the frontrunner at a very early stage.</p>

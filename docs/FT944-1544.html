			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Fresh US attempt to reform banking Mr Jim Leach, the incoming chairman of the House banking committee, yesterday outlined an ambitious programme of banking legislation, parts of which will be launched early in the new year. The series of bills will include legislation to reform the Glass-Steagall Act, which separates many aspects of commercial and investment banking in the US, and an initiative to reduce the number of agencies responsible for banking regulation. Mr Leach, currently Republican minority leader of the committee, also outlined plans for legislation to cover the derivatives markets, and to give the US administration powers to retaliate against countries which shut out US financial services companies. Plans for reform of Glass-Steagall have foundered before on wrangles between the different interest groups involved. Many big US commercial banks, along with foreign banks operating in the US, have argued strenuously for greater freedom to trade and underwrite securities, and to enter the insurance business. Mr Leach said this was the 'first and most important' issue facing the banking industry, and that he would introduce a bill on the first day of the new Congress to end the barrier between commercial and investment banking. The incoming chairman also hinted at a more moderate plan for consolidation among bank regulators than that attempted earlier this year, which would have led the Federal Reserve to giving up its bank regulation powers. Mr Leach, while praising the Fed, said the Office of Thrift Supervision, which overseas the savings and loans industry, looked 'increasingly superfluous'. A bill on derivatives would not be introduced until 1996, he added.</p>

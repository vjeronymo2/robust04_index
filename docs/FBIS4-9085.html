			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Ivan Georgiev, "leader of the Bulgarian </F> National Radical Party," by Magdalina Andonova; place and date  not given: "We Are the Alternative That Scares Rulers"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Andonova] You use the  concept of "denationalization" in your program. With what means  will you struggle against it?    [Georgiev] I will answer you with an example. The  Bulgarians in Aegean Thrace are called Slavonic Hellenics?!  One of the ways we maintain contact with them is through the  historical literature we bring there. This literature indicates  their roots to them. We will attract this population by  improving their economic prosperity and then they will strive to  come closer to us. If we succeed to bring down the border  barriers and create appropriate social conditions we will  perhaps be able to bring them back to the bosom of the Bulgarian  nation. In Germany for example, the authorities pay for the  social security of their immigrants.    [Andonova] In anything related to foreign policy you use the  principle "good is what is good for Bulgaria." Do you often  read Machiavelli?    [Georgiev] Yes, I have read "The Prince," but this is not  what we mean. If we, nationalists, do not unite Bulgaria we  will perish. We are not like the Bulgarian Socialist Party and  the Union of Democratic Forces, which could transport their  interests outside the borders of our country. We need an  economic and spiritual upsurge. It is well-known that no one  likes the weak ones.    [Andonova] With what foreign parties do you maintain  contacts?    [Georgiev] Jean-Marie Le Pen invited me to visit France.  Their delegation will visit us in September. We are in contact  with Haider's party in Austria, Paradzik's Human Rights Party in  Croatia, and the Italian Alliance -- all of them nationalistic  parties. We also have close relations with Zhirinovskiy's party  -- we have an agreement to help each other at difficult moments,  and in addition, our programs are similar. [passage omitted]    [Andonova] Do you intend to amend your style of behavior?  Do you not insert hysteria in our society, which even without  this has grave problems?    [Georgiev] The times are changing and so are the categories.  No one has the moral right to blame a dying person who is trying  to save himself. In some regions, for example in the Rhodopes  and the Ludogorie, the people think that I am too meek and  should be firmer. Against the background of this economic  destruction the Bulgarians in some regions, Yakoruda for  example, directly face a genocide. In those regions the people  prefer only the Bulgarian National Radical Party. What about  the burning of the Bulgarian national flag? The Bulgarian  authorities keep silent about this sacrilege and do nothing.  This fact speaks of the lack of a Bulgarian sovereignty. We do  not have organs which could protect the property and dignity of  the Bulgarians. [passage omitted]    [Andonova] What do you think the current Bulgarian borders  should be?    [Georgiev] From the ethnic and historical points of view we  are entitled to an additional 127,000 square km -- up to the  Albanian mountains. More than half of Bulgaria is outside our  borders.    [Andonova] When do you think you will come to power?    [Georgiev] We will form our government in the 38th National  Assembly. The people want to get rid of everything that makes  them feel inferior and unneeded. Nationalism is one of the  alternatives. We have a very simple formula -- a rich nation in  a rich state.</p>

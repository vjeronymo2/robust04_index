			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Liquidators try to put brave face on BCCI ruling: Judgment of Luxembourg court throws the winding-up of collapsed international bank into uncertainty YESTERDAY'S decision in the Luxembourg courts, upholding an appeal against a Dollars 1.7bn compensation plan for creditors of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, left the liquidators to the bank trying to put on a brave face over what to do next. The decision to uphold the appeal was portrayed as a victory by the three BCCI creditors who brought the action. But most of those involved in the liquidation stressed the need to study the written judgment before deciding what to do. Touche Ross, the liquidator, said it believed the decision announced in court by Judge Raul Gretsch was based essentially on 'public interest' issues in Luxembourg law. These included whether some groups of creditors would be disadvantaged under the agreement the liquidators had negotiated. The interpretation of the judgment will influence what steps are taken next. When the liquidators meet next week to discuss the implications, they are faced with three principal options: Appeal against the judgment. There is provision to appeal to the final court in Luxembourg, the Cour de Cassation. But these appeals tend to take place on narrow technical grounds, and the liquidators were yesterday expressing some doubts about how likely this would be. Attempt to renegotiate with the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in BCCI. The liquidators have always maintained that they obtained the best deal that was possible after five months of discussions concluded in February 1992. Abu Dhabi has said it is not willing to offer a higher figure. Sue Abu Dhabi. The 'contribution agreement' under appeal in Luxembourg was that the liquidators would agree to waive any legal actions against the government in exchange for at least Dollars 1.7bn. They could now resume that legal threat. Mr Christopher Morris, a partner at Touche Ross who is one of the liquidators to the English liquidation of BCCI, was quick to stress yesterday that any future decisions would be developed and approved in close co-ordination with creditors' committees around the world. In any event, the action is likely to extend for many months any distribution of dividends to creditors of BCCI. The most optimistic view had been that Touche might be able to offer a dividend of up to 15p in the pound by next August. First the liquidators would have had to seek approval from the bank's estimated 530,000 possible creditors worldwide to seek their agreement to a distribution. Judging by the response in previous correspondence with creditors, that would have taken several months. Now they must consider different strategies to recover money. Mr Brian Smouha, another partner with Touche Ross and one of the three court-appointed liquidators to the bank in Luxembourg, was keen to stress that the decision did not destroy all the action that had been taken since the bank was shut worldwide under the co-ordination of the Bank of England in July 1991. Touche has commenced legal actions against the Bank of England, the two auditors to BCCI - Ernst &amp; Whinney (now part of Ernst &amp; Young) and Price Waterhouse - and against National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, its former chief operating officer. Mr Smouha said that realisations so far had exceeded Dollars 1bn, principally from several undisclosed settlements and from the liquidation of parts of BCCI's loan book. But that contrasts with total stated assets at the time of the collapse of Dollars 14bn. The liquidators say there is a 'black hole' of accounted assets of Dollars 12.4bn. Yesterday's court ruling also confirmed that an appeal against the 'pooling agreement' had been dropped. That allows the liquidators to finalise discussions with the many different BCCI liquidations around the world and confirm which are willing to co-operate and join in the global attempts at settlement. Mr Fred Goodwin, a Touche partner, said that so far total fees and expenses on the liquidation worldwide were between Pounds 100m and Pounds 130m.</p>

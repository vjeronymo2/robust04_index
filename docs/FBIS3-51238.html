Carlos Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, Itamar Franco, Luis  Alberto Lacalle -- the presidents of Argentina, Paraguay,  Brazil, and Uruguay -- are in Colonia, 180 km from Montevideo,  attending the fifth Common Market of the South [Mercosur]  summit, whose agenda centers around resolution of discrepancies  for implementation of a common market.    Bolivia, which is not a Mercosur member, is being  represented  by its president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who is attending as  an observer. This country has been considered part of the River  Plate Basin in the "waterway" project, which will give Bolivia  its longed- for access to the sea.    Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu told journalists  that  "the waterway will be included as a topic in the final  declaration" of the fifth summit, which will end this evening,  but did not report on the project's difficulties.    The common channels that Argentina and Uruguay -- the two  River Plate coastal nations -- have under the terms of the River  Plate Treaty have been used so far to reach the sea from the  Paraguay and Parana Rivers.    But an Argentine initiative to build a private channel  within  its territorial waters through a public works concession to a  private party, a project that will be financed through tolls,  has created displeasure among the system's partners.    Uruguay has conveyed to Argentina its concern over the Mitre  channel, which is the name of the Menem government's  privatization project.    This channel will join the Argentine port of Rosario on the  Parana River with the Atlantic Ocean. This will eliminate the  Uruguayan port of Nueva Palmira as the river's final port, where  Paraguay and Bolivia have been allowed to operate duty-free  warehouses.    Uruguay also is concerned that the deepening of the new  channel in Argentine territory will displace the channel the two  countries share in Martin Garcia.    River navigation experts also have voiced their concern  about  the Mitre channel, which could force Uruguayan ships to pay  tolls to the enterprises awarded the construction of Argentine  public works, even for navigation to Uruguayan ports on the  Uruguay River.</p>

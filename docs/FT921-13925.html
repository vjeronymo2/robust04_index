			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Markets: Secretaries have votes, too - London THE symbolic photograph of the week showed a forlorn Roger Freeman, transport minister, taking an unwonted ride on the London Underground clutching a box of chocolates. The chocolates were for his secretary, whose job status he had inadvertently insulted in a speech. The symbolism said: the election campaign is under way; do not foul things up. Although there could easily be five months between now and an election, stock market traders, like politicians, are already behaving as if the vote were imminent. This week, the sustained Conservative attack on the potential tax implications of Labour's spending plans had two effects. By making it clear that the government would fight the election as the low-tax party, it raised the prospects of an (ever so slightly) tax-cutting Budget. More important, it exposed a weakness in the Labour camp: by mid-week the leadership was attempting to muffle the impact of its proposal to lift the ceiling on National Insurance contributions. Investors worried by the way the Tories had appeared to be drifting to defeat were heartened by a suddenly rediscovered ability to put Labour on the defensive. Thursday's half-point drop in building society mortgage rates was also cheering, not least because of its potential impact on home-owning voters. In truth, this move is more an indication of the big societies' determination to shut the clearing banks out of the market for home loans than of improvement in the economic climate, but investors wanted to read the best into it. Shares in Abbey National, the quoted former building society that led the rate-cutting move, rose 11p on the day of the announcement and closed on Friday at 298 1/2 p, up 19p on the week. Shares in the clearing banks also rose strongly, even though they stand to lose from their rivals' sacrifice of margins. There were other forces at work, of course: weighed down by loan losses, banks have become as cyclical as any chemical or construction company. And, as the chart shows, the week saw a marked shift out of defensive, recession-resistant stocks - especially the big pharmaceutical companies that dominate the Health and Household sector of the All-Share - into shares that might benefit from economic recovery. Glaxo closed at a new high of 930p on Monday, then lost nearly 100p in the next four days, closing at 838p. SmithKline Beecham went from 946p to 889p in the same period. On Thursday, these two companies took nearly 12 points off the FT-SE index's performance. The reasoning behind the move owed a little to optimism about the UK economy: sterling's stability above its ERM floor, and lower pay demands from the German trade unions, both signalled a lower risk of a Bundesbank-inspired run-up in UK interest rates. The move owed at least as much to developments in the US, where a marked switch from defensive to cyclical stocks was arguably more justified by a growing confidence about economic recovery. US pharmaceutical companies such as Merck, Glaxo's closest international competitor, suffered; and so did the UK drugs companies, in which US investors' have big stakes. The trend spread to the London market, where investors leapt on it with enthusiasm. Among the gainers were shares in banks, stores, and construction companies. The cautious remember, however, that there were several abortive attempts to establish the trend last year; it remains to be seen whether this version is longer-lasting than its predecessors. One drug company, Fisons, had other news to contend with. On Tuesday its chairman of 11 years, John Kerridge, retired on health grounds, leaving the company looking for a new chief executive. The share price has been languishing for months, as the company has been attempting to overcome hostility it has managed to inspire in the bosom of its most important regulator, the US Food and Drug Administration. Kerridge's departure was marked by an immediate run-up in Fisons' shares, followed by an only-slightly-less immediate bout of second thoughts. Those were compounded by some wounding FDA comments in internal documents obtained under the US freedom of information act. Fisons' shares closed on Friday at 334p, down 13p on the week. The US theme that ran throughout much of the week's activities also affected Cable &amp; Wireless. For several weeks, the markets have been circulating rumours about discussions with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US long-distance operator; on Friday, those rumours were confirmed, with the rider that the talks had halted for the moment after failing to make progress. Those who had been talking up the stock in the (never very realistic) belief that AT&amp;T would buy the whole of Cable &amp; Wireless were disappointed that the talks had not gone further; those who had expected some more limited relationship were heartened that the talks had happened at all. Cable &amp; Wireless closed the week at 600p, up 11p. One other big stock reacted to important news this week: British Gas stepped back from a confrontation with its regulator, and the shares rose 3p on the week, closing at 243p. Opinion was divided about whether this was a decisive surrender or just another skilful manoeuvre in the utility's struggle to preserve as much as possible of its market dominance. One thing was clear: British Gas was able to ease itself out of confrontation thanks to the diplomatic involvement of John Wakeham, the energy secretary. In the run-up to the election, expect to see more such diplomacy all round.</p>

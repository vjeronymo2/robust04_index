			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Britain fails to restart EC's revenue debate BRITAIN'S efforts to restart discussions from scratch on plans to increase European Community revenue by nearly a third were rebuffed by its partners yesterday. Nevertheless, richer member states like Germany, which contributes most in net terms to the EC budget, agreed with the substance of British misgivings about the size of the rise sought by the European Commission. Finance ministers of the 12, gathered at the first EC council meeting of the British presidency, said the so-called 'Delors II' package negotiations should build on the limited agreements reached at last month's Lisbon summit. Though the question of when and if the EC revenue base should be raised remains open, a majority of ministers agreed that increases in Community spending should not be tied arithmetically to levels of national public spending, constrained as they are by slow economic growth and the tight financial convergence targets for economic and monetary union later in the decade. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, had sent a presidency letter and an 80-item questionnaire to his colleagues, implying EC spending should be tied to national expenditure increases, and calling into question the need for an increase in the revenue ceiling. Negotiations under the preceding Portuguese presidency were dismissed as 'useful preparatory work'. The Commission wants to raise the revenue base from a current 1.2 per cent of EC gross national product to 1.37 per cent by 1997. This would increase the budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.6bn) now to Ecu87.5bn in 1997 in today's money. Half the increase would go to Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece as part of the EC's 'cohesion' effort to help them catch up with their partners' living standards and sharpen their competitive edge. This level of increase is considered by these four states as pledged by the Maastricht treaty. Cohesion, however, proved the most divisive issue of the Lisbon summit. It nevertheless decided that the small 'Cohesion Fund' for the four poorest states, created by Maastricht, could start early next year. This would amount to less than a tenth of the fiscal transfers sought by the Commission. The UK questionnaire was virtually ignored by ministers. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, congratulated the 'presidency's epistolary imagination and zeal', before making clear that there could be no question of further discussion on lowering the existing ceiling on farm spending, ratified in Lisbon. Mr Horst Kohler, the number two in Bonn's Finance Ministry, asked tongue-in-cheek whether there could be a 'supplementary question' in the presidency document on Britain's contested budget rebate - ignored by the questionnaire. Mr Lamont said he 'wouldn't dwell on' the rebate issue - as president of the Council - but that 'the UK's position has always been clear'. Britain refuses to countenance any change in the refund Mrs Margaret Thatcher won in 1985, since when Pounds 12.5bn (Dollars 24bn) has been returned to the UK. Mr Jacques Delors said the Commission would bring forward proposals on the Cohesion Fund and the UK rebate, either at tomorrow's or next week's Commission meeting.</p>

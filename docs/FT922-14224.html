			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Yeltsin to ease economic shock therapy MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, yesterday appeared to have saved both his government and its economic reforms from early destruction, at the cost of further promises of assistance to the low paid, industries and agriculture. Both Mr Yeltsin and Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister who spoke briefly after the president, were received sceptically and largely in silence. Only when Mr Yeltsin sought to blame some of the difficulties on the previous Soviet governments of Mr Nikolai Ryzkov and Mr Valentin Pavlov did the muttering in the audience rise by several disapproving decibels, forcing him to stop to allow Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, to appeal for silence. Mr Yeltsin mentioned neither the promised liberalisation of energy prices set for June, which he is believed to have doubts about, nor the assistance promised by the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven countries, which is unpopular with many of the deputies. He left both to the staccato speech of Mr Gaidar, who said the Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.9bn) assistance promised last week was 'comparable to the Marshall Plan for Europe after the war'. Mr Yeltsin blamed the government for underestimating the extent of the price rises and for the slow pace of privatisation. He said privatisation would now be hastened, since Russia must 'create millions of owners of property and not hundreds of millionaires'. The president said the policy of the government required correction especially in the area of social welfare. Further credits would be given to industry and agriculture for investment and that further large grants would be made to military enterprises for their conversion programmes. Mr Gaidar accepted that the government had been wrong about the effects of the price rises, but, like Mr Yeltsin, claimed the market economy was beginning to work, and that 'unique pre-conditions for the economic recovery of Russia have been created'. 'Russia has the chance to enter a period of economic growth . . . it would be a crime to turn away from this road.' He said the government would now change the emphasis of reform, moving away from shock therapy towards 'a broad programme of transforming the economy'. It now seems certain that the crisis in industry - where unpaid debts amount to Rbs800bn - will receive more attention, together with the promised Rbs200bn in credits. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, an ally of Mr Khasbulatov's and his deputy in charge of economic reform, called for the creation of a 'powerful centre for the administration of industry' and for a revamped industrial ministry. This would represent the interests of state enterprises - which constitute 88 per cent of output - in the heart of government. Mr Shumeiko may himself take the post of industry minister in a further cabinet reshuffle. He said Mr Yeltsin had already promised to amend the privatisation legislation to allow managers to take between 10-20 per cent of the stock of privatised companies. Japan is likely to put up about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 570m) for a fund to help Russia stabilise the rouble and will come up with an overall policy on a western aid plan by the end of April, government officials said in Tokyo, agencies report. Meanwhile, Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said the Group of Seven's pledge of Dollars 24bn in aid to Russia is only half the amount really needed by the Commonwealth of Independent States. The total consists of a Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble and Dollars 18bn in balance of payments support. Mr Attali said the aid package is only funds 'either already announced or in the air'.</p>

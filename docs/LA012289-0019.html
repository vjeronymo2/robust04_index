			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MOVE OVER, ELVIRA!  </P> <P> Ozzy Osbourne hosting horror films? Cannon Home Video has hired the heavy metal  madman to perform two-minute introductions to each of eight horror films. The  first four -- "Dracula's Last Rights," "Crucible of Horror," "Beast in the  Cellar" and "Blood on Satan's Cloth" -- are due on video shelves April 26.  </P> <P> Kristina Hamm, assistant to the director of Cannon Home Video, told us Osbourne  will provide a plot summary and "tell a couple of jokes."  </P> <P> "We've discovered that the prime horror video renters also listen to heavy  metal music," explained Hamm. "That's why we felt Ozzy was a logical choice."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, European metal head King Diamond -- recently featured on Geraldo  Rivera's notorious Satan special -- has landed a role in the fright flick  "Boggs," about a not-quite-human televangelist, which begins filming next month  in Florida. Sources tell us King Diamond will play a priest in a church lottery  sequence where two lucky people win . . . entrance to hell. Marc Shapiro  </P></p>

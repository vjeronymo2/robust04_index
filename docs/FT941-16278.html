			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Scandal pushes rock-like imageto the edge: Patrick Harverson explains how Prudential Securities is being hit by investors' claims When Prudential Securities agreed to pay Dollars 371m (Pounds 250m) in fines and restitution to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors who bought high-risk limited partnerships from its brokers in the 1980s, the Wall Street firm thought the worst of the scandal was over. Mr Hardwick Simmons, chief executive, said of the settlement three months ago: 'It's one last punch. The eye already got blackened.' In the past fortnight, however, the firm received another black eye when Mr Loren Schechter, its general counsel, was forced to resign. Mr Schechter, the firm's chief legal officer for more than 11 years, was ousted after it was reported that the US attorney's office in Manhattan was investigating the legal department's role in vetting sales documents used in connection with the partnerships. Over the next few months several former and current executives, including Mr George Ball, former chief executive, as well as Mr Schechter, are expected to be issued with subpoenas by government investigators seeking more information on the case. Mr Ball's career has continued to suffer - last October he resigned from a top post at another Wall Street brokerage, Smith Barney Shearson, amid speculation that he was asked to go because of the publicity surrounding the limited partnerships case. Other indications that the issue has yet to run its course include the prospect that senior executives at the firm in the 1980s will be charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with failing to supervise properly the brokers selling the partnerships, and the recent naming of Prudential Insurance, the firm's parent company - and two accounting firms Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &amp; Touche - in lawsuits involving the limited partnerships. The investigation of wrongdoing at Prudential Securities has implications beyond the firm. The publicity surrounding it has come at a bad time for the US brokerage industry, which has been trying to fend off accusations that it was lax in preventing 'rogue brokers' from taking advantage of investors through unscrupulous trading practices. The longer the Prudential Securities affair drags on, the harder it will be for Wall Street to convince investors that its brokers can be trusted. The problems plaguing Prudential Securities, the fourth largest firm in the industry, date back to the early 1980s, when brokers at Prudential-Bache Securities, as the firm was then called, sold about Dollars 8bn of highly speculative limited partnerships in property, oil and gas investments to about 400,000 clients. Although the clients say they had been assured the investments were safe, by the end of the decade the high-risk investments had soured amid the collapse of the property and energy markets. Investors were left with billions of dollars in losses. By the start of the 1990s, thousands of clients had launched lawsuits against Prudential Securities, claiming they had been defrauded by brokers who had misled them about the partnerships' risks and returns. So far, only a few class-action lawsuits on behalf of several thousand investors have been settled, at a cost to the firm of Dollars 270m. Prudential Insurance's public image - built upon the advertising slogan 'Solid as a Rock' - has been tarnished by the events, partly because many investors said they bought the partnerships as they trusted the Prudential name. The parent company has also been named in several class-action lawsuits which claim the insurer was part of a racketeering conspiracy involving the sale of the partnerships. Government investigators are also looking into allegations that insurance agents at the parent company bypassed rules that prohibited them from selling partnerships and other securities. Prudential Insurance's debt rating might even be lowered because of the events. Last month the insurance ratings agency AM Best was considering downgrading the rating from A-double plus, its highest grade, because of uncertainty surrounding the financial implications of the partnerships affair. Ultimately, the biggest cost will be in dollars. To date, the firm has agreed to pay a total of Dollars 641m to settle SEC charges and class-action lawsuits. The funds will come out of the Dollars 700m Prudential Securities has set aside in reserves to cover such costs. Under the terms of last October's SEC settlement, the firm is obliged to meet the claims of any of the 400,000 clients who bought the limited partnerships who can convince lawyers that they were defrauded. Industry analysts estimate that the firm will need to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars more. Mr Perrin Long, analyst at First of Michigan, says: 'My guess is the final bill will be at least Dollars 1bn.' The firm has admitted the Dollars 700m will grow to at least Dollars 800m. The only good news for Prudential Securities is that all this has come at a time when it can afford the huge costs. If it had erupted in the late 1980s, when the securities industry was struggling, it might have broken the firm. Today, however, Wall Street is entering the fourth year of boom, and Prudential Securities has thrived. Yet, the scandal has ruined what should have been the best years in the firm's history. While every other big securities firm has been basking in record profits, Prudential Securities admits it has had to put aside a dollar in its reserves for every dollar of earnings.</p>

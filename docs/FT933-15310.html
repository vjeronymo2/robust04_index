			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / People: Strong brings a new order into Freemans Yesterday retail group Sears announced its second senior management change in less than a week, as chief executive Liam Strong continues his drive to lift the performance of the refocused group. Mike Hawker, 43, managing director of Freemans, the mail order division, has resigned from the company after 13 years, after Strong decided Freemans was not improving quickly enough. 'Freemans has had reasonable performance on the whole but profits have not moved ahead in the way we would like,' Sears says. 'The feeling was that we needed a new pair of eyes and a new approach.' Sears announced on Tuesday it was closing Ter Meulen Post, its loss-making Dutch mail order business that was part of the Freemans division, having decided it could not be economically turned around. Hawker will be replaced by Richard Boland (right), who joined Adams, Sears childrenswear division, in 1989, and became divisional managing director two years ago. Boland, 42, has wide retailing experience, having started as an executive trainee with C&amp;A in 1973, moving to Asda for a year, and then spending five years at GUS, the UK's biggest mail order group, where he rose to become one of two group merchandise managers. In 1988 he became joint managing director of Danielle, a clothing and footwear importer for a year, before joining Sears. Described as a 'creative and energetic man, the kind of man who runs down the hallway', Boland is charged with continuing the move away from the traditional system of sales agents, towards direct marketing. Some systems have already been put in place to enable Freemans to handle direct ordering from customers, rather than purely sales through agents. Sears announced last Friday the appointment of Andrew Wileman, a partner with OC&amp;C strategy consultants, as group strategy director.</p>

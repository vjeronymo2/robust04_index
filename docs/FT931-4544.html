			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers reverse fresh advance LONDON'S attempt to follow Wall Street to new highs was thwarted yesterday by a shakeout in the stock index futures market. After gaining 20 points in early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index turned back sharply when the futures markets opened and share prices ended the day on the downside. Confidence in economic recovery remained sound, however, and hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates around the time of next week's Budget speech were supported by sterling's relatively stable reception for the announcement of the latest UK producer price data. The parliamentary defeat overnight of the UK government on moves to accelerate the Maastricht legislation introduced an element of political uncertainty. The stock market continued to debate the prospects of rises in indirect taxes on Tuesday when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, makes his Budget speech. The early gain of 20 points on the Footsie was reversed into a loss of 11.2 by midsession. A sluggish start on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial Average was just 2 points ahead in London hours, left the UK market to drift. Traders reported little sign of significant selling and said profit-taking was only to be expected following the sharp advance in the previous session. At the final reading the FT-SE 100 stood at 2,949.9, down 7.4, with traders unsure whether to worry about the challenge to the 2,900 mark. Trading volume was brisk, with 776.5m shares moving through the Seaq system compared with 654.1m on Monday, when retail business stayed firm at Pounds 1.23bn. Non-Footsie business increased significantly, to make up about 78 per cent of the day's total, against recent daily averages of closer to 60 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shaded lower by 0.5 points to 3,119.2. Market strategists remained confident that the London market still has further strength behind it and that yesterday's pause was nothing more than a bout of minor profit-taking following a session when share prices were driven ahead by a mixture of economic optimism and technical market factors. The latest advance to new peaks in the UK stock market has taken place against a backcloth of similar strength in other world markets. While convincing evidence of a recovery in the UK economy remains elusive, London traders have taken an increasingly confident view of developments in the US. At the same time, belief that German interest rates will soon start to fall underpins expectations that UK rates can remain low, at least until the end of this year. However, some analysts are wary of the outlook for UK equities after the Budget. Mr Craig Knox at Lazard Investors is moving ahead of Mr Lamont's speech. He told clients that UK shares have performed relatively well over the past month and that this appears a 'good moment to reduce exposure'. At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall sees the FT-SE 100 Index now making its 'final dash' for the 3,040-50 target, with both New York and Tokyo providing encouragement. He believes that this week's data on consumer credit imply a consumer-led recovery but doubts that consumers will indulge in 'another 1980s style binge'.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Bid stories help offset early slide in equities - Market Report Talk of an imminent takeover bid, involving one of the FT-SE 350 stocks, helped the rehabilitation process of a UK equity market which plunged back through the 3,000 mark on the FT-SE 100 Index shortly after the outset of trading yesterday. There were no really 'hot' stories circulating, but dealers insisted some sort of takeover or strategic stakebuilding move was afoot. One suggestion was that JP Morgan, the US investment bank was at last about to instigate a much-rumoured plan to merge its market activities with those of SG Warburg, the leading UK investment bank. Stories of such a move have been circulating in London for many months. Earlier, markets across Europe, but especially London, had come under heavy downside pressure following news that one of the world's biggest mutual funds, Fidelity's Magellen is not paying a year-end dividend, having sustained heavy losses in derivative market during the year. This news, coming so soon after Wall Street's recent downside break and persistent talk that US interest rates are set to move up again, only weeks after the 75 basis points rise, caused serious worries in the London market. It also spent much of the session fretting about the possibility of the Conservative government sustaining an extremely damaging defeat in the House of Commons over the second stage of the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel. Adding to the UK market's discomfort were comments by Mr Eddie George, Governor of the Bank of England, that the UK economy was growing at an unsustainable rate, a view interpreted by the markets that an increase in UK interest rates could occur much sooner than the markets had previously expected. A rise in January has been widely predicted. At the close of a frantic trading session the FT-SE 100 index was 17.4 lower at 3,016.1. The FT-SE Mid Cap 250, which, unlike the 100-index failed to move up on Monday, plunged 28.1 to 3,430.2. Despite the high anxiety encompassing the markets, there was precious little real customer activity in London. Turnover in equities was a pitiful 432.3m shares, the lowest for many weeks, with non FT-SE stocks accounting for over 60 per cent of that total. Customer business on Monday just topped Pounds 1bn level to reach Pounds 1.19bn. The Footsie began the session weakly with dealers citing the Fidelity news. Within two hours of the opening the 100 index was down over 40 points and in disarray with marketmakers predicting a bloodbath on Wall Street. Sentiment began to improve thereafter, and the 100 index picked up strongly as Wall Street confounded the market, opening is resilient form, considering the Fidelity news, and slipping 20 Dow Jones points before embarking on a strong rally which took the index into positive territory shortly after London closed. Two hours after the UK market finished the Dow was three points easier. With events in the US calmer than expected it was domestic events which dominated in London as the session drew to a close. Talk in the market was that the VAT vote was going against the government, with only five hours before the division bell. A leading marketmaker said a defeat over the VAT Bill, with all the implications for raising further taxes, would be a severe setback for the government. And there was a story that the chancellor had already prepared a contingency plan in the event of a defeat of the VAT bill. Around a quarter of the constituents of the 100 index ended on positive ground, with BTR leading the pack in a reaction to the recent big slide in the stock. Glaxo was given a strong boost by negative stories concerning Astra, one of the group's big rivals.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: US exchanges choose flavours of the month IN AN effort to generate volume and income for their members, two US commodities exchanges are introducing futures and options on food products this summer. This continues a long line of relatively obscure and usually short-lived agricultural product launches as small exchanges struggle to rebuild trading volume in the flagging farm futures sector. New York's Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange last week launched futures in cheddar cheese and non-fat dry milk. Options on the futures began trading on Tuesday. US dairy prices have traditionally lacked volatility, held in check by huge oversupply and high government price supports. However, government subsidies have been reduced recently, leaving milk and cheese prices above support levels. This has injected uncertainty into the markets, and made them ripe, the CSCE believes, for futures hedging. The new dairy futures contracts trade for just one hour each afternoon in the CSCE's sugar pit, after the exchange's main markets are closed. The late hour was meant to encourage members to stay after their regular sessions to trade the new products. The cheese contract represents 40,000 lb of cheddar in 40-lb blocks, while non-fat dry milk futures trade in 44,000 lb increments, in 25-kg bags. The contracts are deliverable, free on board, to any manufacturing plant within the continental US. Despite strong pre-launch support from the dairy industry and healthy first-day volume, the contracts appear already to have soured. Only five cheese and two milk futures contract changed hands on Monday. Cheese for July delivery finished at 120.5 cents a lb, while non-fat dry milk ended at 103.75 cents a lb. Traders say the contracts are faltering because of a lack of fundamental information on US dairy production and supply and the dairy industry's complete unfamiliarity with futures trading. The Minneapolis Grain Exchange is likely to face similar hurdles in its attempt to make a futures market in frozen white shrimp. The tiny exchange, which now boasts a century-old futures contract in hard red spring wheat, plans to launch shrimp futures July 12. The idea isn't completely new. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange briefly traded shrimps in the 1960s, but the project was quickly abandoned. For the past decade the MGE has searched in vain for fresh futures fodder. Mr James Lindau, the exchange's president, thinks shrimp will be a winner. 'The economics are right for this contract,' he says. 'The commodity has price volatility. Shrimp is a multi-billion dollar industry in which hundreds of companies produce, distribute, process and sell the product. Mr Lindau recently returned from a marketing trip to Ecuador, which exports 70 per cent of its white shrimp harvest to the US. Export prices for these have slumped by 25 per cent in the last five years, and producers are under pressure from rising fuel prices and high shipping costs. Mr Lindau says he is willing to wait for the market to develop and can see potential for other fishy contracts, like salmon. The New York Mercantile Exchange has received approval from the UK Treasury to allow UK traders to deal directly on Access, its after-hours electronic trading system. The system will be launched in New York this evening.</p>

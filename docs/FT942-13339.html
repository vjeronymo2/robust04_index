			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Japan speeds up in multimedia race The Japanese authorities and businesses are racing to catch up with US moves to introduce the benefits of digital television and multimedia to the public. Following a flurry of announcements from the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on research programmes in digital and interactive TV and multimedia, a government advisory council yesterday called for the development of technology to connect ISDN, a digital telecommunications network being built by NTT, the telecommunications company, with cable television . The increasing number of networks that were being built and which sought to offer both telecommunications and broadcasting services, made it vital that they were able to link up with each other, the ministry said. The recommendation has been made in the expectation that television, including cable TV, and telecommunications will increasingly be based on digital technology, an MPT official said. Separately, another advisory group is expected to outline details of Japan's digital broadcasting programme in its final report on the future of broadcasting in Japan. In a mid-term report released in December, the panel called for the adoption of digital technology. The final report is likely to present a clearer map of Japan's move towards digital broadcasting. Japan has lagged behind the US in building a programme for an information super-highway. The regulatory hurdles, the lack of a concerted effort to build such an information infrastructure and industry hesitation have all contributed to the delay. But the authorities appear to have found a new enthusiasm. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has been promoting its own multimedia programmes and the Construction Ministry plans to lay an optical fibre network under its roads at a cost of Y40,000bn (Pounds 263bn). Meanwhile, as the authorities step up their efforts to stimulate further progress in advanced broadcasting and telecommunications, a private group is considering the use of digital satellite broadcasting to pump 50 channels into Japanese homes. Satellite TV has had a mixed history in Japan. Of three satellite channels, the two public broadcasting channels have had relative success, but a private channel has had difficulty attracting subscribers, largely as a result of the high price of signing up. The trading companies Itochu, Mitsui, Nissho-Iwai and Sumitomo are considering offering a 50-channel satellite TV service using digital technology which could be extended to cover other Asian countries.</p>

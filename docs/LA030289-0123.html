			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OBSERVATORY TO FOCUS ON ECLIPSE  </P> <P> Moorpark College's Charles Temple Observatory will be open Tuesday for viewing  of the partial solar eclipse, which will begin at 8:17 a.m. and last until  11:58 a.m.  </P> <P> Hal Jandorf, an astronomy instructor at the college, said that at the eclipse's  maximum, the moon will block 36% of the sun. He warned that permanent eye  damage can occur if the eclipse is viewed directly through telescopes,  binoculars or sunglasses.  </P> <P> Jandorf advised viewers to focus the image of the sun on a pocket mirror  directed at a shaded wall. The mirror should be covered by a sheet of paper  with a small hole punched in it, he said.  </P> <P> The observatory will offer viewing through several telescopes equipped with  safety devices.  </P></p>

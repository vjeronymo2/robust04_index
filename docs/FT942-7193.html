			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hydro-Quebec up 23% at CDollars 643m Hydro-Quebec, one of Canada's two biggest electric power utilities earned CDollars 643m (USDollars 465.9m) in the first quarter, up 23.7 per cent from a year earlier, as harsh winter weather boosted domestic and export demand. Electricity sales rose 8.4 per cent by volume and revenues 8.2 per cent to CDollars 2.3bn. Sales in Quebec rose 3.8 per cent by volume and revenues by 6.4 per cent. A rate rise generated an additional CDollars 32m in the latest period. Revenues from power exports, mainly to the US, but also other provinces, were up 4.4 per cent to CDollars 144m. Spending rose 3.3 per cent largely because new generating and transmission equipment came on stream, increasing depreciation and amortisation. Tight controls held operating costs steady, while taxes were up 7.5 per cent. The utility cut staff, controlled overtime strictly and began a pay freeze. Hydro-Quebec, 100 per cent owned by the Quebec government, invested CDollars 629m in the quarter, down from CDollars 755m a year earlier. Total investment in 1994 will be CDollars 3.86bn, against CDollars 4bn last time, mostly for James Bay hydro expansion and for the distribution system. Many large projects are nearing completion. The utility arranged a CDollars 1bn global issue and total 1994 borrowing will be almost CDollars 3bn. Cancellation of a US export contract to take effect in 1999 will not affect the utility's construction programme. An existing 800 MW contract may be extended beyond 1998 expiry.</p>

After a year in which the Royal Bank's profits sank to Pounds 21m, its staff were demoralised by the promise of big job cuts, and shareholders irritated by the handsome salaries paid to a few executive stars such as insurance supremo Peter Wood, so yesterday's agm in Edinburgh was expected to be a rowdy affair. Fortunately, the Royal Bank's spin-doctors have discovered paragraph 6.8 of the Cadbury report. This is the bit about shareholders submitting difficult questions in writing in advance. So the chairman, former defence secretary Lord Younger, announced that there had been 200 questions - most on three subjects: the composition of the board, directors' pay and Peter Wood. He then read out the answers and Peter Wood was never mentioned again. Younger's patience and sense of timing in dealing with the rest of the questions from the floor was exquisite. But then that is one of the few reasons for hiring an ex-politician as chairman.</p>

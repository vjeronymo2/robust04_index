			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Brussels anger over US food export hitlist THE European Commission yesterday reacted angrily to the publication in Washington of a Dollars 2bn EC food exports 'hit-list', half of which may suffer punitive tariffs if the EC fails to reform its oilseeds subsidy regime. This latest escalation of the oilseeds row casts a pall over prospects of concluding the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation talks, in which the US and EC can still not agree on how far each side should cut farm subsidies. The Dollars 2bn hit list, which ranges across wine, cheese, biscuits, gin, liqueurs, tobacco, will be pared to Dollars 1bn after 30 days of being open to public suggestions. It does not include whisky. This is a notional estimate of damage caused by EC discrimination against the US's powerful soyabean exporters. If imposed, the list would block about a quarter of EC food exports to the US. Brussels officials described the action as 'totally without justification since it lacks any legal basis' within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) disputes procedures, now ostensibly being followed by both sides. The EC has taken up a Gatt panel option to offer compensation to US exporters while nevertheless challenging the Gatt ruling which it hopes ultimately will be settled in the Uruguay Round. Compensation would do nothing to answer US soya farmers' complaints. 'What is needed is fair access into the EC market so US soyabean farmers can compete for the market. This can only be accomplished through reductions in the EC oilseed subsidy programme,' said Mr Gary Riedel, president of the American Soyabean Association, yesterday. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said 'it would seem from this action that the US is not interested in peace in international trade.' The EC proposal over oilseeds will be put to the next meeting of the Gatt Council on June 19. At the last Gatt Council meeting the EC blocked a report from the dispute settlement panel which, for the second time, found that EC policies impair the duty-free status accorded to soyabeans as a result of previous negotiations. By declaring its intention to press ahead with its hitlist against the EC under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, the US is being attacked by Brussels for flouting Gatt procedures by initiating unilateral sanctions. US officials recognise this, but say the administration may press ahead nevertheless. Senior EC officials believe the Bush administration is bowing to the electoral pressures building up on the president, pointing out that the sanctions list homes in on France and Ireland, two hardliners in the farm subsidies row. EC figures also show that US soya exporters have lost out mainly to lower cost soya exporters like Argentina and Brazil, at a time when European imports of soya have expanded significantly.</p>

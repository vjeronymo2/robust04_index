			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The House of  Representatives Budget Committee decided Thursday [16 June] to  summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on June 21 to  testify about his questionable personal finances, which drove  him out of office in April.    Overriding the ruling coalition's objections, Budget  Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi declared that his panel  would summon the 56-year-old Hosokawa. As soon as Yamaguchi  made the announcement, several lower house members openly  protested while opposition party legislators, including those of  the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), applauded. Members of both  the LDP and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social  Democratic Party of Japan] are trying to use Hosokawa's plight  to their advantage and force Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's  minority government to step down. Budget panel chairman  Yamaguchi is an SDP member.    The budget panel made the announcement a day after  Hosokawa's  former financial secretary appeared before the panel to say  Hosokawa had indeed paid back a 100 million yen loan borrowed in  1982 from scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm. The  secretary, Masatoshi Miyama, testified under oath at the  committee about the former premier's questionable financial  deals, which led to Hosokawa's resignation in April. Miyama  denied allegations that Hosokawa may not have paid back the 100  million yen loan and that it was received as a secret political  donation.</p>

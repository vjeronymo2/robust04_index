			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] New Delhi, Apr. 27 (PTI)--India is likely to  emerge as a major space power by the turn of the century and  would achieve self-sufficiency in satellite launch vehicle  technology by then, the Lok Sabha was told today.    India had emerged as a major space power in satellite  building and space applications in the areas of communication,  meteorology, disaster warning and remote sensing, the minister  of state in Prime Minister's Office, Mr Bhuvanesh Chaturvedi,  said in a written reply.    With two operational space systems, Indian national  satellite  (INSAT) and the Indian remote sensing satellite (IRS), the  country had demonstrated its technological capabilities in these  areas, he said.    India had already developed technological capabilities to  launch 1000 kg IRS class, satellite through design, development  and testing of polar satellite launch vehicle (PSLV), Mr  Chaturvedi said.    The development and operationalisation of geo-synchronous  satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) before the end of the century,  will make India self-sufficient in satellite launch vehicle  technology, he said.    The minister also said there was no proposal to shut down  any  of the Trombay nuclear research reactors.    However, the Apsara and Cirus research reactors were planned  to be refurbished in view of their long service life of about 38  years and 34 years, respectively, he added. [passage omitted]</p>

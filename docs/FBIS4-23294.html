			<p>BFN     [Text] President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe has outlined a  new vision for Africa in which the continent will no longer be  synonymous with economic mismanagement, civil strife, or human  rights abuses, nor with poverty, hunger, ignorance and disease.  Opening a meeting of African presidents and representatives of  Western donor nations in Harare, he said that perhaps at no  other time in Africa's history had the continent felt so acutely  the need for partnership and a genuine friendship than today.  Africa was an essential component of global policy, he said.  The failure or success of Africa affected the rest of the world.    President Mugabe said Africa was embarking on a program of  economic structural adjustment, political reforms and regional  integration. Good governance had been accepted as vital  throughout Africa as democracy could not be complete without it.  He said those African countries that had demonstrated  seriousness about their political and economic reforms deserved  support and cooperation more than ever before.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Stefano Folli: "Pannella: Dear Ministers, Time </F> for a Reshuffle"]    [Text] Rome -- The curtain is about to fall on the sad  scenario of the First Republic. But before the company is  disbanded, one final major show is about to be staged. It  should not be missed, because it offers a plot with some  potential for spectacular developments. For instance, the  possibility of a group of ministers tendering their resignation  in order to prompt a reshuffle. The title could be "Will Our  Hero Persuade Ciampi To Ride Again?" The "hero" is Marco  Pannella, the lone occupant of parliament around the end of the  old year and the start of the new. Pannella is the architect of  a political strategy verging on the brilliant, whose aim is as  follows: to prevent the Ciampi Government from sliding toward  the elections on the magic carpet of ambiguous neutrality, as a  "disinterested" government aloof from the political struggle.  Pannella argues (as does Segni now), that this would in practice  provide support for the postelection plans of Occhetto, who --  surprise, surprise! -- has precisely Ciampi in mind as leader of  a second, infinite transition period -- to provide reassurance  for the markets, industry, and our European partners.    Hence his obstructive move. Ciampi, Pannella argues, must  not be merely an anemic, albeit efficient, government clerk. He  is involved in the political crossfire against his will, and the  rationale of the first-past-the-post system will exacerbate this  conflict to the maximum. So Ciampi must constitute the  expression of a coalition supporting him as the precondition for  a political alignment that in the future may be either  victorious or defeated, but that must in any case prepare for  the electoral battle.    The next step in his argument concerns the need to make  "visible" what we could call this liberal-democratic coalition,  which partly coincides with the old majority -- the DC  [Christian Democratic Party], the PSI [Italian Socialist Party],  and the nondenominationalists -- but which now includes the  Pannella group and above all Mario Segni. According to  Pannella, if the latter wants to remain consistent, he must not  underestimate the possibility of a second Ciampi Government  wrested from the PDS and presented on behalf of the moderate  camp.    But a no-confidence motion is not enough in order to achieve  a second Ciampi Government. At least, it is clear enough that  the legislature's days are numbered, especially if the prime  minister begins the debate 12 January but resigns before the  final vote. Scalfaro would sign the dissolution decrees with a  view to an election on 27 March or later, as the Senate speaker  suggested, on 10 April. Ciampi would stay on to take care of  routine business. The political objective proposed by Pannella  (a natural coalition) would not be achieved. So here is his  idea: Why do interested ministers -- and especially those  concerned about the future of the moderate center -- not resign  now, of their own free will? By so doing, they would avoid  facilitating the government's downhill slide toward the PDS and  would turn the process of the dissolution of parliament into a  significant political transition instead of a sterile  institutional ritual. This, because Scalfaro would be  duty-bound to replace the outgoing ministers and his choice  would not be without specific political repercussions. The  elections would take place all the same, but the  liberal-democratic front would feel a little fresh blood flowing  through its veins. The Italian people would make their choice  on the basis of a proposal (and alliance) for government,  "instead of the old classifications of left, right, and center,"  whereby Berlusconi, Segni, Martinazzoli, and Bossi would be  preparing for a Pyrrhic victory, with a weak left commanding 30  percent, and three minority groups commanding 20 percent.    Pannella confined himself to making the suggestion, asking  whether there are any ministers "unwilling to accept the  undemocratic and unpolitical degradation of their role." It is  up to them to reply. It is up to people like Andreatta,  Barucci, Jervolino, and Costa -- the most "political" members of  a highly technocratic government, and perhaps those most  interested in the reconstruction of a moderate coalition. We  shall see imminently whether the reshuffle takes place.    For the present it must be acknowledged that an uphill climb  lies ahead. First, it is necessary to see whether the DC --  that is, Martinazzoli -- is willing to follow Pannella. Second,  it is necessary to establish what Mario Segni's position is  (according to the plan, he would fill the post of deputy prime  minister, with Pannella himself as foreign minister): On the  one hand, by attacking Ciampi over the year's end economic  package, he seems more interested in electoral competition with  the League than with establishing himself at the Chigi Palace  [government seat]. But yesterday evening he helped Pannella  considerably when he told IL GIORNALE that "before the  confidence debate the prime minister has an obligation to make  it clear whether he considers himself the candidate of the front  led by the PDS." Then there is the proposal made by Liberal  Secretary Costa, in an interview -- yes to a reshuffle, but only  if it guarantees new "substance" to the government program and  therefore sets the elections back by a few months, to June.  Pannella rejects this argument: Nothing bugs him more than  being described as the leader of the "postponement party."    "Moreover," PDS constitutionalist Augusto Barbera commented,  "if there is to be a reshuffle, it can only be a merely  technical one. In our present situation political choices would  create too many problems. If that happened, who can say whether  we should move to the right or left in order to strengthen  Ciampi?"</p>

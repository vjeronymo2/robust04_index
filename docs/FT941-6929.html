			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Gentlemen, players, and bad losers: Dominic Lawson wonders why the British whined so when Torvill and Dean were beaten How sad it is to have to confirm that, on the sporting field, from the sweltering cricket pitches of Jamaica to the icy rinks of Norway, Britain has become not just a nation of losers, but a nation of bad losers. Of the reports in yesterday's newspapers of the England cricket team's loss to the West Indies, on average about two-thirds of the space was given over to whingeing about the allegedly unfair treatment meted out to Devon Malcolm (England) by Courtney Walsh (West Indies). For those of you who, perhaps wisely, have avoided reading these interminable moans, the single fact involved is that the West Indian fast bowler subjected the least able English batsman to a series of short-pitched deliveries, during which the Englishman scored 18 runs and, in return, took four blows to his body. Among the English commentators who have rushed to denounce Walsh is Bob Willis. Now Willis was for many years England's most destructive fast bowler, and by no means averse to a bit of intimidation, especially against the weakest international opposition. Willis has perhaps forgotten the time one of his well-directed bouncers removed some of the teeth of Iqbal Qasim, then the undisputed rabbit of the Pakistani team. The whining behaviour of the English press, not all of whom, at least, could be accused of hypocrisy, is particularly unappealing, given Malcolm's own response. 'It's just part of the game,' he said, adding with the sort of stoicism that we associate with the English gentleman: 'It's only pain.' That is where the debate should have ended. But instead the bad losers of the sporting press carried their whingeing on to the front pages. This time the target was the group of men and women who judged the ice dance competition at the winter Olympics. Apparently it was inconceivable to the 23m people who watched the competition on BBC Television that the British couple, Torvill and Dean, could have failed to win. After all, 23m people would not be watching something as fatuous as an ice dancing competition, unless it were to see an English couple winning. So it must have been a conspiracy by foreign judges that prevented the rightful and predicted English victory. And, conveniently, it was a German judge who gave the lowest marks to the English couple. It did not take many commentators long to recall that it was a German referee who 'robbed' the English football team in its World Cup qualifying match against the Netherlands last year. Ice dancing is a completely bogus sport, particularly as an Olympic event. Let these bland looking couples do their dances on the ice if they must, but let us not pretend that it is possible objectively to decide, in the precise order of one to 20, which of them is best, second best, third best, and so on. Still less should we believe that the public, and its cheer-leaders in the press, are capable of distinguishing precisely between the merits of Torvill and Dean as opposed to those of Grichtchuk and Platov, and Useva and Zhulin, the Russian pairs who gained the gold and silver medals. I doubt whether more than a tiny proportion of the 23m viewers could now remember even the names of the winning Russian couple. But I do wonder why we British have become such consistently bad sporting losers. Perhaps it is simply that we have recently had a lot of practice at it. Or perhaps there is some more profound reason. When Britain was a pre-eminent economic and political power it mattered relatively little whether we also ruled the sporting world. When you are controlling a third of the world's population you can afford to be a little generous on the sporting field. Even when we failed to win, we knew Britain was still the greatest nation on earth, and no mere loss of a cricket game could change that. And if the other side used unfair methods, that merely confirmed British superiority. But now that the pattern of world affairs leaves us with no special place in the sun, we have become petulant and bad tempered. And as children of the welfare state, we are very much at home with the thought that whatever goes wrong is always someone else's fault. Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

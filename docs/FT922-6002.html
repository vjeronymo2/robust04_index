			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Oil groups may form mutual insurer SEDGWICK, the UK insurance broker, and Price Waterhouse, the accountants and management consultants, are joining forces in a bid to help leading European oil and gas companies form a new mutual insurance company. The new mutual, which could have a capital base of more than Dollars 50m and a minimum of 15 members, would provide extra insurance capacity in the specialist energy insurance market, where rates have increased and capacity diminished following recent losses. Since December, Sedgwick and Price Waterhouse have conducted feasibility studies and intend to hold more detailed talks with their clients within the next two weeks. No company has yet agreed to join the proposed mutual, but both organisations report a general feeling of support from their clients for the concept. 'We believe the support is there. We are literally having clients say to us 'when can we have it?',' said Mr Chris Mundy, director of marketing at Sedgwick Energy, the broker's specialist subsidiary. 'We would like to think we would be putting together a cast iron proposal within the next four to six weeks,' he added. Mr Mundy said there was an urgent need for action because of the contraction in available capacity. Sedgwick's 200 clients include British Petroleum, Shell and Mobil. Several oil majors which have North American interests are already part of a mutual company, Oil Insurance Ltd (OIL), which was formed in the late 1960s. Hit by losses such as the explosion of the Piper Alpha rig in the North Sea in July 1988, specialist energy insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's of London, have increased rates and reduced the amount of cover available. Last year, buyers faced rate increases of between 15 and 200 per cent.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei firmer ahead of options settlements A ROUND of small-lot buying at the end of the session lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average closed moderately higher amid quiet pre-holiday trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average gained 67.73 at 17,089.90, having fallen to the day's low of 16,897.86 in the morning session. It recovered towards the close and hit the day's high of 17,092.00. Volume was little changed at 190m shares against 186m. Activity centred on position adjustment and technical trading by dealers and arbitrageurs ahead of Friday's options settlements. Declines, however, retained a small lead over rises at the close by 474 to 436, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost a net 0.17 at 1,295.93, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.38 to 1,044.19. Most investors remained absent ahead of today's national holiday. The sharp rise in the yen against the dollar also unnerved some investors, while the weekend meeting between Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, was also focusing attention. Traders said prices moved forward just before the close in technical trading linked to options activity. The settlement price for February options contracts will be fixed on Friday morning. Export-oriented high technology issues lost ground on the higher yen. Fujitsu retreated Y20 to Y537, while Sony fell Y60 to Y4,080 and TDK, the tape maker, lost Y120 to Y3,370. Speculative trading by dealers also led activity. Gajoen Kanko, the ailing hotel and restaurant operator, advanced Y25 to Y265 and Nagase moved ahead Y45 to Y830. Isuzu Motors, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y380 on the 'restructuring theme', while Nissan Chemical appreciated Y8 to Y758. Non-ferrous metal producers eased on falling gold prices. Sumitomo Metal Mining lost Y1 to Y649 and Mitsubishi Materials Y2 to Y407. Housing-related stocks advanced on reports of strong condominium sales in January. Daikyo, the leading condominium developer, rose Y29 to Y824 and Mitsui Home gained Y50 to Y1,570 on the second section. Some oil refiners were firmer on prospects of lower oil import prices due to the higher yen: Showa Shell Sekiyu put on Y30 at Y1,490. Arabian Oil climbed Y50 to Y3,700 on reports that a consortium, including the company, had started an oil development project off the Vietnamese coast. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 22.18 to 18,474.38 in volume of 52.4m shares. Roundup POLITICAL considerations came to the fore in some Pacific Rim markets. AUSTRALIAN shares were mostly firmer as the market took a lead from better than expected half-year results from Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The All Ordinaries index added 7.2 at 1,591.1 in turnover that slowed to ADollars 153m. Shares in Commonwealth Bank, in which the government has a 70 per cent stake, were 23 cents higher at ADollars 6.20. HONG KONG began quietly, again inhibited by the political outlook, but a late burst of buying, particularly of banking shares, helped the Hang Seng index finish 46.03 stronger at 5,835.55 in turnover of HKDollars 1.9bn. TAIWAN made a strong start but succumbed to heavy profit-taking in reaction to news that Provincial Governor Lien Chan was being nominated as premier. The weighted index, more than 80 points higher at mid-morning, ended a net 58.93 down at 3,578.10. BANGKOK was led higher by demand for bank shares and the SET index gained 17.45, or 1.8 per cent, at 990.13. BOMBAY rose for the third consecutive session, with speculative buying taking the BSE index up 40.44 to 2,812.12.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Smith pledge on human rights Sir, While welcoming the warm reception you provided for John Smith's commitment towards incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights (Leader, March 3 1993), I must take issue with your assertion that a Ministry of Justice and a Commission on Human Rights would be 'over-egging the pudding'. If a Human Rights Bill is to succeed, it will require a fundamental shift in attitudes. New institutions will have to be set up and old ones reformed if the transformation of our constitution and society is to be real rather than merely cosmetic. For citizens to feel confident in the judges who protect their rights, there must be fundamental shifts both in their method of appointment and their training. Currently our senior judiciary are appointed by the Lord Chancellor's department in a process free from even the most basic scrutiny. That process must be made more open, and subject to review by the legislature - perhaps by a Legal Affairs Departmental Select Committee or Committee of both Houses. The law, as defender of individual rights, will have to be made more accessible. A Ministry of Justice responsible for, but separate from, our legal system is a necessary prerequisite for genuine judicial reform. Accountability to Parliament could take place through a Secretary of State for Justice. To assist ordinary people in their claims for redress, a Commission on Human Rights is vital. Citizens who have had their rights violated but do not have the time, expertise or financial means to pursue their case should be able to seek the assistance of the Commission where necessary. In addition, the Commission would be capable of identifying areas of concern over rights, pursuing test cases and suggesting codes of good practice, in much the same way that the Commission for Racial Equality does in relation to anti-discrimination legislation. Labour's Democratic Agenda, as expounded by John Smith on Monday, is radicaI and far-reaching. It seeks to challenge every part of our outdated and archaic constitution. Merely incorporating the ECHR and legislating for freedom of information is not enough. Alongside must come a commitment to reviewing, and if necessary replacing, institutions devised before the advent of popular democracy.

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / PRI 'set to win' in Mexico The ruling party in Mexico is set for a comfortable victory in the presidential election next month, according to a new opinion poll by the Indemerc/Louis Harris organisation. It gave Mr Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), 50.3 per cent support, against 32.2 per cent for Mr Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the centre-right opposition. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, candidate of the left, was shown as a poor third on 13.4 per cent. Opinion polls are very controversial in Mexico. Some analysts contend that respondents are unwilling to reveal opposition to the governing party, which has been in power for 65 years. Pollsters emphasise that preferences are unusually volatile this year and that the final result will probably be affected by the turnout on August 21, which is hard to predict. However, the Indemerc/Louis Harris poll was based on 2,550 interviews in 25 states, making it much more extensive than most polls in Mexico. It was paid for by members of Mexico's Chamber of Radio and Television. Mr Zedillo's big lead is at odds with recent polls by Mori of Mexico, which show Mr Zedillo and Mr Fernandez neck and neck. But the Mori poll is based on a sample of about 300 from five main cities, giving it a larger margin of error. The Indemerc/Harris poll showed Mr Zedillo leading by 56:24 per cent in rural areas, by tradition strong PRI ground. In the cities, Mr Zedillo had 47:37 per cent over Mr Fernandez. Mr Fernandez has been affected by his low-key campaign since a television debate in May, which he was judged to have won. The poll shows his support then at a peak of 41 per cent, several points ahead of Mr Zedillo. Since May, though, his support has slipped and Mr Zedillo has gained.</p>

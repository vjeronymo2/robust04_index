			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] New Housing Minister Joe Slovo spelt out preliminary  but ambitious plans for his portfolio yesterday, including the  establishment of a national housing bank and the implementation  of a mortgage indemnity scheme.    An upbeat Slovo expressed support for agreements already  achieved by the National Housing Forum, and endorsed the concept  of the provision of housing as a kick-start for the economy.    Slovo said priority had to be given to the poor, who had  been  ignored largely in the past and had to be brought into the  mainstream of policy. He stressed all major players would need  to be engaged, especially the private sector, which had a  "seminal" role to play. Slovo mooted the idea of a housing  summit to gain wide involvement and establish a logic to the  provision of housing, which had been somewhat "constipated."    The provision of housing could be a major generator of jobs,  but for this to happen there had to be a great degree of market  certainty to release the "latent energy" in the sector. The  idea of a national housing bank had to be realised, although the  details needed to be planned with care. Slovo said one of his  major tasks would be to develop a good relationship with the  provincial housing administrations.    The ANC's reconstruction and development programme specified  that 1-million "housing units" should be built within five  years, which Slovo said was realisable although it might not be  possible to build 370,000 houses in the first year.    Slovo said he was "over the moon" about his portfolio.    "We have been talking liberation, but this will be the  beginning of making liberation...There is so much goodwill, I  think there is a very good chance we can make a breakthrough."</p>

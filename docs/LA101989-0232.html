BRIEFING;  </P> <P> OLDER MANAGERS FIND JOBS FASTER  </P> <P> Out-of-work managers over age 50 found jobs faster than their younger  colleagues in the job market last summer, according to a survey released today  by Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc.  </P> <P> "The results represent the first time in 15 years of tracking job searches that  the 50-and-over age group has surpassed its younger counterparts in the length  of time it takes to find a new job," said James E. Challenger, president and  founder of the job-search consulting firm.  </P> <P> The firm's survey of third-quarter employment patterns showed the median time  needed for an out-of-work manager age 50 or over to find new work was 3.23  months. Unemployed managers in all other age groups required a median time of  3.26 months.  </P></p>

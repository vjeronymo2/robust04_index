			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUNS OFFER MINIMUM TO NO. 1 DRAFT PICK  </P> <P> The Phoenix Suns announced today they have decided to offer first-round draft  pick Jayson Williams only a one-year contract for the minimum $170,000 salary  and he likely won't be on their NBA roster this season.  </P> <P> Williams, a forward from St. John's, returned to his home in New York and was  not immediately available for comment.  </P> <P> "His options are many," Suns President Jerry Colangelo said at a news  conference. "He's welcome to come to training camp (starting Friday in  Flagstaff). I don't think that's in the cards. No. 2, he can sit out the entire  year and go back in the next college draft and we will retain his rights until  then.  </P> <P> "No. 3, he can go to Europe and play and we would still retain his rights. And  No. 4, we could trade his rights. If anyone's interested, they can call."  </P> <P> Colangelo said he and Suns head Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons met with Williams last  Thursday and the rookie told them he'd rather play for an East Coast team.  </P> <P> Phoenix drafted the 6-foot-10, 240-pound Williams at No. 21 overall in the June  27 draft although he missed all but 13 games of his senior season last year  with a fractured bone in his right foot. It was surgically repaired in January  but he hasn't played a game since Feb. 3.  </P> <P> Williams angered Suns officials when he skipped the team's rookie and free  agent camp here in July, saying he wouldn't be ready to play until Sept. 1.  </P> <P> On Aug. 31, Williams' agent, Bob Woolf, informed Colangelo that his client was  considering signing a one-year, $1.5-million contract with the Italian pro team  Il Messaggero. That deal never materialized and Williams joined the Suns for  informal workouts Sept. 13.  </P> <P> "Jayson had to demonstrate to us with his work ethic and attitude that he  wanted to be a member of the Phoenix Suns. The bottom line is we didn't see  that," Colangelo said.  </P></p>

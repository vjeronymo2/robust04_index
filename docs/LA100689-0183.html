			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S. OKS FORD 15% JAGUAR PURCHASE  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co. has received U.S. regulatory clearance to buy up to 15% of  Jaguar PLC, a spokesman for Ford's British unit said today.  </P> <P> Ford received early clearance by the Federal Trade Commission, which must  approve major share acquisitions under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, said the Ford  United Kingdom spokesman.  </P> <P> Jaguar shares closed $1 higher at $11.77 on London's Stock Exchange. Volume was  a heavy 13 million shares.  </P> <P> It was not immediately clear whether Ford had purchased any Jaguar shares  today. It previously owned about 1% of the British luxury auto maker.  </P> <P> Jaguar's rules of association prohibit any shareholder from taking more than a  15% stake before the end of 1990 and give the British government a "golden"  share with which it may block any bid for the formerly state-owned company.  </P> <P> Jaguar has characterized Ford's stake-buying as unwelcome and says it wants to  remain independent.  </P></p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Arts: The Seagull - Lilian Baylis Theatre The most obvious feature of Mike Alfreds' version of The Seagull for the Oxford Stage Company is that it looks extraordinary, not because of any design-led flight of fancy but because of its conception of the people involved. The members of Chekhov's country house party appear like a cross between the background interest in a Renoir painting and a convention of Lithuanian nationalists. The men sport big-bottomed beards; the women are simply big-bottomed. Even the luckless seagull, bagged by the fretful Konstantin, is an albatross in all but name. Biggest and brashest of all is Pam Ferris, whose Arkadina is no elegant Muscovite, bestowing her refined presence on her country estate, but a corpulent diva with an all-engulfing presence, who erupts into unconfined temper tantrums and as quickly erupts out of them again. When she steps on to her son's rickety little stage, after ridiculing his play off it, the structure shakes under her weight, its little proscenium arch no match for her voluminous coiffure. One can well imagine her appeal to a restless spirit like Trigorin, who could simply bury his sense of inadequacy in her massive bulk; likewise, she makes it woefully clear why her son, Konstantin, has never grown up. Michael Mueller presents a man spiritually and materially squashed by a mother who bandages his head one minute and hurls insults at him the next. 'While I'm away, you won't go click-click again,' she beseeches him. It is the nearest she gets to acknowledging his desperation, her choice of childish euphemism underlining her childlike refusal to face his attempted suicide. The refusal is so complete that it makes a charade of her attempt to prevent Trigorin from leaving her for the younger Nina. This central scene, which anchors the characterisation of Arkadina to a sense that her day is past, loses its meaning when it is played by an emotional illiterate. She weeps, bullies and finally, having reduced Trigorin to hopeless tears, bustles off with a smug smile on her face, her sense of her own importance confirmed. Alfreds' preoccupation with grandiloquence of emotion and gesture creates a sore problem for Irena Brook, whose visually lovely Nina - a gift for the declamation of Konstantin's sweet nothings - signally fails to gather the required stature along the way. Her reappearance, a fallen woman, in the final act is certainly not the stuff of tragedy as Arkadina would know it; this haggard little slip is merely pathetic - and rather less so than Caroline Quentin's slatternly Masha, whose capacity for melodramatising her misery gives her a sombre momentum. So what of the men? One is tempted to leave them till last because they are so entirely dwarfed by the women. Nicholas Clay builds the character of the usually urbane Trigorin around a sphynx-like smile into his beard, as if the successful writer is lost for the appropriate words. It is as hard to imagine him indulging a casual amour as it is to envisage Roger Frost's skinny schoolmaster fathering Masha's family, or Ric Morgan's brusque doctor sustaining a 20-year liaison with Dawn Keeler's fluttery Polina. It is all interesting and different enough, until one starts to look for the Chekhovian heart.</p>

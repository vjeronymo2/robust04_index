			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Federated lifts first-quarter profit to Dollars 18m FEDERATED Department Stores, one of the largest department store operators in the US, and taking in chains such as Bloomingdale's and Jordan Marsh, yesterday unveiled an after-tax profit of Dollars 18.2m for the 13 weeks to May 1, on sales of Dollars 1.59bn. The results compared with profits of Dollars 11.8m and sales of Dollars 1.57bn in the first quarter of 1992. Operating profit, year-on-year, rose from Dollars 80.3m to Dollars 82.9m. The after-tax figure in the current year was struck after a Dollars 3.54m extraordinary item related to early debt repayment. Mr Allen Questrom, chairman, described the first quarter as 'moderately good' and in line with expectations. He noted the weather had not been generally helpful, and consumers appeared to have lingering doubts about the economy.</p>

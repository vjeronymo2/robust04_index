			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>   [Excerpt] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 13 Feb (EFE)  -- The Armed Forces have discreetly intensified military  surveillance in the conflict zone in Chiapas State in the  southeastern part of Mexico. At the same time, the Zapatist  National Liberation Army (EZLN) is continuing its diplomatic  offensive by forwarding letters to various social organizations.    The community of Altamirano, 850 km southeast of Mexico City  and one of the four communities attacked by the EZLN in the wake  of its 1 January offensive, remains virtually occupied by the  Armed Forces. Cording to an official communique, however, the  Armed Forces intend to simply maintain a garrison at the  entrance of the community. Most people in Altamirano who do not  have to work remain indoors most of the time and prefer to keep  their opinions on the conflict to themselves. During a brief  tour of the community, soldiers supported by jeeps and tanks  could be seen on every street. Also, heightened security  measures are in effect in the nearby mountainous area where it  is believed the Zapatist presence is the strongest.    Since the conflict began, the Mexican Army has maintained  some 17,000 soldiers at its primary base in Rancho Nuevo, 10 km  southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas. As of 15 January when  a truce was declared, the Army gradually started to withdraw  from the towns of San Cristobal, Ocosingo, and Las Margaritas,  and it has set up checkpoints at the entrance of each of these  communities.    Yesterday, the Army increased the number of troops at the  fork in the road leading to Ranch Nuevo and Ocosingo. Ocosingo  is an access point into the Lacandona jungle, which is a  Zapatist stronghold.    Meanwhile, Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  national reconciliation; Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de  las Casas; and more than 300 journalists are still awaiting a  possible meeting with the EZLN. The meeting was postponed  several times over the past week.    In his Sunday homily today, Bishop Samuel Ruiz reiterated  that famine is the most serious problem facing the Chiapas  Indians who, according to official figures, total 1 million.    While waiting for the meeting between the Zapatists and the  government to take place, Camacho Solis is maintaining contact  with the EZLN by way of confidential letters. Meanwhile, the  EZLN also is sending messages to other intermediators. The  meeting between the EZLN and the government is expected to take  place in a Chiapas community which has yet to be determined.  [passage omitted]</p>

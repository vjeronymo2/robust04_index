			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / EU to discuss budget fraud The fight against massive budget fraud will be on the agenda when European Union finance ministers meet in Brussels today, Reuters quotes diplomats in Brussels. The meeting will discuss a report on the EU's 1992 budget from the Luxembourg-based Court of Auditors which calculates that some Ecu170m was wasted in irregular outlays and lost receipts that year. Britain, which has pinned its flag to the fight against fraud in the run-up to the European Parliament elections in June, is pushing for fraud against the EU budget to be treated as a criminal offence as is fraud against national budgets. The meeting will also discuss the tricky issue of setting a time limit on opening up access to the EU budget's emergency monetary reserve to include agri-monetary costs.</p>

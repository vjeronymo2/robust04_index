			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / More Maastricht to come: Europe Maastricht is not a popular treaty. After so much hassle, disappointment and interminable argument, many may feel, not unreasonably, that they've already heard just about as much as they can stand, and wish the politicians would change the subject. If so, they are destined to be disappointed. For we are probably on the threshold of yet another Europe-wide debate about the treaty, which is likely to inaugurate the biggest and most politically charged discussion on the future of Europe since the epic struggles of the 1960s. This debate is unavoidable. The treaty is a ramshackle structure with disparate pieces tacked together, some of which were improvised in haste in response to German unification. And the consequence of improvisation and ambiguity, and of the impact of outside events, is that it does not look viable as framed. The programme for monetary union obviously needs to be re-examined, if only because a significant number of member states will not be able, and some will not be willing, to meet the conditions for a single currency. The commitment to a common foreign policy looks merely ridiculous in the light of the Yugoslav disaster. In theory these treaty imperfections could be side-stepped: those who don't want a single currency or a single foreign policy could simply stay outside the integrationist stream, and the Community would gradually diverge on variable-geometry lines. But there is one new problem facing the Community which cannot be side-stepped: how far can it expand with new members, and what will be the institutional consequences? This is the issue which makes unavoidable the debate now getting under way. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has tried to hijack that debate in advance, so as to pre-empt any attempt by others to press for an acceleration of the traditional Community integration process. His vision of the Community, which he has set out in a long article in The Economist, is of a Europe which is large and loose, inter-governmental rather than integrated. In place of the old (and discredited) objective of European Monetary Union, it needs a new agenda, whose immediate priorities should be the conclusion of the Uruguay trade round, the deregulation of labour markets and the slimming of welfare costs. The longer objective should be to include the whole of Europe. This anti-integrationist vision is a characteristically British recipe. It is unlikely to prove any more persuasive to the other member states today, however, than it has in the past. The original six, at least, have been committed to an integrationist model of the Community for 40 years. They will not abandon it lightly, least of all to please Britain. By contrast, a far-reaching integrationist vision has already been marked out by Germany's ruling Christian Democrat party, in a paper drafted by Mr Karl Lamers, the party's foreign affairs spokesman. Even if this is not an official government document, it is likely to indicate where Germany will stand at next month's Community summit. Like Mr Major, Mr Lamers insists on the need to reach a successful conclusion of the Uruguay round. But on almost every other issue his vision of Europe is diametrically opposed to that of Mr Major. He maintains, for example, that 'it is essential, despite the problems that have recently beset the EMS, that the goal of monetary union and the timetable proposed be adhered to'. In other areas of the Maastricht treaty, the Community must press ahead with policy integration: asylum and immigration, the fight against organised crime, and a common foreign policy. Security policy is an issue of clear divergence of emphasis between the British and German visions. Mr Major stresses the importance of Nato, within which 'the Europeans should take on greater responsibility'. But Mr Lamers says that the Western European Union defence grouping should be strengthened 'and equipped with military forces', as the best way to ensure a continued American commitment. The biggest gulf between Major and Lamers concerns the Community's institutions. They both believe that the Community must eventually take in the countries of eastern Europe. But whereas Mr Major wants an intergovernmental Community of nation states, Mr Lamers believes enlargement requires a strengthening of the integration principle. 'The expansion of the Community . . . must not be allowed to weaken the degree of integration already achieved by the present core; on the contrary this must be strengthened. Otherwise the European Union will not be able to help solve the increasingly life-threatening crises of the nations that make it up . . . For that reason, institutional reforms of the Community must be undertaken in parallel to the membership negotiations currently in hand with the Efta countries.' These institutional reforms should include a radical strengthening of majority voting in the Council of Ministers, combined with a sharp reduction in the voting premium currently enjoyed by the small member states. The most dramatic change would be the abandonment of all unanimous voting, to be replaced by a 'super-qualified majority': with votes of four-fifths of the members representing at least four-fifths of the population. The Lamers vision is obviously overambitious. But if anything like it is put forward by Germany next month, we can be sure that it will open up a far-reaching debate about fundamental principles which were left on one side during the Maastricht negotiations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian  Liberal Democratic Party, arrived from Moscow at Ljubljana  airport on an Adria Airways aircraft last night. Together with  his three companions, he was forced to spent the night at the  airport as the Slovene immigration officials would not allow him  entry.    In light of the experiences of his latest visit,  Zhirinovskiy  is supposedly persona non grata in our country. Zhirinovskiy  lodged a protest with the immigration organs, while the Russian  Embassy in Ljubljana has not reacted so far.    The Slovene border officials would not allow members of the  press to come in contact with Zhirinovskiy. He is supposed to  return to Moscow at 1355 today on a regular flight of the  Russian carrier Aeroflot. [passage omitted]</p>

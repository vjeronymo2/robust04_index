			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Thames Water in Malaysia row Thames Water has become embroiled in a political row in Malaysia, as the country continues its ban on awarding government contracts to British companies. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's deputy prime minister, has criticised the local government in the north Malaysian state of Kelantan because he says its leaders have awarded a water supply contract to Thames. Mr Anwar accused the local authority of defying government policy. The Kelantan government says it awarded the contract at the end of last month. The Malaysian government imposed its ban on British companies in February in retaliation for critical comments about the Malaysian leadership that appeared in the British press. Mr Mike Hoffman, group chief executive of Thames, has denied that any such contract has yet been awarded. Mr Hoffman said that Thames had been 'working very hard' to win the water distribution contract in Kelantan but a final decision had not yet been made. 'We are up against a lot of international competition, but I would suspect that we have got to the point where we are in the lead,' he said. The reason for the confusion is not clear. Kelantan is the only state in the Malaysian federation not controlled by the governing national front coalition. In recent months the authorities in Kelantan and the federal government in Kuala Lumpur have been involved in a number of bitter arguments. A number of British companies are believed to have lost multi-million pound contracts as a result of the ban.</p>

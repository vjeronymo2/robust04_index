			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONDOM PROGRAM  </P> <P> Chancellor Joseph Fernandez of the New York City schools recently recommended  distribution of condoms in his schools to help promote "safe sex." Your Sept.  30 editorial congratulated the chancellor for his leadership in this regard,  and for keeping his personal religious convictions (Catholic) separate from his  secular responsibilities.  </P> <P> But there should be no difference between the religious and the secular. His  moral and religious convictions should be intertwined with all his  responsibilities. Isn't he supposed to tell the truth in church, as well as in  school?  </P> <P> What we in Los Angeles, and they in New York, need most are more public leaders  who do not separate their personal, moral, religious beliefs from the rest of  life, but bring those truths, values and convictions to bear on every problem  society faces.  </P> <P> RAYMOND H. LARSEN  </P> <P> Glendora  </P></p>

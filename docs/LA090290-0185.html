			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> * Taking the Fifth: Eric Show, Mike Dunne and Calvin Schiraldi have all tried  to become the fifth starter in the San Diego Padres' rotation with a startling  lack of success. They have started 24 games, pitched into the seventh inning  only three times and won just two games in that role. A fifth starter, a  regular shortstop and a third baseman top the Padres' winter shopping list, but  it's not clear who will be doing the shopping. New owner Tom Werner has  re-hired Greg Riddoch as manager but is yet to make a definitive call on  General Manager Jack McKeon.  </P> <P> * Nixon Library: With Otis Nixon having stolen 41 bases in only 165 at-bats,  Richard Griffin, the Montreal Expos' publicity director, went to the books and  discovered that Miguel Dilone of the 1978 Oakland Athletics had the fewest  at-bats among players who have stolen 50 bases in a season. Dilone had 258.  </P> <P> * Add Steals: Eric Yelding, through Thursday, had stolen 50 bases, had been  caught stealing 21 times and has a chance to break Houston's club records in  both categories. Gerald Young set them in 1988 when he stole 65 bases and was  caught 27 times.  </P> <P> * Baines a Pain: One other aspect of the Oakland Athletics' acquisition of  Harold Baines concerns preparations for a likely meeting with the Boston Red  Sox in the American League playoffs. Baines has a .333 average against Roger  Clemens and a .367 average against Mike Boddicker, Boston's top two starters.  </P> <P> * Mismatch: Once a highly regarded prospect with the New York Yankees, Brad  Arnsberg has rebounded from Tommy John-type elbow surgery in 1988 and revived  his career in the Texas Rangers' bullpen with a 5-1 record and five saves. But  he shouldn't pitch against the Angels. In four appearances spanning 4 2/3  innings, he has allowed nine hits, six earned runs and three homers, among them  shots by Devon White and Lance Parrish during the Angels' three-game sweep last  week. In 46 1/3 innings against the rest of the league, Arnsberg has allowed  only 33 hits and three earned runs. ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

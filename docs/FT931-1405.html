			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's oil investment 'set to peak this year' INVESTMENT IN Norway's offshore oil and gas industry will peak this year at NKr51bn (Pounds 4.95bn), a 17 per cent increase over 1992, and NKr209bn is expected to be invested over the next five years, according to a report soon to be issued by Edinburgh-based oil analyst Wood Mackenzie. This year, the Norwegian state, through its direct financial interest and Statoil, the state oil company, will be the major investor, with capital expenditure of an estimated NKr32bn, or 63 per cent of the total. The report says the state's financial return will move from a relatively weak position in the early to mid-1990s . . 'to be generating over NKr40bn per annum,' late in the decade, 75 per cent greater than combined oil companies' cash flows. 'There are several companies. . . which will have negative cash flows until the mid to late 1990s,' the report says. WoodMac says investments in fields in production peaked in 1986, but substantial expenditure is expected to be made on several fields, notably Ekofisk, where some NKr10bn may be spent in the mid-1990s on a major upgrading of the ageing facilities, where at least one new platform may be required. Expenditure only on fields under development will peak this year at about NKr37.7bn, while expenditure on probable developments is expected to ensure an annual investment level of NKr25bn in the mid to late 1990s, says WoodMac. However, the analyst says that several of Norway's current field development projects have been characterised by a series of cost over-runs and delays. Higher costs, estimated at NKr2bn, have arisen on the Sleipner East project because ofdue to the sinking of the original platform, while increases have ocurred on the Troll, Draugen, Heidrun and Sleipner West fields because of design changes.</p>

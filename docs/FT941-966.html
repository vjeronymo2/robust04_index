			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Seoul calm while world media panic 'I don't worry about a war breaking out,' said Ms Choi Kwang-hun as she peered from the observation deck of Seoul Tower at the city that North Korea recently said it would turn into 'a sea of fire'. Ms Choi, a housewife in her mid-forties, and most of the city's other 10m residents appear calm in spite of the threats of war traded between North and South Korea over the past week. Although the subject of war has become a dominant topic of conversation, it has had little affect on life in the sprawling environs of Seoul, only 35 miles from the North Korean border. There are few, if any, outward signs of preparations for an emergency. Indeed, it is the rest of the world that seems more concerned over a possible military attack from the North. Panic selling of Korean stocks by foreign investors helped cause the bourse's general index to fall by 2.3 per cent last week. Hotels are reporting cancellations by overseas tourists, casting a pall over what has been proclaimed as 'Visit Korea Year'. 'The general feeling among many Koreans is that the crisis is the result of international media hysteria,' said one US-educated Korean businessman. The relaxed attitude displayed by South Koreans reflects that the country has lived with a threat from the North for 40 years, with tensions rising and falling regularly. Koreans have also developed a fatalistic attitude after a century of invasions and political upheaval. But there are clear generation differences in reactions. Middle-aged Koreans, who grew up with the Korean War of 1950-53 and remember UN troops saving their destitute country, believe that international support will resolve the dispute this time. 'I believe the US and the UN will prevent a war from happening,' said Ms Choi. But younger Koreans, whose national self-confidence has grown with the country's rapid economic progress, blame the US for aggravating tensions by deploying US Patriot missiles. They are also more sceptical about the seriousness of the threat that the North poses. 'The former military governments used to use the North Korean threat as a justification for keeping the people under authoritarian control,' said one student. 'Conservative hardliners may be using this to assert their power once again by giving maximum publicity to war-like statements from the north.' There is also a sharp divide in reactions among Seoul's foreign expatriates. 'The old-timers are taking this in stride, while the newcomers are ready to pack their bags and leave,' said Mr Alan Plumb, the long-time head of the Rolls-Royce office in Seoul. When a London broker recently rang in the middle of the night to ask about rumours that war was about to break out, 'I couldn't get back to sleep,' confesses Ms Anne Lowell, an analyst for Baring Securities in Seoul. Discussions among foreigners have focused on evacuation plans if the North Koreans invade. Those who live on the trendy south side of the Han River, which divides the city as the Thames does London, count themselves lucky since it would be easier to flee. Those living north of the river worry about the destruction of 19 bridges that would leave them trapped. The evacuation procedures drawn up by the US military to get foreigners out of the city did not inspire confidence. Foreign citizens would have to gather at the big US military base at Yongsan in central Seoul, considered a prime target for North Korean Scud missiles and artillery. They would then leave the city by bus, a formidable feat at the best of times given Seoul's notorious traffic jams. 'Personally, I'm relying on a good pair of trainers instead,' said one US official.</p>

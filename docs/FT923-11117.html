			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / International Company News: Aer Lingus cuts value of GPA stake by IPounds 22m AER LINGUS has reduced the value of its stake in GPA Group, the aircraft leasing group, by IPounds 21.9m (Pounds 20.6m) in its accounts for the year to March 31. Its 8.76 per cent stake is valued at about IPounds 113m, based on exchange rates ruling at March 31. This implies a price of Dollars 18.50 for each GPA share at March 31, compared to the range of Dollars 20-Dollars 25 a share (before a two-for-one split) which GPA set for its failed international public offering last month. GPA said the price of Dollars 18.50 a share was in line with its estimates of current value, though there has been no trading in GPA shares since the offer was cancelled. Aer Lingus's carrying value has been adjusted to take account of the airline's legal and administrative costs relating to the stake. The airline owns 9.94m shares in GPA, which would have doubled following the proposed split. It hoped to sell a minimum of 4.64m shares in the offering, which was cancelled at the last minute on June 18. Mr Larry Stanley, chief executive of Aer Lingus Commercial Holdings, said the value had been reduced for 'reasons of prudence,' prior to the cancellation in line with the indicated price range. Aer Lingus, one of the founding shareholders in GPA, was one of those most anxious to see the offer proceed. It had planned to use the funds to reduce gearing. It has been released from the 'lock-in' arrangements agreed between GPA and its main shareholders before the offer and is believed to be keen to establish GPA's intentions on seeking a quotation. Mr Stanley said Aer Lingus was adopting a wait and see approach and has had several meetings with GPA to discuss future financing arrangements. 'We were very disappointed with the failure of the international public offering,' he said. 'It was an opportunity for us to get liquid. But we wanted to wait until we have a clearer idea of what GPA intends to do before making any decision. We have no pressing need for funds.'</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> GOVERNOR APPEALS ON ACCESS TO RECORDS  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian has asked the 3rd District Court of Appeal in Sacramento  to reconsider its January ruling that would give journalists and others access  to the governor's daily appointment calendars. The request for a rehearing  argues that the court erred last month when it granted a Los Angeles Times  reporter access to documents listing the people that Deukmejian has met with on  official business since he became governor in 1983.  </P> <P> The California Public Records Act generally requires officials to make  documents available unless there is a strong public interest in not disclosing  them. But Deukmejian contended that the calendars are covered by an exemption  in the law that allows the governor to withhold his "correspondence" -- which  he defined as "interchange of written communications." The Appellate Court  disagreed, saying that the definition used by Deukmejian would allow him to  withhold "virtually every written item in the governor's office."  </P></p>

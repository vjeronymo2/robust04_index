			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- A top opposition lawmaker  said Tuesday [26 April] the ruling coalition is as good as dead  and displayed interest in possible talks with the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan --  SDPJ] which just quit the coalition.    "The ruling coalition has virtually collapsed. Their power  game...has failed," Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP), said at a meeting of party executives,  according to party officials.    Kono also told reporters the LDP is willing to hold talks  with the SDP or new party Sakigake [Harbinger], which were both  key components of the coalition, if they can agree over the  modus operandi of politics.    "I would like to see what stance the two parties take, but  if  they think the same way as we do on how to do politics, we can  have talks."    The SDP walked out of the coalition early Tuesday after it  was enraged by a move by other coalition partners to form a new  parliamentary bloc. The party's withdrawal stripped the  coalition of its majority in the key House of Representatives.    LDP executives met in the morning to discuss how they should  handle the renewed political turmoil, and decided to put up a  united front to cope with the situation.    Kono made clear the LDP will capitalize on the confusion to  regain the ruling status.    "The time has come for a showdown," he said at the meeting.    But he warned against expected moves from the newly-elected  Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata or his coalition partners to lure  away some LDP lawmakers to secure a Diet majority.    Kono criticized Shinseito, headed by Hata, for its "forcible  way" of handling Diet business.    "It is not a true form of democracy that places importance  on  process," he said.    The surprise move among conservative and centrist coalition  members to form a new bloc is widely believed to have been  masterminded by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, a top  coalition strategist and a self-acknowledged behind-the-scenes  negotiator.    Another LDP leader made a more articulate call for an  alliance with the disillusioned SDP.    LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said, "the current  situation is tantamount to anarchy. I am infuriated."    "Let us keep close contact with the SDP," he told the  party's  top brass.</p>

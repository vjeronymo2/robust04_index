			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RIVALS TRYING TO STEAL CUSTOMERS, AT&amp;T SAYS  </P> <P> American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. today accused rival MCI Communications  Corp. and other long-distance companies of trying to steal its customers, but  MCI said the problem was exaggerated and mostly honest mistakes by sales staff.  </P> <P> "In the last six months alone, over 90,000 AT&amp;T customers have told us that  they were victims of slamming," AT&amp;T Vice President Merrill Tutton told a  House Government Operations subcommittee.  </P> <P> Slamming is changing a customer's long-distance service to another company  without permission.  </P> <P> Tutton said the actual number of switches without authorization was probably  several times higher, because many customers did not know they were switched or  did not complain.  </P> <P> MCI Vice President Eugene Eidenberg admitted that slamming does occur but he  said, "Let me state emphatically that the frequency of unauthorized switching  has been grossly exaggerated by AT&amp;T. Much more common than the intentional  switching by an inter-exchange carrier is a simple, honest mistake."  </P> <P> Some customers said they were changed to another long-distance company even  after they told telephone salespeople they did not want to switch. Others said  they were switched without notification and did not find out until they got  their telephone bills.  </P> <P> Market leader AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and other long-distance companies have been  in fierce competition since the breakup of AT&amp;T five years ago.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T has 70% of the nation's long-distance phone market, MCI 15% and Sprint  10%. Smaller companies control the remaining share of the market.  </P> <P> Under terms of the breakup, customers are allowed to choose the long-distance  service they want and are billed through their local telephone company.  </P> <P> AT&amp;T has a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign urging those who  changed to another company to switch back to AT&amp;T.  </P></p>

Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said if the  UN decided to send peacekeeping troops to the West Bank,  Malaysia would consider participating since it already had such  commitments in other countries. Until now, the government has  not received any official proposal from the UN and if there is  any it will be channelled through the UN office, he told  reporters in the northern Penang state Sunday.    However, he said, the decision to send Malaysian soldiers to  serve under the UN would be up to Defence Minister Najib Razak  and the cabinet.</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Survival in a Sarajevo cellar: How Bosnians are coping with life in a city under siege FOR more than a month now Mrs Milica Petrovic, a Serb, and her husband have lived in a cellar in Sarajevo. Above ground, their house in the suburb of Ilidza is being steadily destroyed as the war tears the city apart. Grenades have been hurled into their yard, killing the sheep and chickens. On Thursday, when the city centre and several office blocks and factories were destroyed in some of the most brutal bombardments of the civil war in Yugoslavia, the Petrovics were caught unprepared. They had only a handful of raisins to eat. For days there has been no electricity. The food stored in the freezer has rotted. Milica says: 'The only time I am hungry is in the morning, when I wake and there is silence - no shooting - then I realise that I haven't eaten in days.' All semblance of normality has broken down in Sarajevo as Serb irregulars, backed by the federal army, besiege the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina. There has been no milk or meat for weeks. Serb gunmen have manned roadblocks, stopping all transport of foodstuffs and medicines. The biggest problem is looking after babies and small children. There is no baby food. About half of the city is without electricity, water and telephone lines. The shelling over the past seven weeks has destroyed transport and communications systems. Blocks of flats, factories, mosques, churches and schools are charred skeletons. Sarajevo was once famous for its lively mix of nationalities, Moslems lived side-by-side with Orthodox Serbs and Catholic Croats, surrounded by snow-flecked mountains. The city is now pounded with shells and mortars from the surrounding slopes and its people live in fear. There are several city districts where people are imprisoned in ghettoes. Attempts to leave one's house is tantamount to suicide. When the shelling stops, the snipers take over. A trip to buy bread means risking death. Mothers give their infants water mixed with sugar and bread soaked in water. Women are giving birth in cellars. But in the shelters everyone shares, down to the last cup of coffee and cigarette, regardless of ethnic group. 'Bosnians have an expression 'nikako', meaning 'awful', that's how we are living now. If you can call it that,' says Ms Envera Selimovic, a Moslem and a journalist. 'Sarajevo still manages in some way to be what it was before - people try to help, either with food or by taking care of each other's children. My Moslem neighbour gave cooking gas to a Serbian friend who had no electricity,' says Mrs Marijana Jovovic-Bilandzic, 31, a Montenegrin who is married to a Croat. She explains the only time she felt panicked was yesterday when Radio Sarajevo was cut off. 'I felt scared by the silence.' The only way to communicate is via the radio which broadcasts messages giving news to stranded relatives. Amid these stories of everyday life in Bosnia, allegations of atrocities committed by Serbs when seizing mainly Moslem neighbouring towns have emerged. Diplomats fear the death toll is much higher than the official figure of 1,320. A witness from Bratunac, which is 64 per cent Moslem, tells how Serb irregulars rounded up and shot dead several hundred Moslem men in the local sports arena. Some refugees from Bratunac, on Bosnia's eastern border with Serbia, say the men are still alive and are being held captive. But Mrs Jovovic-Bilandzic warns: 'There is a darker side to this insanity. An irreversible hatred erupts in a person who has lost a close relative. If he is a Moslem he will hate and try to kill anyone who is a Serb.' Ms Selimovic says: 'The policy of the Serbian Democratic party is to sow hatred and create chaos. If it continues like this, they will succeed in their goal.' UN call to end fighting, Page 2</p>

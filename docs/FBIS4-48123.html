			<p>BFN     [Text] President of the Republic Jose Eduardo dos Santos  has just returned from South Africa, where he was a guest at  South African President Nelson Mandela's inauguration. The head  of state was welcomed at Luanda's international 4 February  airport by National Assembly Chairman Dr. Franca van Dunem.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] How did you  find the inauguration ceremony?    [Dos Santos] It was a well organized ceremony. It was an  historic time and many foreign delegations were there. I think  that South Africa is now entering a new stage in its history.  Let us hope that the new government will not only respond to  internal expectations but also to African expectations.    [Correspondent] Mr. President: Do you think that Portuguese  President Mario Soares (?can) influence Jonas Savimbi concerning  peace in this country?    [Dos Santos] No, you know full well that the Angolan peace  process has a well defined framework provided by the Bicesse  Accord, the relevant UN resolutions, and, eventually, an accord  that may be signed in Lusaka. I had a meeting with President  Mario Soares but I only asked him to ask Savimbi what he wants.  [end recording]    The Angolan head of state was also welcomed by Prime  Minister  Marcolino Moco, Attorney General Domingos Cololo, and other  government officials.</p>

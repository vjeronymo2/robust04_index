			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S DEAL: A SHARE OF POWER FOR REPUBLICS, A STRONGER HAND FOR HIMSELF  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is offering his country a new political  deal, a broadening of local government rights in exchange for an increase in  his powers. Most here will doubtless ask: Will this put meat in the shops? Will  it end the turmoil in the Caucasus?  </P> <P> "People are tired and expect radical measures," one member of the Supreme  Soviet (legislature) said last weekend. "They have no faith in the president,  the prime minister, the Supreme Soviet." Give them dependable supplies of bread  and medicine, she said, and again there will be trust.  </P> <P> By eliminating the post of chairman of the Council of Ministers, or Soviet  prime minister, and taking direct command of the state bureaucracy, Gorbachev  seeks to do just that.  </P> <P> At one stroke, he would become the day-to-day chief of the ministries that  millions of his countrymen accuse of thwarting reform and also gracefully  dispose of an ally, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who is now a political  liability.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's proposals for the overhaul of the executive branch, sketched in his  brief speech to the national legislature Saturday, raise many questions, but  perhaps the most fundamental is what the reaction of populist Boris N. Yeltsin  will be.  </P> <P> If Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation and the most respected  politician in the country, were to declare his opposition to the plan, its  success would be inconceivable.  </P> <P> At first, Yeltsin associates such as Vladimir K. Varov, chairman of the Russian  legislature's panel on political reform, seemed to reject Gorbachev's ideas as  an infringement on Russia's sovereignty. But on Sunday, the Tass news agency  said that Deputy Prime Minister Grigory Yavlinsky had concluded that  Gorbachev's proposals and Yeltsin's appeal for a national coalition government  "are not incompatible."  </P> <P> Everything now depends on "how people will implement the president's ideas,  what course of action they will take and what mechanism they will use," the  Russian government official told Tass, sounding as though the only remaining  dispute with Gorbachev could be over means and tactics.  </P> <P> However, the exact opinion of Yeltsin himself remained unknown. He pointedly  stayed away from the Kremlin the morning that Gorbachev spoke, and he flew to  the Ukraine on Sunday to sign a treaty establishing "fundamentals of relations"  with that republic, another manifestation of the fracturing of Soviet political  power.  </P> <P> However, comparing Gorbachev's plan and the emergency measures Yeltsin had  recommended to the national legislature on Friday showed apparent points of  convergence. Among them:  </P> <P> Yeltsin asked for a vote of no-confidence in Ryzhkov and his ouster; Gorbachev  wants the 61-year-old prime minister's job eliminated, although the longtime  Gorbachev ally from the Urals could conceivably wind up with some other post.  </P> <P> * Yeltsin seeks an "anti-crisis committee," with representatives from all 15  Soviet republics, to lead the country out of crisis; Gorbachev called for  upgrading the Federation Council, on which Yeltsin and leaders of the other  republics serve, to make it the supreme organ of government.  </P> <P> * Finally, Yeltsin called for a government of "national unity" in which other  parties and factions could share power with Communists; Gorbachev told the  Supreme Soviet that he wants to infuse the Kremlin leadership with "new,  enterprising people with a modern mentality."  </P> <P> Evidently, Gorbachev's proposals are the core of the new union treaty he is  advocating to replace the 1922 agreement that created the Union of Soviet  Socialist Republics, and which soon became a cover for dictatorial Communist  Party rule from Moscow. The text of the proposed new treaty should be published  soon.  </P> <P> In brief, the Soviet president is offering local elites a stake in a revamped  Kremlin power structure by granting the leaders of the republics, sitting with  him on the Federation Council, the right of review over "everything touching  the interests of the entire country."  </P> <P> That sounded alluring, but Soviet officials later made it clear that Gorbachev  would have the final say, even if the leaders of the 15 republics dissented.  What's more, a totally separate body, the National Security Council, will take  charge of defense, security matters and foreign policy.  </P> <P> To have no direct say in those key elements of statehood would be unacceptable  for republics such as Latvia and Georgia, which aspire to complete  independence, and perhaps for Yeltsin's Russia as well, although he has spoken  in favor of a new union treaty.  </P> <P> Ryzhkov, Gorbachev's prime minister since nearly the beginning of the social  and economic reforms now collectively known as perestroika, has become the  bugbear of progressives and radicals. They blame him for torpedoing their  efforts to dismantle the "command system" of state economic management and  create the basis for free enterprise.  </P> <P> Conversely, many conservatives have come to see in him a weak and ineffective  technocrat. On Saturday, speakers from the left and right joined in the Supreme  Soviet to call for a stronger hand. The president should be given such powers,  Grigory Podberezsky of Byelorussia told Gorbachev, "so that people not only  obey you, but also fear you."  </P> <P> A deeper question is how great an effect even Gorbachev can have on the  nation's economic and social life if Soviet legislators grant his wish and  create the institutions he wants.  </P> <P> If Gorbachev, already the general secretary of the Communist Party and Soviet  president, has been unable to arrest economic decline and force obedience of  laws and his decrees with the already impressive powers and institutions at his  command, there is a question how much an institutional reshuffle can  accomplish.  </P></p>

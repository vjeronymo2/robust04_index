			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed program is designed to ensure that substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions are achieved by the aviation industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the strategy neither establishes a hard and fast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions budget or cap for individual commercial airline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators, nor specifies compliance measures. Instead, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program relies on environmental performance targets or emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate goals with fees for excess emissions. The approach leaves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each operator with the discretion to choose the best compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategy for achieving environmental goals and satisfying market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commercial airline may choose to satisfy the emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirements with compliance measures ranging from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relatively straightforward options to very challenging, more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult approaches. EPA's preliminary analysis suggests that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lower end of this range includes such measures as converting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground service equipment to cleaner power sources; increased use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of single engine taxiing; implementing procedural improvements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce congestion and taxi/idle times; purchasing cleaner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current production aircraft; or possibly purchasing emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the upper end of this range, airlines may choose to tow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft rather than taxi with onboard power; substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve load factors; pursue the production of new engine designs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with low-NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  staged-combustion systems which are presently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nearing production for certain applications; or develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional clean engine technology. An airline which continues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have excess emissions after choosing from among these possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures will pay emission fees on its activities. It might then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> choose to limit activity to reduce its total fee liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerns have been raised that this strategy may require airlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to choose operational measures that, for safety reasons, should be left to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the discretion of the pilot in command. For example, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advised that the decisions to reduce use of reverse thrust and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase use of single-engine taxiing should ultimately be those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the pilot.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Beyond these choices, concerns have been raised that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the no-fee emission reduction targets may depend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on technology-forcing aircraft engine development, and that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability for noncompliance fees may directly or indirectly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in a limitation on activity. EPA requests comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood that, and the point within the range of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reductions (e.g., 30&hyph;45 percent for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) at which, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures as advanced engine development may be required. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency also seeks comment on the legal and policy implications of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a strategy that has the potential to create an economic incentive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for airlines to limit operations at airports in the FIP areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA also requests comments on the legal and policy implications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed strategy if, after public comment and further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> study the Agency determines that at the upper end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions reduction range under consideration, the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may have the potential to induce airlines to choose between such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options as encouraging implemention of aircraft operational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures that currently are left to pilot discretion for safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons on the one hand, and limiting the number of operations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the airport on the other. Finally, comment is requested on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between EPA's legal authority under section 110(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and section 231, should the strategy result in the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry having as its only options, outside of activity limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reliance on either technology-forcing aircraft engine advances to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the emission reduction targets, or paying the proposed fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regardless of the means by which compliance is achieved, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed control strategy does not appear to mandate or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly require an accelerated fleet turnover that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially conflict with the schedule established under ANCA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing noise by the end of 1999 (See 49 U.S.C. App. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2157 (a)), because the first FIP controls would not apply until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2001 and the most stringent controls would not be required until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2005. The proposed control strategy also appears consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statutory requirements and mandate for the FAA under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C. App. 1348.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the drafting of the proposed control strategy, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered but rejected requiring the airport proprietor to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement and enforce regulation of the commercial airlines. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected this concept and chose for EPA and FAA to implement and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforce the proposed strategy because the proprietor has more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited authority over the commercial airlines and because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> courts have held that there are limits on EPA's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandate municipal entities to control the behavior of others by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring specific measures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Brown v.

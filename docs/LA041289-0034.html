			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SOLACE FOR SILBERMAN COMES FROM THE SOLE  </P> <P> Charlie Dozzell figured it was the right thing to do, so he didn't hesitate. He  headed straight for the federal courthouse in downtown San Diego on Monday to  offer support for his longtime friend and customer, Richard T. Silberman.  </P> <P> When the two embraced, Silberman lost his public composure for the first time  since his shocking arrest Friday on money-laundering charges.  </P> <P> "When a man is down real bad, like Richard is, that's when he needs people,"  said Dozzell, 70, who operates a shoeshine stand at the Town &amp; Country  Hotel in Mission Valley.  </P> <P> "When my daughter was so sick and needed a doctor, Richard offered to do  whatever I needed to help her," he said. "That's the kind of man he is. All  this other stuff on television and in the paper, that's not Richard."  </P> <P> For nearly two decades, Silberman has had a standing appointment on Saturday  morning to have his shoes (mostly Guccis) shined. "When he didn't arrive on  Saturday, I knew something was very wrong," Dozzell said.  </P> <P> A native of Little Rock, Ark., Dozzell was a dining-car waiter on the Rock  Island Railroad and then a shoeshine proprietor at the Hanalei Hotel for 18  years before moving to the Town &amp; Country in 1964.  </P> <P> In four decades in San Diego, he's seen them all -- lawyers, politicians,  business tycoons, civic leaders. And he has also seen how even the mighty can  fall.  </P> <P> For many years Dozzell had the town's most respected banker as a steady  customer: C. Arnholt Smith.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Calling the Literati  </P> <P> The Fessenden Review, the irreverent-irrelevant La Jolla-based publication that  bills itself as "The Noisiest Book Review in the Known World," has hit  financial problems and asked its readers (whoever they might be) for help.  </P> <P> For 12 editions, the quarterly has provided scholarly insight into books that  the larger reviews ignore: among them, minor works on environmental topics,  offbeat poetry, Liberace and scientific concepts such as "randomly rotating  phreatic fields."  </P> <P> But now the capital assets of The Fessenden Fund, named for turn-of-the-century  physicist Reginald A. Fessenden, have gone dry. A three-page, fund-raising  letter has gone forth, on pea-green paper, complete with quotes from Malraux  and Mailer.  </P> <P> The long-range future is uncertain but, at least, edition 13 will soon be  available. Featuring reviews of "Red Flower: Rethinking Menstruation," "The  Faber Book of Seduction," "Intercity Bus Lines of the Southwest" and "Flowers  from the Royal Gardens of Kew."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Speaker Out of the Cold  </P> <P> The Soviet invasion continues.  </P> <P> Vista High School next week is having its annual student body election, this  year with a United Nations theme, so who better to invite as a keynote speaker  than Stanislav Levchenko, the highest-ranking KGB officer ever to defect?  </P> <P> Levchenko, who recruited politicians and journalists in the Far East as spies,  was given political asylum in this country in 1979. He tells all for $5,000 a  lecture, plus expenses. Corporate sponsors are bankrolling his Vista trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SDG&amp;E in the Glare  </P> <P> Nobody said the utility business was going to be easy.  </P> <P> In a recent speech to an American Bar Assn. conference on electricity law and  regulation, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Senior Vice President and General  Counsel Stephen L. Baum warned his fellow lawyers to beware of a press backlash  in the event of an attempted merger.  </P> <P> Baum said the SDG&amp;E-Southern California Edison merger attempt has produced  "so much negative reporting that speculation within the company is that the  local papers' reporters have been directed to write one negative story each day  about the merger."  </P> <P> "Unfortunately," he continued, "some employees are only too willing to assist  by funneling internal gossip and documents to the press to fuel the fires."  </P> <P> Edison executives are being driven batty by "living in a fishbowl," Baum said.  To SDG&amp;E, it's business as usual.  </P> <P> "We're used to it, having been company non grata for years."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal to the President and Government of the Russian </F> Federation and draft of a cooperation agreement transmitted by  Yuriy Skokov, Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity  Producers of Russia: "What Will be Viktor Chernomyrdin's  Answer?; the Commodity Producers Have Proposed the Signing of a  Cooperation Agreement to the Government"]    [Text] As has become known from well-informed sources, a  few days ago the Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity  Producers of Russia [FTR], Yuriy Skokov, transmitted to the  president and government of the Russian Federation an appeal  from the Council of the FTR and the draft of an agreement on the  cooperation of the government and the FTR.    Considering the serious and urgent nature of these  documents,  as well as certain special features of the present situation in  Russia, we are citing them in full.    Yu. Skokov had previously already carried on negotiations  with the prime minister and the closest assistants of the  president with respect to questions of guaranteeing the  interests of domestic commodity producers. These discussions  were held in a constructive spirit.    It is not difficult to observe that certain provisions of  the  appeal of the FTR Council to the government were utilized in  Boris Yeltsin's message to the Federal Assembly.  <H3>  Appeal of the Council of the Federation of the Commodity  Producers of Russia to the Government of the Russian Federation </H3>   The Second Congress of the commodity producers of Russia,  which took place in December 1993, defined the basic problems of  domestic commodity production and formulated the immediate and  strategic goals of the association of commodity producers.    The position of the commodity producers with respect to  questions of their cooperation with organs of state power is  stated and demands regarding the creation of conditions ensuring  such cooperation expressed in the Declaration of the Rights of  Commodity Producers adopted at the congress. The indicated  declaration was sent to the Government of the Russian Federation.    On the instructions of the Congress the Council of the  Federation of Commodity Producers considers it necessary to  direct the attention of the government to the fact that the  growth of negative processes in the sphere of commodity  production which is going on at the present time threatens to  cause a chain reaction of dramatic social, political and  economic consequences.    Tension in the economy has reached a critical point. Forced  large-scale open and hidden unemployment can become the powerful  detonator of a social explosion, since the state is not in a  position to guarantee the protection of the basic social rights  of the unemployed and there is no law regulating the relations  of the unemployed with the state and fixing the duties and  obligations of the state in relation to a person who has to all  intents and purposes become a hostage of irresponsible  experiments and political games.    It is necessary, finally, to honestly say that the basic  cause of the developing inflation is the catastrophic drop in  commodity production. The methods of struggling with inflation  being practiced can only lead to the complete collapse of the  economy. The means of regulating the economy being proposed are  inadequate for the state of the national economy and have led to  the fracturing of the resources and commodities markets and  those of financial and industrial capital, and to investment and  payments crises. As a result complete collapse threatens the  economy and disintegration and chaos the state.    The Council of the Federation of Commodity Producers:    --proposes that the Government of the Russian Federation  conclude an agreement defining the procedure for the  implementation of the Declaration of the Rights of Commodity  Producers and the cooperation of the parties in developing a  coordinated position in the tactics and strategy of the further  reformation of the economy;    --considers immediate consultations of the chairman of the  Government of the Russian Federation with the chairman of the  Federation of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the purpose  of discussing and adopting an agreement and a joint plan of  actions to be necessary;    --insists on the promulgation by the government of a precise  plan of actions for stabilizing the economy and preventing the  destruction of technological and intellectual potentials;    --considers it advisable for the agreement to be discussed  in  labor collectives and implemented in cooperation with the heads  of administrations, regional unions of commodity producers and  interregional associations for the economic cooperation of the  subjects of the Federation.    If the government does not see the need for a joint search  for ways to get out of the crisis and for securing a  qualitatively new system of interrelations with commodity  producers, then the Federation Council thinks that the  government has a right to reach such a decision. However, it  should be kept in mind that the economic reforms begun in the  name of democracy and a better life for the citizens of Russia  should not become the next tragedy in the country's history,  which imposes a special responsibility in relation to the people  and to history on all who have taken the levers of power into  their hands.    The draft of an agreement of the Government of the Russian  Federation with the Federation of Commodity Producers is  attached.    On the instructions of the Council of the Federation of the  Commodity Producers of Russia    Chairman of the Federation of the Commodity Producers  of Russia Yu. Skokov  <H3>  Draft Agreement on the Cooperation of the Government of the  Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public Associations  of the Commodity Producers of Russia </H3>   Recognizing the need to combine the efforts of the  Government  of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the Public  Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia for the  purpose of:    --formulating a stable system of commodity production and a  stage-by-stage large-scale restructuring of Russia's economy on  new principles and creating a balanced national economy on this  basis;    --retaining strategic and work-available resources,  including  the country's scientific-technical and technologicial potential;    --setting up a national self-developing market oriented to  the domestic commodity producer and creating new forms for the  self-organization of commodity producers on the regional and  interregional levels;    --realistically achieving the social guarantees of all  subjects of commodity production;    --creating an effective system for the cooperation of the  Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation of the  Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia in  implementing economic transformations in the country secured by  procedures for the coordination of the interests, principles,  and procedures of joint actions;    the Government of the Russian Federation and the Federation  of the Public Associations of the Commodity Producers of Russia  conclude the following agreement:    Article 1    The Government of the Russian Federation recognizes the  "Declaration of the Rights of the Commodity Producers of the  Russian Federation" as one of the basic documents when  developing the strategic course of economic reforms and the  methods of its implementation.

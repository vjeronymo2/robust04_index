			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political </F> adviser to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Sa'id Mu'addi in Cairo  on 18 May from the "With the Midday Events" program -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Mu'addi] One last question,  Dr. Nabil. Yasir 'Arafat's statements in Johannesburg drew  angry reactions from the political leadership in Jerusalem,  particularly the prime minister. What is your comment?    [Sha'th] My comment is that there is sometimes exaggeration,  even in interpreting what President 'Arafat meant. Jihad in  Islam is dual -- minor and major jihad. When Prophet Muhammad,  may God's peace and blessing be upon him, conquered Mecca, he  said: Minor jihad is now over and major jihad begins. The  major jihad is the jihad of soul, work, construction, and all  forms of struggle, not only the military jihad as, I believe,  was understood in various places. Jihad for Jerusalem means  struggle for the sake of insistence on presenting what we  demand, that is, to have East Jerusalem as the capital of the  Palestinian state. However, this will take place through  various forms of peaceful struggle that will end with  negotiations on the final status, an important part of which  should be on Jerusalem. Our position on these negotiations is  clear right now. This, I think, is what President 'Arafat meant.    [Mu'addi] One question, after the last, doctor. Was there a  letter from Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin to Yasir 'Arafat on the  status of Jerusalem?    [Sha'th] The letter Prime Minister Rabin exchanged with  President 'Arafat, which was signed with the agreement as you  may recall, stated that negotiations on the final status can  begin as soon as possible but not after the beginning of the  third year or the end of the second year after the start of the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles. This means not  later than 13 October 1995, namely, after one year and four or  five months. These negotiations on the final status, as is  clear in the Declaration of Principles, emphasize that Jerusalem  is one of the five most important topics that will be discussed  at these final negotiations.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian  National Authority, thank you very much.    [Sha'th] Thank you.</p>

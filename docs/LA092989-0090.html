			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> FORMER KING HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR CALLS HIS REMOVAL UNFAIR  </P> <P> William Delgardo, who was replaced as administrator of Martin Luther King  Jr./Drew Medical Center, said Thursday that the action by county supervisors  was unfair and blamed health care problems at the hospital on inadequate  funding.  </P> <P> "I was asked a question of did I think it's fair?" Delgardo told reporters  after giving the county a status report on the Watts hospital. "Certainly, I  don't think it's fair."  </P> <P> Members of the Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital Authority, which issues  bonds to finance construction at the hospital but is not empowered to act as an  advisory board, expressed support for Delgardo, who was transferred by the  supervisors Tuesday to an administrative position at the Department of Health  Services.  </P> <P> "We'd all like to see Mr. Delgardo running the hospital, but what can we do?"  asked Terence Lee, the panel's president.  </P> <P> Delgardo told the panel that the county hospital, which shoulders an enormous  patient load, including about 1,200 emergency ambulance runs a month, lacks  sufficient funding and staffing to handle its heavy caseload.  </P> <P> He said the health care problem cited in a series of state and federal reports  exists at other county hospitals, and he charged that King had been unfairly  singled out.  </P> <P> Asked by Commissioner Jerry Godell whether he believed that the charges were  racially motivated -- as South Los Angeles community activists have alleged --  Delgardo said, "You'll have to draw your own conclusions."  </P> <P> The decision to replace Delgardo with Ed Renford, former chief of staff for  administration for the Health Department's hospital division, was made by  supervisors at the urging of Health Department Director Robert Gates.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Supervisor Kenneth Hahn called for a county investigation  of "serious charges of substandard health care" based on a series of articles  in The Times. The articles, he said, pointed out "poor administration, a lack  of highly skilled medical staff and a severe shortage of space, staff and  funding to adequately deal with the hospital's increasing load."  </P> <P> The move came a day after federal officials notified hospital officials of  plans to cut off $60 million in public health care funds to King on Dec. 21,  effectively closing the hospital unless the health care deficiencies are  corrected.  </P> <P> Two reports prepared by state health officials earlier this month cited the  hospital for massive, wide-ranging deficiencies in administrative leadership,  quality assurance, infection controls, nursing, dietary services and physical  environment.  </P></p>

			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Price-fixing on books is defended in EU court Book publishers yesterday began what could be their final fight to defend the Net Book Agreement, which allows publishers to decide on a book's minimum price. The agreement is under investigation by the Office of Fair Trading and was declared illegal by the European Commission in 1988. Mr Jeremy Lever, representing the Publishers' Association, told the European Court of Justice: 'This case raises a fundamental issue concerning the cultural development not just of the United Kingdom and Ireland, to which it principally relates, but of all the member states of the European Economic Area.' The Publishers' Association and its Irish Republic equivalent, CLE, have been fighting to defend the agreement - which rules out large price discounts - since the Commission declared it illegal under its competition rules. The decision was upheld by the European Court of First Instance in 1992. The case which began yesterday is the appeal against the 1992 ruling. A decision is expected by the end of the year. Mr Lever argued that the the Maastricht treaty had changed the ground rules and would force the court to consider wider issues. 'This court is now required to take into account the cultural effects of both the Commission's decision and of the Court of First Instance's judgment in the exercise of its jurisdiction over this appeal,' he said. The Publishers' Association and the CLE, battling to protect the Pounds 2.5bn UK book market, fear that rising sales and discounts in supermarkets, petrol stations and through mail order, will reduce choice and quality for consumers and could force small bookshops out of business. But Mr Nicholas Forwood, the lawyer representing the commission, attacked the agreement as a 'a price cartel' which limited competition. 'It has the effect of making rigid a system which . . . might be able to evolve in a different manner but for this agreement,' he said, adding that the publishers had failed to prove that there had been any legal holes in the Commission's decision or the Court of First Instance's ruling.</p>

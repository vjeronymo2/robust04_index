			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / How to get the drop-outs back in: David Goodhart examines the UK's options for tackling unemployment among unskilled young men Unskilled men are not wanted by UK employers. Displaced by machines, women and the cheaper labour of workers in developing countries, nearly one in three of them does not have a job. Such men - and the young unskilled in particular - spoil the picture of falling registered unemployment, which last week dipped beneath 10 per cent for the first time in 18 months. According to Mr Jonathan Wads-worth, an economist at the London School of Economics, 18.2 per cent of low-skill males (with only CSEs below grade 1 or no formal qualifications) are now unemployed compared with only 5 per cent of graduates. But the figure for low-skill males, he says, understates the problem as many older unskilled workers have left the labour market altogether by, for instance, signing up for long-term sickness benefit. Between 1977 and 1991, the proportion of low-skill men with jobs fell from 88 per cent to 67 per cent. The extent of this collapse in demand for low-skilled men has only recently caught the attention of policymakers; anxiety in Whitehall has been prompted at least partly by fears that a growing, semi-permanent underclass is fuelling rising crime. Concern has been deepened by a belief that unskilled male unemployment is no longer cyclical, as it has been in the past. During the 1980s experts believed that if such workers could be kept in touch with the labour market through temporary work schemes they would find a job when the economy picked up. But many of the relatively well-paid, 'good jobs' that unskilled men used to do - in the steel industry or docks - have disappeared for good. Employment growth over the past two decades has been in less well-paid, often part-time jobs in the service sector. While service-sector employment grew by 22 per cent in the 1980s, industrial employment fell by 31.2 per cent. As a result of this switch, men are twice as likely as women to be made redundant, and two-thirds of men made redundant are under 35, according to an Employment Department study last week. Displaced unskilled men are reluctant to take low-paid 'women's jobs' for reasons of pride or because pay rates are too low to justify coming off social security. In any case employers usually prefer to take on women, because they are generally more productive and flexible. At the same time, unskilled young men are finding other doors closing. In the early postwar decades, the armed forces recruited up to 10 per cent of 16-year-old male school-leavers every year, but now take only a few hundred. For many of the most disadvantaged young men in Britain, the army had provided self-esteem, social skills and, where needed, high-quality remedial education. With conventional employment routes blocked, a growing number of young men earns an income and gains a sense of worth through crime or drugs. 'A lot of young men who once got their social values from the army are now getting them in prison,' says Ms Vivien Stern, director of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro). Several US studies have established a link between rising numbers of young males outside the labour market and rising crime. In the UK, Mr David Pyle, a Leicester university expert on the economics of crime, says that the crime-unemployment link is difficult to prove, but he has estimated a 10 per cent increase in unemployment leads to an 8.5 per cent increase in burglary. Male youth unemployment - although currently more than 20 per cent - has not been a focus of national attention since the early 1980s, when an outbreak of inner-city riots prompted fears for a generation of youth without work. That is partly because absolute numbers are lower, thanks to the slower birth rate in the 1970s, and more young people are staying on at school. But many experts believe that the danger of long-term exclusion for these young men is now much greater. 'A minority of young men have always been involved in crime or antisocial behaviour. In the past they settled down into apprenticeships, jobs or marriage, and became law-abiding citizens. Fewer are now doing that,' says Ms Pamela Meadows, director of the Policy Studies Institute, the UK think-tank. Government attempts to catch the young male drop-outs have had mixed results. Ministers want every 16- to 19-year-old to be either in full-time education or training, or in a job leading to a qualification. Skills training, combined with a big expansion of further education, is clearly part of the answer when the proportion of low-skilled jobs is falling so rapidly, from 60 per cent to 35 per cent since 1979, says Mr Wadsworth of the LSE. In November, the government unveiled its new apprenticeship initiative, aimed at finding high-quality training places for 40,000 young people a year by 1996. But Whitehall officials acknowledge that for others the two main existing training schemes - Youth Training and Training for Work for adults  -often provide neither adequate training nor 'real' work. Moreover, many young people are not covered at all: a recent study by Tyneside Training and Enterprise Council found that nearly 10 per cent of all school-leavers in Newcastle were dropping out of the system altogether. For this disaffected and poorly educated minority, many of the training-linked job-creation solutions seem inappropriate, at least as the first step, because they do not seem to lead to anything. What are the alternatives? One option, with which the government is experimenting in a dozen pilot schemes, is to try to price the low-skilled unemployed into real jobs. Some of these pilots, such as the 'Workstart' scheme, subsidise employers' labour costs, so workers can be paid a wage that gives them an incentive to come off benefit. Such schemes are in line with European Commission ideas for cutting employers' social security costs for the low skilled. Other pilots, such as the 'portfolio worker scheme', try to encourage adjustment to the growth in part-time employment by financially supporting unemployed workers as they build up a portfolio of two or three part-time jobs, rather than wait for a suitable full-time vacancy. Full Employment UK, the jobs consultancy, is working on a similar plan which will offer volunteers three days' work a week for three months in growing small businesses, in the hope that a proper job will be offered at the end. An alternative, more traditional option for helping the low-skilled unemployed is for the government to become an 'employer of last resort', by funding infrastructure projects, such as road building. But such schemes can be costly. Also likely to be ruled out on grounds of expense, is a return to the 1980s Community Programme which created 250,000 jobs a year but, because it paid close to the rate for the job, incurred an annual cost of more than Pounds 1bn. Nevertheless, the government is interested in less ambitious community work schemes. A new version, Community Action, launched last year, will give priority to unemployed 18- to 24-year-olds and hopes to provide 90,000 part-time work places at a cost of Pounds 120m a year. But it is expected to pay a wage only a little higher than unemployment benefit, and is therefore unlikely to fill all the places. The problem is familiar. With most of the Pounds 2.5bn spent by the government each year on measures for the unemployed still committed to training schemes, the money available for the alternatives of pricing the unemployed back into work or creating community jobs is limited. A radical alternative being canvassed by some employment experts - mostly in private because of the political sensitivities - is to create some sort of 'peace corps', or civilian national service, for those young people who by choice or accident slip through the training net. Ms Stern of Nacro agrees there is a danger of stigma becoming attached to such a scheme if it was reserved only for people at the bottom of the heap. But she believes there is a need for a national project which combines discipline, self-discovery and community work, borrowing from the schemes for inner-city youth run by the Prince of Wales' Trust. Crucially, says Ms Stern, such a scheme should appeal to young men raised in a tough street culture. 'Such people despise half-baked training schemes. Far better to have something like a 'youth action force', perhaps run by a glamorous local institution like a football club, which would inject a sense of fun and purpose,' she says. Though Nacro has no blueprint to offer, it has had local successes finding jobs in the performing arts and music industries for former young offenders. Nacro believes more imagination is required to tap the skills of young drop-outs. So far there is no sign of any political party backing a compulsory programme of civilian national service. As a half-way measure, ministers might consider withdrawing benefit from any unemployed person under 25 who refuses to join an approved project in the voluntary sector, such as those teaching entrepreneurship on deprived housing estates. That too would cost money - which the government does not have. But if ministers do not find an alternative means of intervening effectively to equip unskilled youths with the ability to get on in mainstream society, many of today's unemployed will become an even greater burden on government resources later in their lives.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH COURT MOVES INTO A NEW ERA;  </P> <P> IS NOMINEE 'FUZZED UP' ENOUGH ON ABORTION ISSUE?  </P> <P> President George Bush's nomination of New Hampshire Appeals Court Judge David  Souter to succeed Justice William J. Brennan Jr. on the U.S. Supreme Court  marks the beginning of a new and uncertain era in constitutional law.  </P> <P> If he is confirmed by the Senate, the 50-year-old Republican jurist is expected  to solidify a youthful majority that probably will endure beyond the turn of  the century -- although once on the bench, justices can surprise ideologues of  all stripes. But the tenor of his confirmation hearings -- and what they reveal  about the quality of the President's choice -- will be an important signal of  whether the White House and the Senate's leaders understand their  responsibility to ensure that the country's passage into a new era is no more  dislocating than necessary.  </P> <P> The judicial epoch that came to an end with Brennan's resignation -- the era of  the Warren Court -- is something of a model in this regard. Because of its  duration, people tend to forget just how gradually those justices asserted  their views.  </P> <P> Brennan and the late Chief Justice Earl Warren had been together on the court  for almost a decade before they handed down the majority of their many landmark  decisions. In the interim, they not only had laid a legal foundation for their  theory of constitutional interpretation, but also had witnessed the emergence  of a social and political consensus that obliged the court to attack the  mountain of unresolved issues that had piled up during the previous decades of  self-imposed judicial passivity.  </P> <P> At present, no such consensus exists. The Republicans have controlled the  Executive Branch for a decade, while the Democrats' power over both houses of  Congress appears unshakeable. In the unending controversies over the so-called  social issues, public opinion polls reveal a deeply split, increasingly  polarized polity; on the most contentious of these issues -- abortion, for  example -- the President's party is divided against itself.  </P> <P> Those were the plain facts that Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole had in mind  Sunday, when he bluntly warned that if Bush sent the Senate a nominee "who  wants to overturn Roe vs. Wade, it's going to be a blood bath." With the  distasteful experience of Ronald Reagan's failed attempt to put conservative  ideologue Robert Bork on the court still fresh in everyone's mind, Dole's  assessment seems on the mark.  </P> <P> On Monday Bush said he had felt it "inappropriate" to inquire about Souter's  views on Roe vs. Wade . In one case three years ago, Souter, then a New  Hampshire Supreme Court justice, concurred in a ruling that doctors have a  professional responsibility to test for birth defects and inform pregnant women  of their option to obtain an abortion.  </P> <P> In his concurrence, however, Souter sought to delineate the decision's impact  on physicians opposed to abortion. "The court does not hold that some or all  physicians must make a choice between rendering services that they morally  condemn and leaving their profession in order to escape malpractice exposures,"  he wrote.  </P> <P> Thus, the nominee may meet the criteria set by one White House aide, who said  last weekend that the President was looking for someone whose position on Roe  vs. Wade is "a little fuzzed up."  </P> <P> But what the country requires in a Supreme Court justice is not fuzziness, but  fairness. Whatever his principles, the country requires someone who, like  Justice Brennan, can put the parochial predilections of creed and class aside  in fidelity to the common good.  </P></p>

			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Investment law for Cambodia Cambodia's national assembly has passed a long awaited investment law, but businessmen and others said yesterday it was unlikely to bring a rush of investment even though it was a boost for the economic climate. The assembly approved the law after months of wrangling between competing interests in the administration and extensive redrafting of the bill. Profits are tax-exempt for eight years. Imported construction materials, equipment, raw materials and half-finished goods are all duty-free for various categories of ventures, including those which export 80 per cent of output. Investments in tourism, in labour-intensive industries, infrastructure and energy are also eligible for tax incentives.</p>

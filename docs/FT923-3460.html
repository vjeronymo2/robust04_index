			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Coal supply deal may be near SHARE prices of electricity generators rose sharply as the stock market reacted to rumours of an imminent agreement on long-term coal supply contracts. The contracts are an essential precursor to the forthcoming privatisation of British Coal. The corporation denied that agreement had been struck. 'As far as we are concerned, we are still talking,' it said. However, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, is believed to have approved an outline deal under which British Coal deliveries to the generators would fall from the present 60m tons to 40m tons next March when the new contracts are due to start. Within three years they would fall a further 10m tons to 30m.</p>

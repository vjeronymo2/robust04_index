ANC spokesman Cyril Ramaphosa said at  a news conference in Johannesburg that he interpreted Mr. de  Klerk's remarks about a new initiative as meaning that the  government would try to keep the IFP and the kwaZulu government  involved in the election process.    Referring to the planned meeting between King Goodwill  Zwelithini and ANC Leader Nelson Mandela, Mr. Ramaphosa said it  was absolutely essential that such a meeting should take place.</p>

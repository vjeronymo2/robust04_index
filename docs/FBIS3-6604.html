Consequently, Korea will have a second meeting in Geneva  today to get the schedule endorsed. To narrow differences in  positions, Korea yesterday had a series of informal bilateral  meetings with the United States, Australia, New Zealand and  Canada, the countries which vented particular displeasure with  the schedule.    A ministry official said Korea may have to revise its  agricultural country schedule in such a direction as to expand  the opening of its agricultural market if it fails to win  concessions from the U.S. and other major farm exporting  countries.    In Thursday's meeting, the U.S. accused Korea of having  presented a country schedule that doesn't correspond to the  final draft presented on Dec. 15 last year when even-year  Uruguay Round of trade liberalization talks was concluded.    The most thorny issue in Thursday's meeting was Seoul's plan  to levy mark-ups, a term referring to levies which are  equivalent to the difference between import and sales prices, on  a number of imported agricultural products.    Korea seeks to levy mark-ups on 118 agricultural products in  the form of state-administered trade, saying the broadbased  application of mark-ups is needed to protect its farm industry.    On the contrary, the U.S. and other major farm exporting  countries took issue with the mark-up scheme, noting that Korea  listed only 10-odd items in its final draft presented last  December.    They also accused Korea of trying to levy what they claim  are  excessive amounts of mark-ups to have its farm industry nestled  under the umbrella of government protection.    Washington was also unhappy with Seoul's plan to keep tariff  rates on agricultural imports at high levels, ministry officials  said. In its country schedule, Korea offered to trim tariffs on  agricultural imports by an average 24 percent over 10 years from  1995, insisting that it be regarded as a developing country.    But the U.S. expressed dissatisfaction with Seoul's tariff  reduction plan which it said was too conservative given its  current economic status.    Washington also clarified its objection to Seoul's plan to  slap tariffs on 97 agricultural imports on the basis of amounts.    Korea came under criticism for trying to curb farm imports  by  introducing a new tariff system, ministry officials said.    In Thursday's meeting, however, the U.S. didn't raise an  objection to how much rice Korea will have to import next year  and what years it proposes to base market access quota and  subsidy cuts on, the officials said.    Complaining about Korea's plan to import 51,000 tons of rice  next year, 1 percent of domestic consumption, the U.S. has been  urging the quota be increased to 56,000 tons, saying the quota  is limited to consumed volume and leaves out rice for seed and  processing.    On the contrary, Seoul argues that the quota be fixed at  51,000 tons, saying seed volume is just statistics and not part  of the actual harvest and that the volume for processing is not  categorized separately.    As Korea failed to get its agricultural country schedule  endorsed Thursday, farm economists say it may have no other  alternative but to revise the schedule.    An official at the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and  Fisheries said Korea is waging an uphill battle, hinting at a  revision of its country schedule.    So far, of 118 member countries, some 80 have their final  farm schedules endorsed at the GATT. Korea is one of the few  countries whose schedule failed to pass the screening process.  According to GATT regulations, the screening process is due to  be completed by March 21.</p>

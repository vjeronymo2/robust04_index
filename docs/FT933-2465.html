			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper plunges as squeeze ends that much is clear. What remains far from clear, however, is how and why it met its end. Having survived repeated warnings from the London Metal Exchange management and last week's LME action to limit the cash/one day premium to Dollars 5 a tonne, the squeeze that had been distorting the market since the summer suddenly took a turn for the worse in after hours trading on Thursday. And by lunchtime yesterday it had breathed its last. The cash premium over three months metal (the 'backwardation'), which a few days before had exceeded Dollars 70 a tonne and still stood at Dollars 43.50 at the close of Thursday's afternoon ring-dealing session, collapsed to Dollars 20 during afterhours trading and by yesterday's close had been replaced by a Dollars 5 cash discount. A cash discount (or 'contango') is the normal market situation when adequate supplies are available to the market, representing the cost of holding physical metal. But although the total of copper stocks in exchange warehouses has been at a 15-year high for some time much of it has been securely held by a group of operators allegedly seeking to drive up nearby prices to their own profit. Speculators who had sold copper forward in the expectation that they would be able to make covering purchases at cheaper prices as bearish fundamentals depressed the market found themselves having to pay premiums to roll their positions over, to avoid taking heavy losses. Explanations for the sudden collapse of the squeeze are many and various. Chinese selling has been suggested, as has backroom pressure from the exchange authorities. Other traders believe that much of the 'long' position was held against a planned physical deal that had now been completed. Another, and perhaps more likely, suggestion is that the 'shorts', dismayed by the failure of the backwardation to narrow significantly following last week's LME action, had done a deal with the 'longs' under which they cut their losses and the latter cut their profits. The actual explanation may or may not become clear in the fullness of time, but traders are now more interested in watching the behaviour of the unsupported market. The three months position, which closed yesterday at Dollars 1,764.50 a tonne, has already fallen by more than Dollars 180 from the peak reached two weeks ago and many analysts believe the sell-off is far from over. Compared to copper the nickel market is a model of simplicity. LME stocks are at a record and growing; producers are still stubbornly refusing to make the production cuts necessary to get supply into balance with demand; and no-one has felt tempted to try to prop up prices. The result has been the long downtrend that this week took the LME three-months price below the equivalent of Dollars 2 a lb, the level some analysts have suggested will force some producers to bite the bullet at last. At the London Commodity Exchange cocoa moved out of coffee's shadow and into the limelight this week as nearby futures positions stormed to levels last seen in the summer of 1990. A move towards the psychological barrier at Pounds 900 a tonne for December delivery faltered on Tuesday, but the bulls - encouraged by a deepening conviction that world stocks were set to fall heavily - were not to be denied. After edging the price up again on Wednesday they went on the rampage the following day, pushing the December contract to Pounds 909 a tonne at one stage. Early trading yesterday saw the price at Pounds 907, but it was pared back by profit-taking to close at Pounds 903 a tonne, up Pounds 47 on the week and Pounds 124 over the past month. Traders were undaunted by yesterday's modest retracement, arguing that a period of consolidation was 'hardly surprising' after such a strong performance. They saw supply/demand prospects for cocoa as fundamentally bullish and thought further gains were likely. 'We had been forecasting that the December price would reach Pounds 1,000 by the end of the year,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at London trade house GNI. 'Now it looks as though it could make that by the end of the month.' It will not be all plain sailing, however. Mr Eagles noted that there were technical hurdles to be cleared at Pounds 958 a tonne, the life-of-contract high for the December contract, and Pounds 967, the long-time high for the second position (reached on May 24, 1990), before stiff psychological resistance was met at Pounds 1,000 a tonne. Mr Eagles said earlier in the week that the market's new-found confidence was based on expectations of a third production deficit this year, resulting in a stocks drawdown of between 200,00 and 300,000 tonnes, to which could be added 179,000 of the 230,00 tonnes in the International Cocoa Organisation's buffer stock. He explained that the agreement by producer and consumer members of the organisation to dispose of the stockpile in an orderly fashion over not more than four and a half years, to which finishing were being put in London yesterday afternoon, transformed the 179,000 tonnes that would remain after this season's disposals from an overhanging stock into a predictable, medium-term source of supply. The effective level of world stocks was therefore likely to fall by between 379,000 and 479,000 tonnes from the present level of about 1.2m tonnes.  ------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ------------------------------------- Aluminium   +17,750 to 2,155,325 Copper      +15,875 to   547,875 Lead           -350 to   283,450 Nickel       +1,290 to   112,338 Zinc         +5,800 to   784,500 Tin            -175 to    21,450  -------------------------------------</p>

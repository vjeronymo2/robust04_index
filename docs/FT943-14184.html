			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / International Company News: Tyco to acquire Kendall Tyco International, a diversified US manufacturer, is to acquire Kendall International, a maker of disposable medical products, in an all-stock deal valued yesterday at Dollars 1.38bn. The acquisition will give Tyco, formerly Tyco Laboratories, a bigger presence in a market that it estimates to account for annual sales of Dollars 20bn in the US, and Dollars 50bn worldwide. Some 80 per cent of Kendall's revenues, which in 1993 amounted to Dollars 816m, are in disposable medical products, from wound care items, used in hospitals, to therapeutic hosiery sold through retail outlets. About 17 per cent of the company's sales come from outside the US, with local manufacturing and distribution facilities in Europe, the Far East and Latin America. Tyco, more than half of whose Dollars 3.3bn sales come from fire protection systems, derives only Dollars 80m of its revenues from medical products at present. The merger is part of a move by Tyco to 'translate our manufacturing expertise in packaging into higher margin products in the disposable medical products market', said Mr Dennis Kozlowski, chairman and chief executive. The combined business would be grown in the US and internationally, in part through other acquisitions, he added. Tyco said the transaction would not dilute its earnings per share, partly because it planned to buy back 2.9m of its shares after the deal was completed. However, Tyco's shares slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to close at Dollars 45 1/2. Kendall's share price was up Dollars 3 to close at Dollars 54.</p>

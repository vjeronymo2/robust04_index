			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: FROM PALMS TO PINES ON MT. SAN JACINTO TRAMWAY  </P> <P> Palm Springs Aerial Tramway makes it easy for hikers to enter Mt. San Jacinto  Wilderness Area. Starting in Chino Canyon near Palm Springs, a tram takes  passengers from 2,643-foot Lower Aerial Tramway Terminal (Valley Station) to  8,516-foot Upper Aerial Tramway Terminal (Mountain Station) at the edge of the  wilderness.  </P> <P> The Swiss-made gondola rapidly leaves terra firma behind. Too rapidly, you  think. It carries you over one of the most abrupt mountain faces in the world,  over cliffs only a bighorn sheep can scale, over several life zones, from palms  to pines. The view is fantastic.  </P> <P> Construction of the tramway was opposed by conservationists who pointed out  that Mt. San Jacinto slopes were totally unsuited to its stated purpose --  skiing. First proposed in the 1930s, the project was finally completed in 1963  after approval and funding from the state of California.  </P> <P> Now, most nature lovers enjoy witnessing flora and fauna changes equivalent to  those viewed on a motor trip from the Mojave Desert to the Arctic Circle in  just minutes. In pre-tramway days, John Muir found the view "the most sublime  spectacle to be found anywhere on this Earth!"  </P> <P> For an introduction to the Alpine environment of Mt. San Jacinto State Park,  take the short nature path that begins at Mountain Station, then join Desert  View Trail for a superb panorama of Palm Springs. After enjoying the view of  the arid lands below, you can extend your hike by looping through lush Round  Valley.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From California 111 at the northern outskirts of Palm  Springs, turn southwest on Tramway Road and drive 3 1/2 miles to the tramway  terminal.  </P> <P> The hike: From Mountain Station, walk down the paved pathway to the signed  beginning of the trail to Desert View. You join the nature trail for a short  distance, cross the path used by the "mule ride" and soon get the first of a  couple of great desert views. The view takes in Palm Springs, Tahquitz and  other palm-lined canyons of the Agua Caliente Indian Reservation, along with  the basin and hills of the Coachella Valley.  </P> <P> Continue on Desert View Trail, which makes a full circle and junctions with the  path back up to Mountain Station. For a longer hike, walk through the Long  Valley Picnic Area to the state park ranger station. Obtain a wilderness permit  here.  </P> <P> Continue west on the trail, following the signs to Round Valley. The trail  parallels Long Valley Creek through a mixed forest of pine and white fir, then  climbs into lodgepole pine country. Lupine, monkeyflower, scarlet bugler and  Indian paintbrush are some of the wildflowers that add seasonal splashes of  color.  </P> <P> After passing a junction with a trail leading toward Willow Creek, another  three-tenths mile of hiking brings you to Round Valley. There's a trail camp  and a backcountry ranger station in the valley and splendid places to picnic in  the meadow or among the lodgepole pines. The truly intrepid hiker will head for  the summit of Mt. San Jacinto, a 3 1/2-mile ascent from Round Valley.  </P> <P> An alternative to returning the same way is to retrace your steps three-tenths  of a mile back to the junction with Willow Creek trail, take this trail a mile  through the pines to another signed junction and follow the signed trail north  back to Long Valley Ranger Station. This alternative adds only about a  quarter-mile to your day hike and allows you to make a loop.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Desert View Trail  </P> <P>  Mountain Station  </P> <P>  to Desert View:  </P> <P>  2 miles round trip  </P> <P>  Mountain Station  </P> <P>  to Round Valley:  </P> <P>  6 miles round trip;  </P> <P>  600-foot elevation gain  </P> <P> </P></p>

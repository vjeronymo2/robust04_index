			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Israel reopens Bir Zeit University after four years ISRAEL yesterday announced the reopening of Bir Zeit University, the most prestigious university in the occupied territories. It has been closed for more than four years, under one of the most criticised measures imposed by the authorities to combat the Palestinian intifada, or uprising. The first official classes for the 2,500 students will be held on April 29, two days after the fifth round of Arab-Israeli negotiations launched at last year's Madrid peace conference gets under way in Washington. The US has led persistent international criticism of the Israeli policy of closing Palestinian schools and colleges, saying that it amounted to unwarranted collective punishment. Over the past two years, as levels of violence have subsided, all schools and most higher education institutions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been reopened, leaving only Bir Zeit still shut. Bir Zeit, near Ramallah, north of Jerusalem, has been a centre of Palestinian nationalism as well as building a reputation for the highest academic standards among the six small universities established during the occupation. Several senior members of the Palestinian team involved in the peace talks, including Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, the spokeswoman, teach at Bir Zeit. Unofficial classes were held off-campus during the closure, but staff members say these were inevitably inadequate for full completion of courses.</p>

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Pre-Budget nervousness is evident THE gilts market is divided over the steps Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, should announce in his Budget speech tomorrow to tackle the rising public sector borrowing requirement. As Mr Lamont ponders the gap between public spending and borrowing, he is a bit like a man with a festering boil. He is undecided on whether to leave the deficit alone, or to administer surgery which could ultimately misfire. The nervousness in the market before the Budget was evident last week. Trading was volatile as many investors took profits after the run of several weeks of falling yields at the long end of the market. During the week, the short end of the market showed a small price rise, with yields for five-year bonds falling by about 10 basis points to 6.4 per cent. The move was more the result of technical switching down the yield curve rather than any strong sentiment about an imminent fall in bank base rates, now at 6 per cent. Some gilt practitioners reckon that - even with the PSBR set to reach about Pounds 50bn in 1993-1994 after a likely Pounds 37bn or so this year - Mr Lamont should resist the temptation to tackle the deficit through fiscal tightening. They reckon such a move would hit consumer and business confidence, and deal a blow to recovery hopes. A new leg to the UK recession could mean the deficit would go up even more over the next few years, because of reductions in tax income and higher social security spending. Another body of opinion thinks drastic action to curb the deficit is necessary. According to this view, without a fiscal tightening the PSBR could soar to Pounds 60bn to Pounds 70bn by the mid-1990s. That would depress gilt prices because of the large volumes of bond issues which would be necessary. This school of thought favours a large tax rise of some Pounds 5bn in the coming financial year, possibly accompanied by a cut in interest rates to 5 per cent. In between these two views is the position of Mr Gavyn Davies, chief UK economist at New York bank Goldman Sachs. He would like Mr Lamont to announce a package of tax increases, but delay their implementation until 1994-1995. This, he reckons, would reassure financial markets of the government's determination to reduce the PSBR, but stop short of damaging short-term prospects for an upturn. That argument fails to convince Mr Chris Dillow, UK economist at Nomura, the Japanese securities house. He thinks Mr Lamont should ignore the PSBR. 'The Budget should be as boring as possible,' he says. 'History has shown that bold budgets often do more harm than good.' According to Mr Dillow's analysis, the PSBR will fall naturally as the economy recovers - something he thinks is on course. That view is supported by evidence such as last week's announcement by the Confederation of British Industry that retail sales volumes in February showed strong year-on-year growth for the second month running. Mr Dillow says any increase in income tax or value added tax would increase inflation, either because of the push these measures would give to wage inflation or because of the direct impact on consumer prices. He thinks the negative effects for gilt yields of a tax rise would more than offset any immediate positive impact gained through reduced need for new bond issues. Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at the capital markets division of National Westminster Bank, says aside from any decisions over taxation the gilt market would gain most satisfaction if Mr Lamont changed the funding rules to allow purchases of gilts by bank and building societies to count towards financing the PSBR. He thinks the government would earn high marks by going back to broad money targeting as a set of guidelines for economic management to replace the discarded nostrums of the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>

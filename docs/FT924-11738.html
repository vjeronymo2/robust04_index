			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / BA may end link with Eurodisney BRITISH AIRWAYS may cancel its 'official airline' status with Eurodisney, the Paris theme park, because of disappointing demand from UK air travellers. The present contract expires at the end of March next year and BA is prepared to take a tough position in talks over any renewal. The theme park opened last May and BA increased the capacity of its services from five UK cities in anticipation of heavy demand. But the 1.25m visitors so far from the UK have tended to travel by ship and coach.</p>

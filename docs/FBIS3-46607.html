			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [28 December message from PDK President Khieu Samphan to </F> Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, chairman of the FUNCINPEC  party, in response to the latter's 24 December message to Khieu  Samphan via the the PDK office in Phnom Penh -- read by  announcer]    [Text] To His Royal Highness Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, chairman of the National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia  [FUNCINPEC] party, Phnom Penh    Your Highness Prince Krompreah: I have received a letter  dated 24 December 1993 graciously sent to me by your highness  via the office of the party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] in  Phnom Penh.    Your highness expressed the view when you graciously granted  me an audience on 17 December that the current situation  required all the national forces, including your highness and  myself, to meet frequently to discuss and exchange views with  one another under different forms so that together we could  solve the serious problem facing our Cambodian nation and  community. Agreeing with this excellent concept, I and the  entire PDK were very pleased when your highness graciously  accepted that a technical group should be set up in response to  my request in order to make it possible for frequent but  comprehensive talks to be held on all issues without any  preconditions. In addition, your highness graciously stated  that the five-point political guideline put forth by his majesty  the king constitutes the basis for the consultations of this  technical group.    I am confident that all of our nation and blood brothers in  the countryside and the cities, at home and abroad, will  joyously welcome this excellent development, because it is a  step toward national reconciliation, national unity, and the  rallying of all national forces in line with the enlightened  initiative of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, the  august, lofty leader of our nation. I believe that, in order to  make the consultations between your highness and myself more  advanced and fruitful, we should adhere to the above basis and  go into greater detail and depth in accordance with the  prevailing situation of our country and the sacred aspiration of  our nation and people.    I also beg your permission to use this opportunity to inform  your highness once again that the PDK welcomes and fully  supports without any preconditions his majesty's five-point  political guideline graciously put forth by the king in his  capacity as a Cambodian citizen in an essay on 21 November 1993.    In these five-point proposals his majesty the king demands  that the factions give concessions to each other and hold  discussions, consultations, and working meetings on that basis.  The PDK has always been prepared to honor this excellent royal  instruction, and will do everything in its power to completely  accomplish the king's political guideline as soon as possible.  We have this stance because we firmly believe that this royal  political guideline will surely bring about national  reconciliation, national unity, and the rallying of all national  forces -- with none rejected. Besides, we hold that the  political guideline that his majesty the king has provided for  all Cambodian leaders and for our nation and people stems from  his profound meditation and reflection on how to cope with the  prevailing situation, which requires that all national forces  take part in all fields and sectors of state affairs, jointly  helping to redress the worsening situation and responding to the  desire of our entire nation and people.    As I have already informed your highness, if supported by  all  national forces, this five-point political guideline of our king  will become the second royal crusade, opening up for his majesty  the king another opportunity to fulfill a noble mission for our  Cambodian nation and people and giving the latter total  independence and sovereignty in their territorial integrity --  the sacred goal of our nation and people.    Based on all the above reasons, it is my opinion that we  should make arrangements so that the technical group, set up in  the spirit of the consensus reached between your highness and  myself on 17 December 1993, can gradually begin to function and  provide discussions and consultations on the basis of his  majesty our august king's five-point political guideline with a  view to implementing it on every point. So long as we have a  chance to discuss and hold working meetings on such a specific  and correct basis, and with the august instructions graciously  given by his majesty as a beacon to help light up and steer our  way, we will surely succeed in progessively solving the problems  until we have fully carried out his majesty our venerated king's  political guideline. Then, there will be national  reconciliation, national unity, the rallying of all national  forces, and peace as a positive response to the profound and  sacred aspiration of our entire nation and people.    I therefore ask permission to inform your highness of all  the above. I have nothing against your highness at all. On the  contrary, I myself and the PDK as a whole, who once worked along  side your highness Prince Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party in  jointly fighting our national enemies, continue to support  FUNCINPEC and seek by all means to offer your highness Prince  Krompreah the full right to be the prime minister of a genuinely  national royal government in accordance with the wish of our  nation and people.    It is my belief that if we proceed in accordance with this  guideline, there will be no more problems. As for the problem  of who is attacking whom, I believe that this problem can also  be solved when the five-point political guideline of his majesty  our august king is fulfilled through actual implementation,  because then the armed forces of all national forces will be  integrated into a single Khmer Royal Armed Forces, with the king  as the supreme commander. Concerning this problem, I already  informed your highness in person of what really happened during  our meeting on 17 December 1993.    Moreover, I ask permission to sincerely inform your highness  that, during the past few months as well as at the present,  there has been a lot of political propaganda and military  activity aimed at destroying the forces of Democratic Kampuchea.  In the provinces of Preah Vihear, Kompong Thom, Siem Reap, and  Oddar Meanchey the forces of the former National Army of  Independent Cambodia [the Sihanoukist ANKI forces] have been  drawn up to join other armed forces in launching large-scale  offensives in attempts to attack and destroy the forces of  Democratic Kampuchea, such as those at Stoung and Phnum Chhat in  August and at Anlung Veng at the beginning of last October.  Since late-December another large-scale offensive to attack the  forces of Democratic Kampuchea has also been launched.    I ask your permission to raise this issue in order to show  your highness Prince Krompreah that the situation is very  complex and its solution requires joint efforts, just as his  majesty our august king has most wisely pointed out.    I take this opportunity to assure your highness that the PDK  and the national army of Democratic Kampuchea support your  highness and the FUNCINPEC party as a whole, including both its  military and political apparatuses. This support stems both  from our tradition of joint struggle and, more importantly, from  our understanding that in order for our Cambodian nation and  race to survive all national forces must rally around the throne  and the king with the FUNCINPEC party, which advocates national  reconciliation playing the main role as in the times of Sangkum  Reas Niyum under the leadership of his majesty the king. I  understand that this is also the wish and desire of our entire  nation and people. It was for this reason that our blood  brothers gave their votes of confidence to your highness Prince  Krompreah and the FUNCINPEC party. And it was for the same  reason that the PDK supported the election results and has  demanded that arrangements be taken to fully comply with these  election results; and the PDK continues to strictly maintain  this position.    Humbly yours,    [Dated] 28 December 1993    [Signed] Khieu Samphan, president of the PDK</p>

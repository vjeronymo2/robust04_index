			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nelly Gomez in Barranquilla; from the "NTC News" </F> newscast]    [Text] The U.S. airplanes that overflew Barranquilla  yesterday are participating in narcotics operations with the  national government's authorization. What is unclear is why  they flew so close to the ground when their route was authorized  by the Colombian Air Force at 22,000 feet.    The two U.S. military airplanes overflew Barranquilla for  eight hours and endangered air navigation in Colombia, according  to Henry Jimenez, supervisor of the Ernesto Cortizos Airport  control tower. The pilots never reported their position or  altitude; all they did was identify themselves with the names of  Cajun 680 Alpha and Cajun 57 Alpha.    [Begin Jimenez recording] They never answered our calls.  That is why they might have caused a collision with controlled  civilian aircraft. No one could tell what were the aircraft's  positions or altitude at a given moment. [end recording]    According to the official, the U.S. aircraft were in a  critical airspace coordinate, meaning a route designated for  civilian aircraft on the Barranquilla-Santa Fe de Bogota-New  York route, crossing through Curazao and vice versa.    The military aircraft left for Howard Air Force Base,  Panama,  at 1900.</p>

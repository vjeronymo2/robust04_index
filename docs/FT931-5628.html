			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Beijing fails to end HK deadlock MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, said yesterday he believed the overall interests of Britain and China would be best served by the two sides 'sitting down and talking'. However, the deadlock between the two countries over terms for talks on Hong Kong's future was unbroken last night. Barring a last-minute agreement on talks, Governor Chris Patten will today tell the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's law making body, that his administration's patience with China has virtually run out. He is also expected to indicate that his democracy legislation will be gazetted next week if Beijing has not agreed to talks by then. Mr Li, meeting a delegation from Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, said China's conditions for talks were 'respect' for the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, 'convergence' with the Basic Law, and the other 'understandings and agreements' reached between the UK and China in the past. He did not call on Governor Patten to withdraw his blueprint for political reform. These conditions have always been acceptable to the UK. Mr Patten's planned statement to LegCo today is designed to regain support among his increasingly restive supporters. He will insist on the right of Hong Kong to participate in Anglo-Chinese talks on the colony's political future. He will also reaffirm his and the British government's view that LegCo has the constitutional authority to take the final decision on any Anglo-Chinese agreement. Talks about talks, which are under way in Beijing, have centred on these two issues, with China indicating that it does not want to recognise Hong Kong officials present at talks, and that the UK should agree to implement whatever is agreed. Mr Patten is adamant that negotiations cannot be conducted if the Chinese will not give way on these two issues. The governor is under growing pressure to push ahead with political reform. More than a tenth of the 400,000 people who have left Hong Kong in recent years have returned, according to a Hong Kong government report published yesterday.</p>

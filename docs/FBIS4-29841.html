			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  voiced confidence Tuesday that North Korean strongman Kim  Il-song will not be able to avoid a summit this time, adding  that the two leaders need only to decide on the time and place.    "The summit proposal Kim made through (Former U.S. President  Jimmy) Carter is apparently sincere, not just a gesture," Kim  said during dinner with ruling Democratic Liberal Party  lawmakers at the presidential mansion.    "We expected this to happen and we have been preparing a  long  time for it," he said. "We can meet anywhere, anytime to discuss  anything."    Carter met with Kim Il-song in Pyongyang last week and  relayed the message to Kim Yong-sam that the North Korean leader  wants an inter-Korean summit.    "Kim Il-song obviously became impatient," the South Korean  president said, noting Seoul's growing ties with the world's  four most powerful nations.    Seoul proposed a working-level contact on June 28 to prepare  for the summit. Pyongyang has yet to respond.    "Now that we have accepted Kim Il-song's proposal, the only  thing left is the time and place," said Kim. "We will decide our  government position as soon as North Korea responds."</p>

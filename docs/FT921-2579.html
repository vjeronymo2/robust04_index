			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Financial Futures and Options (2): Small markets stock up - The growing competition in Europe FUTURES business, once dominated by the large US exchanges, is shifting to Europe, reflecting the increasing level of trading in European securities. But the success of Europe's exchanges is also fostering a more competitive environment, as new exchanges and competing products spring up. While the larger exchanges struggle for dominance of major European markets, smaller ones may find a niche in trading products based on domestic instruments, or by forging links with the larger exchanges. Three European exchanges are battling for business: the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe); the Marche a Terme International de France (Matif), in Paris; and the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), in Frankfurt. Liffe's most successful contract, the Bund future, has come under threat from a rival contract on the DTB, backed by the German banks. Although the volume of Bund futures traded on Liffe has not fallen, activity in the DTB contract has increased substantially, due to a combination of slashed commissions, a new marketmaking system and daily targets. The DTB's market share in the Bund contract increased from 8 per cent in January 1991 to 29 per cent in January 1992. The DTB plans further expansion, which could threaten Liffe's strong position in German interest-rate products. As well as an option on the German BOBL (three-and-a-half to five-year bond) future, the exchange is working on a three-month Euromark interest rate future. The contract, which has not yet been approved by the board, would be the exchange's first short-term interest rate contract. The exchange's plans to expand overseas - currently stymied by regulatory problems - indicate that it will not limit its sights to domestic business. The exchange is also discussing the creation of futures and options contracts on a pan-European stock index (two attempts so far have flopped: Liffe's Eurotrack and the European Options Exchange's Eurotop contracts). Meanwhile, Liffe has lost a battle, if not the war, over Ecubond futures trading. A rival contract on the Matif, launched six months earlier, traded 110,000 contracts in January, compared with a mere 4,000 Ecu bond contracts traded on Liffe, despite the launch of a new marketmaking system. Roger Barton, managing director in charge of business development at Liffe, admits that it will be 'a long hard slog' to win back Ecu business. But he points out that the marketmaking system is providing two-way prices at a tight spread. The fact remains that the contract is barely traded, and many dealers use alternative instruments for hedging: either cash bonds, such as the UK 10-year Ecu bond, or a proxy such as the Bund future. While the failure of the Ecu contract has proved a setback, the success of Liffe's Italian bond future contract, launched last September, has exceeded all expectations. The contract fends off competition from a rival contract on the Matif, also launched in September. In January, only one contract was traded on the Matif, compared with 142,000 on Liffe. However, a further challenge is on the way from the Italian authorities. In June, they plan to launch a screen-based bond futures trading system, which will be added on to their existing cash market trading system. There is still some scepticism about the Italians' ability to meet that deadline, although development of the clearing and trading systems is now under way. Meanwhile, smaller European markets are also developing their own exchanges, which will soon be stocked with derivatives on a range of domestic instruments. In Vienna, the Osterreichische Termin und Optionenborse (Otob), which opened for business last year, has made a strong start. Currently the exchange trades only six individual stock options on Austrian shares, but an option on the Austrian Traded Index, made up of 18 shares traded on the Vienna stock exchange, will be launched in May or June, and a synthetic government bond future is planned for later this year. The Belgian Futures and Options Exchange (Belfox) made a rather disappointing debut at the end of last year, with a Belgian government bond future contract. But options on six Belgian stocks and futures and options on its BEL-20 Belgian Stock Index are planned for later this year. Spain's two exchanges are now trading under one holding company, Mercado de Futuros Financieros (Meff), but are still based in both Madrid (equity products) and Barcelona (interest rate products). Meff in Madrid recently started trading futures and options contracts on a new index of Spanish stocks, the Ibex 35, and plans to launch individual stock option contracts later this year. Meanwhile, the Swedish exchange, OM, with operations in Stockholm and London, is in discussions with other exchanges such as the European Options Exchange (EOE) about cross-listing of products (including its Swedish stock options and stock index products). Such linkage may be a way forward for other smaller exchanges seeking to expand. In the UK, the merger of Liffe and the London Trade Options Market (LTOM) officially takes place next Monday, but the two exchanges have in fact been operating under the same roof since January. The merger is an attempt to revive the UK stock options market, which had been languishing under the wing of the stock exchange. The prospects for one key product, options on the FT-SE 100 index, are excellent. The FT-SE options pit has already benefited from its proximity to the futures pit in the new exchange, and from a surge of interest created by the merger. After the merger, in addition to economies of scale, traders will be able to match their futures and options positions. But Liffe's Mr Barton admits that the 'significant growth' expected in FT-SE option volume is unlikely to be matched in individual stock option trading. 'We are looking for steady growth over the next six to 12 months,' he said. However, the signs are not encouraging. Liffe raised a bare minimum of marketmakers in individual stock options, and most houses say they will be concentrating their efforts on index products, which are used increasingly by fund managers for asset allocation and hedging purposes. The row over the future of stock options trading, which delayed the merger, could erupt again. The large UK banks, active in stock trading in the cash market, favoured a shift to screen-based trading, while smaller firms held out for the continuation of pit trading Although Liffe resisted pressure from the larger houses to move to a screen-based system, an automated system is being developed for possible use later. 'We took the view that the merged market should make that decision,' said Mr Barton. 'The board of the merged market will decide if and when to move to an automated system.' However, the system will not be ready for another year, so the market will, in theory, have some time to find its feet, unless members push for an early decision on the issue. Some optimists still believe that Liffe's marketing flair, combined with growing interest in derivative products among fund managers, may produce a sufficient surge in volume to save the stock options market in its present form.</p>

It was caused less by  the events in Germany than by those on the international  financial and capital markets. No central bank can accept  direct responsibility for the development of the capital market  interest rates but can only reduce the expectations of  inflation. Referring to the German money supply, which has  soared 20.6 percent, Tietmeyer warned against precipitate  conclusions, because the money supply reflects a number of  special influences. Even though it is not easy to distinguish  the special factors from the trend, in the future, too, the M3  money supply will be watched closely as one of the essential  indicators. The decisions of the Bundesbank are based on the  overall economic development. Therefore, the money market  interest rates need not remain at the current level.</p>

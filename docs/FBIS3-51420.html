During these special sessions they are  to review and discuss the amnesty law proposed by President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    Starting on 19 January for three days, special sessions will  be held at the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate to discuss and  approve the amnesty bill concerning the violent incidents in the  Mexican State of Chiapas which was sent to Congress by President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    The amnesty bill contains five articles. Basically the bill  states that people who violated the law during the violence in  Chiapas State between 1 January 1994 and 1100 on 16 January will  not be arrested and prosecuted. The amnesty bill states that  the attorney general will verify that the law is applied.  Arrest warrants will be canceled and those being prosecuted  will be released. The bill also states that in case there are  any amparos filed regarding these incidents, the authority will  dismiss charges and will declare the penal action ended. The  people favored by the amnesty bill may not be arrested or  prosecuted in the future for the Chiapas incidents.    Francisco Jose Paoli, National Action Party deputy, read the  president's amnesty bill. One of its most important articles  states:    [Begin Paoli recording] The individuals who are currently  facing judicial action, inside or outside the country, as a  result of the crimes referred to in Article 1 may benefit from  the amnesty once they have surrendered all types of weapons,  explosives, instruments, or other objects used to commit crimes.  This must be done during the 30-day period following the  enactment of the law at locations that will be announced at the  proper time. [end recording]    Legislators from the Party of the Democratic Revolution  demanded the discussion of various constitutional reforms during  the special sessions to offer more integral solutions to the  problems faced by the Indians in Chiapas State.</p>

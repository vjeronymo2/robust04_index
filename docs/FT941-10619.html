			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Doubts persist on Bosnia air strikes: Growing pressure for action in the republic The massacre of 68 shoppers in a Sarajevo market last weekend has concentrated world attention as never before on the need for effective action in Bosnia. Even those, like Britain, who have always had deep reservations about the usefulness of military intervention, are talking about more 'muscular' action. And even that paragon of caution, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, has said that the Sarajevo atrocity 'brings us near a decision, in one way or another, to use force'. Yet for all the huffing and puffing and the widespread feeling that 'enough is enough', a big question-mark hangs over the use of air power  - the only type of military action any of the western powers is prepared to contemplate. The statement issued by the European Union's foreign ministers at their meeting in Brussels on Monday that Nato and the United Nations should try to lift the siege of Sarajevo 'using all means necessary, including the use of air power', certainly marks a political change of direction. Only last spring the Europeans rejected a US proposal which included the use of air strikes against Bosnian Serb artillery positions, as well as the selective lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. In practice, however, a decision to go ahead with air strikes now lies in the hands of Nato, which has been asked by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, to authorise such bombing raids, if these are considered feasible and once the responsibility for the Sarajevo massacre is deemed to have been clearly established. The advice of senior Nato and UN commanders will be crucial in any final decision to launch air strikes and it is no secret that most military experts are extremely sceptical about their effectiveness in Bosnia's wooded and mountainous terrain. After a two-hour meeting of President Bill Clinton's senior national security advisers on Monday, Mr William Perry, defence secretary, indicated that he and General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, had expressed their doubts about such a course of action. 'We take very seriously the limitations of air strikes against, first of all, artillery type targets, and secondly, any targets that are embedded in a civilian population.' Bosnian Serb artillery and tank positions, when they are not concealed in forest, are reported to be highly mobile and easily relocated when under attack. If they were deployed in populated areas, air strikes would risk killing innocent civilians. Moreover, Serb and Moslem positions are frequently so close to each other that bombing raids could kill combatants from both sides. Quite apart from the military limitations of air strikes - recognised by Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, when he said a whole range of other options were also being considered - there are many political and, ultimately humanitarian drawbacks. The launching of air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs, by triggering retaliation against inadequate UN forces, could bring to an end the whole UN peacekeeping operation in Bosnia and greatly jeopardise, if not halt altogether, the delivery of international aid. Equally serious, air strikes, while satisfying the growing desire of western public opinion and governments for punitive action, are unlikely to bring a political solution any nearer. That is why Britain, as well as the US, continue to insist that they be linked to clear objectives that would end the conflict. Both France and Britain have been doing their utmost, so far with little success, to persuade the US to become more closely involved in the peace negotiations. The US, which was responsible for sinking the original Vance-Owen plan for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, has been equally unenthusiastic about the international mediators' subsequent project. This would carve the country up into three ethnic mini-states - Serb, Moslem and Croat - but has proved unacceptable to the Moslems, who argue that the territory allocated to them does not amount to a viable country. Washington has all along refused to support a solution which is not approved by the Moslems, thus making sure that the stalemate at the Geneva peace conference, which has been further exacerbated by Croat-Moslem fighting and territorial disputes, will not be broken. One possible way out of that stalemate is agreement by the three warring parties to the mediators' proposal that, as a first step, a separate agreement should be reached on Sarajevo, which would demilitarise the city and place it under UN administration. Such a partial solution, which would cover an area of some 1,500 sq km around Sarajevo, would relieve the siege of the city by putting it out of range of Serb guns. Lord Owen, the EU's representative, has indicated that Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, would be willing to negotiate such an agreement, though the latter is notorious for failing to keep his word. A rapid separate agreement on Sarajevo, on which talks are due to be held in Geneva tomorrow, could be the best way of avoiding a military escalation in Bosnia, with unforeseeable consequences. It could also be the first step towards an overall peace settlement, which remains the only way to end the conflict.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Leading Article: New ideas on nuclear arms OF ALL the risks associated with nuclear weapons, the break-up of a nuclear power was one that nobody contemplated. In recent months, the search for reassurance on the nuclear front has been a prime focus of east-west diplomacy. The subject will be high on the agenda at Friday's UN Security Council summit and involves ensuring a centralised, trustworthy command system for the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal; securing the non-Russian republics in their stated non-nuclear intentions; preventing the leakage of weapons, parts or expertise to would-be proliferators; and keeping Russia to the promises and treaty commitments made by Mr Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw and destroy much of its stockpile. It is hoped that these plans will be extended in response to further US arms reductions. There is scope for western governments to help the republics fulfil these aims. The cost of some measures would be marginal; even the more expensive would be cheap compared to the cost of failure. If necessary, the west should be prepared to make financial aid contingent upon co-operation in de-fanging the nukes. The US congress has authorised Dollars 400m of Pentagon funds to help with storage and destruction of Soviet nuclear arms, a sum not yet taken up. It is perhaps not surprising that the Russians should hesitate before handing over responsibility for dismantling their most secret weapons. But there are other ways in which the US and its allies can help, and which can be made acceptable to the recipients. Some 13,000 of the ex-Soviet Union's 27,000 deployed nuclear warheads are already on the elimination list. Using current Russian facilities, it would probably take 10 years to cope with them. In addition to these and subsequent arms-control cuts, there are thousands more old weapons in storage that need dealing with. Central storage The safest first step would be to ship all the weapons due for elimination to central storage in Russia. The west could assist in setting up a team to carry out inventories and in arranging for weapons to be transported, grouped and disabled so that they cannot be fired. More ambitious would be a western-built plant for the complex business of disassembling the weapons. This entails dangers both for security - keeping track of fissile materials and parts such as triggering mechanisms and guidance systems which proliferating nations would be only too keen to lay hands on - and for the environment. A programme would also be required for recycling weapons-grade uranium into civil fuel and for handling the plutonium warhead cores. Foolproof precautions A case can be made for leaving the nuclear materials in the weapons, as a lesser risk if foolproof precautions cannot be secured. Either way, there would be a need to place stored warheads or materials under some agreed form of supervision. This could be done by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but that would require a big increase in its Dollars 75m-a-year inspection budget. A further target for western financial help involves Russia's own nuclear weapons community. There are reckoned to be tens of thousands who could be of use to a country seeking nuclear arms, including 5,000-7,000 experienced in specific weapons-related technology. Suggestions that the west might pay such scientists and technicians directly  -for instance in projects for cleaning up pollution from the Soviet weapons programme - should not be dismissed as madcap. Direct assistance for what would be tantamount to a selective welfare scheme might raise political objections in the US, but it could be carried out indirectly through an international organisation. Russian officials have suggested Dollars 1,000 a month would be enough to persuade a scientist to stay put. At that rate, several thousand could be employed for the next 20 years for much less than it would cost Britain to procure a new sub-strategic nuclear missile for its air force. In terms of the security it would buy, it would be good value.</p>

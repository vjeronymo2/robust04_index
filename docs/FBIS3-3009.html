"This conforms to China's interests as well as to the  regional and world interests," Qian said at a press conference  this morning.    Asked about the International Atomic Energy Agency's  difficulties in inspection of nuclear facilities in the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), Qian said China  supports DPRK to hold negotiations with the United States, the  Republic of Korea, and the International Atomic Energy Agency.    In the past the negotiations met some setbacks and achieved  some progresses too, Qian said.    Now some difficulties have cropped up again. "We believe  that  so long as all sides are patient in negotiations and do not  adopt measures to make the situation complicated, the  negotiations will achieve important progress," he said.</p>

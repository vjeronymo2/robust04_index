			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Security services accused by MPs over 'supergun' BRITISH intelligence was yesterday accused of misleading parliament over the Iraqi 'supergun' affair by three Labour members of a House of Commons select committee. However, a trade and industry committee report stopped short of censuring the security services. The committee's two-year investigation into the saga blamed inadequate procedures and misjudgments by civil servants, rather than ministers or the intelligence services, for failing to prevent the manufacture and export of supergun components by British companies. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, accused the government of an 'attempted whitewash' before the general election and pledged to launch an independent inquiry into the affair if Labour wins. 'It is now clear the British government knew of plans for a supergun long before the official admission in April 1990,' he said. 'I want to know from the prime minister who knew what and when, and which ministers were involved.' The committee's report concludes that 'knowledge within the government of the project was like a number of people all holding pieces of a jigsaw without realising that they were the pieces of the same jigsaw'. Both the Ministry of Defence and Department of Trade and Industry are censured for taking decisions on the basis of telephone conversations with no written record, or reference to management and ministers. The report also criticises the DTI for not requesting more documents when Sheffield Forgemasters and Walter Somers, the British companies which made barrel sections for the project, applied for export licences in summer 1988; for failing to link the two orders and to keep them under continued scrutiny; and for not checking its records and connecting the contracts with information about the Iraqi project circulated to government departments in late 1989. In spite of claims during the committee's hearings that British intelligence was kept fully briefed about the project by the supergun's designer, Dr Gerald Bull, an amendment specifically censuring the security services was not included in the report. It concludes that 'the long-range gun affair raises serious and important questions about the accountability of the intelligence services both to ministers and to parliament'. The attack against the intelligence services came from the Labour MPs, Mr Doug Hoyle, Mr Jim Cousins and Mr Stan Crowther. At a sometimes heated news conference yesterday, Mr Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, said he found it 'almost impossible to imagine' that British and other foreign intelligence services were not aware of the project from its inception. Mr Cousins, MP for Newcastle Central, said he was in 'absolutely no doubt that parliament was deceived about this matter. Either the intelligence services knew about this from the beginning or they are grossly incompetent and ought to be sacked'. Mr Keith Hampson, Conservative MP for Leeds North-West, wanted the report's publication delayed after documents relating to the affair came to light last week.</p>

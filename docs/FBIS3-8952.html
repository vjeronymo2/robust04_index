On Monday [14 March], most of the former opposition  parliamentary parties agreed to propose Moravcik, the foreign  minister of the former cabinet of Vladimir Meciar, as the new  Slovak premier.    President Kovac asked the former opposition parties to  compose a new government after the Meciar-led Movement for a  Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) had not answered his question whether  it would propose a person whom he could charge with the  composition of the new cabinet.

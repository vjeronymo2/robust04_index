			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Test for Collor on austerity policy BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor today faces a crucial political test of his government's fiscal austerity policy which could determine his success in obtaining a Dollars 2bn loan from the International Monetary Fund next week. The government is fighting for congressional approval of legislation to increase social security contributions in order to pay a 147 per cent rise in pensions granted last week by the Supreme Court. Mr Collor claims that the state welfare system is bankrupt and that the extra Cr11 trillion (Dollars 10bn) that the pension increase would cost the Treasury would wipe out all its gains from recently approved tax reforms. This would jeopardise its proposed fiscal adjustments due to be presented to the IMF next week. But amid growing controversy over the system's lack of funds it seems unlikely that the government will secure approval of the new law. Yesterday Mr Genebaldo Correia, congressional leader of Brazil's main political party, the PMDB, said it would vote against the project. The government insists that the changing demographic profile of Brazil's population is responsible for the welfare system's parlous financial state. But opposition politicians claim that the government has been using the funds to finance schemes such as Mr Collor's pet multi-million dollar project to construct integrated education centres.</p>

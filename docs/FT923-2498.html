			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Zimbabwe pins hopes on the coming of rain: How drought has hit the economy hard AS Zimbabwe slides inexorably into its deepest recession in 60 years, recovery hopes are pinned entirely on above-average rains in the coming season. The economy is going into ever-steeper decline as the impact of last season's catastrophic drought is exacerbated by social problems and water and electricity shortages. The government estimates that some 5m people, roughly half the population, are receiving drought relief. Two weeks ago, the monthly drought relief allocation was cut from 15 kilograms per person to 8 kg. In Bulawayo, the country's second largest city which accounts for a quarter of industrial production, local officials warn that water will 'run out' by the end of next month unless good rains fall before then. However, Bulawayo's rains do not normally start until mid-November. The electricity crisis has its origins in prolonged official delays, first in agreeing a programme for new generation capacity and subsequently in imposing load-shedding. Power cuts were first mooted in May, but then postponed in favour of electricity imports from Zaire. In mid-September a new rationing scheme was announced, but within 24 hours it had been temporarily postponed because of 'a technical hitch'. The worst of the maize crisis too could have been averted had the government heeded repeated warnings going back to the late 1980s that its 'cheap food' policy would lead to under-production. Farm production is expected to fall 40 per cent this year, with maize deliveries at less than 30,000 tonnes compared with 1.8m tonnes in the mid-1980s. Cotton production collapsed to 52,000 tonnes from 320,000 three years ago, while sugar deliveries to mills were 3 per cent of normal levels. Although production of the country's main export, flue-cured tobacco, increased despite the drought, quality was seriously affected. With three quarters of the crop, estimated at 180m kg now sold, the average price of ZDollars 8.60 (90p) a kg is 25 per cent below last year's seasonal average of ZDollars 11.57. On present trends, the signs are that the seasonal average will be close to ZDollars 8, not far above the estimated break-even level of ZDollars 7.50 a kg. The fall in farm output will be partially cushioned by increased beef production and prices - the result of high forced slaughter rates - continued growth in horticulture, where exports have risen from ZDollars 5m in the mid-1980s to the some ZDollars 200m this year and tobacco earnings of about ZDollars 1.4bn, still down almost 30 per cent on last year. Hopes of a powerful farm-led rebound in the economy next year look increasingly fragile. Not only will 1992-1993 plantings be constrained by lack of irrigation water, but worsening water and electricity supply for all sectors of the economy will inhibit recovery. Manufacturing output, which continued rising until May, is now falling sharply and industrialists expect an output decline of around 5 per cent in 1992. No recovery is likely until the latter half of next year, and that will be only modest given high nominal interest rates, falling investment and employment at home and deteriorating sales in South Africa, which is the country's main market for manufactured exports. Drought - and the IMF - have forced the authorities to tighten both fiscal and monetary policy. Despite angry criticism from some businessmen, money market interest rates have been pushed above the inflation rate, currently 41 per cent, and further increases are inevitable before inflation peaks, probably not far short of 50 per cent, later in the year. Mr Bernard Chidzero, the finance minister, has come in for sharp criticism, too, for his failure to cut public spending in his 1992 budget. This is misplaced, however, since after adjusting for the ZDollars 2bn drought relief provision, Mr Chidzero budgeted for only a 5 per cent rise in public expenditure, which with forecast inflation of 35 per cent over the next fiscal year, implies a huge reduction in real spending. Indeed, the share of government spending in GDP will fall from close on 50 per cent last year to 40 per cent in 1992-1993. All of this is predicated on the minister's ability to make his cuts stick. The omens are not good; not only has government recently upgraded its estimate of maize imports from 1.8m tonnes to 2.5m tonnes, but its 10 to 15 per cent civil service pay award exceeds the 7.3 per cent budgetary provision. With the IMF breathing down his neck, Mr Chidzero may yet have to make further swingeing cuts, with defence being everyone's preferred target. If the minister fails to achieve his courageous spending targets and the Reserve (central) Bank, which has stuck resolutely to its tight money stance, is forced to back down in the face of vociferous business criticism, then hopes of lower inflation and interest rates next year will come to nought. With good rains there should be a recovery in the latter half of 1993, though only a modest one, while inflation will remain uncomfortably high and renewed devaluation will be necessary. But another drought would add Zimbabwe to the growing list of sub-Saharan countries requiring upwards of Dollars 1bn a year in foreign assistance. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has approved an SDR315m (Pounds 233.73m) three-year loan to Zimbabwe, of which SDR200.6m may be drawn under the enhanced structural adjustment facility. The balance comes under the extended fund facility.</p>

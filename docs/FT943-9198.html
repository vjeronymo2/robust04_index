			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / UK Company News: SCI buys 'strategic' stake in Plantsbrook Service Corporation International, North America's largest funeral group, yesterday continued its aggressive foray into the British burial business by buying a 3 per cent stake in Plantsbrook, the sector's largest quoted company. SCI claimed this was a strategic stake, but said that it was interested in buying further shares. The announcement came just one day after the Texan company received approval from the Takeover Panel to put forward a recommended 775p for Great Southern Group, the only other UK listed funeral company. Plantsbrook is 46 per cent owned by Pompes Funebres, France's largest funeral business, and it is understood that SCI's strategy could be to secure a ring-side seat if the parent considers asset sales. It had informed both Pompes Funebres and Plantsbrook of its share purchases, which have taken place over recent weeks. Pompes Funebres controls around one third of France's funeral market, in addition to interests in Belgium and Singapore, and SCI has made no secret of its ambitions to use Great Southern as a springboard for expansion into Europe. SCI was also concerned that Loewen Group, its largest North American competitor, might consider turning its attentions to Plantsbrook, after the failure of its attempts to block SCI's Great Southern bid. Plantsbrook controls about 9 per cent of the UK funeral market, compared with Great Southern's share of some 4.5 per cent.</p>

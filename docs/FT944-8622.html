			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow mirrors gyrations in bond market Wall Street US share prices mirrored the ups and downs of the bond market yesterday morning, before falling firmly into negative territory by the close, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 17.15 off at 3,828.05. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 2.04 to 463.56, while the American Stock Exchange composite shed 2.26 to 446.13 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 3.80 to 765.84. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 323m shares. At one point the market was down 36 Dow points before coming off its lows later in the afternoon. Early morning news from the Commerce Department that housing starts fell by 5.2 per cent in October momentarily boosted bond prices, towing equities along, but neither market proved able to sustain the upticks. Later in the morning the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported a decline in its index of business activ-ity for the month of October. This news, however, failed to cheer the markets, which drew pessimistic conclusions from a sub-index that showed an increase in prices paid by manufacturers. Investors mainly remain unsure about how to interpret the wave of economic data that has been reported over the past two weeks. There is also uncertainty about the implications of the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday to increase the target Federal Funds rate to 5 1/2 per cent. Although the monetary tightening was somewhat more aggressive than expected, the Fed left the door open for another rate increase late this year or in early 1995. Campbell Soup moved ahead Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 , surpassing its previous high for the year of Dollars 44 1/4 , after reporting record first-quarter earnings. Operating earnings at the soupmaker increased by 16 per cent from the same period last year. Hewlett-Packard also rose after reporting stronger than expected fourth-quarter results, gaining Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 100. Net revenue in the US was up 20 per cent from a year ago for the California-based computermaker, while net revenue from abroad rose by 26 per cent. Hewlett's strong results initially pulled Adobe Systems up by Dollars 1 1/2 before the stock fell to end Dollars  3/4 down at Dollars 34 1/2 . Hewlett is the biggest customer for Adobe's Postscript software. Hilton Hotels jumped Dollars 10 to Dollars 67 7/8 after announcing that it had retained Smith Barney to study the possibility of selling the company, or spinning off one or more of its businesses. Genentech declined Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 after a report yesterday morning that nearly a dozen executives at the biotech company had sold large stock holdings since July. Exxon put on Dollars 3/8 at Dollars 61 after a court agreed to a plan to settle part of a suit filed over the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Other oil companies also posted gains: Mobil firmed Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 84 3/4. Canada Weakness in US and Canadian bonds set the tone for equity markets as Toronto stocks posted losses in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index was in negative territory from the opening and closed near the day's low with a fall of 27.90 at 4,143.84. Declines outpaced rises by 465 to 273 after volume of 57.7m shares. Financial markets have been reeling since the US Federal Reserve lifted short-term rates on Tuesday, with some believing the rise will choke economic expansion. Eleven sub-indices were down, led by pipeline, gold, industrial products and oil stocks. The real estate, transportation and utilities sectors rose. Golds fell 1.48 per cent. Venezuela Shares in Caracas recovered from early losses to close higher for the first time in more than three weeks. The recovery was led by Electricidad de Caracas, and the Merinvest composite index added 2.18 or 1.8 per cent at 122.30, with Electricidad up 10 bolivars at 224 bolivars. Electricidad had fallen from a level of above 330 bolivars last month, largely due to the announcement of a Dollars 65m one-for-six share subscription. Brokers remained cautious, pointing to the low trading volume.</p>

The appointment was made under this week's order by US Bankruptcy Court Judge James Garrity. The mediator, called an 'examiner,' is charged with working with the various parties to reach an agreement on an independent board for the US unit, Olympia &amp; York Cos. (USA). On May 24, Judge Garrity denied a motion by Citicorp, parent company of New York's largest bank, to appoint a 'responsible officer' to run O&amp;Y's US unit.

A spokeswoman for the administrator said Mr Vance is with the New York law firm of Simpson Thatcher. Mr Vance also recently worked on negotiating a peace agreement in war-torn Bosnia, in the former Yugoslavia. Mr Vance served as US secretary of state under President Carter from 1977 to 1980. He then returned to his law practice at Simpson Thatcher &amp; Bartlett.</p>

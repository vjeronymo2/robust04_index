			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Monday Interview: Visionary with a global goal - Jacques Attali, president of the EBRD, talks to Peter Norman The problem with Jacques Attali is knowing whether he has his head in the clouds or his feet on the ground. The latest chapter in the remarkable career of this French academic, author, part-time film-maker, presidential adviser and intellectual begins today when he becomes president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The London-based EBRD, or European Bank as Mr Attali prefers to call it, has been set up in record time to help the emerging democracies of eastern and central Europe develop market economies. It has a lot of hopes riding on it. Proof of this will be the presence today of some 30 heads of government and 39 finance ministers at the bank's inauguration ceremony in the unlikely setting of the International Maritime Organisation headquarters on the south bank of the Thames. But for Mr Attali, the bank, although important, is only a means to achieving a much bigger goal. The EBRD 'is the first pan-European institution, which happens to be a bank,' he says. Moreover, he would be prepared, if necessary, to postpone its lending operations for one or two years to ensure that it achieved the right pitch of excellence. 'I will be very cautious in the disbursements because triple-A is the beginning and the end of my banking credo.' This curious mixture of high-flown ambition and operational caution surfaced many times during an interview with Mr Attali in the bank's spartan temporary headquarters in the City of London. Whereas a layman - and some member governments - might suppose that the bank had been set up to meet specific needs for finance or technical expertise in eastern Europe, it soon became clear that Mr Attali's main interests lay elsewhere. 'The question is the vision,' he said. 'The vision was and still is to build the first pan-European institution, in order to make totally irreversible the end of the split of the European continent in two.' This split, Mr Attali explained, went back much further than the 70 years of communism. For 500 years, in fact, the differences in development between eastern and western Europe had been a cause of war. As the iron curtain was falling, he and his former boss, President Francois Mitterrand of France, had asked themselves how could they 'hook irreversibly the east to the west'. The first answer was to create democracy and the market economy in the former communist states because 'they are the core of success of the western part of Europe'. Ideas then focused on a financial institution. 'We could have thought about a confederation, about political institutions. But today the main problem is finance.' The early years of the European Community provided an instructive example. 'The EC was built up not through the ideas of European political union - although that was useful - but through the first institutions having money. 'We talked about a bank because bank means money. But also because of its capacity for arm-twisting relationships in order to push them (the eastern European countries) in the direction of democracy and market economy.' His ambition is for the bank to help restructure eastern Europe's economy and then be transformed 'into something else, which is a really purely global, pan-European institution'. He cites the example of the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of today's EC, which 'disappeared and merged into the common market'. The European Bank will, he insists, be a completely different from existing international financial institutions (or IFI's) such as the International Monetary Fund or the multilateral development banks (MDBs) such as the World Bank. And woe betide anyone who refers to the 39 nations and two European institutions putting up its Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital as 'shareholders'. Crunching a plastic pill box in his hand, Mr Attali was adamant: 'This is not an IFI. This is not an MDB. This is an institution of a third type, of a new type . . . If you talk about shareholders, you are a commercial bank. That is fine. But you cannot pretend to have political visions with shareholders.' Although Mr Attali dislikes the language of commercial banking, the EBRD's oper-ations will have a distinct private sector focus. It is committed to promoting 'private and entrepreneurial initiative' in central and eastern Europe and can use no more than 40 per cent of its resources to finance the public sector. It also has an overt political goal. The former communist states must be 'committed to and applying the principles of multi-party democracy, pluralism and market economics'. Its capital has been subscribed by a unique mix of countries, symbolising the post-cold-war era. European Community states and institutions have a 51 per cent majority of votes. The rest is shared among the other west European countries, eastern Europe except Albania, the Soviet Union and a few non-European countries including Japan, Canada and the US, which, with 10 per cent, is the biggest EBRD member. Some 30 per cent of capital will be paid in and may be used for equity investment. The bank's treasury department estimates that it could disburse Ecu5.5bn in loans and make Ecu600m of equity investments in the first five years, rising to Ecu12.6bn and Ecu1.8bn respectively over eight years. But aren't these rather small sums, given that Mr Attali last September said eastern and central Europe would need Ecu2,000bn bring average labour productivity to French and German levels? 'No, not really, not really,' he replies. 'Suppose it takes 20 years to do that. Voila] that means 100bn Ecus a year. The bank, according to the people around here, can mobilise something like 100bn Ecus in seven or eight years: 100bn in seven years means 15bn in one year.' Because the bank will act as a catalyst, encouraging others to join projects in eastern Europe, it will activate more investment funds than it actually disburses. Mr Attali's off-the-cuff projections - which are rather more optimistic than those of the bank's treasury - suggest it can mobilise at most 15 per cent of the region's financing needs. But the eastern European countries have high domestic savings and 15 per cent may be all the foreign capital needed. Mr Attali himself will not worry too much if these hopes are not met. 'At the end of a period we can be there. Even if we say that we are 10 per cent, I don't care. Even if we say we have half of it, I don't care.' So when will business start? 'I hope, cross my fingers, that we will have the first operation done before June.' It is notable that Mr Attali does not have the bank's business plan at his fingertips. But then: 'I am an intellectual . . . a professor of economics first,' he says, 'I will never make the mistake, I hope, to believe that I could become a banker. I will not take decisions on the banking side. My only duty is to find the best bankers to do it.' While moulding the bank, Mr Attali has kept up a fiendish schedule of extra-mural activity. On the day of the interview he had got up, as usual, at 4am, to work on his 16th book and to discuss a project for his third film. In his 10 years as President Mitterrand's special adviser he produced seven books. But, contrary to some expectations, he has been very much a hands-on president-designate. He expects to stay at the bank for more than his initial four-year term. A strict taskmaster, he has made full use of the article in the statutes giving him responsibility 'for the organisation, appointment and dismissal' of staff. There has been a considerable turnover of personnel at the EBRD so far and this trend can be expected to continue. Although today will be one of celebration, there is considerable scepticism surrounding the EBRD and Mr Attali. It is, for example, unclear: whether it will be able to find enough projects compatible with maintaining 'triple-A' status; how relations will work out between the 23-strong board of directors representing the bank members and the bank staff under Mr Attali; how it will co-operate with the European Commission, IMF, World Bank and International Finance Corp, which is already active in eastern Europe, and; whether its political goals will lead to problems in the bank's lending operations. For example, should the bank call in loans, creating a possible risk for its business operations, if one of its borrowers reverts to dictatorship? On this latter issue, Mr Attali is confident that all international institutions will eventually fall in with the EBRD's ground-breaking approach towards encouraging democracy. He guesses that it will take at least 15 years for eastern Europe to adjust its economies. 'The only thing is that I am sure we are going to be disappointed,' he says. 'It will take a lot of time. With a lot of ups and downs.' After 55 minutes, it was easy to see how this 47-year-old former eminence grise of the Elysee Palace can encourage idealism and scepticism in about equal measure. 'Scepticism is better than (being) despised, isn't it? And scepticism is not indifference. The worst is indifference,' he says.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1943 Born November 1 in Algiers. 1963 French National Polytechnic School. 1968 Two years at France's National School of Public Administration. 1972 Publishes first of 15 books covering economics, politics,      biography and fiction. 1981 Special adviser to President Mitterrand. 1989 Member of French Conseil d'Etat. 1990 President-designate of EBRD. 1991 President of EBRD.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Second-hand endowment trust launched A NEW investment trust which will invest in second hand endowment policies is being launched by Exeter Asset Management and Teather &amp; Greenwood, the broker. There is a growing market in with-profits endowment policies, with policyholders finding it more rewarding to sell their policies rather than to surrender them to the insurance company. Investors are attracted to these second hand policies by their relatively steady returns. The Exeter Geared Endowment Policy Trust will have an unusual structure. It will have gearing, via a zero coupon debenture stock. Although this will not pay interest, the capital roll-up on the debenture will be an allowable expense for tax purposes. As well as endowment policies, the trust will buy income shares of split capital investment trusts. It will be able to offset tax on this income against the roll-up on the zero, enabling it to receive the dividends gross. This income can then be used to fund the continuing premium payments on the endowment policies. The fund managers expect a return of about 10.85 per cent per year over the trust's 15 year life. Further details will be available when the prospectus is published next week.</p>

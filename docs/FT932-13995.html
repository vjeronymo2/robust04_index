			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards for Technological Achievement 1993: Radar fit for the River Rhine - Smiths Industries / Kelvin Hughes and Aerospace THE technological links between the broad boats that ply the River Rhine and jet fighters that streak through the skies may not be apparent to most people, but they are clear enough to Smiths Industries which has won two Queen's technology awards for products serving these sectors. Its Kelvin Hughes subsidiary, the group's naval and marine equipment specialist, was awarded one of them for its river radar system, which was designed to meet the tough new specifications laid down by the Rhine River Authority. These were introduced in 1990 and since then, the company's RSR1000 river radar has taken a quarter of the market for new equipment on vessels operating on the Rhine and Danube. The other award went to Smiths Industries Aerospace - Integrated Display Systems for its multi-purpose colour display used on fighter aircraft. The MPCD provides a full colour moving map display which is visible in cockpit conditions ranging from direct sunlight to total darkness. The MPCD functions with a re-designed cathode ray tube which is considerably brighter than on previous models and has sharper definition. Infra-red emissions are suppressed by a new optical filtering technique and colour contrast is thus improved and light reflection reduced. The system is also more reliable, with a fourfold improvement to 1,600 operating hours in time between services. The US Navy has selected the MPCD as its standard display. Kelvin Hughes' river radar system uses a spiral scanned display on its cathode ray tube which gives much better resolution at the short distances where clear vision is vital to safe navigation. It can be mounted on the bulkhead, in a console, or on a table. The picture presents a continuous 150 degree view ahead and a full view astern. Around 1,000 river radar units have been sold since the product's introduction, says Mr Barry Morgan, Kelvin Hughes' marketing services manager. Most of these are for German and Dutch vessels. The company also hopes to sell into eastern Europe. Now that the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal has opened up inland waterway traffic in central Europe, boats can enter the Rhine from the Danube and thus have to accord with the new rules. Already, there are some 10,000 vessels on the Rhine and those with older radar systems will have to upgrade these at their next refit.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPANY              LOCATION           PRODUCT OR DEVELOPMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- B  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BT Laboratories                         Metal organic vapour (BTL) Optical                           phase epitaxy for making Research                                semiconductor devices for the Division             Ipswich, Suffolk   optoelectronics industry  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bridon Ropes         Doncaster, Brifen Department    S.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 18 (XINHUA) -- China today set up the  Zhonggu Cereals and Oils Group and the Zhongshang Enterprise  Group.    Both are claimed to be the biggest in the country in the  cereals trade and commercial businesses.    Addressing the inaugural meeting of the two groups, Minister  of Internal Trade Zhang Haoruo said that the two state-owned  groups will be the main forces in helping the central government  exercise effective macro-control in the two trades.    He pointed out that the establishment of the two groups was  of great importance to stabilize commodity prices, and to the  smooth carrying out of the "vegetable basket" project and  grain-supply project -- the two government plans to provide  enough food for the people.    Zhang said that the Zhonggu Group will mainly conduct trade  in cereals and edible oil. It has more than 100 subordinate  enterprises.    The central enterprise of Zhonggu claimed a registered  capital fund of 200 million Renminbi yuan.    Businesses conducted by the Zhongshang Commercial Enterprise  Group will cover retail sale, wholesale and all other commodity  distribution businesses.    It has 18 closely-related subordinate enterprises and  hundreds of loosely-controlled enterprises.    The whole Zhongshang Group reported a total capital of more  than two billion yuan, and the enterprise at the core has a  registered capital of 150 million yuan.</p>

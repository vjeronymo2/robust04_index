			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Management: A question of motivation - How to keep up staff morale amid job losses How do you manage a business whose 340 employees will mostly be made redundant in two years' time? That is the challenge facing Keith Greenough, chief executive of Mortgage Express, the TSB's centralised mortgage lending subsidiary. A casualty of the deep recession in the UK housing market, North London-based Mortgage Express is winding down its 'book' ahead of the transfer of its functions and remaining assets to TSB branches in 1996. At that point, all but a few will lose their jobs. Greenough acknowledges that the health of the business is heavily influenced by macroeconomic factors - the six months to April, for example, saw a turnround from losses of Pounds 15m to profits of Pounds 19m as the bad debt charge tumbled - but he insists that the efforts of staff can make a significant impact. Employee involvement, training and better communication are on the Mortgage Express agenda, at least as much as they would be at any enlightened financial services company with a more secure future. Morale was especially low when Greenough and his team arrived in 1991, amid rumours that the company was likely to be sold and following a decision to relocate the mortgage administration centre to Glasgow (subsequently reversed). 'One of the first things we noticed was a lack of trust,' explains Peter Taylor, director of human resources and quality. An important part of the re-motivation strategy has been the development of two-way communication channels. Particular emphasis was placed on introducing a staff opinion survey that adequately reflected the needs of the company. Other companies (including TSB, Rank Xerox and Federal Express) were benchmarked and 'metaplanning', a technique involving different groups of staff in confidential brainstorming sessions, was used. The fact that 78 per cent of employees responded to the subsequent questionnaire against a 60 per cent response rate to earlier polls conducted for the company by Mori, is an indication that the planning paid off. There are now about half a dozen cross-functional teams working on different issues, including finding a fairer system of staff appraisal. Overall 71 per cent of employees said they were positive or very positive about the company, although 50 per cent do not or tend not to believe what management says, and more than 60 per cent disagree or tend to disagree with the statement that Mortgage Express management generally understands the problems they face in their jobs. Staff development is one means by which Greenough and his fellow executives will be hoping to improve their rating this year. Among the 36 employees being sponsored or part-sponsored for a professional qualification at the moment is Susie Every, a litigation supervisor who started as a temp in the collections department. Every has just completed an MA in Human Resource Management, having written her dissertation on the problems of downsizing at Mortgage Express. She is also developing a course on CVs/job applications which she hopes to run for colleagues if a pilot project proves successful. More interesting work is another important source of motivation, say Mortgage Express executives. Taylor points out, for example, that 32 people have been moved to new positions in the company in the past year. 'As the company gets smaller, the chance of someone moving into a supervisory/management role is greater than it would otherwise be,' explains Anne McDougall, manager in risk and management accounts. Financial incentives, however, do not appear to loom large at Mortgage Express. According to Greenough: 'what you pay people is a potential demotivator if you pay them a wage which is inconsistent with the market. This is a possible source of dissatisfaction. Paying people more money is unlikely in itself to create a higher level of performance. It is the way you treat them.'</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> Asia-Pacific nations say they do not want to form a trade bloc confronting  North America and Europe, but economists warn that they may be forced into it  unless world trade is liberalized. "Events in North America and Europe are  driving the world that way.  </P> <P> An Asia-Pacific trade bloc is emerging by default," says a recent report by the  Australian-based Center for International Economics, a private research group.  Asia-Pacific countries worry that the European Community's plan to become a  single market in 1992 could make it a "Fortress Europe" that would resist  imports. The free trade zone comprising Canada and the United States, which  Mexico may join, has aroused similar fears. A three-way split in world trade  will emerge unless countries commit themselves to removing trade barriers, says  the research group's report, which was commissioned by the Confederation of  Asia-Pacific Chambers of Commerce and Industry. A Reuters survey shows that the  12 nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, formed last year,  reject the idea that the organization will become a closed trading system.  </P></p>

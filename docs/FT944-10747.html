			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Getting policy in sharper focus / A look at the changes taking place at SG Warburg SG Warburg Group has completed an overhaul of its senior policy-making structure following the most rigorous internal management review since the Big Bang deregulation of London markets in 1986. The changes sweep away what Lord Cairns, Warburg's chief executive, described as a 'fuzzy' decision-making structure in which too many people had to be consulted. Even those most informed about key areas felt they lacked the authority to make choices. Lord Cairns said the effect of the structure was to make decision-making a time-consuming process in a business which, by definition, must move quickly. 'Decisions became rather fuzzy. Nobody felt ownership of anything, and everything was referred up to the top,' he said. The management structure had evolved since Big Bang, when various acquired businesses were integrated into the group. The changes, which were announced internally in October at the same time as Warburg issued a profits warning, abolish the 18-member investment banking management committee. It is replaced by a smaller investment banking policy committee consisting of eight of those 18 executives. The old IBMC had been responsible for overseeing the decisions of other committees, several of which 'were in the high teens' in their own members, Lord Cairns said. Sometimes the IBMC would be discussing matters which some members knew little about. Under the new structure, four new committees, each with eight members, have been created. These committees are intended to make the sort of decisions which used to be referred to the IBMC. The management changes were unrelated to current trading conditions at Warburg, he said. They were put in train about a year ago. Mr Peter Wilmot-Sitwell, then chairman of SG Warburg Securities, was coming up to retirement and Mr Herman Van der Wyck, chairman of SG Warburg and Co, intended to step back from executive responsibility. 'The environment was right for change,' Lord Cairns said. Overhauling the management structure, for an institution like Warburg, has not been easy. 'We come from a culture which is pretty consensus driven. There is a great respect for the views of others. What we need is a balance between a hierarchical structure and a consensus structure,' he explained. Deciding who should and who should not be on decision-making committees was a 'sensitive' issue, he said. The new policy committee consists of Lord Cairns, Mr Derek Higgs, chairman of SG Warburg and Co, Mr Nick Verey, chairman of SG Warburg Securities, Mr Simon Leathes, group finance director, Mr Michael Gore, chairman of SG Warburg Asia Pacific, Mr Piers von Simson, head of Europe, Mr Rodney Ward, head of Asia except Japan, and Mr Thomas Wyman, head of US operations. Reporting to it is a new long-term strategy group chaired by Mr John Trueman, head of group risk. Reporting to the policy committee are four functional committees: corporate finance, equity, fixed interest and treasury and operations, which includes the functions of custody, settlement, information technology and administration. Some former members of the old IBMC are on these committees. Beneath that is a business development group, chaired jointly by Mr Higgs and Mr Verey, whose job it is to make short-term decisions. Securities analysts welcomed the changes. 'When people start to look internally when things go wrong, that starts a period of self-cleansing,' said Mr Rodney Maryan Green, merchant banking analyst at James Capel.</p>

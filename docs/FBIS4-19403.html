			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 14 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard said on Thursday [14 April] that all 500 French  paratroopers in Rwanda to help evacuate foreigners from the  strife-torn Central African country would leave the capital by  the end of the day.    Leotard told a press conference the men had helped 1,238  people -- 454 of them French nationals -- flee the country,  where thousands have died in a week of savage ethnic, political  and criminal violence.    The bodies of two French soldiers killed in the fighting  were  flown home to France, Leotard said, along with the corpse of a  woman and three French pilots killed in the plane crash a week  ago in which the heads of state of both Rwanda and Burundi died.  Their deaths triggered the current violence.</p>

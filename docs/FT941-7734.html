			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Glaverbel incurs deficit of BFr2bn Glaverbel, the Belgian glassmaker, yesterday said rising selling prices in North America and Europe, and tighter control of financial costs, had helped it to reduce the heavy losses of the first half of 1993. The net loss at Glaverbel, Europe's third-largest flat glass producer, was BFr2.06bn (Dollars 58.4m) in 1993, compared with a BFr715 profit in 1992. However, BFr1.78bn of this loss was incurred in the first half of the year. The improved performance in the second half meant losses here were kept to BFr154m. Glaverbel blamed its poor performance in the first half on falling prices, an extensive programme of redundancies and restructuring, and the heavy losses at AFG Industries, its North American subsidiary. Overall sales in 1993 reached BFr30.75bn, down 7.2 per cent on the previous year.</p>

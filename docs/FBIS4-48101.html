			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 11 May (PANA) -- Deadly clashes occurred  here last night between Republican Guards and students of the  Bamako Police Academy. The clashes, which involved the use of  teargas, automatic pistols, and machine guns, resulted in many  casualties, so far undisclosed, among the fighters and their  families. The fighting lasted more than three hours, according  to witnesses.    Republican Guards and police trainees undergoing training  live in two camps in Bamako separated by a common wall. Sources  say that a Republican Guard, Boubou Sylla, who wanted to take a  shortcut through the training center, was allegedly molested by  some student policemen leading to violent reprisals by the  Republican Guards, who live with their families in their camp.  However, women and children living on the premises were said to  have been evacuated in time by paratroopers, who came from their  quarters 5 km away to separate the fighting groups.</p>

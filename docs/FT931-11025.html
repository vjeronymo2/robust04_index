			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Government Bonds: Enthusiastic welcome for Bundesbank's cut in interest rates THE Bundesbank's decision to cut its official interest rates yesterday was greeted with enthusiasm in the European government bond markets, where it was seen as relieving the tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism. The high-yielding government bond markets, such as Spain and Italy, rallied strongly and gained nearly a point at one stage in the day. Bond prices started to climb as rumours swept the European bond markets that the Bundesbank would hold a press conference in the early afternoon. Most market participants expected it to announce an easing in interest rates at the conference, and as the news of the cuts in the Lombard and discount rates emerged, some of the markets sold off. Dealers noted strong overseas buying of high-yielding paper, particularly of Spanish and Italian government bonds. 'The yields look attractive and there is scope for an easing in Spanish interest rates possibly as soon as the next repo,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. The yield on the Spanish 10.3 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 11.63 per cent to 11.50 per cent. In Italy, which had started on a strong note because of the 50 basis point cut in the Italian discount rate, bonds continued to climb on the Bundesbank news. The Liffe futures contract gained 0.77 to 96.60, while the yield on the 12 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 13.14 per cent to 13.02 per cent. FRENCH government bonds rallied as the German interest rate cut was seen as taking pressure off the French franc. The yield on two-year paper dropped from 8.15 per cent to 7.91 per cent, while at the longer end, the fall was less dramatic with the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2003 yielding 7.81 per cent by late afternoon, against 7.82 per cent at the opening. THE German government bond market saw a surge of activity as rumours of an interest rate cut circulated. The bund market has shown steady gains in recent days, but started yesterday on a quiet note as dealers were waiting for news on the public sector wage negotiations. Dealers bought bunds on expectations that the Bundesbank would announce a rate cut at its hastily-called press conference, and the market later sold off once confirmation of the rate cuts came. The Liffe bund future contract, which opened at 93.36, climbed to a high of 93.54 and then dropped to 93.05 before ending at 93.14. THE UK government bond market rallied at first on expectations of a German interest rate cut, then fell to end the day half a point lower on the Liffe gilt futures contract. Dealers pointed out that with sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism, the Bundesbank move would have little influence on UK interest rates. THE Bank of Japan cut its Official Discount Rate by 75 basis points to 2.5 per cent early yesterday, as expected, prompting a fall in Japanese government bond prices initially. The sell-off was mainly futures driven, with the March futures contract falling from its opening level of 109.28 to a low of 108.95. Dealers noted some buying interest as the futures contract fell below 109.00, an important support level, and the future recovered to end at 109.14 in Tokyo, before climbing to 109.26 in London trading. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 issue traded in a range of 4.33-4.375 per cent, ending the day little changed at 4.35 per cent. The Official Discount Rate is now back at its historic low last seen in the late 1980s. The cut had been expected for some time, and was reflected in the rate on three-month certificates of deposit. Three-month CD rates have fallen from 3.70 per cent a week ago to 3.25 per cent on Wednesday and 3.24 per cent yesterday. US TREASURY prices firmed across the board yesterday as the market continued to take strength from the Treasury's decision to cut the size of the long bond issue in next week's quarterly refunding auction. News that the Bundesbank had cut its Lombard and discount rates initially helped bond prices, but by the afternoon attention was firmly focused on today's release of employment figures for January. The market remained bullish in spite of yesterday morning's report that US factory orders for December had risen 5.3 per cent, above expectations of a 5 per cent increase. The benchmark 30-year government bond was  5/16 higher at 105 3/8 in late trading, yielding 7.179 per cent. Gains were more modest at the short end of the yield curve, where the two-year note was up  1/8 to yield 4.167. The Federal Reserve refrained from open market intervention yesterday morning, with Fed funds changing hands at 3 1/16 per cent, slightly firmer than the Fed's perceived 3 per cent target for the rate.</p>

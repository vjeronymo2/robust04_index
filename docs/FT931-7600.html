			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Reluctance of leaders threatens peace settlement negotiations THE negotiations for a peace settlement in Bosnia, which have been stalled for the past three weeks, are in serious danger of having to be wound up altogether in the absence of two of the three leaders of the warring factions. Doubts about an early resumption of the talks in the UN increased last night as a lawsuit against one of the key participants threatened to delay his arrival in New York. However Lord Owen the EC mediator, still voiced confidence that Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serbian leader, who is the object of the legal action, would return. 'Certainly it is necessary now to get the leaders as quickly as possible here and I think it can be cleared up,' he told reporters. A 'more complicated situation', he added, was that of President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, who might need some strong persuasion to drop his reluctance to attend the talks. Mr Izetbegovic was due to meet US Vice-President Al Gore in Washington this week and then go on to New York for the peace talks, but reports from Sarajevo said he might not make the trip. Mr Karadzic is threatened with a multi-million dollar civil class action that three US human rights organisations filed in a New York court 11 days ago, charging him with responsibility for atrocities carried out by forces under his control in Bosnia. Mr David Larner, a spokesman for the plaintiffs, said last night that any grants of immunity would be challenged in Federal court, although he acknowledged that Mr Karadzic need not fear arrest while he was in the US. When he led the Bosnian Serb delegation to the peace talks earlier this month, Mr Karadzic's movements were restricted by the US immigration authorities to six blocks from the United Nations building and several hotels indicated he was an unwelcome visitor. He has made it clear that he would much prefer the talks to return to Geneva and that he was unwilling to return to New York unless his security could be guaranteed, possibly through a personal invitation from Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: US to stick to EC aviation aid deal THE US administration will stick by last July's agreement with the EC limiting government financial support to their respective civil aviation industries, despite President Bill Clinton's recent attacks on Airbus subsidies. A spokesman for Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said a senior US official yesterday responded to the European Commission's request for clarification of the president's remarks by saying 'we won't be opening (the subsidies agreement) up; we intend to stick to it.' Earlier yesterday the Commission had again challenged the US to live up to its undertaking with the EC. Officials pointed out that the terms of the agreement precluded either a review or any party's withdrawal before July 1994. Last July's deal settled a potentially explosive five-year dispute over Airbus subsidies, provoked by the European consortium's increasing success against Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in world markets. The agreement outlaws future production and marketing subsidies, and caps development subventions at 33 per cent. The EC claims that US manufacturers get big indirect subsidies through the American defence and space budgets. Under the pact indirect subsidies will be capped at 3 per cent of industry turn-over, or 4 per cent of company sales. In London, Downing Street indicated that Mr John Major would take a firm line in defending the financial support given to the Airbus project when he meets Mr Clinton in Washington today. Downing Street pointed out that the US government supported its domestic aircraft industry via Nasa. The UK provided Pounds 700m of launch aid to Airbus and had already recouped Pounds 140m from levies on the sale of the A320 aeroplane, it added. Britain expects all the launch aid to be repaid over the life of the Airbus project. Mr Clinton told cheering Boeing workers on Monday that he would seek 'tough new discipline' on subsidies granted to Airbus while 'closely monitoring' the pact. Any new measures tightening the rules on subsidies are likely to be brought up in the multilateral negotiations under the Gatt aircraft code, according to sources close to the administration. When the bilateral deal was concluded last July it contained an agreement to 'multilateralise' the limits on support. Failure to do so after a year could clear the way for either party to withdraw from the agreement. However, even if the subsidies limits are agreed multilaterally, both the US and Airbus country governments still have the option of walking away from the pact. The administration is by no means set on a course of action. The US industry has been reluctant to act against a rival which is also a customer. But one option under consideration is the filing of a countervailing duty case under US trade law. This would at least counter Airbus subsidies in the US market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Patrick Bulger] </F>   [Text] South Africa's marathon constitutional negotiations  were given a four-day reprieve on Thursday [27 January] night  when negotiators agreed to delay the deadline for an  all-inclusive settlement until Monday. African National Congress  [ANC] and government negotiators emerged shortly before midnight  to announce that the Freedom Alliance had requested, and been  granted, until Monday to examine a set of proposals devised by  the ANC.    "The talks are proceeding and the deadline could be said to  be extended," Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer  said. Instead of promulgating the April election on Friday as  expected, the announcement was being delayed for what were  described as "technical reasons".    It is understood, however, that the anticipation of progress  in the trilateral talks prompted the delay. This will in effect  give the Alliance the opportunity to declare its participation  in the election before the actual announcement of the April  27-29 dates decided on by the ANC-dominated Transitional  Executive Council earlier this week.    Thursday night's trilateral talks coincided with two other  sets of negotiations, the first involving the Afrikaner  Volksfront (AVF) [Afrikaner National Front], the government and  the ANC on an Afrikaner "volkstaat" [homeland] and the second  involving government and a delegation of the kwaZulu king.    The three sets of talks may result in at least two changes  to  the constitution. Although there is no direct link between the  different talks, the "volkstaat" and Zulu monarchy talks address  the concerns of key alliance partners, namely the Afrikaner  right wing and, indirectly, Inkatha.    Mr Meyer said the Zulu talks could involve the addition of a  constitutional principle on the role of traditional leaders,  among them the Zulu king. He said the trilateral negotiations  had taken note of progress in the talks on a "volkstaat".  However, an earlier expectation of substantial progress on a  "volkstaat" failed to materialise.    Mr Meyer said a new hitch had arisen which the negotiators  were trying to resolve. In the trilateral talks, Mr Meyer said  the same issue that surfaced earlier in the week had arisen  again. This involved the definition of regional powers which the  Alliance wanted characterised as "exlusive".    In agreeing to this, the ANC had added, however, that such  exclusive powers would, if granted, have to be exercised within  a centrally-directed legislative framework.    ANC negotiator Mohammed Valli Moosa said the addition of a  new constitutional principle had arisen in the trilateral talks.  The principle dealt with the integrity of regional  constitutions. He said the anc was discussing a package of  agreements with the Alliance. The package included provisions on  the powers, functions and fiscal independence of regions.    He said the ANC's proposals took into account most of the  Alliance's legitimate demands. "We are hoping at this late stage  that the Freedom Alliance will realise that it is in their best  interest to become part of the political process.    "The fact that negotiations are continuing indicates that  there is a possibility that they may well accept the interim  constitution.    "Our proposals were not rejected out of hand and that  indicates the show is still on the road," Mr Valli Moosa said.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): With-profits plans are the most secure - Choosing one / Personal Pensions THE PROCESS of choosing a personal pension plan starts with a calculation of how much can be invested. As background and a stark warning, the DSS will provide a forecast of how much is due under the state retirement scheme, based on contributions records. Requests for this information must be made on form BR19, available from local DSS offices. Inland Revenue limits, scaled by age, currently allow between 17.5 per cent (at ages under 35) and 40 per cent (between 61 and 74) of annual earnings to be invested in a personal pension qualifying for highest rate relief. Payments can be made and tax relief claimed up to six years after the earnings are received. There are four main types of personal pension: With-profits plans, where the money is invested in gilts and property, as well as shares, with the proportions chosen by the insurance company's investment managers. 'With-profits' means that, each year, a share of the investment profits is added to the policy for keeps. When the policy matures, a further terminal bonus is usually also paid. Unit-linked plans, where the money is invested in unitised funds chosen by the investor from the range offered by the pension provider. There are no bonuses: the value of the plan depends entirely on the unit prices of the funds. So a stock market crash will severely damage a unit-linked pension. Holders of unit-linked plans maturing in October 1987 found they were forced to postpone retirement by the 30 per cent drop in plan values. Unit-linked pension policies usually allow holders to defer cashing in, but legally the deferment cannot extend past the policyholder's 75th birthday. Self-invested pensions, where an insurance company supplies the basic policy and administrative services, while investors themselves, or managers of their choice, select the investments without being limited to funds run by the company. Cash or deposit-based pensions, where interest rolls up gross. Broadly speaking, with-profits plans are the most secure, though there have been cuts in bonus rates and warnings of more to come. Unit-linked and self-invested plans are riskier, and probably not suitable for anyone within less than 10 years of retirement. Cash-based plans do not have the long-term growth potential of stock market investments, and tend to be a relatively short-term option for people close to retirement. Unit-linked plans now often have a facility for holders to switch into cash two years before retirement, so as to avoid last-minute market plunges. Most pension plans take either regular or single premiums, setting a variety of minimum payment levels. A significant difference is that much higher commission is charged on regular premiums than on single payments. The retirement date written into the pension plan also influences commission charges, which rise as the term increases. It is cheaper to set an early retirement date, say 50, and then defer it if necessary, as this can be done without the penalties imposed if retirement takes place before the date specified. Having chosen a basic type of plan, or perhaps a combination, the next move is to find a pension provider with good investment performance and low overall costs. As commission is such a major component in costs, especially in the early years of a plan, the most satisfactory way of buying a personal pension is to go through a specialised adviser, who will charge a fee for advice and rebate any commission in full. Beware of advisers offering to rebate 'full Lautro commission'. This means they will pocket a sizeable chunk of the commission, rebating only the amount set out in the Lautro maximum commissions agreement scrapped three years ago, since when commissions have rocketed. Recently, the second annual commission survey by the regulator Lautro showed that, in 1991, on average, independent advisers were receiving 23 per cent more than the level set by the maximum commissions agreement for 10-year pensions, and 26 per cent above for 25-year pensions policies. Tied agents selling 10- and 25-year pensions were getting 44 per cent and 40 per cent more respectively than under the maximum commissions agreement. This hefty bite out of the initial investment is not the only reason for avoiding tied agents in the pension field. Another is that they can only advise on or recommend the investments provided by the company to which they are tied, instead of scanning the whole range on offer as independents are supposed to do. Assessment of future investment performance and costs is really a matter of guesswork, based on past records. The projections put out by the companies themselves are no help here, as they are required to use standard growth assumptions and an industry-wide average for expenses. Recent research by the Securities and Investments Board showed what this would mean to investors. Although companies' expanses knock anything from 6p to 40p in the pound off pay-outs, the average to be used in projections is 14p. So some companies are vastly understating their charges. One of the most reliable sources of comparative information about company charges is a table derived from returns filed by life companies to the Department of Trade and Industry. This was published in a simplified form in the Weekend FT on February 22 this year. The table shows an initial expense ratio, expressing the amount a company spends on starting up a policy as a proportion of the first year's premiums, and a renewal ratio, setting the running costs against the annual premium. The sixty-one companies covered in the last table ranged from Equitable Life, a company paying no commission, with an initial expense ratio of 24.1 and a renewal expense ratio of 4.57, to NEL Assurance with an initial expense ratio of 307.65 and a renewal ratio of 2.39. For past performance records of with-profits and unit-linked policies, one of the most authoritative sources is Money Management, a monthly sister publication to the Financial Times, which publishes annual rankings of past investment performance over different periods. Any statistics rehashed by a company and presented in a favourable light should be rechecked at source. As a rough guide, it is worth remembering that a company proud of 'top quartile' performance has probably never made it into the top ten.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Recovery indicator falters THE financial health of British industry is showing renewed signs of weakness, says a leading firm of risk assessors, Tony Jackson writes. The setback adds to concerns about the strength of the economic recovery raised by recent official statistics. Syspas, the London-based consultants, said there was a sharp deterioration in the position of quoted industrial companies in the three months to the end of August. The Syspas method is based on analysing published accounts to establish the risk of financial failure. It first gave warning of recession at the start of 1989. It first signalled recovery at the end of last year. The position then remained static until the latest deterioration. Mr Guenter Steinitz, Syspas's chief executive, said the distribution sector and smaller unquoted companies continued to show improvement. This was consistent with recent statistics showing growth in retail sales and a reduction in the level of bankruptcies, which tend to be concentrated among small companies. 'The same improvement has not been seen in the major industrial sector,' he said.</p>

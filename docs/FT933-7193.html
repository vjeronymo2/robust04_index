			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / A note of disharmony Gerard Mortier, artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, does not fear controversy. His enemies might suggest that he positively courts it. Whether as general administrator of the Brussels Monnaie - an operatic backwater which in the 1980s he transformed into one of the most adventurous and exciting of Europe's front-rank opera houses - or now at Salzburg, the 49-year-old, small, bespectacled Belgian has demonstrated a unique capacity for arousing strong passions. Last summer there was, for instance, a war of words after the departure of Riccardo Muti from the festival before the opening of the new production of Mozart's opera La clemenza di Tito. At the 11th hour, Muti found it too 'modern' for his taste. This summer, with the festival now into its final week, there has been a hue and cry over a new production of Mozart's Cos fan tutte in modern dress and experimental style. The first-night audience booed ferociously; debacle and flop were some of the terms of abuse lobbed by the Austrian press. At about the same time another highly publicised dispute had broken out with another Italian superstar, this time Claudio Abbado. The argument concerned Abbado's provocatively timed announcement of a plan to conduct a new production of Strauss's Elektra at the 1995 Salzburg Easter Festival, a short springtime offspring of the main festival. Mortier said the project was in direct and improper competition with the new Elektra he had already planned for summer later that year. Charges of bad faith flew back and forth. Unusually, it is Mortier who has backed down: Abbado's Elektra will be the one given in 1995. Though the furores provide fodder for entertaining cafe chatter, they also represent, in artistic and economic terms, a tug-of-war of considerable significance. There is much at stake. For a sizeable chunk of the post-war era - roughly contiguous with the latter 25 years (1964-89) of Herbert von Karajan's life  -Salzburg secured a position as the most luxurious of the top-level annual summer festivals. The Salzburg-born Karajan, probably the 20th century's most consistently power-hungry superstar conductor, moulded the enterprise into an emporium for top-name performers, giving glossily spectacular accounts of themselves at exorbitant ticket prices. The record companies, particularly those with which the conductor-boss was involved, were able to treat the festival as a showcase. Artistically, the formula became sterile. Invitations to take part depended on Karajan's favour. Perceived rivals, such as Leonard Bernstein, or unwelcome trend-setters, like the pioneering Austrian period-instrument conductor, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, were rigorously excluded. The experiments in radical production that gripped European opera in the late 1970s and 1980s found no place in Salzburg. Mortier was brought in to change all this. Having learnt his operatic trade throughout the 1970s in, successively, Dusseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg and Paris, he went to Brussels in 1981 to take charge of a Sleeping Beauty opera house - once-great, then mired in mediocrity and restrictive practices, with a disaffected audience. Though the architectural renewal of the building, including an office extension at roof level, remains a cause of dispute, the artistic renewal gave Brussels opera a distinctively forward-looking feel. He had no truck with opera-as-showbiz and with its stars: 'My public knows,' he once said, 'that the doors of the Monnaie are too small for Pavarotti, the corridors too narrow for Jessye Norman.' He has been called narrowly puritan in his tastes, yet in a short time the Monnaie became one of the hot places of international opera. Mortier has wasted no time in making his mark in Salzburg. Under Peter Stein, the celebrated German theatre director who serves as drama overseer, the drama programme has come vibrantly alive. The choice and style of opera presentation reflect what might be called the Monnaie imperatives: Mozart rethought, 20th-century masterpieces, Monteverdi revived. Period-instrument performance, banned by Karajan, is a regular feature. Orchestras of quality from all over the world figure on the concert schedule. But the outcome of the campaign is far from certain. There is more than the Karajan mystique for Mortier to root out, more than the disapproval of record companies and top artists' agencies to confront, more than the Austrian press's periodic fits of artistic xenophobia to withstand. A new, more adventurous audience has to be attracted. Ticket prices for prestige events remain among the world's highest (this year's top was Sch3,600, or Pounds 201). Except for the surefire operas - The Magic Flute, Cos, Verdi's Falstaff conducted by Georg Solti - bookings are down. Grumbling traders, hoteliers and taxi-drivers are not hard to find. In addition, Mortier has the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra to cope with. Formerly the festival mainstay, it now bitterly resents the way its role in both the opera and concert schedules is being whittled down. When questioned about this, Mortier is apt to comment, with the tartness of rejoinder for which he is noted, on the high cost of keeping one of the world's most admired, but most expensive, orchestras in Salzburg residence. He is on a six-year contract in Salzburg, although it could be terminated earlier if the need proved overwhelming. Among more progressive musicians and critics, and in the wider world of opera, Mortier's Salzburg stance commands a unique degree of sympathy, respect and approval. But that may not be enough to guarantee his survival.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Govan announces deal with workers Kvaerner Govan, the Clydeside shipbuilder, yesterday announced a two-year agreement with its 1,550 workforce. The deal gives an annual 3 per cent wage increase and the permanent workforce has been guaranteed job security to at least the end of next year. Mr Bobby Gordon, personnel director, said the agreement was an extension of the agreements that had enabled the company to revolutionise manpower policies and working practices since the yard was taken over in 1988 by the Norwegian-based Kvaerner group.</p>

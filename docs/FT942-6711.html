			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: New rate worries drive Footsie below 3,000 - Market Report A confident opening performance by UK equities was wiped out by a series of blows delivered first from Germany and then from the United States, which triggered a flurry of heavy selling pressure originating in the futures markets. News yesterday suggested that German rates had effectively bottomed out while there were worrying signs inflationary pressures in the US. The FT-SE 100 index plunged below the 3,000-mark for the first time since September 1993, ending another turbulent session a net 53.3 lower at 2,966.4, a fall of over 160 points, or 5 per cent on the week. The UK market's second-line stocks also fell heavily, with the FT-SE Mid-250 index retreating 44.1 to 3,572.3, leaving the index 142 points, or 3.8 per cent, lower over the five-day period. The US inflationary worries pervading international bond markets also gripped UK gilts where long-dated issues, which began the day around 1/4 firmer but came off sharply and closed with losses in excess of a point, with dealers showing concern over next Tuesday's May MO money supply figures. Dealers said an MO figure showing year-on-year growth in excess of 7 per cent could bring renewed pressure. The UK equity market, together with most European bourses, has been badly hit this week by worries that German interest rates may have bottomed out in the current cycle. The gloom encompassing the London market at the close was far removed from the lively mood at the outset, when marketmakers hoisted opening levels after taking in details of the latest Confederation of British Industry Survey which revealed that factory orders reached a five-year high in May. The survey, which also highlighted optimism that economic recovery is filtering through to manufacturing sectors, saw the FT-SE 100 race to a session high of 3,033.7, up 14.4, within an hour of the opening. After the initial flush of institutional buying, the market ground to a halt and lost heart as sell trades in the FT-SE future weakened sentiment in the cash market. The real pressure across the market emerged around midday, when a burst of selling of the FT-SE future, reportedly of a similar size to that which triggered Wednesday's market sell-off, drove the future lower and saw the FT-SE 100 index plunge through 3,000 as the market reacted to the higher than expected increase in US gross domestic product and the deflator figure. With little sign of support the 100 index dropped rapidly to reach the day's low point of 2,959.5, with other European markets similarly hit. The low point coincided with details of the testimony given to the US Senate Banking Committee by Federal chairman Mr Alan Greenspan, who spoke of concern at the dollar's lack of response to monetary policy moves. A senior trader in the London equity market spoke of 'investor fatigue' at the close of a difficult week. There was no real selling pressure in the cash market, dealers insisted. 'There is nothing in this market to tempt the buyers who continue to give the market a wide berth,' said the head of marketmaking at one of the big UK integrated houses. Turnover of 569.8m shares was described as 'unremarkable, given that the market has dropped almost 60 points'.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Fugitive helps unravel scandal The decision of Mr Mauro Giallombardo, former personal secretary to Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to surrender to Milan magistrates is expected to help them establish how much of the corrupt funding of political parties was syphoned off by individuals. Mr Giallombardo, a fugitive for nearly a year, helped set up two finance groups in Luxembourg, Merchant Italia and Merchant Europa, and until last year had links with Luxembourg International Bank. During the trial in Milan of Mr Sergio Cusani, a financial consultant close to the Socialist Party who acted for the Ferruzzi family, evidence has emerged of regular use of accounts at the latter bank for funds collected from individual businessmen and companies. The magistrates, with the co-operation of the Luxembourg authorities, have begun to trace these funds.</p>

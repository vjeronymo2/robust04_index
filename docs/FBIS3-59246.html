			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD/LAR: "Mr. Delcroix Back From Moscow: </F> Russian Doctrine Soon To be Explained?"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 27 Jan (BELGA) -- Russian Defense Minister  Pavel Grachev is due to visit NATO in May to explain the content  of new Russian military doctrine -- as approved on 2 November by  the Kremlin, but only the broad outlines of which have been made  public -- a source close to the national Defense Ministry  indicated on Thursday [27 January].    General Grachev in fact indicated to his Belgian  counterpart,  Mr. Leo Delcroix -- during the latter's visit to Russia on  Tuesday and Wednesday -- that he was prepared to come and  explain this doctrine to NATO leaders, members of the minister's  entourage reported.    This Russian briefing -- which NATO is eagerly awaiting --  has already been reported on repeated occasions. Initially  scheduled for last December, it was postponed until two days  after the NATO summit on January 10 and 11 and then subsequently  cancelled, observers recall.    According to a colleague of Mr. Delcroix, Gen. Gratchev  could  come and deliver his briefing at the time of the joint meeting  of NATO defense ministers and their East European "partners"  which is planned for late May in Brussels. The Belgian minister  will inform NATO of this offer on the part of Russia, the  national Defense Ministry added.    Diplomatic sources report that NATO is already in possession  of 24 of the 27 pages of the document on the new Russian  military doctrine. The three secret pages could concern the  sometimes difficult relations between Russia and Ukraine --  notably following the reluctance of Kiev to dismantle its  strategic nuclear weapons as laid down in the StART-1 nuclear  disarmament treaty, and as ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament  in November 1993.    Mr. Delcroix also invited his Russian counterpart to pay an  official visit to Belgium next April, and the two men are also  to pay a joint visit to a contingent of Belgian and Russian blue  helmets in eastern Croatia. The minister returned on Wednesday  evening from a two-day visit to Russia during which he became  the first Westerner to visit the ballistic nuclear missile base  of Bologoye, located between Moscow and St. Petersburg.    Mr. Delcroix -- who was accompanied by Major General John  Schellemans, his principal private secretary, and Lieutenant  General Jose Charlier, his chief of staff -- was taking up a  "personal invitation" from Gen. Grachev.    The Belgian delegation was able to visit the Russian  strategic missile command in Moscow -- a force consisting of  some 200,000 men -- and, at a launch site, a silo containing an  SS-17 intercontinental missile with multiple warheads and a  range of 11,000 kms. Access to these sites had previously been  denied to any foreigners and even to the highest Russian  authorities.    Members of the Russian military indicated to the Belgian  delegation that nuclear weapons inherited from the former Soviet  Union were being kept "completely under control," the same  source indicated.    At a meeting to discuss problems of international security,  Mr. Delcroix and Gen. Grachev again raised in particular the  Partnership for Peace proposal that NATO has made to its former  enemies in East Europe. This program seeks to increase  political and military cooperation with the countries of Central  and East Europe with a view to eventual NATO membership for some  of them.    According to Mr. Delcroix' office, Gen. Grachev has  expressed  an interest in this partnership, stressing that in future it  should guarantee peace and stability in Europe.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hsiao Ming (5618 2494): "A `Controversy' Is </F> Being Provoked Again"]    [Text] The Background Against Which Deng Xiaoping  Proposed To "Refrain From Controversy"    Deng Xiaoping said: "Not to engage in controversy is one of  my inventions." As I understand it, an "invention" means a  special measure under special circumstances. In other words,  socialist reform is valuable because it is aimed at emancipating  the mind. To develop socialist productive forces, one should  not be afraid of adopting some capitalist managerial experience,  its technical innovations, and its organizational methods in  production. We should not think that this is practicing  capitalism, nor should we provoke a controversy over whether  what we are doing is of a capitalist or socialist nature, as  this could bind reformers hand and foot (to put it more bluntly,  this could be as bad as banning and opposing reform).    This refers to the repudiation provoked by the leftists in  the period after the 4 June incident to 1990, which criticized  reform as "retrogressing to capitalism." As a matter of fact,  this repudiation was targeted at Deng Xiaoping, therefore some  people regarded it as "repudiating Deng" for the second time.  During his southern tour, Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the  main danger was "leftist" tendencies (but people should also be  on the alert for rightist tendencies), adding that the  controversy over what was being done was of a capitalist or  socialist nature was inappropriate. Deng Xiaoping's response to  the "leftists" offensive was quite "mild and moderate." Instead  of "drawing a sword," he only said "we should not engage in  controversy" for the sake of maintaining stability in reform, he  only tried to prevent both sides from engaging in controversy.  <H5>  The Magazine ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU [IN PURSUIT OF TRUTH] </H5> Provoked a Controversy    Silence prevailed in the ideological field for a period of  time after Deng Xiaoping's southern tour talks. Some people  wrote several "leftist" articles, but they were not strong  enough to create the necessary climate. It was said that it was  very difficult to have articles published, and even the  authorities did not support such publications. But this did not  in the least harm the "leftists!" Some people tried to run  middle-of-the-road publications and asked some famous people to  express insignificant remarks. This enabled the "leftists" to  clearly see the opponent's weakness. Thus the "leftists" waited  for an opportunity to provoke a new trouble. After making all  the necessary preparations, they thought the time was ripe for a  new controversy.    At that time, I went to the mainland and heard people  commenting on several articles in a magazine called ZHENLI DE  ZHUIQIU. These articles were published in issue No. 4 of this  year's ZHENLI DE ZHUIQIU. The most conspicuous one was a  "commentator's article" published by the magazine. I happened  to see the magazine at a friend's home and began reading the  article quickly.    As I was not an expert in this respect, it was a little  difficult for me to understand the meaning, not because it was  abstruse, but because it was evasive. After reading it twice, I  finally understood these two points: First, it pointed out that  "bourgeois liberalization is still the biggest danger on the  ideological front," therefore it urged launching a powerful  criticism "like the one occurring after the 4 June political  storm." Apart from directly asserting that opposing "leftist"  tendencies was "liberalization," the article did not explicitly  indicate the performance of "liberalization" at that time.  Instead, it cited many problems and difficulties arising in  reform, such as inflation, excessive price hikes, loss-incurring  state enterprises, loss of state assets, prominent regional  differences between the poor and the rich, corruption, and  rampant malpractice. The article pointed out it was natural  that these had happened, but that these problems should be  resolved. By citing these examples, did it mean that all these  problems were the results of "liberalization"?  <H5>  The Purpose Was To Criticize the Theory of Focusing on </H5> Economic Construction    Another main point of the article was criticizing the  proposition of "poor socialism." For this reason, the article  launched an offensive against "bourgeois liberalization." The  article said there had never been "poor socialism" in the  Marxist dictionary, adding that this expression was mere trash  and was completely anti-Marxist; socialism advocates common  prosperity and the elimination of exploitation; poverty has  nothing to do with socialism. I was confused. As everyone  remembers, it was Deng Xiaoping who first said "poverty is not  socialism" and who first criticized the idea of "poor  socialism." It is true that Marx never mentioned "poor  socialism," but China's socialism did proceed from poverty.    In 1956, when China asserted that it had become a socialist  society, this socialist society could not be regarded as rich.  If it could not be called a "poor socialist society," it would  do if we called it an "undeveloped socialist society." As Deng  Xiaoping pointed out, strictly speaking, this socialist society  cannot be regarded as a "qualified" socialist society. But this  "undeveloped socialist society" is a reality in China. No one  can deny it. In other words, this is a historic fact.  Obviously, the criticism of "practicing poor socialism" was a  criticism of the erroneous ultraleftist policy--a policy of  "taking class struggle as the key link." The Great Leap  Forward, the people's communes, and the Great Cultural  Revolution were examples of the implementation of this  ultraleftist policy. It was this policy that undermined the  vitality of socialist productive forces and left many localities  in prolonged poverty. This was a grave lesson in socialism, not  the glory of socialism. Now the gentlemen who were "in pursuit  of truth" revealed this historic fact and started saying in  abstract that there was no such thing as poor socialism. What  was their purpose? Marx did not favor egalitarianism, but China  previously practiced socialism with different degrees of  egalitarianism. Was this not a fact? It was strange that they  "pursued truth" by engaging in empty talk regardless of the  facts. Evidently, these gentlemen's purpose was to criticize  the theory of focusing on economic construction and developing  the productive forces, but they did not dare to conduct a direct  criticism, so they took an evasive method.  <H5>  How the New Controversy Was Provoked </H5>   This friend of mine did not know how the new controversy had  been provoked, but only said that it had been brewing for more  than two months. On the eve of the Spring Festival, the CPC  opened a national meeting on propaganda and ideological work.  At the meeting, a leader made a significant remark in his  speech--a remark which interested those gentlemen who thought  the opportunity for a controversy had come. Thus they were  ready for such a move.    In my opinion, if the authorities could look further into  the  future, controversy is not a good thing. At that time, Deng  Xiaoping proposed "not to engage in a controversy," out of  consideration for maintaining stability in reform. The  situation has remained stable in the last few years because many  people have refrained from controversy. Now there are many  comments in China and abroad on China's situation after Deng  Xiaoping's death. These comments vary with different people.  Many think that there will be a change and political turmoil in  China. As this leader is at a venerable age, like a candle  guttering in the wind, the policy of stability must be pursued  and efforts must be concentrated on resolving problems in  reform, instead of allowing a controversy on the ideological  front or provoking trouble. Otherwise, this could lead to evil  consequences. Letting tigers out the cage harms oneself;  thinking oneself clever kills oneself. There have been many  such examples. If a controversy arises on the ideological  front, this will cause differences of opinion among leaders  (including retired leaders) on the policy and line to be  adopted. People throughout the country who have embarked on the  track of reform will not sit idly by either. In such cases,  stability in reform could be ruined and no one can remedy it,  and China could face a confused situation or retrogress to the  period before 1978. This is a weakness in China's reform and a  danger for its future. The CPC should seriously take this into  account.</p>

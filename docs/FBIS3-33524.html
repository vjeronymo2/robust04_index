The majority of the miners were arrested on the  Brazilian-Colombian border, near the Army battalion in Cucui.    Jose Altino Machado, director of the Legal Amazon Region  Miners Union Association, said: The Brazilian miners were  illegally arrested and taken to Puerto Ayacucho [Venezuela].    The undefined markers on the Brazilian-Venezuelan border,  manifested in the massacre of 16 Ianomami Indians in the Haximu  area in August 1993, facilitated the invasion of Brazilian  territory.    Jose Altino Machado said: The Venezuelan National Guard  arrests the miners to steal their gold.    The miners were arrested last week and held in Puerto  Ayacucho, located 400 km from the border, until 16 February.</p>

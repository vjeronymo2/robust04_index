			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Plea goes to EC over help for region - Ravenscraig THE GOVERNMENT has applied to the European Commission for leave to declare an enterprise zone in north Lanarkshire to offset the impact of closure of the Ravenscraig steelworks, Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said yesterday. Mr Lang also told MPs he had written to Sir Bob Scholey, chairman of British Steel about its proposals for Ravenscraig. His letter asks British Steel to help deal with decontamination of the Ravenscraig site, partly by funding an assessment to gauge which parts of it needed special treatment. Mr Lang also asks British Steel to release evidence explaining why it had opted for closure and to state how much extra funding will be provided to British Steel (Industry) - a body set up to nurture new industries - to take account of the additional job losses. During a debate on Ravenscraig initiated by the Opposition, Mr Lang challenged Labour to say how it would react to the situation. 'The party opposite owes it to the House to tell us what they would do,' he said. Earlier, Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, had attacked government inaction over Ravenscraig, which he said was typical of its 'hands-off, do-nothing approach'. While branding the government's package as 'incoherent and without shape', he admitted there could be no promises of 'an overnight transformation.' He did not consider nationalisation the answer. Mr Dewar advocated keeping open 'as long as possible' the option of finding a buyer while recognising the chances were slim. British Steel had probably agreed to consider offers only because it doubted that there would be any. An opposition motion condemning British Steel's repeated failure to invest in its Scottish plants was defeated by 242 votes to 212.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (1): An anxious reawakening - Three years after the end of the Iraqi occupation, Kuwait has made great strides on the road to recovery. It enjoys greater security, oil is flowing, and politics are thriving. But it has underlying problems which have yet to be addressed Kuwait is rebuilt. Its oil industry, the fountain of its wealth, is restored to pre-Gulf war vigour. Political life has resumed and is thriving in the polished halls of the most powerful elected assembly in Kuwait's history and, indeed, anywhere in the Gulf. The state's defence is underwritten by pacts with the Gulf war allies which liberated Kuwait from seven months of Iraqi occupation three years ago almost to the day. All should be well. But it is not. Rather than dwelling on the accomplishments of reconstruction Kuwaitis are instead looking ahead, and with profound uncertainty. The Iraqi occupation has left an economic and political legacy which Kuwaitis are beginning to address only now that the basic tasks of rebuilding are complete. Two factors above all have conspired to raise troubling questions about the future. The first is the sheer financial cost of the war, which rudely tugged away the previously deep cushion of wealth which allowed Kuwaitis to enjoy one of the world's most generous welfare states. Kuwait's greater dependence on oil revenues since the occupation ravaged the non-oil sector, and the prospects of low crude prices for the foreseeable future, have sharpened questions of how - indeed whether - Kuwaitis can continue enjoying the panoply of cradle-to-grave benefits most have come to regard as a birthright. The political effects of the war are more complex, but strike at the heart of how Kuwait will manage a transition to life in reduced circumstances. Popular demands for greater democracy in Kuwait which Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the emir, was forced to meet after the war resulted in the election in October 1992 of an opposition-dominated National Assembly, the first to be elected since the emir dissolved the previous assembly in 1986. The new parliament has ever since been diligently nibbling away at the ruling al-Sabah family's governing power. But the resultant tug-of-war between a parliament intent on proving itself indispensable to the proper governance of Kuwait and a ruling family reluctant to cede too much of its historical authority has led to a crisis of leadership. Kuwait's uncomfortable dilemma is that this crisis threatens to create a political impasse just when the state's economic problems are demanding tough, immediate decisions. Away from this continuing political tussle and the uncertainties it has provoked, however, Kuwait can point to some considerable and concrete post-war gains. For example, although its Dollars 11.7bn rearmament programme is unlikely to make Kuwait much more defensible than it proved in 1990, defence pacts with the US, Britain, France and Russia have provided a far more overt and less ambiguous security framework than existed before the war. On the domestic economic front, Kuwait's commanding institutions have weathered grave crises and emerged arguably more strongly and accountably managed. In the oil sector, for instance, Kuwait has not only been able rapidly to resume pre-war output of more than 2m barrels a day, but has stubbornly battled back to what it considers its rightful oil allocation and position of power within the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The industry is now proceeding with plans to increase capacity above 3m b/d to position Kuwait for future Opec haggling and, perhaps, oil market opportunities as they arise. The Kuwait Investment Authority, custodian of an overseas investments portfolio which remains Kuwait's second biggest source of income, has also regained confidence after the shock of its fire-sale of holdings to fund the war and the embarrassing revelations of alleged corruption and mismanagement in its Spanish investments. Mr Ali Rashid al-Badr, the KIA's post-war managing director, is reluctant to discuss alleged scandals, which he says are a matter for courts in Spain and London where former Kuwait Investment Office managers are facing civil and criminal charges: 'The Spanish affair I put behind me more than a year ago,' he says. Instead, KIA managers point to a bumper year in 1993, when buoyant world markets earned a 20 per cent return on its residual investment portfolio of around Dollars 35bn-Dollars 40bn. Another success lies in last year's agreement on plans to settle the 12 year-old problem of KD5.5bn worth of bad debts left, primarily, by the 1982 collapse of the unsupervised Souk al-Manakh stock market. But the most striking achievement since the war - though not all of Kuwait's ruling elite may see it so - has been the full-blooded return of democratically based politics in Kuwait. In the context of feudal Gulf politics and even of Kuwait's own historically feisty political tradition, the National Assembly's accomplishments in little over a year have been startling. Parliament has doggedly negotiated new laws protecting public funds; it has for the first time won access to the accounts of all government-held companies; it was the driving force behind settlement of the bad debt problem. Perhaps most remarkably, in the face of strong ruling family pressure it forced the trial before a criminal court in Kuwait of Sheikh Ali Khalifa, the former oil and finance minister facing charges of embezzlement from the state-owned Kuwait Oil Tanker Company. Parliament is, says Mr Jassem al-Saddoun, an economic adviser to the assembly, now 'supervising the government in every sector'. He and others in the assembly are confident other victories lie ahead - like having the government reveal defence spending on its published budget for the first time, where it can then be debated, and perhaps even cut. But just such creeping parliamentary power, particularly in economic affairs, is contributing to Kuwait's present uncertainty. The Kuwaiti exchequer, drained by post war spending of perhaps Dollars 100bn, facing possibly prolonged weakness in oil prices and in the next two years saddled additionally with annual repayments exceeding Dollars 2.7bn on post-war borrowing, is felt by the finance ministry, the central bank and the KIA to be under unsustainable pressure. Each has been issuing recent statements to the effect that government spending has to be cut, revenues raised, or both. 'We have to have austerity measures, this is inevitable,' says Mr al-Badr. Such talk in boundlessly cossetted pre-war Kuwait would have been unthinkable. The difficulty is that the previously unthinkable may also prove unpassable. The National Assembly has already voiced strong resistance to any suggestions of foreign investment in the banking sector, raising emotional cries of 'neocolonialism'. And few observers, in parliament and outside, believe popularity-conscious MPs would readily endorse measures which might affect public sector salaries (96 per cent of employed Kuwaitis work for the government), or raise the prices of power or water. The prospect of a government-parliament impasse over such crucial economic decisions is a source of deep frustration among many Kuwaitis - particularly among merchant and business leaders who argue they can make few commercial decisions until there is a firm determination of economic policy. At present, says Mr al-Saddoun, 'there is no economic policy whatsoever'. But political leadership is in short supply. Parliament is so far largely incapable of creating policy, lacking either the resources or expertise. Moreover, it regards its role, for the present at least, essentially as a watchdog. The government itself, led by Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, has in the view of a growing number of Kuwaitis proved itself capable only of paralysing attempts at consensus-building. As Mr Abdulla al-Nibari, an opposition MP, puts it: 'All of Kuwait's savings will have to dry up before we face the problem. It will take that.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ``Nontraditional employment'' is defined in the NEW Act as occupations or fields of work where women comprise less than 25 percent of the individuals employed in such occupation or field of work. Although nontraditional occupations are usually thought of only as construction or skilled trades, these occupations encompass a much broader spectrum of jobs, including those in technical and other fields.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nontraditional occupations have the potential for greatly improving the economic status of women, particularly when they are growth occupations with increased wage potential. Nontraditional training for women also provides benefits for the States and the SDA's. The Department believes that this kind of training expands the occupational mix available to all customers, and can enhance coordination with other education and training programs, as well as with labor and apprenticeship programs. It helps advance efforts by the States and/or SDA's to be a valuable source of trained individuals for employers and unions. Through the implementation of NEW, it is the Department's intent that changes will occur throughout the job training system so that training in nontraditional occupations becomes institutionalized in each State. The GCSSP and the job training plan prepared by each SDA were required to include goals, actions, and accomplishments for the training and placement of women in nontraditional employment for the 2-year period beginning July 1, 1992 and beyond. NEW does not establish specific numerical goals by SDA or State. However, using General Accounting Office data (GAS/HRD&hyph;89&hyph;152FS, September 1989), the Department estimates that the proportion of women currently trained by JTPA in nontraditional occupations nationwide is about 9 percent. Therefore, at their option, States and SDA's may use this figure as a substitute for a particular State's baseline until they can collect data specific to that State. States should strive for a goal for training and placing more than 9 percent of women participants in nontraditional occupations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department expects that the GCSSP and the SDA's job training plan will reflect specific measurable activities to train and to place women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeships, as required by the statute. As mentioned earlier, SDA's may wish to consider using the national figure of 9 percent as an indication of the pre-NEW level of nontraditional training until geographic-specific data becomes available. Sections 104(b)(6) and (13), 121(b)(3) and 122(b)(5)&hyph;(7) of the Act require the States and SDA's to set goals and report on program accomplishments. The Department intends to look closely at these activities to ensure compliance with requirements of NEW.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the Department expects that each State's and SDA's plans and activities will reflect the development of outreach and promotional materials and/or activities aimed at making women aware of the programs and the services available through JTPA, particularly of nontraditional training and placement opportunities. Examples of outreach materials include, but are not limited to, nontraditional career information modules, video and print materials on nontraditional career options (for counselors), recruitment brochures targeted at both the customer and the employer, and dissemination of preexisting resource materials and/or model curricula. States may also wish to undertake statewide public education campaigns, similar to those conducted for literacy programs, on nontraditional training and employment opportunities. The Department expects statewide dissemination of model programs/approaches to serve as a method of encouraging the replication and institutionalization of nontraditional training in the State. The Department encourages the States to disseminate to SDA's and service providers the SJTCC's summary report on promising programs funded by JTPA or the Carl Perkins Vocational Education and Applied Technology Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comments that pertained to NEW sought to add to the regulations a number of specific requirements regarding services to women and focussed on nontraditional employment. These suggested requirements ranged from language to requiring OJT goals for women in nontraditional employment, as well as standards for OJT contracts, to specific procurement requirements as they pertain to women-owned businesses, and specific monitoring requirements. The Department believes that many of these ideas have merit but does not believe that it is appropriate to establish them as Federal regulatory requirements beyond that which would otherwise be required by the provisions of the Act_particularly as the Federal Government looks to reduce administrative requirements. On the other hand, a commenter suggested that the regulations ought to reflect the statutory requirements. The Department is persuaded that the NEW's requirements should be emphasized by referencing them, as appropriate, in the regulations and has done so in appropriate sections, including: &sect;627.455, for the annual report to the Governor that is to be described in the job training plan; &sect;628.205, pertaining to the State goals for the training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment and apprenticeships; &sect;628.210, for the responsibility of the SJTCC to review and analyze the annual reports of SDA's and to distribute them in the State and to the Secretary; and &sect;628.420, for the SDA's local goals for the training and training-related placement of women in nontraditional employment. These are not new regulatory requirements; rather they are reflections of statutory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specific changes in PART 628_Programs under Title II of the Job Training Partnership Act are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Governor's Coordination and Special Services Plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments were received on the Governor's coordination and special services plans. Section 628.205(c) of the interim final regulations required the States to provide their respective SDA's prior to December 31 of the year preceding the program years for which the plan is developed, information on its plans to undertake State activities in program areas, including education coordination and services to older workers, and capacity building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters requested removal of the December 31 date. The commenters suggested the language be revised to say that the State should issue this information to SDA's in sufficient time for them to be able to take it into consideration in developing plans. The Department agrees with the commenters and this change is made to the final regulations in a new paragraph (c)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

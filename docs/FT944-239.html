			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Corruption has no frontiers For anyone who still believed that corruption was primarily a problem of the developing world, and not the developed, the exposes of the past year should have provided a belated awakening. Scandals ranging from petty 'sleaze' to substantial bribery have broken out across the globe, from Japan in the east, through Britain, France, Italy and the former communist states in Europe, to the US, Brazil and Mexico in the west. It is clear that bribery and corruption know no frontiers. The rash of cases raises three questions: is the problem getting worse, in spite of the trend towards market economics, open trade and deregulation? Is it a problem that needs to be controlled with new rules, or will such measures merely create new opportunities for corruption? And if more controls are needed, what effective steps can be taken? It is tempting to be cynical about the issue. Corruption has always existed, wherever power exists. On occasion it may arguably be beneficial: where a modest bribe can circumvent excessive and onerous regulations, it may oil the wheels of economic activity. Or a bribe may simply redistribute the profit of a transaction from a government to individuals: then the state is the only loser. Where governments are excessive regulators, where they have imposed penal tariffs on trade, or where they have fixed unrealistic exchange rates, they deserve to be punished by such subversion. The real solution is to reduce the bureaucracy and scrap the bad rules, not to encourage corruption by writing more. Economic distortions The danger of the spread of bribes is that, in the first place, they distort rational economic decision making; and second, that they undermine the legitimacy of the administration, indeed of the entire political system which allows them to take place. Economic distortions may be difficult to identify. But loss of political legitimacy has been evident in industrial countries suffering from recent scandals. The scale of the problem does not seem to have grown. Rather, the trend towards deregulation, privatisation and more open government has exposed its existence. That would seem to be the case in Italy, France and Japan. Moreover, the end of the cold war has left electorates that were once prepared to tolerate corrupt practices in the interests of stability less inclined to do so. Political favours The common cause behind many of the recent cases has been the need for ever-increasing campaign funds for political parties, rather than individual venality. The soaring costs of campaigning for political office in a televised democracy have put ever greater financial pressures on the participants. In the US, as in Japan, the purchase of political favours with campaign contributions has long been almost an accepted part of the system. What is to be done? Clearly it is essential that political contributions should be subject to maximum transparency. There is a case for strict limits to be set on election spending. Cost-free party political broadcasts, on the British model, rather than the commercial sale of television advertising spots, could be another way of controlling expenses. Another lesson is that both bureaucrats and politicians must earn incomes in keeping with the responsibility of their jobs. If either are clearly underpaid, it will provide a temptation to corruption, which would rapidly outweigh the savings on their salaries. Above all, simple and transparent regulations are the best defence against corruption. The less unnecessary red tape a government imposes on business, and the more open and enforceable the rules are, the less incentive or opportunity its employees will have to extract private profit from their position.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Groupe Bull in search for partners Groupe Bull, France's loss-making computer group, is holding talks with potential industry partners which could take a stake of up to 20 per cent in the state-owned company as part of its privatisation, Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, the chairman, said yesterday. In his first briefing since taking over at Bull last October, Mr Descarpentries said he was seeking to prepare the company for privatisation as quickly as possible and that the French state's 76 per cent stake could be brought below 50 per cent this year. The Bull chairman also spelt out a restructuring and cost-cutting plan aimed at returning the computer group to profit during 1995. The French group has lost more than FFr15bn (Dollars 2.5bn) over the past four years, as a result of depressed markets, high costs and inefficient production. Mr Descarpentries said his recovery plan would be presented to the European Commission by the beginning of March. The Commission has ordered a freeze of a FFr2.5bn injection of state aid to the company pending the presentation of a recovery plan and is also investigating a FFr7bn allocation made last year. Mr Descarpentries described the capital injections as a 'one time, last time' event. He said that he had been given two years by the French government to prepare the group for sale and spelt out a strategy of privatisation through industrial partnerships and employee participation rather than a public offer for Bull shares. The search for industrial investors could bring a substantial foreign computer group into the capital of the French group. 'The criteria for the first partner will be speed not nationality,' said the Bull chairman. He declined to specify the companies with which discussions were being held, but Bull already has alliances with other international computer groups, including NEC of Japan. NEC holds 4.43 per cent of Bull's shares and has a strategic alliance in several areas. Mr Descarpentries said a return to profit would be achieved through a reorganisation of the group into separate profit centres, tighter reporting and the implementation of cost-cutting measures. An existing plan to cut 6,500 jobs between 1993 and the end of 1994 has been accelerated. But priority is to be given to cutting non-salary costs. A reduction in the group's Paris sites, from 24 to two, for example, should bring annual savings of FFr530m.</p>

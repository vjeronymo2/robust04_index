			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / ITC to reopen Channel 5 debate THE Independent Television Commission plans to reopen the debate about the future of Channel 5 next month with the publication of a report setting out a range of options. The idea of a fifth national television channel appeared to die in December, when the ITC rejected the only bidder, a consortium led by Thames Television. The ITC said that it was not satisfied with the consortium's business plan nor its level of 'investor commitment.' For the past few months ITC engineers have been reconsidering the technical possibilities for a fifth channel. The commission believes that a new channel is still a distinct possibility. The most expensive stumbling block to last year's proposal was the fact that the Channel 5 signal would have caused interference to millions of video recorders. The first of three main options outlined by the report would reduce the need to retune video recorders by proposing extra frequencies for the channel. The second option suggests using frequencies once considered for a sixth television channel to set up a series of city-based television stations. That option would require legislation as the 1990 Broadcasting Act provides for a national Channel 5. The third main option is receiving increasing attention. It suggests using the Channel 5 frequencies to launch digital television in the UK. Using digital technology at least four channels can be squeezed into the space now occupied by one. That could, at least in theory, allow the creation of several new services or could be used to launch wider screen television, although viewers would need a special box to convert the signal. The ITC plans to invite comments on the options and call for expressions of interest, and may re-advertise the channel before the end of this year or early next year.</p>

Zherzdev, </F> Moscow; UDC 629.7.023.22]    [Abstract] This paper examines the creation of condensed  heat-resistant coatings for cooled working blades of the gas  turbines of aviation engines and energy plants. The evaporation  of ZnO[.sub]2[/]-V[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics are  studied and a coating with a columnar structure is formed. The  basic thermophysical properties of ceramic coatings are studied.  Ceramic condensed coatings are highly resistant to thermal loads  and were not damaged during prolonged tests on aviation engines.  The coatings protect blade surfaces from high-temperature  corrosion and the blade material from weakening due to high  temperatures. The characteristics of ceramic coatings in general  are listed. Two ceramics were tested, KDP-1 and KDP-4. The  conductivity of KDP-1 was close to that of a ZrO[.sub]2[/]  single crystal. The main cause of coating failure is oxidation  of the ceramic-metal interface; other causes are listed. The  oxidation causes a continuous reduction in the adhesion of the  ceramic coating. This may be reduced by alloying and reducing  the diffusive mobilty of oxygen. At temperatures below 1100  the coatings may last 10,000-15,000 hours.

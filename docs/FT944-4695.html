			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: GKN sells 20% of Chep UK GKN, the automotive products, aerospace and special vehicles group, is selling 20 per cent of Chep UK, its pallet pooling business, to Brambles of Australia for Pounds 25m in cash. The deal, creating a 50/50 joint venture between the two groups, includes a provision for a further payment of Pounds 3m depending on Chep's profitability for the two years ending December 31 1996. Brambles has also agreed to acquire a 20 per cent interest in shareholders' loans made to Chep UK for an estimated Pounds 7.2m. The two groups also agreed that further global expansion would be on a 50/50 basis. Chep UK, with 14m pallets in circulation, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.9m in the year to December 31 1993. GKN has also sold its equipment rental activities in the US and Australia for Pounds 5m, net of costs. The consideration compares with a book value of Pounds 12m and goodwill already written off of Pounds 22m. The effect on the group's results will therefore be an exceptional loss of Pounds 29m and a reduction in shareholders' funds of Pounds 7m. The GKN rentals division in the US is being sold to a number of purchasers led by Pro Equipment Rentals, while GKN Australia and its subsidiaries have been sold to Kennards Hire. In 1993 the two businesses made losses of Pounds 6m.</p>

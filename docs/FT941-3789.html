			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Last-minute clause caused act's ambiguity Yesterday's statement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, resolves the confusion over an ambiguously worded clause inserted into the 1986 Insolvency Act at the last minute. In a 1985 case, Nicoll v Cutts, the courts ruled in favour of the receivers and against a director who had sued them, claiming he was entitled to compensation because he had not formally been dismissed. The case was raised during parliamentary discussion on the Insolvency Act, and a clause was introduced stating that a receiver who did not dismiss employees at a company would be deemed to have adopted their contracts. Until then, receivers had simply paid employees during the period for which they were in charge of a company. Other employment costs - such as pay in lieu of notice - ranked only as unsecured claims alongside other creditors'. The 1986 law suggested that they would in any case become liable after 14 days for all outstanding employment obligations, including long-term service contracts of the directors. These claims have preference over money owed to unsecured creditors. In administration, any remaining assets of a company would be paid to meet these claims. In administrative receivership, the receiver would also be personally liable for any remaining shortfall. In 1987 the insolvency profession pushed through a test case - Specialised Mouldings - which supported the action taken by receivers: that they were not deemed to have adopted the employees' contracts if they wrote and told staff that they had not done so. The Court of Appeal judgment on Paramount two weeks ago appeared to overturn this ruling, arguing that all previous employment rights should be honoured and ranked as priority claims ahead of unsecured creditors unless a new contract had been drawn up. As a result, insolvency practitioners began to lay off staff rather than risk incurring substantial additional obligations and becoming personally liable for any shortfall. Mr Heseltine's statement yesterday ensures that future administrations and receiverships will reinstate the practices adopted by practitioners until now, and remove the personal liability of receivers to meet any shortfall.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THREAT TO THE RESCUE CULTURE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -What the Insolvency Act 1986 sets out  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   It makes receivers personally liable for any contract of employment   'adopted' by them. If administrators 'adopt' a contract, employees get   first call on assets.   It recognises that administrators and receivers can contract out of   personal liability by providing that they will not be deemed to have   'adopted' a contract of employment because of anything they do or omit   to do within 14 days of their appointment.   It gives receivers the right to an indemnity against personal   liability out of the assets of the company.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -How it was interpreted  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Administrators and receivers interpreted the act to mean they had 14   days after their appointment to dismiss employees or to negotiate new   employment terms which exclude personal liability. This was endorsed   by the High Court in February 1987.   Receivers and administrators now issue letters to all employees within   14 days of their appointment. These spell out that the company will   continue to pay salaries buy they do not and will not adopt or assume   personal liability in respect of contracts of employment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -The case of Paramount Airways  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   The administrators issued such a letter to all employees but when they   failed to find a buyer and dismissed all the employees, two pilots   sued for wages in lieu of notice.   The administrators argued they had not adopted contracts of employment   because of the letter sent to employees exluding personal liability.   The Court of Appeal said that 'where administrators continued   substantially after 14 days to employ staff and pay them in accordance   with previous contracts they would be held impliedly to have adopted   those contracts.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -What happens next  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Insolvency practitioners and lawyers say the decision reverses the   previous position and threatens the 'rescue culture'.   If receivers could not exclude personal liability they would not risk   trying to trade out of difficulty. Little alternative but to dismiss   staff immediately.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

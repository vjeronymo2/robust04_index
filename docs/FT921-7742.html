			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: National Semiconductor to expand Texas plant NATIONAL Semiconductor is to begin immediately a Dollars 120m expansion of its semiconductor production plant in Arlington, Texas, writes Louise Kehoe. The company said the decision to proceed with the expansion came after the passage of a tax abatement plan by local authorities which will offset a recent increase in Texas state taxes. Over the past year, National has been restructuring its operations and closing some manufacturing facilities. National said, however, the CMOS (complementary metal-oxide-silicon) technology used at Arlington was one of its core activities . 'One of our corporate goals is to concentrate our manufacturing efforts in fewer sites, each of which is more effective,' said Mr Scott Hendricks, the plant's managing director. 'Now Arlington is at the forefront of that trend.' ***** Integrated Device Technology, a US chipmaker, has reached an agreement with Toshiba of Japan to expand collaboration in developing reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessors designed by MIPS Computer. IDT, Toshiba and Siemens of Germany are partners in the manufacture of the MIPS microprocessors, which can be used to power computer workstations. MIPS is competing with Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and others to establish its microprocessors as a standard in the workstation market. IDT and Toshiba will now work together to develop derivative chips for use in applications, such as computer printers, as well as devices aimed at the personal computer and workstation markets. ***** Pillsbury, the US food processor, and Nippon Suisan Kaisha, the Japanese fishery group, are to set up a joint venture to market Pillsbury's Green Giant brand of frozen vegetables in Japan, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. The new company, Green Giant Frozen Foods, will be capitalised at Y30m and begin operations on June 1. Pillsbury, which is owned by Grand Metropolitan of the UK, will own 75 per cent of the joint venture, with Nippon Suisan holding the remainder. The Tokyo-based company will repackage frozen vegetables imported from the US and then market them in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. Nippon Suisan forecasts sales of Y2bn in the first year of operations. ***** Sivensa, Venezuela's largest private steelmaker, is to invest Dollars 300m in a new plant to produce direct-reduced iron ore briquettes for export, writes Joe Mann in Caracas.</p>

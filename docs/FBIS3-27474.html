			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ren Jianxin: "Strengthen Procuratorial and </F> Judicial Work To Guarantee Reform, Opening Up, and Stability"]    [Text] In the past year, under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th National Party  Congress, the people of all nationalities in China have seized  opportunities and deepened reform. As a result, the national  economy has been growing vigorously, social and political  stability has continued, and major progress has been made in the  modernization drive. Under the leadership of party committees  at all levels, procuratorial and judicial departments across the  country have safeguarded the stable social environment required  for China's reform and development by further improving their  work, effectively thwarting the sabotage of hostile forces at  home and abroad, dealing appropriately with some emergencies  that could have a great impact on their work, ceaselessly  carrying out various forms of struggle against crime,  concentrating on investigating and handling major economic  crimes such as embezzlement and bribery, seriously implementing  measures for consolidating public security and order, and  improving law enforcement and legal services in the economic  sphere.    This year is a very important and crucial year for deepening  the reform. Many major measures will be comprehensively taken  to establish a socialist market economic structure on the basis  of the blueprint drawn up by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, and our reform will enter a critical  stage in which wholesale advances and breakthroughs in major  areas will be sought simultaneously. Some new contradictions  and problems will emerge along with the deepening of reform and  the adjustment of relations of interest. We must remain sober,  analyze and judge the situation correctly, be prepared for  danger in times of peace, provide for a rainy day, and do a  better job of safeguarding social and political stability.    The main tasks for the procuratorial and judicial front in  1994 are implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, adhering to the  strategic principle of "grasping two links at the same time and  paying attention to both," meeting the requirements for  establishing a socialist market economic structure, further  strengthening and reforming procuratorial and judicial work,  enhancing the functions of the people's democratic dictatorship,  safeguarding national security, cracking down on criminal  activities, improving the handling of major cases in the  struggle against corruption, vigorously and comprehensively  improving public security and order, and providing better legal  protection and legal services for the socialist market economy.    1. Correctly Understand the Dialectical Relationship  Between Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Development on the One  Hand and Social Stability on the Other -- That Is, Reform and  Opening Up, and Economic Development and Social Stability  Promote One Another and Form a Single Entity -- and Doing  Everything Possible To Maintain Political Stability    Deepening the reform, opening wider to the outside world,  and  accelerating development constitute a solid foundation for  consolidating political stability and unity, and the  prerequisite for reform and development is to maintain political  stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said: "Reform requires a  stable political environment. Without this, nothing can  succeed." Only by upholding the four cardinal principles,  grasping the two links simultaneously, and preserving social and  political stability can we effectively guarantee the smooth  progress of reform, opening up, and economic construction. In  the current situation in which reform and opening to the outside  world are being accelerated, there has been a noticeable  increase in the number of factors leading to instability for  various reasons. Therefore, safeguarding stability has become  even more important and urgent. The more we accelerate the pace  of establishing the socialist market economy, the more we should  strengthen the state apparatus of the people's democratic  dictatorship and the more we should pay attention to  safeguarding social and political stability.    Safeguarding political stability is the important  responsibility of party committees, governments, and departments  at all levels and of party and government leaders of various  units. It is a task of all comrades in the party and of the  people of all nationalities across the country, and is also the  bounden duty of the procuratorial and judicial departments.  Party and government leaders at all levels must adhere to the  strategic principle of "grasping the two links at the same time  and paying attention to both." While grasping reform and  development, they should pay attention to the building of  spiritual civilization, strengthen party building, consolidate  work on the ideological and cultural front, and carry out  effectively their responsibility for safeguarding political  stability. They should study, plan, guide, and check, in a  timely manner, the work of safeguarding stability, promptly  eliminate factors leading to instability, properly handle  emergencies, and pay attention to solving the outstanding  problems of the masses to ensure social stability. The cadres  and workers of various departments and units should also enhance  their sense of political responsibility in safeguarding  stability, bear in mind that safeguarding stability is  everyone's responsibility, plug loopholes in work, improve  systems of work, and consciously make contributions to  eliminating factors leading to instability.  2. Correctly and Properly Handle the Contradictions Among  the People Arising From the New Situation    A host of contradictions among the people are bound to  surface in the course of deepening reform, opening wider to the  outside world, and developing a socialist market economy. Party  and government leaders at all levels must seriously study the  characteristics, forms of expression, aggravating factors,  preventive measures, and methods of dealing with the  contradictions among the people that emerge under the new  situation; take practical steps to change the work style,  overcome bureaucracy and formalism; go deep into the midst of  the people and help solve their actual difficulties; attach  importance to properly attending to their grievances aired  through personal visits or letters; make efforts to go to the  masses to resolve their contradictions, and take active steps to  prevent the contradictions from becoming more acute. At the  same time, we must also strive to introduce and perfect a  complete set of key measures for implementing the reforms,  intensify publicity through the media before introducing the  various measures of reform, enhance the tolerance level of the  masses, and accelerate the establishment of various mechanisms  designed to ensure social security. Party committees and  governments in various localities must shoulder leadership  responsibility, improve their ability to distinguish and handle  the two types of contradictions amid complex situations, and  promptly nip in the bud problems at the grass-roots level.    3. Strengthen and Improve Party and State Leadership  and Management Over Religious Work Among Nationalities    Party committees and governments at all levels, particularly  those in minority nationality areas, must consistently hold high  the banner of promoting economic development and national unity,  earnestly implement the "Law Governing Autonomous Regions of  Minority Nationalities," comprehensively carry out the various  policies and measures formulated by the party and the state for  minority nationality regions, and strive to foster and  consolidate national unity while accelerating economic  development as well as ideological and cultural construction.  We must step up education to publicize the Marxist concepts on  nationalities and the legal system so that the minority peoples  will learn how to safeguard their own legitimate rights and  interests through legal proceedings, thereby gradually bringing  the readjustment of relations between various nationalities into  line with the legal system. We must take a clear-cut stand,  justly and forcefully oppose ethnic splittism, and punish  according to law those involved in illegal and criminal  activities in creating separatism among nationalities. We must  strengthen management over religious affairs according to the  law, comprehensively and correctly implement the policy on  religion set out by the party and the state, protect the normal  religious activates and the legitimate rights and interests of  religious circles in accordance with the law, and firmly punish  those who take advantage of religion to interfere in political  affairs or violate the law and commit crimes. At the same time,  we must comprehensively promote among those who follow religions  the Marxist concepts on religion, patriotism, and the legal  system and rally the broad masses of followers under the banner  of economic development and bringing prosperity to the  motherland, guiding them in carrying out religious activities in  accordance with the Constitution and the law.  4. Actively Participating in the Struggle Against  Corruption and Concentrating on Investigating and Hanlding Major  Cases of Economic Crime Such As Embezzlement and Bribery    Strengthening clean government and combating corruption  constitute the necessary condition and important guarantee for  establishing the socialist market economic structure and are  keys to safeguarding stability. Procuratorial and judicial  departments at all levels and the entire police force should  conscientiously study and implement the party Central  Committee's instructions on launching the struggle against  corruption and, under the leadership of party committees and  governments, successfully push forward the struggle.    It is necessary to rely on education and law to combat  corruption and promote honesty. The important thing is that  party and government leaders at all levels must enhance their  understanding and be determined to work hard to implement  policies. Procuratorial and judicial departments should take  the initiative in participating in combating corruption, enforce  law strictly, be serious in handling cases, concentrate on  investigating and handling major cases involving crimes  committed by law-enforcement personnel, and strictly carry out  their legal responsibility. Party committees at all levels and  their political and legal commissions must provide better  leadership, seriously supervise the handling of major cases,  support procuratorial and judicial departments in strictly  enforcing laws, overcome resistance, and eliminate interference  in all forms. The leadership of relevant procuratorial and  judicial departments should strengthen guidance and supervision  over investigation and prosecution of major cases and institute  a responsibility system for handling cases to increase work  efficiency and law-enforcement quality. Investigations must be  pursued to the end no matter who is involved or what resistance  is encountered. Anyone who hinders the prosecution of cases and  protects corrupt elements must be given severe punishment  according to party discipline and state laws. In prosecuting  cases, it is necessary to pay attention to the political,  economic, and social impact. In combating corruption and  promoting honesty, it is important to go to the root of the  problem. Education in law and professional ethics, with emphasis  on building a clean government as the special topic, should be  conducted in party and government offices and other key  departments, so as to prevent and reduce, to the greatest  extent, economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery.    5. Adopting Forceful Meassures To Strengthen the  Struggle Against Crime and Meting Out Timely Severe Punishment  to Criminal Elements    Resolutely changing the situation in which insufficient  efforts have been made to crack down on crime, effectively  upgrading the results of cracking down on crime, and creating a  social environment in which people can live and work in peace  and contentment constitute the major responsibilities of  procuratorial and judicial departments and the requirements for  these departments set by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee. In 1994, in launching the struggle  against crime, it is necessary to concentrate on cracking major  cases, dismantling organized crime groups, and going after  escaped criminals. To cope with their outstanding problems,  various localities should adopt forceful measures and organize  people to crack down on crime or tackle special types of crime.  They should also strengthen investigation, prosecution, trial,  and reform on a regular basis; check the steady rise in the  number of major and serious cases; step up the anti-theft  struggle; mobilize the masses to strengthen crime-prevention  measures; eliminate breeding grounds for crime; resolutely ban  prostitution and other related activities; resolutely eliminate  social evils; round up all local criminal gangs; and exterminate  all organized crime groups once they are discovered, never  allowing them to exist.  6. Further Mobilize Social Forces To Implement Various  Measures for Comprehensively Improving Public Security and Order  Under the New Circumstances    Efforts to comprehensively improve public security and order  were emphasized many times in the decision of the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and in speeches made  by Jiang Zemin. In the new situation of developing the  socialist market economy, it is necessary to work harder to  improve public security and order in an all-round way. Not the  slightest slackening of efforts in this respect is permitted.  The focus of this work for this year is the following: First,  great efforts should be made to introduce a responsibility  system for leaders to implement the principle that the "persons  in charge shall be responsible." Committees for comprehensive  management of public security at all levels should work with  relevant departments to draw up, as quickly as possible, rules  for implementing "Some Provisions for Introducing the Leaders'  Responsibility System for the Comprehensive Management of Public  Security," promulgated by the five ministries and commissions of  the central government. In the process of changing their  operating mechanisms and establishing a modern enterprise  system, enterprises and institutions should aggressively take  the initiative in "guarding their gates, managing their  personnel, and doing their work." It is necessary to conduct  education in the legal system among the people, do a good job in  spreading legal knowledge, and enhance the people's awareness of  the law. It is necessary to strengthen networks for soldiers,  the police, and the masses to jointly participate in crime  prevention and efforts to improve public security and order.  Second, making continued efforts to improve public security and  order in key areas. While focusing on the requirements for  developing the socialist market economy, it is necessary to take  into full account the people's views, determine key areas to be  tackled in line with local conditions, improve public security  and order, and advance the comprehensive improvement of public  security and order by concentrating on key areas. Third,  special efforts should be made to resolve the problem of public  security and order in rural areas. Agriculture, rural areas,  and the peasants constitute the fundemantal issues in China's  economic development and modernization drive. Solution of the  current serious problem of public security in rural areas  remains an urgent task. It is necessary to concentrate on  villages and towns and areas adjacent to communication lines  where public security is in a state of chaos, focusing on  cracking down on hooligans and other serious criminals who  undermine agricultural production. It is necessary to  conscientiously study ways for the rational and orderly transfer  of surplus laborers in rural areas and popularize the experience  in governing villages according to law. It is necessary to  enhance the role of the basic-level people's mediation  committees so as to reduce the number of civil disputes and  prevent contradictions from worsening. It is necessary to  implement the guidelines of the central conference on rural work  and reorganize grassroots party organizations, whose core  consists of party branches, and consolidate autonomous mass  organizations in stages within three to five years. It is  necessary to consolidate and strengthen the number of rural  people engaged in joint crime prevention and joint efforts to  improve public security. In some localities the masses are  willing to voluntarily pay for the hiring of personnel to  safeguard public security. This should not be regarded as  indiscriminate collection of charges. Fourth, it is necessary  to conduct education in the legal system among young people,  focusing on systematically educating middle school students in  the legal system on a regular basis. It is necessary to  strengthen control over the market for cultural products and  over places where videos are shown in order to purify the public  environment in which young people grow. Fifth, it is necessary  to implement measures for resettling and educating convicts who  have been released at the end of their prison term, as well as  the personnel freed from centers for educating juvenile  delinquents through labor. In particular, in dealing with those  who refuse to work and give up bad habits and who may commit new  crimes, it is necessary to draw up a package of control,  management, and education measures.    7. Accelerating Reform of Procuratorial and judical  Work So As To Provide Better Service to Development of the  Socialist Market Economy    The establishment of a socialist market economic structure  urgently requires a corresponding reform of procuratorial and  judicial work. In accordance with the relevant guidelines of  the party Central Committee, procuratorial and judicial  departments should implement positive and yet discreet  principles; persist in taking "conducive to three causes" --  developing the productive forces of our socialist society,  increasing the overall strength of our socialist country,  improving living standards -- as their fundamental criterion;  and, guided by the correct principle of "perfecting the legal  system, guaranteeing democracy, strengthening dictatorship,  providing highly efficient service, and improving supervision,"  accelerate the pace of reform and opening to the outside world.  In particular, mature reform measures must be introduced in a  timely manner.    Procuratorial and judicial departments are urgently required  to study a series of reform measures to support the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure by the  end of this century. For example, reforming and perfecting the  judicial system and the administrative law-enforcement  mechanism; establishing an integrated people's police structure  and judicial structure to upgrade the quality of judicial work  and administrative law-enforcement; establishing a sound  self-restraint mechanism and law-enforcement supervisory  meachanism in procuratorial and judicial departments; in  conjunction with major economic reform measures and in  accordance with the law governing the operation of the socialist  market economy, studying the revision of economic laws and  statutes and judicial interpretations, and improving and  tightening the administration of economic laws so as to create a  favorable legal environment for fair competition; in accordance  with the principle of separating government administration and  enterprise management, reforming the public security structure  and public order management in enterprises and institutions; in  accordance with changes in the economic structure in urban and  rural areas, reforming the family registration system to bring  about a rational transfer of surplus labor; increasing  intermediate market organizations such as law and notary  offices, reforming their operating mechanisms, and strengthening  unified management of legal service organizations; simplifying  administrative organs, reforming cadre and personnel  administrative systems, and establishing a sound system for  handling cases and guaranteeing expenditures; and so on and so  forth. Policy decisions on reform should go hand in hand with  those on legislation. It is necessary to step up efforts to  draft and revise the "Police Law," "Regulations on Judges,"  "Regulations on Procurators," "Law on Lawyers," "Prison Law,"  "Notary Law," and "Compensation Law." It is also necessary to  accelerate revision of the Criminal Law and the Criminal  Procedure Law. These laws should be used to guide, promote, and  guarantee the smooth progress of reform in procuratorial and  judicial work.    8. Combating Corruption, Promoting Honesty, Tightening  Discipline Among Procuratorial and Judicial Personnel, and  Improving Their Work Style    As the main force and also one of the main sectors in the  fight against corruption, procuratorial and judicial  departments, while actively participating in the struggle  against corruption, should first set an example in combating  corruption and promoting honesty, allowing these two activities  to promote one another. In combating corruption and promoting  honesty, emphasis should be placed on educating the masses of  cadres and the police rank and file. We must conscientiously  organize them to study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping and arm them with the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics. All cadres and police  rank and file should conscientiously study relevant central  documents and regulations, serve as an exemplary servant and  defender of the people, and consciously render service to  reform, opening up, and economic construction. It is necessary  to adopt resolute measures to correct unhealthy practices and  strictly investigate cases involving corruption. At the same  time, we must commend the advanced, promote healthy practices,  and closely integrate combating corruption with promoting  honesty. More importantly, it is necessary to learn from  experiences and lessons, both past and recent, Chinese and  foreign, improve the law-enforcement system, strengthen  supervision mechanisms, and institutionalize and standardize  strict law enforcement and the struggle to combat corruption and  promote honesty.    In 1994 we must launch an education and rectification  campaign in procuratorial and judicial departments and among the  police force and conduct thoroughgoing education in the reasons  for serving the people, the importance of being honest and  hardworking, and the legal system. At the same, it is necessary  to rely on the masses in investigating and strictly handling  cases involving violations of discipline and the law. No  indulgence toward wrongdoing shall be permitted. We must focus  on investigating and handling major cases involving bribes,  bending the law for personal gain, extortion, illegal  detainment, and extorting confession by torture, and put a stop  to chaotic lending, fund-raising, and establishment of financial  institutions -- three chaotic phenomena. Cadres and police from  public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments must  strictly abide by the requirements concerning honesty and  self-discipline set by the Central Committee, the circular on  the "10 Prohibitions" issued by the Central Commission on  Politics and Law, and the rules of discipline for building a  clean government drawn up by procuratorial and judicial  departments. We must work toward establishing strict discipline  and clean workstyle as quickly as possible.  9. Strengthening and Improving Party Leadership Over  Political and Legal Work    In the period of transition to a socialist market economic  system, those who are involved in political and legal work face  a new situation, new problems, and more demanding tasks, thus  making further enhancement of party leadership over this work  all the more necessary. Party committees at all levels are  urged to constantly study and resolve major problems in  political and legal work, providing guidance, supervision, and  support to political and legal departments to remove obstacles  and enhance strict law enforcement in line with the requirements  of maintaining, stabilizing, and enhancing law and order in a  socialist market economic system. Party committees and  governments at all levels should attach importance to resolving  the practical problems of serious shortages of funds and  outdated technology and equipment at political and legal  departments, ensuring the normal operation of various  undertakings by the state organs of dictatorship.    The committees on politics and law under the various levels  of party committees are a form of organization that the party  uses to enhance its leadership over political and legal work.  It is necessary to strengthen these committees under various  levels of party committees and give full play to their roles and  functions. Committees on politics and law at all levels are  called upon to carry out investigation and study in depth,  become good advisers to party committees, offer more political  guidance to politics and law departments, coordinate and promote  closer cooperation among various politics and law departments,  work out a system of legal restraints, and give full play their  functions and roles.    Building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  developing a socialist market economy is an unprecedented and  great undertaking. Therefore, the tasks confronting political  and legal departments are arduous yet glorious. Let us rally  closely behind the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang  Zemin at its core, adhere to the party's basic line, fulfil our  duties, make bold explorations, work with one heart and one  mind, accomplish various tasks, and make fresh contributions to  maintaining stability and promoting reform, opening up, and  socialist modernization!</p>

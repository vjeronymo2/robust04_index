			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Wm Ransom static at Pounds 0.29m Static turnover and profits were yesterday reported by William Ransom, the pharmaceutical products maker, for the six months to end-September. On turnover down from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.31m pre-tax profits came out at Pounds 285,000 (Pounds 289,000). There was severe pressure on prices but the weaker pound boosted exports. Earnings per share worked through at 1.22p (1.24p) and in line with the company's previously stated intention to reduce disparity, the interim dividend is increased by 46 per cent to 0.769p (0.525p). The company also announced it had appointed Mr David Brown as chief executive. Mr Brown, aged 53, is a qualified pharmacist and has held senior managerial positions with Amersham International and Serono Laboratories (UK). He will join the company on February 1.</p>

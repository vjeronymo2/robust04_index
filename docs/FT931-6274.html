			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marriott bondholders to push on with fraud claim A GROUP of bondholders in Marriott Corporation, the US hotels and food services group which is planning to split itself into two separately-quoted companies, said yesterday it intended to step up its securities fraud litigation against the company, writes Nikki Tait. The bondholder action is led by PPM America, part of the British Prudential insurance company's investment management division, which holds around Dollars 200m in Marriott bonds - largely on behalf of Jackson National Life Insurance Company, the Prudential's US insurance subsidiary. The demerger scheme involves spinning off the more profitable operational businesses and leaving most of the group's debt, along with the property assets, in a separate company. Marriott bonds dropped sharply as a result, although the group's shares have soared. Some bondholders, including PPM America, sued Marriott, charging that the company failed to disclose its restructuring plan when it was selling new debt issues to investors last year. Some of the big US institutional bondholders, however, are negotiating with Marriott, with a view to a settlement.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Stripped of his options by a full-court press of the judicial variety, Brian  Shaw is returning to the Boston Celtics. The Celtics announced that Shaw has  agreed to rejoin them after spending a season playing in Italy.  </P> <P> "Glad to be back," said Shaw, the former UC Santa Barbara star, during a Boston  news conference. His return thus ended a bitter legal battle that began after  he signed a four-year contract with the Celtics last January. At the time, he  was in the first year of a two-year deal with Il Messaggero of Rome. Shaw  subsequently attempted to return to the Italian club for the upcoming season.  </P> <P> The resolution followed a federal court decision in June, ordering Shaw to end  the Italian contract and play for Boston, a fine of $50,000 for defying the  order and meetings between lawyers for both sides.  </P> <P> Shaw said it was his intention to play one more year with Il Messaggero, then  return to Boston.  </P> <P> "I never ever said or ever felt that I didn't want to be here," Shaw said.  </P> <P> He felt he got in trouble because he was operating without an agent.  </P> <P> "I felt at the time that I knew what I was doing and I could do everything  myself," the 24-year-old player said. "The lesson that I've learned is I don't  know it all."  </P> <P> Shaw was Boston's first-round draft pick in 1988, who became a starter as a  rookie and averaged 8.6 points and 5.8 assists.  </P></p>

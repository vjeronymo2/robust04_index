			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I'LL VOTE, BUT WITH A STENCH IN MY NOSTRILS;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS: THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR IS BETWEEN A BULLY AND A COLD PATRICIAN.  UGH.  </P> <P> I'm in a political location known as a quandary, located precisely halfway  between a rock and a hard place. The rock is John Silber. The hard place is  Bill Weld. The problem is whom to vote for as governor of Massachusetts.  </P> <P> The governor's race here has bewildered outsiders who think of Massachusetts as  the land of the liberal, the miracle and the Michael. Two angry years after  Dukakis and the economy went down the chute, the choice for his successor will  be either a Reagan Democrat or a Bush Republican.  </P> <P> On the one hand, there is John Silber, the president of Boston University, a  man whose style of interpersonal relationship is winning through intimidation.  But Silber's a man with some attractive ideas, especially about early  education.  </P> <P> On the other hand, there is William Weld, the affable patrician-in-training who  worked in Reagan's Justice Department until he resigned in protest. Weld exudes  the politics of the well-fed, favoring a tax-cut proposal on the ballot that  threatens a lethal blow to the state's services.  </P> <P> This race may be an entry in the era of post-character politics. For a time,  the reassuring notion was bandied about that if you knew the person you could  judge the policies. But here we look into the mirror and ask: What do you do  when good people are in favor of bad things and bad people are in favor of good  things, and when it's hard to tell them apart?  </P> <P> Each time an undecided voter swallows hard, determines to go with Weld's  temperament and hope for the best, he makes them choke. How do you vote for a  guy who talks about the AK-47 assault weapon as if it's sporting equipment at  the Myopia Hunt Club? Just when another undecided voter figures that she can  pull the Silber lever without sending a lethal electric shock through her  veins, he raises the voltage. Last week, Silber's comments on blacks and  Cambodians were topped by the charge that children were "neglected" and  "abused" by working women "who have thought that a third-rate-day care center  was just as good as a first-rate home."  </P> <P> Having explored the terrain of undecided turf, inch by inch, only one angle  holds any promise of decision: Vote against the man with a lifetime of  contentious bullying in his curriculum vitae. Stop John Silber before he gets  on the yellow brick road of national politics.  </P> <P> John Silber's scorn for others, his disinterest in listening and what it  implies -- an occasional change of mind -- makes him unfit. So does the message  that the victory of this ambitious man would send nationally: The politics of  anger are winning.  </P></p>

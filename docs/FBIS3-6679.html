			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Tasty, Nutritious Bean-based </F> Imitation Meat"]    [Text] The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has indicated:  By broadly accepting achievements in modern science and  technology, the food industry should direct efforts to  technological innovation in order to timely process various  foodstuffs industrially and to produce and ensure clean,  nutritious, and expedient processed foodstuffs at a low price.    Scientists in the light industry sector, who actively  conducted scientific research activities by upholding the  party's intent, finished developing the technology for the  production of tasty and nutritious imitation meat made with  beans, and put this technology into practice.    By deeply cherishing the lofty intent of the dear comrade  leader to constantly upgrade the people's living standard,  scientists in the Grain Engineering Research Institute and Food  Machine Research Institute of the Academy of Science for Light  Industry, dedicated their passion and study to developing a  large quantity of good- quality foodstuffs suiting people's  taste. They succeeded in producing a tasty, nutritious, and  easy-to-process imitation meat by using bean residues from which  soybean oil was extracted.    The imitation meat, which was recently researched and  developed, is highly nutritious, and is easy to process and  store.    In addition, its structure [chojik kujo] and the feel when  it  is chewed are nearly the same as meat. Thus, it has a good  flavor. Besides, the process to manufacture it is simple and its  cost is low. For this, it is regarded as a cheap foodstuffs  product.    This has been proven by several papers presented by  scientists after examination and analysis.    Various products were compared and showed that 100 grams of  pork has 107 calories; meat 88, and bean curd made of bean  residues has 82. However, the calorie value of this imitation  meat was 134, showing 1.2 times more calories than pork, 1.5  times more than meat, and 1.6 times more than bean curd made of  bean residues.    An analysis shows that pork has 21 percent of protein; meat  18.7 percent, and bean curd made of bean residues 9.6 percent.  However, bean-based imitation meat showed 14.5 percent of  protein. Thus, it has contains more protein than bean  residues-made bean curd, although less than pork and meat.    Besides, 95 percent of the bean-based imitation meat protein  is digestible. It has no harmful element to the health of people.    Bean-based imitation meat has also the advantage that it can  be stored for a long time. This meat is easy to dry, and can be  stored for about a month in the summer without packing, and  about five months in the spring and autumn. The refrigerated and  compressed bean-based imitation meat can be stored for as long  as one year, and if well packaged, it can be stored for over a  year.    Thus, the bean-based imitation meat, has a high nutritious  value, is easy to process, and it is tasty.    Residents in many places who actually included this meat in  their diet said its taste is similar to that of chicken when  they mixed in various seasonings after soaking it in water for a  few minutes. In particular, soup made with this meat mixed in  with some real meat, pork or chicken, is very delicious, just as  that made of real meat.    Since the cost of making bean-based imitation meat is very  low, it is very cheap.    Bean residues from which soybean oil was extracted, some  salt, and baking soda, are all the materials required for  producing this imitation meat.    Electricity consumption is also very low.    Besides, its production process is simple, and setting up  its  production facilities is relatively easy.    The process is as follows: We cut bean residues, from which  soybean oil is extracted, into pieces of a certain size and mix  them in water with salt and baking soda. We then knead them, and  put them in a two-axis screw compressor. They will then be  turned into a form of fiber in the machine at a temperature of  135 degrees Centigrade and at a three-megapascal pressure.  Following this, they will pass through thin mechanical nozzle  opening, and will spout out to the air instantaneously. This is  how the imitation meat is produced.    As its production process is very simple, one can easily  produce it anywhere if one has a two-axis screw compressor.    Functionaries and workers in the Yongbok general foodstuff  plant in Pyongyang, in the Changgwang dried rice foodstuff  plant, and in the rice mill of the Chunghwa cooperative farm in  Chunghwa County, have gained experience in producing bean-based  imitation meat in cooperation with scientists. Their experience  shows that if we work with revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance, we can easily learn this production process.    In fact, engineering workshops in foodstuffs plants set up  this production process with their own strength, and are using  it to produce bean-based imitation meat.    The bean-based imitation meat, which was produced by the  light industry scientists, who uphold lofty intention of dear  comrade leader, will certainly contribute to enriching the  people's dietary life in the future.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 12TH PLAYBOY FESTIVAL TUNES UP FOR A BALANCED OPENING;  </P> <P> JAZZ: A RANGE OF STYLES AND A MEASURED SERVING OF THE POPULAR AND ARTISTIC  SHAPE THE START OF A SHOW WITH A CHECKERED HISTORY.  </P> <P> It began at 2:25 p.m. Saturday, five minutes ahead of schedule, at the  Hollywood Bowl. In spirit, though, the 12th annual Playboy Jazz Festival  started in Flagstaff, with the Northern Arizona University Jazz Ensemble, and  ended in Havana, with Poncho Sanchez and Tito Puente pumping out old-timey  mambo-style dance music.  </P> <P> In the sense that none of the nine acts offered anything offensive or out of  place, and that moments of inspiration marked at least some parts of every set,  this was among the most felicitously planned in the festival's slightly  checkered history.  </P> <P> The maintenance of that delicate balance between the popular and the artistic,  the visceral and the cerebral, was kept with very few compromises. True, there  was no single high point to carry into memory. The audience did not come fully  alive until 6:15 p.m., during a Tommy Newsom suite played by the Doc Severinsen  Orchestra, when Bill Henderson spontaneously joined the action and sang the  blues, flanked by Severinsen and Snooky Young in a "talking trumpets" routine.  </P> <P> Later, Joe Williams, waving a handkerchief during a blues vocal, soon had  thousands of handkerchiefs blowing in the breeze. The Williams set promised a  surprise that failed to materialize. With Jay McShann billed as an added  attraction, it was natural to expect an unprecedented blues duet, but McShann  stayed at the piano and, even when Williams sang a song McShann wrote and  popularized, "Confessin' the Blues," the Kansas City veteran never raised his  voice.  </P> <P> The most adventurous group presented was a quartet composed of pianist Herbie  Hancock, drummer Jack De Johnette, bassist Dave Holland and guitarist Pat  Metheny. With routines that veered wildly between total freedom and basic  three-part chords, and with Holland and Metheny both alternating between  acoustic and electric instruments, this was a provocative set, chaotic when it  started but more accessible as it went through a series of unannounced  originals.  </P> <P> The opening performance by the Arizona band offered inspiring new evidence of  the team spirit and occasional solo accomplishments of which these college  groups are capable. Pianist Jim O'Meally brought warmth and conviction to  "Spirit of Trane." For a finale, the whole band roared decisively through Mat  Catingup's witty piece, "Blues and the Abscessed Tooth."  </P> <P> The "Tonight Show" ensemble, surely the most seen but least heard band in  America, earned a rare chance to stretch out, with first-class arrangements by  Newsom (whose alto sax shared honors with Pete Christlieb's tenor) and Bill  Holman's new view of "Honeysuckle Rose."  </P> <P> The Tony Williams Quintet, an energetic hard bop group, was noteworthy for the  promise shown by a fast-rising trumpeter, Wallace Roney, and by the potent,  driving piano of Mulgrew Miller. Williams, though magnificent as an ensemble  drummer, insisted on starting almost every number with a long solo; for  diversion during these stretches you could always catch up on a few features in  the handsome 104-page souvenir program.  </P> <P> The Chick Corea Trio, running the gamut from his own originals to Coltrane and  Bud Powell and Monk, represented contemporary acoustic music flawlessly, with  John Patitucci in his ever-more incredibly nimble form, and drummer Dave Weckl  superbly supportive.  </P> <P> Pianist Eliane Elias blended determination and delicacy in two of her own works  from the "Cross Currents" album. Surprisingly, she seemed less at ease  interpreting the works of Antonio Carlos Jobim from her native Brazil. "Waters  of March" was just a hair too aggressive and "Desafinado" too fast, with Peter  Erskine's drumming slightly overbearing.  </P> <P> Fellow musicians, notably Wynton Marsalis, have expressed the belief that Miles  Davis has betrayed the achievements of his definitive years. Possibly Marsalis  is wise beyond his years and Miles is years beyond his wisdom. Saturday evening  he offered several passages of genuine beauty, mostly muted, but much of what  he accomplishes today is limited by the rhythmic and harmonic monotony of the  settings.  </P> <P> Davis has found a new way to avoid talking to his audiences: When someone in  the band is soloing, he holds up a placard bearing the soloist's first name.  Kenny Garrett's alto sax tended toward longer phrases than Davis, but he too  was given to repetition and choppy, staccato sounds.  </P> <P> There was a shock for the 17,951 attendees when emcee Bill Cosby announced:  "Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Gosa." Since the popular disc jockey died last year,  this was a chilling moment, assuaged a little when Cosby added the names of  Sammy Davis Jr., Dexter Gordon and Sarah Vaughan to clarify his oddly worded  point (but he neglected to include a death as tragic as any, that of  32-year-old Emily Remler).  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW PRINCIPALS IN 'GREEN TABLE'  </P> <P> Few ballets incorporate the routine of cast changes into their themes as  profoundly as does Kurt Jooss' anti-war parable "The Green Table." The faces  may change; the terrible cycle goes on.  </P> <P> Three new principals joined the Joffrey Ballet line-up of relentless marchers  to death, Tuesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.  </P> <P> Carl Corry made a joyfully opportunistic, rapacious Profiteer, hurrahing the  troops, cheering the patriots and, given the chance, stripping a ring off a  dead soldier's finger with manic glint in his eye.  </P> <P> Corry bounded, glided and hopped through the carnage, and hovered over the  Young Girl (Kim Sagami) with voracious intent.  </P> <P> But even the Profiteer had no immunity from the overall slaughter, and Corry  died an astonished, crumpled figure.  </P> <P> Sagami met her fate -- loss of her lover, life in a brothel -- with  uncomprehending innocence, vestiges of honor and helplessly entreating pleas.  But she made her final moments frantic and fearful.  </P> <P> Jodie Gates made a fiercely determined, slightly crazed Partisan. Pushed to the  wall, with nothing to lose, she found dignity and heroism and, finally, comfort  in being carried off by death.  </P> <P> Allan Lewis again conducted.  </P> <P> The program also included Balanchine's "Cotillon" and Ashton's "Illuminations,"  both previously reviewed.

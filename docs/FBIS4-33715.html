			<p>BFN     [Text] Rio de Janeiro, 7 June (AE) -- Less than 1 percent  of the farms throughout the country are larger than 1,000  hectares, yet they occupy 43.73 percent of Brazilian rural  territory. Paradoxically, farms of 10 hectares represent 52.83  percent of the establishments, yet occupy only 2.66 percent of  rural territory. This concentration of land in the hands of an  elite of farmers is causing the expulsion of peasants and  increasing the population in urban areas. Consequently, 21  percent of the Brazilian population, or 32 million people, are  destitute. This phenomenon is causing another unsolvable  problem: conflicts between the landless and farmers. In 1993  alone there were more than 900 conflicts over the possession of  land in the Amazon region. This information is contained in  research conducted by geographer Dora Hess of the Brazilian  Geography and Statistics Institute (IBGE), which was published  in Rio de Janeiro today during National Environment Week.    According to Hess, the 32 million destitute result from the  excessive concentration of income (10 percent of the poor  receive only 0.8 percent of the income, while 10 percent of the  rich receive 48 percent); 12 million workers (20 percent of the  economically active population) barely earn one minimum salary;  and the purchasing power of the poor and middle class salaries  has deteriorated. Hess asserts that "for the past 15 years  Brazil has been living in recession because the employment  levels have remained unchanged, the consumption power has  dropped, and investments have been made in highly qualified jobs  such as industrial automation."    In the survey, which will be published in France, Hess  quotes  economist Paulo Schilling to refer to the generalized  impoverishment of workers. In 1960, according to Schilling, a  family basket cost 26 percent of the minimum salary. In 1992 it  cost 78 percent of the minimum salary. Early this year, the  minimum salary did not cover the cost of the family basket.  Another consequence of this prolonged recession is the  increasing number of children between the ages of 10 and 13 on  the job market. Hess states that "almost 14.15 percent of  children at this age already work, and this percentage increases  to 58.89 percent in the rural regions."    There are 3.8 million Brazilians living in shantytowns in  nine metropolitan regions, according to another survey conducted  by IBGE geographer Helena Balaciano. The Recife metropolitan  region occupies first place with 678,586 (24.6 percent),  followed by Belem (19.2 percent), Fortaleza (15.6 percent), Rio  de Janeiro (12 percent), Belo Horizonte (10.9 percent), Sao  Paulo (7.5 percent), Curitiba (5.9 percent), Porto Alegre (5.3  percent), and Salvador (4.1 percent). According to Helena  Balaciano, the suburbs of the large and medium-sized cities  currently have to deal with the shantytown phenomenon because  Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro are no longer attractive to  migrants. Another phenomenon is that the largest number of  people living in shantytowns are concentrated in the suburbs of  municipal districts rather than in the capitals themselves, such  as in Betim (15 percent, ouutside Minas Gerais), and Diadema (20  percent, outside Sao Paulo). Moreover, Curitiba district, with  6.9 percent of the population living in shantytowns due to the  expulsion of landless people from the rural region, holds the  record for all metropolitan region suburbs.</p>

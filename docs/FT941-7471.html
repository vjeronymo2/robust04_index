			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Australian insurer ahead at midterm QBE Insurance Group, the Australian general insurer, yesterday reported net profits of ADollars 32m (USDollars 44m) before unrealised investment gains in the six months to end-December, up from ADollars 26.5m in the year-earlier period. Adding in the unrealised investment gains of ADollars 76.9m, compared with a loss of ADollars 17.2m last time, group profits surged to ADollars 108.8m from ADollars 9.25m. Gross earned premiums in the period were ADollars 599.9m, compared with ADollars 469m a year ago. QBE said that the profits increase resulted from improved claims ratios in all its divisions, and better expense ratios in the reinsurance and international primary insurance sectors. The investment gains followed a sharp rise in the value of the company's equity portfolio. QBE's directors have a preferred method of accounting for unrealised investment gains, which involves spreading these over seven years. While acknowledging this does not comply with local accounting standards, they yesterday published figures using this alternative approach. These showed net profits, after the smoothed investment gains, of ADollars 40.1m compared with ADollars 30.2m last year.</p>

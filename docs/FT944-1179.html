			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk helps drive Footsie towards 3,100 - Market report Takeover stories, actual and rumour-based, continued to dominate the UK equity market yesterday with news of De La Rue's Pounds 682m bid for Portals, and the prospect of many more bids and mergers in coming months, overriding the market's fundamental concerns over the short term prospects for domestic and international interest rates. As the London market closed, no hard news had emerged from the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting held to discuss monetary policy, although Wall Street was under renewed pressure for much of the afternoon and down over 20 points an hour after London closing. The feeling remained in both Europe and the US that the Federal Reserve would want to examine all the economic evidence from the fourth quarter before it moved to increase its interest rates so soon after the last move. That took place in mid-November when the Fed increased its Fed Funds rate by 75 basis points to 5 1/2 per cent. On top of the previous session's 16-point fall, dealers said the latest weakness had produced some tremors around UK dealing desks during the last two hours of trading. But the general consensus among traders was that London would probably wind down for the Christmas holiday in good form, given no shift in US interest rates. Helping to sustain all European equity and bond markets was more good news on inflation and money supply from Germany. Germany's M3 money supply grew by an annualised 6 per cent in the year to end-November, much better than the consensus forecast of 6.3 per cent and the annualised 6.9 per cent for the year to end-October. Inflation figures for November from Bavaria were also seen as bullish for markets. 'The German numbers were very good for the markets, well within target ranges,' said the head trader at one of the leading European banks in London. He added that London's equity market would take heart from any strength in Euro bourses, especially Frankfurt. The Bundesbank Council meets in Frankfurt tomorrow to decide the course of German interest rates. By the close of trading the FT-SE 100 index had risen a further 23.7 to 3,058.1, its highest level since the end of November and a rise of 114.7, or 3.9 per cent since December 12 when the market was reeling from a combination of political and economic worries. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index was left behind by its senior index, closing only 3.7 higher at 3,463.7. Earlier, the market had begunon a quiet note, mindful of the overnight fall on Wall Street. Down 3.9 at the outset the FT-SE 100 index quickly rallied as news of the De La Rue bid for Portals - at a much higher than expected price - and other potential bids hit the market. Helping the market move ahead was a Pounds 30m-plus programme trade which was said to have been weighted on the buy side and executed by UBS. Turnover, boosted by the UBS programme trade, increased to a highly respectable 798.4m shares, with non-Footsie stocks providing almost 66 per cent of that figure. Customer business on Monday was worth Pounds 1.275bn. De La Rue, although feeding the market's takeover appetite with its agreed offer for Portals, suffered from the view that the company was paying a full price for the paper manufacturer. The merchant banks and securities houses attracted yet another wave of strong buying interest as speculators continued to bet on a series of rationalisation moves in the UK securities business. Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court, both highly-rated and sizeable players in London markets, moved near their highest levels since February, when bond and equity markets began their interest rate driven descent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Sergey Babkin and </F> Yuriy Tyssovskiy]    [Excerpts] Moscow, 19 Apr -- Russian Foreign Affairs  Minister Andrey Kozyrev today paid tribute to Yasir 'Arafat,  president of the state of Palestine and chairman of the PLO  Executive Committee, for the responsibility and courage he has  shown to establish peace in the Near East. At a news  conference, he summed up the results of the talks which have  taken place with the Palestinian side at the Foreign Ministry's  residence. These talks covered a wide range of issues connected  with a Near East settlement and bilateral relations.    The head of the Russian Foreign Ministry said that at the  talks in Moscow the sides continued the Palestinian-Russian  dialogue which has been going on for several years now and which  was given powerful impetus as a result of President Boris  Yeltsin's initiative. This initiative was discussed by the  sides in Tunis, where a "bold and fundamental" political  decision was made to return to the negotiating table in spite of  existing difficulties. "Today we discussed those difficulties,  we know about them, and we are determined to eliminate all  obstacles to a comprehensive settlement," the minister stressed.  He assured Y. 'Arafat of Russian support for the PLO's policy  of opposing extremists, and noted that the heads of state of  Palestine and Russia are in constant contact through the Russian  president's special envoy Viktor Posuvalyuk via a regular  exchange of messages.    Y. 'Arafat described his visit to Moscow as especially  important given the difficult circumstances under which it is  taking place. He said: "A double historical, political, and  moral responsibility for the situation in the region rests on  Mr. Kozyrev, since it was he and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher who countersigned the Palestinian-Israeli  agreement." Y. 'Arafat said that today he discussed with the  head of the Russian Foreign Ministry ways of overcoming those  obstacles which are preventing the implementation of the  Palestinian-Israeli "Gaza-Jericho, First" agreement, and namely  those "delays and maneuvers" to which the Israeli side is  resorting. "I reminded the minister that the deadline under the  agreement for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the  territories coming under Palestinian autonomy expired on 13  April. In spite of this, nothing has changed on the ground,"  the PLO leader said.    "All of this will lead to time being lost and will allow  those forces which oppose the agreement to close ranks and  mobilize their actions against the establishment of peace in the  region." He warned that the only alternative to peace is  anarchy and "Balkanization" of the region. [passage omitted]    After the talks, the sides signed a Russo-Palestinian  agreement on the prospects for bilateral cooperation in  politics, economics, and culture.    Earlier today, the Palestinian head of the state laid a  wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier, and held talks with  Russian State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin and Russian Interior  Minister Viktor Yerin.</p>

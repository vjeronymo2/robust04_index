			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Priorities for the environment In your welcome attempt to sort out environmental priorities ('Clarifying the green agenda', July 21), you identify one of the most pressing political issues of the decade. You rightly emphasise the urgent need to assess the threat of climatic change and to curb emissions. However, in arguing that conserving biodiversity is the 'most overblown issue of all' you fail to see that the balanced relationships between the species that make up an ecosystem are as important as the species themselves. They stem from interactions, many as yet imperfectly understood, between millions of species. Human life depends on the stability of these relationships: their preservation is certainly not 'conservation for its own sake'. By suggesting that we simply catalogue and preserve species in a 'Noah's Ark', you are indulging in a 'Jurassic Park' fantasy. Sustainable economic activity depends on the maintenance of biodiversity. It therefore requires that we manage our resources in ways that do not irreparably damage ecosystems. Recycling and the use of renewable energy are therefore important. Narrow attitudes got us into this mess. The sooner we all recognise that we are part of the planet's ecosystems, not independent of them, the better.

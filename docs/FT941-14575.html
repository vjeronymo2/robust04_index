			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Bosnia partition talks collapse Talks among Bosnia's three warring parties last night collapsed, with the Bosnian government under increased pressure to endorse a deal after Croatia and Serb-led Yugoslavia agreed to establish low-level diplomatic relations. Lord Owen, the European Union mediator, said the warring communities would go back to 'fight with no real prospects of coming together in a constructive frame of getting a peace agreement'. He said agreement on partition remained deadlocked on the same points - demands for the restoration of a string of towns throughout Bosnia, which were mostly Moslem before the outbreak of war. Under the modest accord, signed by the foreign ministers of Croatia and Yugoslavia, the two countries will set up representative offices in their respective capitals by February 15. While proclaiming the declaration 'a major step towards the normalisation of relations between Croatia and Serbia', Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president, was disappointed by the refusal of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, his Serbian counterpart, to extend full diplomatic recognition of Croatia within its borders. The agreement failed to address the most serious point of contention, the fact that Serbs have set up their own state, of Krajina, on a third of Croatian territory. The Krajina Serbs yesterday said Croatia could sign international agreements 'only for the territory that it controls'. Diplomats said the restoration of communication and transport links would be top priority. However, similar agreements put forward since 1991 have collapsed. Mr Mohamed Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador to the UN, expressed the Moslem-led government's fear of a Serbo-Croat carve-up at their expense. 'We hope this does not signal a further alliance of war against our country,' he said, adding that Croats should decide 'whether they are victims in this war or whether they are opportunistic aggressors'. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, said there had been no progress in yesterday's talks. He stuck to his demands for the return of territory in eastern and western Bosnia seized by Serb forces over 22 months of war. In sessions, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, discussed the creation of an international arbitration commission to settle territorial disputes. But Lord Owen said the Moslems had rejected such a proposal which would effectively sanction the military status quo until the commission determined which ethnic community should control a contested town. France was yesterday considering a successor to General Jean Cot, who is to relinquish his command of United Nations forces in ex-Yugoslavia at the request of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, by March 31, writes David Buchan in Paris. As the largest provider of UN troops in the former Yugoslavia, it is for France to propose a replacement.</p>

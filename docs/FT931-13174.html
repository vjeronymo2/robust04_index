			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Monday Interview: Mr Fix-it's central role - Bob Phillis, next deputy director-general of the BBC, talks to Raymond Snoddy A puppet of Bob Phillis appeared on Spitting Image, the satirical television programme that savagely lampoons the rich and famous, from the royal family to government ministers. It is, however, an accurate measure of the fame of Mr Phillis that the puppet only appeared once in a crowd scene and has languished in his cellar ever since. It was made in honour of his 40th birthday when he was managing director of Central, the ITV company responsible for Spitting Image. It may now be time to take the puppet back upstairs. Mr Phillis, now 47, has been playing an increasingly significant role in British broadcasting for more than 10 years and is to play an even bigger one. He will be the next deputy director-general of the BBC, even though he left school at 15 to become an apprentice in the printing industry, knew nothing of Oxford or Cambridge, where BBC top executives are normally educated, and has never made a programme in his life. 'People say to me: 'Bob you are not a programme maker,' ' he says. 'I'm not. I have never produced or directed a programme, but by God I believe it is part of my role to facilitate the environment in which programme makers can do their best work.' Mr Phillis is central to the plans of Mr John Birt, the new BBC director-general, to try to make the corporation more efficient and accountable, and to persuade the government to renew both its Royal Charter and its universal licence fee. Apart from deputising for Mr Birt across the whole organisation, Mr Phillis will be responsible for a BBC directorate being created to handle resources, engineering and services. His job will also involve merging and running, for the immediate future, BBC World Service Radio, which has just celebrated its 60th anniversary, and the more recent World Service Television. Were Mr Phillis to be joining a First Division football team, he would be the calm, genial sort of solid, midfield player who holds the line when the defence is about to crumble and who can feed the star attackers with accurate passes. But he possesses a more fearsome reputation. People have noticed that, where Mr Phillis goes, job losses can follow. In his two years as chief executive of ITN, staff numbers were cut from 1,100 to 650. There are fears that his arrival will mean similar cuts at the BBC. 'I do bridle at the notion of hatchet man,' he says. 'I have been lucky to have been asked to be managing director or chief executive of companies going through change, and some of that change has been painful. But it has not been change for change's sake; it has been to sustain, or preserve or facilitate.' ITN would not have survived without urgent action to tackle costs in the wake of a Pounds 10m overspend which came to light just as he was arriving, he emphasises. Ironically, Mr Phillis will go to the BBC in the wake of a much larger and much more embarrassing overspend. The BBC admits to being Pounds 38m over budget at BBC Television in 1991-92, although the corporation managed to balance its books overall through cost savings. This year the BBC says its 'best guess' is that there could be a Pounds 21m overspend if economies are not implemented. 'How can you deploy the argument of openness and accountability and value for money if ever this overspend repeats itself? So we have to make sure it doesn't,' says Mr Phillis, who will join the BBC in two months. He first wants to see through the completion of a change of ownership at ITN. A consortium including Carlton Communications, Central and Reuters will replace the previous ITN structure - a wholly owned subsidiary of all the ITV companies. Mr Phillis denies there is an agenda at the BBC to cut specific numbers of staff jobs. But there is an agenda to improve efficiency. 'Unless the BBC is shown to be operating effectively and efficiently, and applying licence payers' money to what it does best, then it is properly going to be open to scrutiny and criticism,' he says. The journey to the heart of one of Britain's most significant institutions has been an unusual one - from a council estate in Croydon, south London. In retrospect, each step has equipped Mr Phillis to be a Mr Fix-it of broadcasting organisations. An interest in the communications industry and a fascination for pictures have linked his working life. 'When I was 15, I was staring into an illuminated glass screen, looking at images, looking at pictures and changing them, retouching them,' he says. His parents thought the greatest job security lay in Bob becoming a member of Slade, the society of lithographic artists, designers and process workers. He studied in his own time, won a scholarship to Nottingham University to study industrial economics as a 20-year-old 'mature student', and was supported by his wife Jean with the help of a weekly collection at his union branch. 'I have no regrets that I left school at 15,' he says. 'If I had stayed on at school I would probably have gone to university to read history.' He retains an interest in history, particularly of the first world war, and is a member of the Western Front Association, visiting battlefields like the Somme where the grandfather he was named after died. The first brush with the world of television came when he was pitching, as managing director of Sun Printers, for the printing contract for TV Times, the ITV listing magazine. Instead, he accepted the managing directorship of Independent Television Publications, the ITV company that published the magazine. It was still print, but it was print about television. In 1981 he accepted, after some misgivings, the managing directorship of the restructured Midlands ITV franchise created out of Lord Grade's ATV, which was to be a dual region with studios in Nottingham and Birmingham. 'The franchise had been awarded to a company that didn't have a name, that wasn't financed, didn't have a chief executive, didn't have a site for its second studio (in Nottingham), and which had to get rid of 49 per cent of its shares. I'm absolutely certain three or four industry figures were approached before me,' says Mr Phillis. Somehow the money was raised to get Central on the air. Mr Phillis says he is proud of the innovative programmes broadcast by his team there. In November 1986, Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, the expanding television services and programming company, poached him at just the right moment. Central's board had just turned down Mr Phillis's plans to take Central into satellite television. He left and became group managing director of Carlton, working on plans to bid for an ITV franchise. They eventually proved successful when the company won the London franchise and took over from Thames Television. After four years, Mr Phillis moved to ITN as chief executive. He denies reports of a rift with Mr Green and says he moved because he realised his job satisfaction lay in a different direction. 'Carlton is a great conglomerate but what gives me a buzz, a rush of adrenaline, is television,' he says. Mr Green believes his former colleague played an important role at Carlton in helping to manage the transition from a small to a medium-sized company. 'I think he is well equipped to understand the problems of the BBC and provide a commercial view and an understanding of the marketplace,' Mr Green says. For Mr Phillis the BBC looks like his ultimate destination rather than another staging post. The BBC Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996 and Mr Phillis has signed a five-year contract. After that he says he does not know what will happen to him. Already, however, there is speculation that he could follow Mr Birt. One letter of congratulation on his new job gave him particular pleasure. It was from Mr John Orford, the journeyman printer who looked after the young apprentice. It simply asked: who would have believed that 'the lithe, fit young man who cycled to work each day' would go so far?  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             PERSONAL FILE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1945 Born December.

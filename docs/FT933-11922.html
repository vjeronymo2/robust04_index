			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moulinex hit by European slowdown MOULINEX, one of France's largest manufacturers of kitchen appliances, stayed in the red during the first quarter of this year with a pro forma net loss of FFr16m (Dollars 2.7m), against FFr90m in the same period of last year. The group, burdened by heavy debts since the takeover two years ago of Krups, its German competitor, has been badly affected by the slowdown in the European electrical appliances market. The first-quarter loss follows the announcement earlier this year that Moulinex fell into a net loss of FFr115m in 1992 from net profits of FFr171m in 1991. Turnover rose by 4 per cent in the first quarter, but fell by 10 per cent to FFr1.83bn in the second quarter, producing a fall in sales of nearly 4 per cent to FFr3.69bn for the first half of 1993.</p>

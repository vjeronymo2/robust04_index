			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky by Martin </F> Kovacs; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Kovacs] How do you evaluate the chances of a  settlement in Bosnia in light of the agreement between the  Croats and Muslims yesterday?    [Jeszenszky] Well, unfortunately, one has to be cautious  because there have already been so many agreements in that  region in the past which have not been kept. However, I hope  that this will be adhered to, for it is of vital importance for  both parties. Since this very significant agreement has been  concluded after this tragic and bloody war, this indicates a  very serious political intention. Another element also has to  be emphasized in the agreement: the Croats and Muslims have also  agreed that they will not try to create two ethnically pure  Croat and Muslim Bosnias. The fact that the communities will  have cultural autonomy while the joint affairs of state will be  run together is a very good model.    [Kovacs] You had talks today with the U.S. defense secretary  and secretary of state. Did they ask you about the Hungarian  position regarding Yugoslavia? Did they ask for any kind of  explanation?    [Jeszenszky] No, they did not ask for any explanation and  there is no need for that. The Hungarian position was known to  them already. I did, however, use the opportunity to illuminate  Hungary's special position; that is, our closeness and to a  certain extent our vulnerability and the vulnerability of the  Hungarians of Vojvodina. Finally, the conclusion was that the  United States sees Hungary's special concerns, but it also sees  that Hungary has consistently pursued the policies of the past  three and a half years. Our policy in the Yugoslav question is  quite unequivocal: we support a settlement, we want peace, and  this peace should be the fairest possible. [passage omitted]    Hungary's foreign policy is balanced; Hungary gives  humanitarian aid to Vojvodina but also to the Serbs living  there. Hungary accepts Bosnian refugees and Hungary is forming  a new friendly relationship with Croatia, reviving traditions  going back centuries. We are confirming these with talks also.  I visited Belgrade in January and I am planning to visit Zagreb  and Sarajevo also in the near future. So Hungary is able to  form good relations with every one of the parties -- to varying  degrees, naturally -- and this is in accordance with the will  and expectations of the international community.    [Kovacs] Did you have an opportunity or was there a need to  talk about the AWACS planes using Hungary's air space?    [Jeszenszky] There were no need for talks about this. We are  in continuous contact with NATO and I know what kind of useful  information we receive from these planes. The planes' mandates  are unchanged. [passage omitted]    [Kovacs] The U.S. State Department has carried out its  annual  analysis of human rights in every country. This analysis also  contained critical elements in connection with Hungary. Did you  react to these critical elements? Did you discuss this at all?    [Jeszenszky] These were not mentioned and this itself  indicates that these critical elements are not serious enough to  create concern in the Government of the United States. As long  as this report is much less critical of Hungary than, let us  say, of Great Britain, I am not worried. Having said that,  there are certain points in this report which do not correspond  entirely to the situation in Hungary, or they are rather  one-sided, and we shall respond to these at the appropriate  level proving precisely the real situation, so we did not have  to discuss this issue at this level.</p>

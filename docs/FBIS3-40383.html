Employment followed suit, with an eight percent decline. New  layoffs should affect 10 percent of the personnel next year.    "The year 1994 will be still more difficult than last year."  While giving this warning, Amaury Halna du Fretay, president of  the GIFAS Equipment Group, is aware that the two leading  indicators of the future of his branch have stopped  deteriorating.    According to the new government, the defense equipment  budget, the famous Title 5, was increased by 5.7 percent, to  Fr103 billion. Although we could argue that this new budget  conceals a Fr5.5-billion carryover of last year's unused  appropriations and that, in substance, it is just barely stable  in current francs, we must acknowledge that, from this point of  view, France is treating her industry better than her neighbors  treat theirs. For instance, the British defense equipment budget  for the year 1993-1994 was cut by 3.7 percent, down to 9.9  billion pounds (Fr87 billion). As for Germany, its defense  budget has already been cut by 21 percent since 1991, and will  be cut by another 2.5 percent next year, dropping to 48.6  billion German marks [DM] (Fr168 billion). The German government  decided to cut back the Eurofighter-2000 budget to DM520 million  instead of the DM820 it had promised or the DM890 deemed  necessary by German manufacturers participating in the program.    The other indicator, that of the Airbus production rate, is  now stable. The European consortium maintains its 1994 forecast  at 12 units per month. Still, it would seem that this forecast  includes future (and therefore hypothetical) orders from the  Saudia airline.    Although the two main indicators of the branch seem to have  stopped their descent into the red, Amaury Halna du Fretay  promised "more layoffs, more employment adjustment plans, and  more companies filing for bankruptcy." This statement is  paradoxical only at first sight. Actually, the aircraft industry  is a long-cycle industry. Decisions made today will take several  years to bear fruit.    The government is fully aware of it: It submitted a higher  Title-5 budget and practically at the same time it announced  that the nuclear aircraft carrier and, later on, the Rafale  program, would be delayed by six months as a result of the  previous government's decision, made in early 1993, to stagger  budget appropriations. In addition, our neighbors' defense  budget cuts, far from causing French manufacturers to rejoice,  raise concerns for all programs carried out with European  cooperation.    Faced with all these uncertainties, the French aircraft  industry will therefore continue to shorten sails in 1994. This  trend, which has prevailed for three years now, already brought  about layoffs in excess of 20 percent at equipment manufacturers.    According to the results of our survey involving nearly all  French equipment manufacturers, it appears that overall sales  for the branch dropped another nine percent in 1993, i.e. 11  percent in real terms if we take inflation into account.  Employment followed suit, although it declined by only eight  percent. The two indicators differ because manufacturers had  recourse to partial unemployment and took measures to reduce  working hours; these now account for nearly five percent of  working hours.    New layoffs are still to be feared. A survey of its members  made by the GIFAS Equipment Group shows that layoffs should  affect another 10 percent of the personnel next year.  <H5>  From Partial Unemployment to Reduced Working Hours </H5>   Partial unemployment variously affects companies, depending  on their position in the regional economy and on the level of  knowhow that must absolutely be retained. In some cases, as at  ECE [Electrical Equipment and Engineering Company] in Niort,  partial unemployment this year amounted to the equivalent of  eight work weeks, which made it possible to maintain employment  at about 800 people, compared with 850 before the crisis began.    A sign that workloads will remain low for a long time is  that  a new form of partial unemployment is becoming quite common:  short-time work. The measure was adopted late in the year at  Sextant Avionics, Lucas Air Equipment, and Thomson-CSF. In the  first case, the agreement aims to avoid a third  employment-adjustment plan involving over 600 jobs. At Lucas Air  Equipment, 200 jobs were saved by a work-time reduction  equivalent to 49 days of partial unemployment. At Thomson-CSF,  1,200 layoffs were postponed.    These measures, however, are limited because, in the long  run, they tend to demotivate employees, lower productivity, and  lengthen cycles and lead times, as Jacques Barillot-Creuzet,  president of the GIFAS Equipment Group committee on PMEs and  PMIs [small to mid-size businesses and industries], explained in  the interview he gave us. One employer even told us that some of  his employees, who had problems after two years of reduced  wages, asked him straight out to end partial unemployment, even  if that meant layoffs.    The financial situation of equipment manufacturers is not  any  brighter than their employment situation. During the traditional  publication of the results of the branch, last May, Jean-Paul  Bechat, then president of the Equipment Group, recalled that the  140 companies belonging to his branch were practically all  operating in the red at the end of the previous year. Nothing  occurred in 1993 to reverse this trend.    Confusion is spreading among equipment manufacturers as they  receive conflicting signals from the government, prime  contractors, and the markets. Thus, when programs are staggered  they must reassess their capacities. When market volume is  reduced, competition gets stronger and forces them to try and  increase productivity, which unavoidably leads to new layoffs.  They are asked to reduce costs and at the same time they learn  that they will also have to shorten lead times significantly, as  required by Charles Bigot, the Arianespace CEO [chief executive  officer] who wishes to reduce his production costs by 23 or even  30 percent, and to shorten his production cycles by one third  before Ariane-5 is set into service.  <H5>  The Thorny Problem of Design and Engineering Financing </H5>   This confusion turns to griping where new programs are  concerned. In 1993, the first invitations to bid were issued for  the equipment of the European helicopter NH-90. When French  equipment manufacturers read the terms imposed for bidding, they  were bitterly surprised to learn that they would have to finance  at least 40 percent of their development costs. "A quite  abnormal situation," Amaury Halna du Fretay protested, demanding  that military programs be entirely financed by the State, as  they are in the United States.    In fact, how could equipment manufacturers make this  additional effort when their series production is so depressed  and when companies must bear the financial burden of the  employment-adjustment plans they started in the past two years?  Jean-Robert Martin, the Sextant Avionics CEO, is concerned by  the flight forward that might result if equipment manufacturers,  wishing to position themselves for the future at all costs, were  soon to face financial difficulties. "Are we trying hard enough  to reuse things that were already studied or invested in?," he  asked, adding: "If we want to continue launching many programs  with small production series, the solution may just be to  retrofit existing equipment."    The situation of aircraft equipment manufacturers is far  from  uniform throughout the branch. The eight major companies  (Thomson-CSF, Sextant, Messier-Bugatti, Dassault Electronics,  SAGEM-SAT [Company for General Applications of Electricity and  Mechanics-Telecommunications Company], Hispano-Suiza, SFIM  [Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company], and  Intertechnique), whose aerospace sales exceed Fr1 billion per  year, saw their 1992 sales in the sector increase by 4.3  percent. However, we should not trust appearances: Their growth  is essentially due to takeovers, and it reflects the first of  the consolidations that continued in 1993. Mid-size equipment  manufacturers (those with sales ranging from Fr100 million to  Fr1 billion) regressed by more than 10 percent. As for the  smaller ones (less than Fr100 million in sales), they saw their  invoiced sales drop by a clear 18.8 percent.  <H5>  Marriage of Convenience </H5>   Hurel-Dubois (Mixed Shipping Company) was the first one to  engage in a large-scale operation; during the last days of 1992,  it announced its alliance with the North-Irish Shorts company  (Bombardier group). The consolidated sales of the nacelle and  thrust-reverser activities of the two companies, which merged to  form the GEIE [European economic interest group] International  Nacelle Systems (INS), amount to some $180 million (over Fr1  billion). According to Jacques Marchand, the GEIE president, the  main responsibilities of INS will be to market and sell nacelle  systems as a single supplier, to coordinate the technical and  industrial activities of the two parent companies, and to  provide customer support. Relying on agreements signed before  its creation, INS just achieved a first success, after one year  of existence, when it signed an agreement with the Spanish  company Gamesa, covering the design, development, and production  of nacelles for the Allison GMA30007 engine that will equip the  EMB145 aircraft of the Brazilian company Embraer. Estimated  value of the contract: $170 million.    Another important player in the nacelle field is  Hispano-Suiza which created the Euronacelle company in September  1992, together with the Italian company Alenia; it announced its  intention to form a partnership with the U.S. company Grumman  for the specific purpose of working on the Eurofan nacelle.  That, Raymond Poggi, the French company's CEO, indicated, should  throw back into question Hispano-Suiza and Alenia's mode of  cooperation, without for all that breaking off relations between  the two companies.    Landing gears were not spared by the wave of partnerships  and  restructuring. Last June, Messier-Bugatti and its British  competitor Dowty (which recently joined the international group  TI) announced their desire to create a European landing-gear  pole. It was officially created on 2 December 1993 when SNECMA  [National Company for Aircraft Engine Study and Manufacturing]  and the TI group signed an agreement providing for the merger of  the landing-gear activities of their respective subsidiaries,  Messier-Bugatti and Dowty. If the creation of Messier-Dowty is  approved by the shareholders of both companies and by national  and community authorities, the new company will achieve close to  Fr2.5 billion in sales and it will control 41 percent of the  world landing-gear market.    In the middle of the summer, observers were alerted when  Sextant Avionics shares stopped being quoted on the stock  exchange. Thomson-CSF and Aerospatiale, the two largest  shareholders of the leading French avionics manufacturer, were  preparing a large-scale operation. Thomson-CSF acquired a  two-third controlling interest in Sextant, Aerospatiale retained  a blocking minority interest of 33.4 percent, and both want an  alliance between their subsidiary and the U.S. giant  AlliedSignal.    The joint venture is expected to be set up by the end of  this  year [1993]; it will join the civil avionics activities of  AlliedSignal and Sextant, in the civil and in the military  sector. It will boasts sales close to Fr8 billion. This  rapprochement follows an implacable logic. To ensure the  viability of its civil activities, Sextant must absolutely sell  to U.S. aircraft manufacturers, but it cannot do so because of  the Aerospatiale label it is stuck with. Bendix/King, the brand  under which AlliedSignal markets its avionics, is increasingly  edged out by its two U.S. competitors, Rockwell-Collins and  Honeywell, which both operate in the more buoyant cockpit and  tracking-system subsector.    As the year ends, a great name among simulator manufacturers  disappears. The English company Rediffusion, exhausted after  several restructuring plans that saw its personnel shrink from  3,000 to 1,400, is throwing in the towel. Thomson-CSF, which  already took over another English company (Link-Miles) in the  same sector three years ago, offered to take over Rediffusion.  If it can get the official authorizations required to do so,  Thomson-CSF will be able to increase its sale of simulators to  nearly Fr3 billion, becoming the second-ranking company  worldwide after the Canadian CAE, with a simulator catalog  covering the entire range of 100-seaters and larger aircraft of  the western world.    Alain Gomez, the Thomson-CSF CEO, keeps looking toward  England where his sonar-manufacturing partner, Ferranti, is  threatened with liquidation. GEC-Marconi, who wanted to take  over the last activities still controlled by this former jewel  of British high technology, gave up its plans when it met with  the fierce resistance of Ferranti shareholders; the company is  now totally bankrupt and was just placed in receivership.  Thomson-CSF, which enjoys a preemption right in the  Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems joint-venture, is also said to  consider an alliance in this field with GEC-Marconi. This would  result in the creation of a group with Fr4 billion in sales,  which would become the leading sonar manufacturer, ahead of IBM.    Mergers also multiplied in France. Early in February, MATRA  [Mechanics, Aviation, and Traction Company] merged its 50-50  MS2I [Matra-SEP Imaging and Information Science] subsidiary, the  champion of satellite-image processing, with Cap Sesa Defense, a  subsidiary of the Cap Gemini Sogeti group specialized in  information and command systems. The new company is called Matra  Cap Systems (MCS); it boasts sales worth Fr900 million and  expects to grow by five percent per year, buoyed by one of the  last defense market that are still developing: that of defense  and imagery data-processing systems.  <H5>  Market Shares Only </H5>   Edmond Marchegay, the Intertechnique CEO, relies on the war  chest he amassed already four years ago, when he sold his IN2  data-processing company. It already served to finance the  takeover of ECE in 1990. In 1993, Intertechnique took over  Ferma, a hyperdynamic small to mid-size voice-server  manufacturer that lacked equity capital. But Edmond Marchegay  will not stop there; he announced that he was considering taking  over three more companies. However, as a sign that the capacity  of the industrial base has really become too large compared with  aeronautical markets, this time Edmond Marchegay wants to take  over market shares only.    In September, SODERN [Nuclear Research and Development  Company], which belongs to the Philips group, also consolidated  its activities by taking over one of its suppliers of aerospace  optic systems, the Cerco company. According to its CEO, Henri  Dugre, the objective is to maintain SODERN, which was hard hit  by the slowdown of nuclear and space programs, at about its  ideal size, with sales of Fr270 million. This is a prerequisite  in order to preserve the future of this jewel of French high  technology, which exports its satellite attitude sensors even to  Japan.    In last year's special issue on equipment, we noted that a  takeover wave had shaken the United States: General Dynamics was  taken over by Lockheed; the electronic activities of GE merged  into Martin Marietta; LTV ended up belonging to Loral. This  year, as can be seen, the shock wave reached Europe.    All the same, you will note that, in adversity, large  companies are the ones which actively consolidate their  operations. Small companies seem to be on their guard and, as a  manager told us, still hope to hold out until the crisis kills  their weaker competitors. In this game, there will have to be  losers, and it looks as if some players have not yet taken the  full measure of the present crisis, which is here to stay.  <H3>  Interview With Mr. Jacques Barillot-Creuzet, President of  the GIFAS PME-PMI Committee: "Some PMEs Lost 50 Percent of Their  Sales" </H3>   [Dupont] Is employment hit harder in PMEs and PMIs than at  prime contractors?    [Barillot-Creuzet] It is difficult to give statistics  because  the PME base is highly diversified. But many of our members lost  40 to 50 percent of their sales in the past two years. Jobs  reflect that fact, even when companies try to preserve them and  maintain knowhow through partial unemployment. But this leads to  a demotivation of employees, lower productivity, and longer  cycles and lead times.    [Dupont] What efforts do you make, on export markets or  through diversification, to make up for the decline of domestic  markets?    [Barillot-Creuzet] PMEs have limited self-financing  capacities, which makes it difficult for them to diversify  successfully. They are often blamed for not taking advantage of  the prosperity of the late eighties to diversify. But you should  recall that at the time they were under such pressure to shorten  lead times and increase production rates that it was materially  impossible for them to turn to other markets. PMEs have reduced  chances on export markets because of the unavowed protectionism  practiced by all countries. In addition, the compensation  mechanisms included in the large contracts awarded to prime  contractors sometimes force the latter to take back products  that were developed by their French associates and entrust them  to foreign companies. Therefore, it takes a lot of financial  strength to obtain financing for all or part of development  costs or to generate openings on export markets.    [Dupont] What is your reaction to the present situation,  where support for R&amp;D occurs at the expense of series  contracts?    [Barillot-Creuzet] Only a very small part of R&amp;D  budgets goes  to PMEs. Unfortunately, that is a French practice. The United  States took advantage of their strong growth in the late  eighties to grade their base of subcontractors and small  equipment manufacturers according to whose knowhow was deemed  critical. Here, it was the crisis that eliminated the weakest.  We deplore the fact that there was no industrial logic behind  all that.    [Dupont] What do you think of state measures taken to limit  layoffs at prime contractors?    [Barillot-Creuzet] Clearly, these measures result in a  transfer of our jobs to prime contractors, as the latter take  back workloads. Actually, these measures just shift the problem  to make it less conspicuous, but probably at the expense of our  economic and eventually our social best interest.    [Dupont] What about the increased frequency of filings for  bankruptcies?    [Barillot-Creuzet] Some companies now view filing for  bankruptcy as a management method, with the sole objective of  maintaining their workloads by cutting prices. This sometimes  leads commercial courts, which are concerned about employment in  their regions, to liquidate all the debts of these companies in  order to encourage takeovers. That generates unfair competition,  which may lead to economic, industrial and social imbalances.</p>

			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The true believers still in thrall to Stalin's ghost: The veteran communists who can only wring their hands in anguish as their dreams and their country crumble around them FOR Grigori Khazanov, the past is suddenly a foreign country where things were done differently. Almost 80 and a Communist Party functionary for most of his life, his views are now deeply unfashionable. 'We believed, we believed in Stalin and in a shining future. We believed in progress.' Now, following the break-up of the Union, he and thousands of others find themselves in a land without history; a land stripped of the past they strove to create. They look back on 74 years of wasted endeavour. And amid the chaos of the disintegrating monolith, and in the face of market forces, the past has assumed a rose-tinted glow. It is easy to forget those who battled to build communism, to build a state in which the workers would be respected. Khazanov and his contemporaries regret not just their faded youth but also that of their country. For them a past perceived as radiant is counterposed by a bleak present. The vortex of decay in which the Russian economy is spiralling is a bitter hardship for the elderly. Communism's capitulation might offer new opportunities. But for those who lived through the Stalin revolution and the consequent social transformation, and who weathered the storm of Nazi invasion, it is the evaporation of a dream, of the beliefs of a lifetime. They now live off meagre pensions and represent an estranged element in society. 'Time will tell, the wheel will turn, we'll fight on,' says Khazanov, clinging to a faltering belief. Many elderly people mourn not only the demise of the Soviet Union but are also pained by the scorn poured on the years of Stalin. Many remain ardent Stalinists, though adoration of Stalin was a fraught compound of love and fear. Stalin's years were those of their prime. Appalling hardships there were, millions suffered and died under a cruelly oppressive system. But others prospered. This was a period of dramatic social mobility, when peasants' children became industrial managers or high-flying party functionaries. Above all there was idealism. People shared a common purpose. The society they had a role in building was lauded as a new stage of human civilisation, bestowing an aura of promise upon the period. Wartime triumph bolstered this. By 1945 the Soviet Union had emerged as a world power. Current events are a barbed disillusionment, piercing their hearts in old age. This forlorn generation present the most visible sign of a society in shock, although bewilderment at the rate and depth of change reaches far beyond it. After six years of Gorbachev and perestroika this is not a society only now throwing off the cobwebs of isolation. Outside influences have become increasingly apparent. But influence is not the same as a sea-change. The realignment of a society, from communism to the market, is a baffling experience for those caught within it. Assumptions ingrained since childhood, for old and young, are being overturned. Coming to terms with the break-up of the Union demands a psychological step of the imagination which is too great an emotional exertion for many in their twilight years. Victory in 1945 instilled a sense of worth in people like Khazanov, but this is now on the verge of crumbling: 'I am offended to tears, insulted that the young think it would have been better to lose the war, as if we would all be driving Mercedes now.' Khazanov's bitterness is not directed at the past, though he admits that Stalin made mistakes, but rather at those he labels the 'democratic usurpers,' in the driving seat since last August's failed coup. Incomprehension is common among Khazanov's generation. Words such as 'insult' and 'offence' have become common currency. Nikolai Rekhovskii, now 67 and going deaf but once a wartime bomber pilot, finds it hard to believe that everything has been given away. 'It is wild' he said. 'After the war we rebuilt everything in five or six years, and now it has taken only five or six years of perestroika to destroy it.' Like many others he wonders how a country overflowing with resources can be begging for aid. 'It is not as if we lived that much better before, but we weren't offended and we didn't feel resentment.' The economic strain of the post-war years was endured against a psychologically positive background. Progress was in the air and from the 1950s living standards clearly rose. But now the country's self confidence has been humbled. 'Everyone moans today, but things were far worse before' says Lev Karpov, a 67-year-old ex-infantryman. He recalls a pre-war adolescence in which he shared a four-room flat of 40 sq metres meters with 17 others. He and his brother had the kitchen table for a bed. He grins with childish zest as he looks at his two-roomed, 30 sq metre meters flat in which he lives with wife and daughter, and announces: 'This is progress.' Progress indeed, but Karpov's pride is laced with despondency: 'We thought it would be better and better, and it was. But its a nightmare now, chaos. I don't even know in which country I'm living. My heart boils when I think of the Union falling to pieces. I used to have a motherland, now I have nothing. It's a nightmare.' Nightmare, chaos, awful - the refrain of a generation left in shock. The sense of betrayal among wartime veterans is deep-rooted. In December, Moscow marked the 50th anniversary of its defence against German forces in 1941. The celebrations were intended to culminate with festivities in the central Manezh Square. But instead it produced an event of comic proportions which could only ridicule the cherished memory of victory. In the chilling cold, few people showed up. Vladimir Ponomarev, however, came from Ukraine to commemorate the victory in which he had fought as a teenager. The incongruity of the event was matched by its music. One moment a military band was blasting marching songs, the next a loud hailer boomed Tutti Frutti. With snow drifting past our eyes and Little Richard blaring out, Ponomarev commented: 'Business is for the young, not for me. I believed in socialism and I am too old to change. It is difficult to embrace what you were brought up to detest.' During the celebrations many veterans had gathered to reminisce. At a partisan meeting, 69-year-old Nikolai Toloraya took the podium to make an impromptu speech. He thundered: 'We are enduring a terrible tragedy in our motherland. We defended the capital of the Union, but what is happening now? How can we stand by and the let republics go, see our monuments torn down and our heroes abused?' The entire audience of 100 men and women, all of whom had fought behind German lines in the winter of 1941-42, gave him the loudest ovation of the day. Toloraya knows exactly where to point his finger to find the origin of the events which so dismay him. 'Perestroika and its ideology are guilty. Gorbachev and Yeltsin are to blame. They want to go back to capitalism, but we were brought up in the spirit of socialism, it's in our blood and we lived in harmony.' No acknowledgement is made of the extent to which this 'harmony' was born of dictatorship. Raised as a communist, Toloraya is quick to identify privatisation and price rises as the source of disharmony. For him, the flip side of enterprise is speculation. He was stunned to learn that students at Moscow State University are now selling party cards, once the symbol of loyalty and commitment, as a Dollars 10 souvenir to foreigners. Disillusion is more easily expressed than solutions are conceived. Stalin's iron fist retains attractions for many of the elderly - it represents a period of order when they knew where they stood. Piotr Khazarian, a diminutive man who shares a communal flat with an alcoholic whom he despises, emphasises this: 'Our generation respect Stalin. You knew that if you worked you would eat, and if you did not work, you wouldn't. We need that discipline now.' A pin-up nude hangs on his wall, but it is accompanied by Stalin's portrait, hanging as if in place of a crucifix above his bed. Stalin's continuing attraction among people such as Toloraya and Khazarian reveals a degree of schizophrenia common in many of this generation. It is a condition born of ambiguity and confusion. Their formative years under Stalin belong to a dark, repressive period, yet one of progress and idealism. Having spent two years in a labour camp in the early 1950s, Lev Karpov can still reflect: 'We lived a thousand times better under Stalin.' His bewilderment derives from seeing years of toil squandered. The sense that the rank and file have been deceived on an enormous scale, set adrift by historical events and by a leadership primarily concerned with its own comfort, is disorienting. Karpov lost ten members of his family at the front during the war. Like so many, with the Soviet Union no more, he now wonders what he fought for. That he cries when he hears war songs is reflective of the emotional resonance that the war still has. At a demonstration to condemn the break-up of the Union, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, a proto-fascist and the one political figure of any renown prepared to air the sense of loss this generation feels, led the 500-strong crowd in singing the popular wartime verse: 'Arise great land, Arise for the deadly battle, with the dark force of fascism, the accursed horde ..'</p>

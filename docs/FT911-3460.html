			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (America): Interest rate fears offset good first-quarter results Wall Street COMMENTS from the Federal Reserve chairman about interest rate policy took the shine off share prices yesterday after the market had opened firmer in the wake of some strong first-quarter company results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 2.73 at 2,930.45, and then only thanks to a last-minute spurt of buying. In the morning the index had been almost 18 points ahead, but steadily receded to stand down 11 points on balance at 3pm. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, finishing a marginal 0.81 up on the day at 381.76. The Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks held on to its gain more tenaciously to end 1.70 higher at 496.08. Turnover on the New York SE remained light, totalling 168m shares, while advancing issues only just kept ahead of declines by 829 to 777. News of a much larger than expected 6.2 per cent fall in factory orders of durable goods during March exerted a two-way pull on sentiment at the start of trading. While the figures illustrated the extent of industry's slump, they raised hopes that the Fed might reduce interest rates again to boost economic activity. Prices fell after Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, outlined his view to a Senate committee that the current level of inflation did not justify further cuts in interest rates. Among a string of companies reporting good first-quarter results, RJR Nabisco put on Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 on turnover of 3.8m shares. The tobacco and foods group announced its first quarterly profit, of Dollars 5m, since it was taken private in 1989 in the world's largest-ever takeover, via a Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out. The most improved results continued to come from the securities industry. Salomon rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 32 3/4 on revealing a doubling in first-quarter net income to a record Dollars 273m, and Morgan Stanley gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 87 3/8 on a 46 per cent climb in quarterly earnings to Dollars 120m. The banking sector featured after Fleet/Norstar, the Rhode Island banking group, won the race to buy the failed Bank of New England. The news lifted Fleet/Norstar Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 21 5/8 in active trading, but left Bank of Boston, which had been widely tipped as the winner, down Dollars 7/8 at Dollars 7 5/8 on turnover of 1.5m. BankAmerica, another possible buyer, put on Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 38 1/2 . Talley Industries eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 6 after the aerospace and consumer products company missed Dollars 1.1m in interest payments on two bond issues. Also lower was Bethlehem Steel, off Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 13 7/8 after reporting a deficit of Dollars 39m for the first quarter and warning of further losses to come. Square D advanced Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 81 1/8 on news that Schneider, the French group, said it was willing to discuss improving its Dollars 78 a share takeover offer. Canada TORONTO rallied in early trading but then lost momentum to leave the composite index a modest 10.8 ahead on the day at 3,502.4. Falls finally held a slight edge over rises, however, by 297 to 271. Volume amounted to a moderate 20.3m shares. Northern Telecom improved CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 38 3/4 in response to a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. Ipsco put on CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 23 3/4 on volume of 74,000 shares in anticipation of better first-quarter results, expected later that day. TransCanada Pipelines, up CDollars  1/8 at CDollars 17 1/4 , reported first-quarter earnings of 33 cents a share, little changed from the 32 cents of a year ago.</p>

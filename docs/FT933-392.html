			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / VW demands tough cuts at Seat SEAT, the loss-making Spanish automotive group, may have to sacrifice one of its three factories and more than a third of its workforce if it is to meet tough restructuring demands from its German parent, Volkswagen. This emerged yesterday after the VW group board rejected a provisional proposal, presented personally by Mr Juan Antonio Diaz Alvarez, Seat chairman. Mr Alvarez returned to Spain under orders to make the seriousness of the situation plain to his workers and to come back with a plan containing 'creative' rationalisation measures to restore Seat to profit, according to Mr Otto Ferdinand Wachs for VW. 'They have had DM1.5bn (Pounds 608m) this year. There is no more money for Seat at Volkswagen,' he said. Seat, which is heading for a DM1.25bn loss this year, was bailed out 10 days ago in an intra-group deal under which VW 'bought' the Spanish company's Pamplona factory and financial services business in return for the DM1.5bn cash injection. Mr Alvarez's initial proposal relied too much on hopes of future increases in volume sales said Mr Hans-Peter Blechinger of VW. 'They have to be able to break even without higher volumes. The idea is to reduce the break-even level. Then if demand does grow you make more profit, he said. Mr Alvarez's suggestion that the 23,000 workforce should be cut by 5,000 in the medium term is also believed to have been rejected as insufficient. Seat officials said in Barcelona that Seat's definitive plans were not due to be presented for two or three weeks. Although incomplete, these are understood to include the closure of Seat's Zona Franca works in Barcelona, the transfer of production and some of the workforce to a new plant at Martorell and the loss of 8,000 to 9,000 jobs. One reason given for Seat's deficit this year is the high cost of buying parts from Germany priced in D-Marks with devalued pesetas, By publicising the outcome of yesterday's board meeting VW appeared to be fuelling the atmosphere of crisis around Seat. The unconventional tactics also reflected the frustration of Mr Ferdinand Piech, the VW chairman, as well as his determination to drive through radical cost-cutting measures.</p>

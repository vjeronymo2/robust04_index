			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Oftel and BT rule outreferral of dispute to MMC BRITISH TELECOM and Oftel, the telecommunications industry regulator, have ruled out referring their dispute over a tighter price-control regime to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. An agreement ending the acrimonious row is expected later this week or early next week. The apparent solution contrasts with the situation in the gas industry. British Gas last week decided to seek an MMC referral after failing to agree with Ofgas, its regulator, over the rates of return on its pipeline and storage business. BT is still negotiating with Oftel over details of the new regime, but Mr Michael Hepher, managing director, yesterday said that a reference to the MMC was 'not the climate in which the discussions are being held'. The statement reflects a marked change in the stance of the telecommunications group, which had resisted strenuously proposals made by Oftel in June that it should cut the price of a basket of its main services in each year from 1993 to 1996 by 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation. At present, BT is required to reduce prices each year by 6.25 percentage points below the annual inflation rate. Oftel had also recommended that BT be required to publish separate accounts for its main businesses as a means of helping competitors get access to its network on fair terms. BT's unhappiness over the pricing scheme came to a head last week at the company's annual meeting, when Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, accused regulators of privatised industries of threatening their success and warned that BT would find it very difficult to accept the tighter price controls. For its part, Oftel had made it clear to BT that none of the main elements of the new regime was open to negotiation. Although the regulator had not changed its stance on that point, 'there is room for interpretation of one or two points', an Oftel representative said yesterday. These relate specifically to the separation of accounts, which, from BT's point of view, would mean making sensitive information available to competitors. 'The implementation of the account separation has to be discussed,' Oftel said. Resolution of the dispute could mean that BT would introduce substantial cuts in connection charges, as required by Oftel, this year, rather than continuing to increase connection charges.

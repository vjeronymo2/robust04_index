			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Offer Sinn Fein Cannot Refuse"] </F>   [Text] The amount of information about the Downing Street  declaration now in the public domain is enormous. Sinn Fein  cannot complain that the declaration has not been clarified. It  has been explained time and time again by political leaders in  Ireland and Britain.    Today, in the Irish News, British Prime Minister John Major  makes an impassioned plea to Sinn Fein to accept the declaration  as the basis for a settlement of the problems facing this  country. It is one of the most significant contributions to the  debate since the declaration was unveiled in London in December.    Mr Major is not alone in hoping the Sinn Fein ard fhets [as  published] will take a permanent and courageous step towards  democracy. The declaration has gained the support of the  overwhelming majority of people in Ireland and in Britain; and  it is seen as the basis for peace with honour in other countries  sympathetic to the Irish cause.    The thrust of the party's policies over the past decade  makes  the final step to full democracy inevitable, its leaders realise  that; now its members must accept that their party can only play  a full and vital role in Ireland when their policy direction  reaches its logical conclusion.    One of the most important paragraphs in Mr Major's article  is  addressed directly to Sinn Fein. He says:    "Sinn Fein claims not to understand the place of the  declaration in the `peace process'. There is nothing obscure  about this... The declaration is not a peace plan, it certainly  isn't a solution on its own. It is simply the view of the two  governments about the principles involved in a process leading  to an agreed outcome. Those central principles are democracy,  and an absence of coercion -- in other words consent, no outside  interference and an end to violence."    The message to Sinn Fein is clear. No agreed outcome has  been pre-ordained by either government; and, if it rejects  violence, it will be able to play a full and unfettered part in  the debate which leads to that agreed outcome.    Today's article by Mr Major is couched in the language of  friendship and reconciliation. And he does not shy away from  some of the key concerns of the Sinn Fein leadership. He is  blunt on the issue of what he means by exploratory talks.    In his January 8 interview with the IRISH NEWS Mr Adams  asked  for clarification on what the exploratory talks would involve.  He asked if it meant more than just a discussion with Sinn Fein  about how the IRA could hand over its weapons. Mr Major says  clearly today that these talks would be meaningful.    "We would be ready within three months of an end to violence  to begin an exploratory dialogue with Sinn Fein. Its aims would  be to discuss how Sinn Fein would become involved in the  three-stranded political talks, how they could be brought fully  into normal political life in Northern Ireland, and what the  consequences of ending violence would be... I believe this  amounts to a substantial exploratory agenda. Those exploratory  discussions would themselves be part of the process of bringing  Sinn Fein back into normal political life, in developing a  normal political dialogue between the government and other  parties, on matters like education, housing, health care, crime  and fair employment."    That is a clear and positive statement which should  encourage  Sinn Fein to become involved, Mr Major is not just offering  talks on a narrow agenda.    Mr Major has also been unambiguous about the meaning of  self-determination, as he sees it. He re-emphasises his  government's position that it has no "selfish, strategic or  economic interest in Northern Ireland", and he goes on to say:  "we would have no wish to frustrate the democratically expressed  wishes of the people."    The primary policy objective of the British government, he  says, is "to see peace, stability and reconciliation established  by agreement among all the people who inhabit the island."    Britain wants to encourage agreement -- agreement which  would  include an input from Sinn Fein if it enters the democratic  process fully. And he pledges to introduce any legislation  necessary to give effect to that agreement which "the people who  live in Ireland may themselves freely so determine without  external impediment."    No Sinn Fein president could disagree with his comment "it  is  not the government's job to tell the Irish people what they  should think or to dictate to them where their future should  lie."    Rightly, Mr Major has said that the political talks -- on  the  three-strand basis which protects Irish interests -- must  continue. The opportunity for Sinn Fein must continue. The  opportunity for Sinn Fein to become involved is there. And he  takes up the theme of partnership both within Ireland and  between the British and the Irish. This aspect is critical if  we are to copper-fasten any agreement with economic  regeneration; and is particularly important in the context of  the two nations' membership of the European Union.    Calling for an end to violence, Mr Major spells out the  consequences: "we shall in time be able to manage without  British soldiers in support of the RUC [Royal Ulster  Constabulary] and without emergency legislation"; greater  protection of civil rights; new institutions "reflecting the  common interests in the island"; and closer partnership.    He does not try to limit or dictate the scope of agreement.  "Whatever may be the shape of final agreement in the talks, it  will not be imposed on anyone. It will be the people who will  have decided."    His acknowledgement that "dreadful deeds have been done by  all" is generous, as is his regret. His plea that "our  generation must look to the future" is one which should be the  motivating force for all those capable of advancing the cause of  peace in Ireland.</p>

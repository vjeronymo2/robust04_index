			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 9 (XINHUA) -- The Taiwan Affairs  Office of the State Council published a speech here today to  mourn over the deaths of the victims of a boat-fire and express  condolences to the families of the deceased.    In all, 32 people, including 24 Taiwan tourists and eight  mainlanders, were killed in a pleasure-boat fire on March 31 on  Qiandao Lake in East China's Zhejiang Province.    The speech says that the State Council has shown great  concern over the accident, instructing the Zhejiang Provincial  Government to handle the accident properly and find out the  cause of the accident as soon as possible.    The Ministry of Public Security, State Tourism  Administration  and Zhejiang Province have surveyed the site and searched for  the remains of the victims.    The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits  (ARATS) of the mainland has passed on reports from Zhejiang  Province to the Straits Exchange Foundation of Taiwan.    At present, the cause of the fire is still under  investigation.    The office believes that Taiwan compatriots understand the  mainland's efforts and measures in handling the accident. It  hopes the Taiwan side would view the accident objectively and  soberly so as to prevent agitators from stirring up incidents  which may harm the relations across the straits.</p>

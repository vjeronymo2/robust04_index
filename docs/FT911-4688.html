			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: AT&amp;T reaffirms intention to pursue NCR takeover AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph reaffirmed its determination to acquire computer maker NCR at the AT&amp;T annual meeting in Chicago yesterday. Mr Robert Allen, AT&amp;T chairman, said, however, that the Dollars 110 per share sought by NCR 'is a price we're not willing to pay'. The proposed acquisition remains a key aspect of AT&amp;T's strategy, Mr Allen said. 'AT&amp;T is firmly committed to a strategy for growth. Leadership in telecommunications is no longer enough.' AT&amp;T must expand its presence in the market for networked computers, Mr Allen said. Networked computing has become 'a driving force behind the worldwide exchange of information', he noted. 'I want AT&amp;T to be a part of that business. This acquisition would make us the leader in network computing.' This month AT&amp;T succeeded in ousting four directors of NCR, the fifth-largest US computer manufacturer, including Mr Charles Exley, its chairman. AT&amp;T had tried to win control of NCR's 12-member board of directors as part of its hostile takeover bid. AT&amp;T originally offered to buy NCR for Dollars 90 per share but NCR responded with a request for Dollars 125. NCR dropped its request to Dollars 110 a share but AT&amp;T said it would be willing to offer Dollars 100 per share if NCR dropped its opposition to the bid. AT&amp;T has already spent Dollars 12m in legal fees on the takeover attempt, Mr Allen said. AT&amp;T also reported its first-quarter results yesterday. Earnings for the quarter rose 6.6 per cent to Dollars 712m, or 65 cents a share, from Dollars 668m, or 62 cents, in the first quarter of 1990. Revenues increased to Dollars 9.19bn from Dollars 8.9bn in the year-ago period. AT&amp;T's earnings were boosted by a one-time gain of Dollars 43m from the sale of 20 per cent of its Unix System Laboratories computer software subsidiary.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazil's mineral data point to fall in output PRELIMINARY government figures show a 2.8 per cent fall in the value of Brazilian mineral production last year, compared with 1990. However, mineral exports increased by 7 per cent during the year, according to the National Department of Mineral Production (DNPM). The overall decline, blamed partly on lower domestic demand due to the Brazilian recession, represents only the second time in a decade that production has fallen, said a DNPM official. The department estimated the total value of Brazilian mining production at roughly Dollars 10bn. The most important reductions were in the extraction of gold, iron ore, and tin. Among the minerals bucking the downward trend was bauxite, the ore from which aluminium is made. Gold output suffered primarily from a significant decrease in output from wildcat miners, known as garimpeiros, who extracted 55,525 kg, down 23 per cent. The reduction was explained by their high costs, which outdistanced the international price for the metal, and the depletion of the main garimpos (wildcat mines), Serra Pelada and Rio Madeira. Industrial production actually increased by 12 per cent, to 33,584 kg. The overall total of 89,109 kg was down from 101,727 kg in 1990. Tin production fell by 25.2 per cent, to 29,300 tonnes from 39,149 tonnes. Most of the total, 17,300 tonnes, was extracted from the Pitinga mine, run by the state-owned firm Paranapanema. Reduced garimpeiro production was also partly responsible for the reduced tin output. Iron ore registered a 1.5 per cent decline, to 149,986,000 tonnes from 152,256,900. The state-owned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, the world's leading exporter of iron ore, accounts for more than half of the country's production. It registered a 2.8 per cent drop in output.</p>

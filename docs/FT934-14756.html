			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Mitterrand to press Saudis on oil threats FRENCH President Francois Mitterrand, who generally declines to call himself a businessman, will have business very much on his mind when he arrives in Riyadh today for a one-day visit. With a French trade imbalance of nearly Dollars 1bn favouring Saudi Arabia in 1992, Mr Mitterrand will be promoting his country's goods, including Airbus and a wide array of military hardware. And, as one of the Saudis' chief allies in the Gulf war, Mr Mitterrand can expect an attentive hearing. Mr Mitterrand, who on Monday visits Yemen, Riyadh's main political rival on the Arabian peninsula, will wish to discuss with the Saudis their recent threats to French oil interests in Yemen. In May 1992 and again in August this year, Saudi Arabia sent letters to western oil companies in Yemen, including France's Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, warning them against operating along the border between the two countries, in dispute since 1934. Though most companies have ignored the warning, and continued their work, BP and Petro-Canada - citing purely geological reasons - have since relinquished their licences for exploration in the contested regions. Mr Mitterrand may also be concerned about a much more recent disruption of French oil interests in Yemen. In April Total, the French oil giant, declared a 12,000 b/d find at its concession in East Shabwa and, on the basis of other finds, may soon declare it commercially viable. But in early September, Total's drilling camp in East Shabwa was attacked. A Yemeni guard died and several others were wounded. Total has since suspended its operations at the site and there are worries among Yemenis that the company may withdraw altogether as a result of the attack. Total officials confirm temporary suspension of their work in East Shabwa, but deny they have any intention of invoking force majeur to end their operations in the country. While many people have blamed local tribes for the attack on Total, western security experts say the raid was untypical of Yemeni tribesmen. 'It was too well organised,' one security expert said, 'and not at all characteristic of Yemeni tribal tactics. The camp had been thoroughly reconnoitred, three armed men entered, knocked out the radio room, disabled the company's aeroplane, and retreated under covering fire from at least 40 men in the surrounding hills.' Tribal difficulties of a more typical kind took place in April when tribesmen kidnapped six Total employees at gunpoint to put pressure on the company into employing their kinsmen. The hostages were later released unharmed after Total agreed to provide the tribe with 85 jobs. Also typical was the experience of the Dallas-based Hunt oil company in July 1992 when tribesmen seized its general manager and six other workers to use as bargaining chips in a dispute with the Yemeni government. After peaceful negotiations, all seven were released. Mr Mitterrand will be concerned to have assurances from Riyadh that French oil interests in Yemen can proceed without any further Saudi threats or disturbances. On Monday Mr Mitterrand will become the first western head of state to visit Yemen since its parliamentary elections on April 27. Now seen as a potential model for democratic change in the region and a threat to the Saudi monarchy, Yemen will be looking for a political seal of approval from Mr Mitterrand. The degree of his approval, however, may well depend on the strength of assurances he receives in Riyadh.</p>

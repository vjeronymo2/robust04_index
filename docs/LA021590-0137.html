			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARBITRATOR AWARDS PADRES' SANTIAGO ONE-YEAR CONTRACT FOR $1.25 MILLION  </P> <P> Benito Santiago, the San Diego Padres' catcher who always told himself while  growing up that one day he'd escape the poverty of Jauca, Puerto Rico,  fulfilled his fantasy Wednesday.  </P> <P> He became a millionaire.  </P> <P> Santiago, who will turn 25 next month, was awarded a one-year contract for  $1.25 million by arbitrator Tom Roberts, the largest award in Padre history.  Santiago, who earned $310,000 plus $35,000 in incentives in 1989, had been  offered $750,000.  </P> <P> "You know, one day, I dreamed of this day," Santiago said. "It's a very special  day in my life. It means I've come a long way."  </P> <P> Agent Scott Boras demonstrated Santiago's value Tuesday in a four-hour hearing,  pointing out that his client and Hall of Famer Johnny Bench were the only  catchers in the past 25 years to win two Gold Gloves in their first three big  league seasons.

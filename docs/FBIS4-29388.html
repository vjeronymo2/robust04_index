			<p>BFN     [Text] Concerning the U.S.-proposed draft sanctions  resolution of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to deal with the  DPRK's suspected development of nuclear weapons, a government  official said: "Japan will be able to participate in the first  phase of sanctions without amending current laws." He thus  indicated the government is preparing for sanctions against  North Korea. However, if the UNSC fails to adopt the resolution  and if Japan, the United States, and South Korea should carry  out sanctions independently, Japan will be placed in a difficult  position over the issue of halting remittances to the DPRK, a  measure included in the second phase of sanctions.    Commenting on the U.S.-proposed resolution, a Foreign  Ministry official said on 16 June: "If the situation remains as  it is, less rigid (sanctions measures) will be adopted. Severer  measures are unlikely. Also, the United States will not call  for independent sanctions." He also indicated that unless  Pyongyang orders International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspectors to leave the country, or it begins procedures for its  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT),  sanctions will be moderate.    Even if the U.S.-proposed resolution is adopted, actual  sanctions would be carried out after a one-month grace period.  The sanctions would include a ban on arms export, and halting  UN economic and development assistance. Concerning a ban on all  air traffic except passenger flights, a Foreign Ministry source  said: "Chartered flights might be affected by the ban. As for  passenger flights, North Korea has not allowed them to fly into  the country since May last year. Only cargo planes carrying  matsutake mushrooms are allowed to stop by."    The second phase would include a freeze on sending  remittances to North Korea. To implement this measure, it is  necessary for Japan to revise the Foreign Exchange Law. Article  16 of the law stipulates that Japan can suspend remittances "if  it is necessary to faithfully fulfill the treaties and  international agreements Japan concluded." But the Finance  Ministry asserts that an agreement among only Japan, the United  States, and the ROK does not provide sufficient reason for  freezing remittances. It notes the need to have a UN  resolution, saying: "If it is impossible to revise the law, the  alternative to implement the freeze would be to have a UN  resolution."    The Foreign Exchange Law sets the limit of the amount of yen  to be carried by a traveler to North Korea at 5 million yen.  The Foreign Ministry has said it is possible to drastically  lower this limit, and to halt remittances to the DPRK through  Japanese financial institutions with the issuance of a ministry  notice. But without a UN resolution, people going to North  Korea via third countries, which do not participate in  sanctions, could thwart the special measure. Without a UN  resolution, sanctions would be less effective. This is the  reason why Japan is reluctant to stop remittances.</p>

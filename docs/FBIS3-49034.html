			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Milan Kucan by Miha Dj. Stamcar </F> and Jani Sever; place and date not given: "Every Story Must End  Sometime"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]  <H5>  Arms </H5>   [MLADINA] Following Slovenia's independence a war broke out  in Croatia and Bosnia, and Slovenia helped these two countries  with arms, too. Decisions were allegedly made at the sessions  of the Defense Council. What did you discuss at these sessions?    [Kucan] In the presidency and at the Defense Council  sessions we actually debated arms within three groups. First,  the seizure and purchase of arms for Slovene requirements. At  that time Slovenia had to prepare itself even for the most  extreme possible outcome. However, the presidency had nothing  to do with the purchase of arms. This was the responsibility of  the government.    Second, we discussed arms when Croatia was attacked. Even  before the war in Slovenia, [Defense and Interior] Ministers  Jansa and Bavcar at the meeting with their Croatian counterparts  wanted to sign a military alliance pact with the Croats. This  would have involved us deeper into the Croatian war and Dr. Plut  and Dr. Kmecl [presidency members] were both opposed to this.  When the war in Croatia started, the defense minister's  position was adopted that to assist Croatia was the best defense  of Slovenia. We all agreed with it. We also agreed with the  stance that Croatia should be helped with equipment and arms  held by Slovenia to the extent to which this aid would not  endanger Slovenia's defense capability.    When the war spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina, we decided to  help  Bosnia-Herzegovina with the same arguments and on the basis of  similar standpoints. Therefore, assistance yes, but on the  condition that the defense capability of Slovenia is not  endangered. Bearing in mind that at that time the situation in  Bosnia, which was not ready for the war, grew very strained, the  agreement to facilitate transport to Bosnia via Slovenia was  understandable.    The last time we discussed this was this January, when prior  to the formation of the new government Igor Bavcar, interior  minister at that time, briefly assessed the circumstances. He  said there were certain indications that an illegal arms trade  was going on via Slovenia that could not be controlled. A  debate then ensued whether to continue helping Bosnia as a  state, although it had practically disintegrated into three  parts, fighting among themselves. We adopted a position that  all forms of assistance with the exception of humanitarian aid  be stopped.    [MLADINA] From a distance it appears that matters became  complicated over the minutes of the Defense Council sessions,  which your office would not forward to the Defense Ministry, and  as a result of which for over six months the ministry would not  answer questions concerning arms from 27 deputies. The Defense  Ministry claims that on the basis of these minutes a line could  be drawn between state arms trade and illegal arms trade, in  which state officials were involved, and which the Airport  affair was all about. Why do you not simply send these minutes  to the Defense Ministry?    [Kucan] Of course, a little more honesty on the part of the  ministry would help the whole matter. All minutes and all  materials are stored and accessible to the authorized persons of  the Defense Ministry. A claim that the documents are not  available to the Defense Ministry and that the latter,  therefore, cannot prepare an answer for the State Chamber, does  not correspond to the truth.    [MLADINA] The difference is perhaps between being able to  see documents and studying them for some time.    [Kucan] I do not know why reading minutes in the Defense  Ministry would be any different from reading them in Erjavceva  [location of president's office]. The minutes are simply  minutes. Each institution has a duty to protect its archives.  There is no obstacle to prevent the documents being available  to the people from the ministry for as long as they need them.  When, for example, the criminal service of the Interior  Ministry requested to see documentation in connection with the  investigation of the Maribor airport arms affair, this was  always available and the ministry's representatives never  demanded to take it away. However, when the investigating judge  requested these documents according to official procedure, the  office acted the way it was obliged to according to the criminal  procedure law. All this is, therefore, sheer manipulation with  the public. The documents are available to the ministry.  However, another question is whether the ministry really wants  to study these documents in connection with the report for the  State Chamber. I also consulted the members of the presidency  about taking documents out of the office's archive, especially  in light of the increasingly widespread practice of misusing  highly classified documents, whose first victim was presidency  member Ciril Zlobec. Namely, all these minutes date from the  time of the presidency's mandate. All members agreed that the  documents should stay in the house.    [MLADINA] Could one on the basis of these minutes really  draw a line between the arms trade with and without the  government's blessing?    [Kucan] One can conclude from these minutes that a political  position was adopted that Croatia and Bosnia should be assisted  with equipment as well as arms that Slovenia had at its  disposal. One can also ascertain that a political decision that  Slovenia would purchase arms for anyone else and then sell them  was never made. One can determine who were the people in the  Defense Ministry that the Bosnia-Herzegovina representatives  should turn to regarding this.    [MLADINA] Also the representatives of Croatia?    [Kucan] For Croatia this was not envisaged as there were no  such problems. Because of the circumstances that emerged in  Bosnia, many people presenting themselves as plenipotentiaries  of the government or of various ministries were appearing in  Slovenia. This caused uncertainty in the Interior Ministry and  the Defense Ministry. Both ministries wanted the matters  concerning Bosnia to be clarified.  <H5>  Meeting with Izetbegovic </H5>   [MLADINA] The meeting of the Bosnian and the Slovene  delegations in Brdo in the summer of 1992 was also connected to  the aid to Bosnia. On that occasion you met with Izetbegovic.  What did you discuss?    [Kucan] This was happening when the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was in its initial, extreme phase. Just as  we were looking for support abroad -- moral and other -- during  the war in Slovenia, the Bosnians were also seeking help. In  this way separate meetings of the government delegations and a  meeting with President Izetbegovic took place in Brdo. The  minutes of it exist. Beside myself, Mr. Ivan Oman, Assembly  Vice President Vane Gosnik, Mr. Peter Tos from the Interior  Ministry, my foreign affairs' adviser Ida Mocivnik, and Marjan  Siftar, the chief of my cabinet at that time, also attended the  talks that were requested by Izetbegovic. We primarily spoke  about the general situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and whether  Slovenia could put in a good word for Bosnia-Herzegovina at the  diplomatic level and secure aid to this country.    [MLADINA] Did you use the term arms?    [Kucan] Of course. Izetbegovic primarily spoke about this,  saying, if I remember correctly, that the greatest problem was  shortage of ammunition. We have repeated our political stance  that we would assist as much as we could but that we could not  trade in arms for them, which he did not want anyway. We have  facilitated the shipments for Bosnia to travel through our  country, but we told Izetbegovic separately we hoped that he  would not misuse humanitarian cargoes for the shipment of arms,  because by this he would compromise us, himself, humanitarian  aid, and humanitarian organizations.    [MLADINA] How did you agree as to who will take care of  that?    [Kucan] Concrete decisions were the task of the government,  that is to say, the Defense Ministry and the Interior Ministry.  Minister Jansa appointed Mr. Lovsin as a contact person. How  the things went from there on I do not know. The presidency has  never received a report about this.  <H5>  Meeting With Cengic </H5>   [MLADINA] It is normal for presidents of two countries to  meet and discuss matters, but your meeting with Hasan Cengic is  much more obscure.    [Kucan] As I have already said, it was not only Hasan Cengic  who turned to me, but numerous other people who claimed that  they were Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiaries, bringing  messages from President Izetbegovic about the situation in  Bosnia and about whether we could intensify international  diplomatic activity to end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Among  others, Fikret Abdic, who was at that time a member of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, also came to visit me in this  role. Because there were several of these people, we demanded,  as I have already said, that they appoint an authorized  representative to Slovenia, and Izetbegovic's answer to that was  that Hasan Cengic was the man.    [MLADINA] Some believe that a man becomes a plenipotentiary  only when a country in which he is supposed to work has  acknowledged his credentials. Has Slovenia acknowledged the  status of plenipotentiary to any of the Bosnian representatives  who came here?    [Kucan] I informed the incumbent ministers that the Bosnians  proposed Hasan Cengic as the plenipotentiary. Whether he had  formal authority and whether he presented this to those in the  Defense and Interior Ministries with whom he discussed concrete  aid, I do not know. I myself did not demand this from him. I  have held talks with him twice. I told him to turn to Mr.  Lovsin, whom the [defense] minister had appointed as a contact  person. However, concerning the arms' affair in Maribor, we  have now received documents from Bosnia in which prime minister,  the defense ministry, and the president say that the Slovene  authorities knew that Cengic was the Bosnia-Herzegovina  plenipotentiary. To my knowledge, there are three documents  that officially confirm the identity of Hasan Cengic.    [MLADINA] You have said that three various Slovene state  organs have received documents confirming that Hasan Cengic was  Bosnia-Herzegovina plenipotentiary, however, the defense  minister maintains that Cengic was not authorized. Did the  minister see these three documents?    [Kucan] One was definitely addressed to the Defense Ministry  via the Interior Ministry. I myself received it from there.    Also, if they cooperated with Cengic earlier, that is to  say,  before the discovery of the arms, without asking him for his  authority, this means that they actually treated him as a  plenipotentiary. A document addressed to the Defense Minister,  referring to the meeting in September 1992, provides sufficient  illustration. Everything now is just a sheer pretense.    [MLADINA] You spoke of the meeting with Izetbegovic at which  you also discussed the arms assistance. There is a UN arms  embargo, however. You did not think that this could have had  consequences for Slovenia.    [Kucan] I remember how it was when we were attacked and how  frantically we needed and sought help. Also, how grateful I was  and will be to [former German Foreign] Minister Genscher for the  meeting in Villach and his immediate action, with which he  mobilized his colleagues in the European Community to intercede  to end the attack on Slovenia. This was my stance when the  question arose as to whether we would help Croatia and later  Bosnia. The embargo that was passed for the territory of the  whole of Yugoslavia was particularly unfair toward the Muslims,  because the Serbs nevertheless had contact with their hinterland  -- Serbia, they were getting arms from there, the Croats  similarly, although with greater difficulty, from Croatia, while  the Muslims could not get arms from anybody. I have spoken with  numerous people in the world and most of them openly agreed that  the arms embargo was unfair. Although I do not advocate war, I  know what it means to be attacked in a war and not have arms.  If I had to decide on it again, I would make the same decision  to assist. Much more than this aid, the world holds against us  the fact that we are now so passive toward the war in Bosnia, as  if this does not concern us even though the war is raging so  close.    [MLADINA] You, therefore, think that Slovenia is not active  enough in its attempts to resolve the crisis?    [Kucan] I do not think that we are the ones who can offer a  solution, however, I am not one of those who say that the  slightest involvement in this issue would drag us back into the  Balkans, of which we neither are nor wish to be a part. We  definitely have as many reasons for cooperation in finding a  solution for the Bosnian crisis as other European countries that  are further away from the crisis, and also the same share of  responsibility.  <H5>  Supervised President </H5>   [MLADINA] Before the Airport affair, you met with Miro  Predanic, agent of the Security Information Service, and later  with Vinko Beznik, chief of the Slovene special police troops.  How did you come meet with them and how did the Defense  Ministry find out about it?    [Kucan] In the interview for your weekly, Miro Predanic has  explained already the content of our talks. He had second  thoughts, though, about talking to me in my office. Because he  was high in the hierarchy of the Security Information Service,  he probably knew why. For me this was a sufficiently clear  warning.    I met with Mr. Beznik at my request. We discussed the  confusion surrounding his decoration. At the proposal of  Minister Bavcar, and with the agreement of his successor,  Minister Bizjak, Mr. Vinko Beznik was awarded with a decoration.  However, he was not supposed to receive it for the same reasons  for which Mr. Tone Krkovic [head of special brigade Moris] had  returned his decoration [sentence as published]. He explained  that this was not the case. Subsequently, I read in the paper  that Mr. Beznik was with me and how much time he spent with me.  It is, of course, no secret who visits the president. However,  it is interesting to note that somebody is supervising and even  keeping a log of how many minutes the talks and visits last. I  cannot imagine who would have the authority to do this.    [MLADINA] If this means supervision, it is obviously  analytically supported. Do you suspect any secret service?    [Kucan] I do not know whether secret services are involved,  however, they definitely do not have the authorization for such  a thing. For this reason, in light of the notorious letter by  the Civilian Initiative, I have demanded from the incumbent  organs that they ascertain whether the statements contained in  this anonymous letter are correct. Also, whether an organized  group of people exists in the Slovenia that is gathering  information about the functioning of the state organs,  individual offices, and individual citizens without  authorization. I am firmly convinced that a document like the  two anonymous letters [both by the Civilian Initiative] cannot  be written by one man alone, who would lack a database that can  be compiled only in an organized fashion. Who in the country is  in charge of this is known, although I believe that too many  institutions in Slovenia are responsible for keeping records of  personal data, and I am not referring merely to the intelligence  and security services.  <H5>  Presidential Visits </H5>   [MLADINA] Some politicians, not so much Jansa's circle but  more Peterle's circle, sport the theory that Slovenia, with a  president who is a member of the former [Communist] party, finds  it much more difficult to find partners abroad than it would  have had with somebody without such a past.    [Kucan] I would say that with imprudent partners Slovenia  will find it difficult to assert itself in the world of  intelligent partners. Today's world is no longer a world of  ideologies, but a world of knowledge, arguments, pragmatism, and  democracy. Contrary to some domestic politicians, the world  recognizes the outcome of the democratic elections. I would  also like to say, not without a reason, that I even get too many  invitations. The problem is that we have no planned priorities  as to how we should carry out these visits and what Slovenia can  expect from them.    [MLADINA] What sort of priority are you referring to?    [Kucan] Priority in the spheres of interest of Slovenia's  foreign policy. I agree with a commentary that I have read that  my visit to Albania was a lost opportunity. I have asked the  government for an opinion on the usefulness of this visit and  about who should accompany me. After this visit I see the  Slovene possibilities primarily in economic cooperation with  Albania. Albania expects this, too. At the beginning of next  year we plan to hold a meeting of a mixed Slovene-Albanian  economic commission, which will review the implementation of the  interstate economic cooperation agreement. There are, of  course, other decisions, too, for example, how great is our  interest in cooperation with Turkey, Israel, Russia, and so  forth.    [MLADINA] For the time being we have opted for the Czech  Republic and ultimately we are supposed to form a customs union  with it?    [Kucan] I believe that this is very important for Slovenia.  I have also received an invitation from the Czech Republic to  attend the spring meeting of all presidents of the Central  European states -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Slovenia.    [MLADINA] Whom will you take with you?    [Kucan] As usual, I will consult the government about this.    [MLADINA] The British Prime Minister Major invited  successful English managers with him on his trip to India, where  they were met by local people of similar standing.    [Kucan] When I travel where I was invited I will certainly  try to open doors for Slovene companies or support them in their  business pursuits. When Czech Prime Minister Mr. Klaus was  visiting, I introduced him at the dinner to the directors of the  Slovene companies that trade most with the Czech Republic and  gave him the opportunity to have talks with them.   <H5>    "Wild" Privatization </H5>   [MLADINA] Privatization has started in Slovenia and numerous  directors are accused of being red directors, that is to say,  Udbomafia people [connected to the former State Security  Service]. What are your ideas about the property reform?    [Kucan] To become the owner of social property in a company  is primarily the right of those who have managed it carefully  for decades, enlarged it, and sacrificed higher salaries for the  sake of investments, technological development, the conquest of  markets, the raising of ecological awareness, and training.  Regardless of the fact that social justice must be taken into  account, we must primarily strive to establish a situation that  will allow as much economic effectiveness as possible in the  implementation of the law. This is the basic goal of property  transformation.    However, if irregularities and abuses occur in this process,  that is to say, during the implementation of this law, then such  wrongdoings must first be proven and perpetrators subsequently  punished. It is the juridical organs and the prosecutor that  are responsible for this. Indiscriminate screaming about theft  contributes neither toward the effectiveness of the property  transformation process, nor to supervision and prevention of  anomalies, and above all, not toward legal security, which is  necessary for effective management. I would rather say that  such behavior helps to create unstable circumstances that would  suit the restructuring of the legitimate political power in  Slovenia and the creation of a front behind which lawlessness  could continue. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Kucan's People </H5>   [MLADINA] Do you have a lobby?    [Kucan] It has become very popular to speak about lobbies  recently. Not a single modern country functions without what is  in Slovenia now understood as a lobby, however, I do not myself  have a lobby.    Disregarding this, in every society an informal system of  acquaintances and connections exists that is based on mutual  trust and life experience. Actually, the only question is  whether the lobby system functions within the legal framework or  whether these acquaintances are being misused for illegal  activities. It would be good for Slovenia if we passed a law on  lobbying.    [MLADINA] Good. You do not have a lobby. So who are  "Kucan's people" then? At the end of the day, papers often also  publish names, and your men, who appear in the affairs  surrounding Safti, Smelt, and others, could simply be enumerated.    [Kucan] Following this logic numerous former and current  directors would be in my lobby, had I had one. Throughout the  years of my political activity I have met with and consulted  many of them. For example, about how the political situation in  Yugoslavia will develop and such matters that were important for  their development and business decisions. Quite a few of those  who, following this criteria, would be in my lobby are now in  other lobbies where they get much more useful and authentic  information about economic, financial, and also other issues, as  well as concrete party support. This does not seem unusual to  me. They cannot get this support from me. As regards the names  that you have mentioned, I would like to say that I only know  Mr. Cupin from Safti from my youth, when he was one of the  leading activists in the Slovene Youth Initiative in Trieste. I  have nothing to do with his business in Safti, regardless of the  latest affair and even allegations that I am Safti's owner.    [MLADINA] Did you ever meet with Igor Bavcar in Vodnikova  133, the headquarters of Adit, whose owner was also Safti?  Namely, Adit director Mr. Platovsek told the agents of the  military intelligence service so.    [Kucan] No, I did not know where this house was at all and  when I found out, I remembered that I passed it when I was still  living in Sisenska Street, when I went to Mostec with the  children. At that time there was a dunghill in front of that  house; it was a farm. The dunghill is gone but it obviously  still stinks there.    [MLADINA] What about all these statements of Platovsek?    [Kucan] I do not know what Mr. Platovsek said to the agents  of the VOMO [Military intelligence service]. What I have read  of what he said about me and Safti has no real basis of truth  whatsoever. I did not meet anyone and I did not forward  information to anyone. However, in connection with this I am  concerned that Mr. Platovsek said nothing about this to the  investigating judge, the criminal police, or the prosecutor, as  I deduce from the newspaper articles, but precisely to the  military intelligence service. This service is not responsible  for the disclosure of such actions as Mr. Platovsek speaks of.  If I am to believe the newspapers, once this service had  established what criminal activities Mr. Platovsek suspected  Safti of, they did not immediately call the police.    [MLADINA] Do you believe that this service is not properly  supervised?    [Kucan] In general I believe that the security-intelligence  and counterintelligence services need to be supervised and  directed by an authorized organ, in which the state's security  concept or the state's protection policy, as determined by the  parliament, should be embodied. This organ would at the same  time direct the work of these services and supervise them. It  cannot be left to the discretion of these services whether they  will inform anyone about important security and intelligence  information and whom they will inform if at all. Their duties  must be clearly determined by the law or on the basis of the  law, otherwise temptation will arise sooner or later and they  will be abused. It was only the presidency of the republic that  proposed the formation of a national security council during the  constitutional debate. [passage omitted]   <H5>    Electoral Promises </H5>   [MLADINA] You were elected president a year ago. From what  you promised the voters what did you in your opinion deliver?    [Kucan] I do not have great problems regarding this. My  slogan was: The work is not finished yet. The process of  political and economic reforms in Slovenia and the process of  Slovenia's integration in a modern society of peoples and  nations are not yet completed. The social policy and transition  into a post-industrial society are the components of this. I  believe that bearing in mind the circumstances, especially the  social situation, unemployment, and the uncertain future for the  young people, I would nowadays have an even stronger reason for  choosing the slogan I chose then.    [MLADINA] It was not an electoral promise, but the coalition  of the Liberal Democratic Party, the Slovene Christian  Democrats, and the United List was also one of your ideas. What  do you think of this coalition now and would you again advocate  such a coalition?    [Kucan] It is true that I favored such a coalition precisely  because of the recognition that the work was not yet over and  that we were entering a very demanding phase of the state's  regulation and its integration in the international sphere. I  was convinced that this would be much easier if the  responsibility for this were assumed by the three largest  political parties chosen at the elections and if they accepted  this as their principal goal.    [MLADINA] Did you have privatization in mind and the fact  that these three parties will also get the biggest piece of the  privatization cake?    [Kucan] No, but that they would, within the context I speak  of, assume responsibility for the formation of a concept and  take care of the legality of the property transformation  process. Therefore, that they would invest their efforts for  Slovenia and not primarily for their party interests, which are  otherwise perfectly legitimate. The coalition is functioning as  it is, that is to say, differently from what I expected. And  since you ask me whether I would favor such a coalition again,  my answer to you is yes, on the basis of the initial positions I  spoke of, and no, on the basis of current practice.    [MLADINA] And why not in practice?    [Kucan] You see yourself how the coalition functions.    [MLADINA] Did you hear that the cabinet looked completely  different 15 minutes prior to its proclamation, that is to say,  that a different defense minister was on the list?    [Kucan] They asked me for my opinion and I answered that I  advise the present minister. Whether this was decisive or not,  I do not know.    [MLADINA] Would you now change your mind and decide  differently.    [Kucan] Yes.    [MLADINA] Will you run for president again?    [Kucan] No.    [MLADINA] Why not?    [Kucan] Every story must end sometime.</p>

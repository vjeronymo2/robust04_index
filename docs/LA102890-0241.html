			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OWNER CRAMPED IN MANSION SAN MARINO CALLS PLENTY BIG  </P> <P> Maybe cost is no object, but that doesn't mean it's easy to "mansionize" a  mansion.  </P> <P> Just ask Kamal and Turkya Batniji, who for more than two years have battled  city officials over their request to expand their 10-room Orlando Road  residence, which already has 7,366 square feet of living space.  </P> <P> "My family and I have the right to live in comfort," said Batniji, a  50-year-old physician who wants to add two bedrooms, two bathrooms, an anteroom  and an interior stairway totaling 403 square feet.  </P> <P> But San Marino, California's 11th-wealthiest city, thinks the white stucco  Mediterranean residence is quite comfortable enough as it is.  </P> <P> The city Planning Commission has repeatedly turned down the couple's request  for a conditional-use permit needed to expand the house. In July, the City  Council upheld the commission's ruling and sent the matter back to the  commission, which in September denied the permit again. Now the Batnijis have  appealed once more.  </P> <P> Built by architect Wallace Neff in 1928, the Batnijis' house already exceeds  the maximum of 6,593 square feet of living space permitted for a house built  today in San Marino. In addition, at least one neighbor is against the proposed  expansion.  </P> <P> George Boone, who lives behind the Batnijis, on Aug. 15 wrote a letter to the  city protesting the proposed addition. He said it would mar the view from his  back-yard sculpture garden and devalue his property.  </P> <P> "We want to be good neighbors, but the integrity of the area should be  maintained," Boone said, praising the Planning Commission for soliciting  neighborhood comment.  </P> <P> "We get about four or five (home expansion requests) a year," said Herb  Worcester, the Planning Commission chairman. About 30% of the requests are  followed by letters from neighbors for or against, he said, adding: "In  Batniji's case, there were no letters for."  </P> <P> When Batniji first applied in 1988, city law allowed 8,193 square feet of  living space. But the addition was turned down because it would have "been an  overpowering structure, almost to the property line," Worcester said.  </P> <P> Then Batniji, with the help of city-recommended architect Robert Wood, scaled  down the size of the addition and redrew the plans.  </P> <P> But by then, the city ordinance had been changed to allow only 6,593 square  feet of living space.  </P> <P> Batniji's reworked application had so many changes in it that city officials  considered it a new request under the new law. However, City Atty. Steven  Dorsey noted that Batniji's earlier application could be considered in the  doctor's favor.  </P> <P> Like its gated neighbors on Orlando Road opposite the Huntington Library, Art  Collections and Botanical Gardens, the Batnijis' house occupies about three  quarters of an acre of land.  </P> <P> Set back from the street by a tiered Roman fountain in the center of a circular  drive, it has wide Gothic arches, intricate wrought-iron trim and a Romeo and  Juliet-style balcony suspended on all sides but one. In the rear, there's a  paddle tennis court and a waterfall added by the Batnijis behind the blue-tiled  swimming pool.  </P> <P> Architect Neff, who designed homes for Hollywood stars such as Mary Pickford,  Groucho Marx and Cary Grant, built the four-bedroom house for himself and his  family. The Batnijis bought it in 1978.  </P> <P> They say they need the extra space to accommodate their five children. The  house has four upstairs sleeping rooms, but the Batnijis maintain that only  three are proper bedrooms, complete with adjoining bathrooms.  </P> <P> They also want a guest room: "I can't put anyone to sleep in the library,"  Batniji said.  </P> <P> Homes in San Marino -- a city of 3.75 square miles with about 14,000  inhabitants -- range from about 1,300 square feet to more than 12,000,  according to local real estate agents, who say the Batnijis' house is  considered one of the city's larger residences.  </P> <P> In some other cities, the term mansionization has been used to describe  towering add-ons that allow once-modest homes to dwarf surrounding bungalows.  </P> <P> In San Marino, there are those who say the term does not quite fit the Batniji  case. Worcester, for instance, balks at calling it a case of mansionization  because "the house is already a mansion."  </P> <P> But Councilman Paul Crowley disagrees. "Mansionization means that the home is  built larger and more massive than before and then looks out of conformity with  the neighborhood," Crowley said. "The Planning Commission intends to protect  the rights of the neighbors, and it doesn't want to set a precedent (by  allowing such expansion)."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, as Batniji prepares for yet another appeal, he says the city was  against him from the start.  </P> <P> "If from Day One they told me, 'You cannot have this, you cannot have that,'  probably I would have decided, 'Well, either I will cancel the project or find  some other, bigger place to live in,' " he said.  </P></p>

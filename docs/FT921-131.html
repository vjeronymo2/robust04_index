			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: Mexico sells bank stake for 1,479bn pesos THE Mexican government has sold 69 per cent of Banco del Atlantico for 1,479bn pesos (Dollars 472m), equivalent to a record 5.2 times book value and 18 times last year's earn-ings. The privatisation brings the revenues from the 13 banks sold so far to 32,000bn pesos, considerably more than most analysts had expected. The money is being placed in a contingency fund which, barring unforeseen shortfalls in government revenues, will be used to clear the government's internal debt. Banco del Atlantico was sold to a group of private investors headed by Mr Alonso de Garay Gutierrez and Mr Jorge Rojas Mota Velasco, who are the principal shareholders in Mexico's second largest brokerage, Grupo Bursatil Mexicano. The price was 26,235 pesos per share. The Finance Ministry said the investors would shortly form a financial group in which they would put their bank and brokerage. The bank is Mexico's seventh largest, but its assets of 10,600bn pesos are just 2.6 per cent of the banking system's total. In 1991, profits increased by 34 per cent in real terms to 87bn pesos. The government plans to sell the country's five remaining banks by the middle of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korean People's Ideological Life Meeting Intrinsic Demand </F> of Social Man"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries an article explaining that the Korean people's  ideological life strictly meets the intrinsic demand of the  social man.    Our people is leading a true ideological life in a socialist  society centred on the popular masses, the article says, and  goes on:    Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of man  first of all because it makes all the members of society live  and develop as true human beings with independent ideology.    An ideological life assumes a class nature in all societies.    Socialism ensures the popular masses an ideological life  suited to the nature of the social man. In the socialist  society where the social and economic basis breeding outdated  idea has been destroyed and a class confrontation removed, the  ideological life of the people is based on the revolutionary  idea of the working class.    The ideological basis of our socialism is the chuche idea,  the greatest guiding idea of our era, and there is a  revolutionary ideological education system established by the  party in our country. So all the working people in our country  are being firmly prepared to be true people with independent  ideology and they fully enjoy a worthy life as master of their  destiny and the master of the state and society. Today our  people accept the chuche idea as their faith out of their vital  demand and devote all their energy and wisdom to the  consolidation and development of our style socialism, closely  united around the party and the leader. And the whole society  is overflowing with the noble communist trait of sharing the  destiny and bitters and sweets helping and leading each other  forward.    Our people's ideological life is suited to the nature of the  social man also because it is a precious life which makes all  the people truly glorify the noblest political integrity.    Man has socio-political life as well as physical life.  Physical life is a life of man as the organism of living thing  whereas the socio-political life is the life of man as a social  being. Man, a social being, holds socio-political life dearer  than physical life, and the true dignity and value of man lie in  having and glorifying socio-political life.    A man can live a life worthy of humanity with  socio-political  life only when he shares destiny with the socio-political  collective united organisationally and ideologically as its  member.    Ours is a socialist society of singlehearted unity in which  the leader, the party and the masses are linked together as a  socio-political organism sharing life and death. It is the true  look of the ideological life in our society that the entire  people absorb the idea of the leader as the nutriments of  political integrity and maintain blood ties with the  socio-political organism centering around the leader, embraced  in a political organisation.    Our socialism is vigorously advancing, flying high the  banner  victory in the grim ordeals of history, because the whole  society is definitely swayed by the noble revolutionary  consciousness and indomitable fighting spirit with which the  people never give up their political faith ind principle under  any circumstances and conditions but share the destiny with the  party and the leader, which way the wind may blow.</p>

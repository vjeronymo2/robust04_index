			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Leading Article: India's two years INDIA'S ECONOMIC progress in the two years since the government of Mr Narasimha Rao came into office has been impressive. For this, the prime minister, his minister of finance, Dr Manmohan Singh, and the officials who are pushing reform forward deserve both credit and support. Both of these were duly received at the meeting of aid donors in Paris at the end of last week, which pledged assistance worth US Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.9bn) for 1993-94. India contains nearly as many people as Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America together. The attempt to reconcile economic progress with democracy in so huge and poor a country has something heroic about it. Until recently, however, that heroism was not matched by common sense over economic policy. The trigger for change was a crisis. Two years ago India was on the brink of default. Decisive action at home, luck with the weather and strong support from abroad have brought a remarkable turnround. Foreign exchange reserves have increased from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 6 1/2 bn; annual consumer price inflation has fallen from a peak of 17 per cent to 6 per cent; the central government's fiscal deficit has been reduced from 8.4 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990-91 to the 4.7 per cent expected this year; overall economic growth, after dipping to 1.2 per cent in 1991-92, is expected to exceed 5 per cent again this year. Little wonder India is one of the IMF's models. Policymakers did not limit themselves to stabilisation. A 'big bang' reform was ruled out for political reasons. But a discussion paper released by the finance ministry at the end of last week stresses that what has happened so far represents the first two years of a five-year programme of market-oriented reform. Still to come, says the finance ministry, are further fiscal consolidation, completion of tax reform (including introduction of a VAT), further reductions in tariffs (which still peak at 85 per cent), further financial sector reform, improvements to infrastructure (notably power generation), reform of the oil sector and, not least, 'restructuring of weak and unviable enterprises'. This is good as far as it goes, but it does not yet go far enough. The government is not yet prepared to admit that both efficiency and the need for additional investment make wholesale privatisation inescapable. It has been unwilling to recognise that private employers will not hire people they are unable to fire. It has hardly begun to reform perhaps the most intractable of all problems, centre-state relations. India has far to go. But beginning a new departure is often the hardest part. Provided neither complacency nor instability set in, the chances for further reform and improved performance look excellent. The finance ministry talks of sustainable growth of 6 to 7 per cent. Six per cent is a minimum for a country like India. But 7 per cent need not be the ceiling.</p>

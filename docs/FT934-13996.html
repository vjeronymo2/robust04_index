			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Ewart falls into the red and passes dividend AN EXCEPTIONAL provision together with higher interest costs left Ewart, the Northern Ireland-based property developer, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 155,721 for the year to end-April. The exceptional item amounted to Pounds 279,377 and represented the cost of an extraordinary meeting. Interest charges took some Pounds 200,000 more at Pounds 949,493. Earnings per share fell to 0.44p (1.18p) and, like the interim, the final is also passed - last year a total of 0.75p was paid. Directors said the investment market was strengthening with demand outstripping supply of well covenanted properties in prime loc-ations. They considered the timing of the company's entry into the investment market in the UK to have been right and said properties acquired were performing well.</p>

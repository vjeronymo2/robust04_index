			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid today received 'Umar al-Muntasir,  secretary of the Libyan General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison "foreign minister."    After the meeting, al-Muntasir said they discussed the  Libyan-Western dispute and events in the Arab world,  particularly the Yemeni crisis and the Arab and international  efforts to end the fighting in that country.    Al-Muntasir added that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid informed him that  the nonaligned foreign ministers with whom he met on the  sidelines of the nonaligned conference voiced support for  Libya's stance on its dispute with the West, particularly as  Libya has been responsive to all international demands.    'Abd-al-Majid said the Arab League wishes to solve the  Libyan-Western dispute in an internationally legal framework  while at the same time safeguarding Libyan sovereignty.</p>

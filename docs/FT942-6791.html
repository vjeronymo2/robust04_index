			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Differences emerge on Anglo-Irish blueprint London and Dublin are at odds over whether the framework agreement they hope to complete for July's Anglo-Irish summit should contain an explicit commitment by Dublin to rescind its constitutional claim over Northern Ireland. Details of these differences emerged as Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, emphasised in a speech in Oxford that a settlement must win clear approval from the province's nationalists as well as its unionists. The two sides have made good progress on the document, which is designed to help forge a durable political settlement in the province by spurring political talks involving Ulster's main constitutional parties. But there are believed to be two potential sticking-points. The first concerns Dublin's move away from its claim on Ulster, and the other is over whether the agreement should set out a specific blueprint for Northern Ireland's future, as Dublin prefers, or simply provide a starting-point for new talks, as London wishes. Speaking just 24 hours after an informal meeting at Downing Street with Mr John Major, Mr Reynolds said that consent was needed by 'both traditions to a political framework that accommodates them both'. Just as Dublin had accepted that Irish unity could only come through consent, so unionists must accept that 'if Northern Ireland is for some time to come to remain under the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom . . . then they too must win the consent of northern nationalists to the democratic arrangements and structures under which this will happen'. He added: 'The total domination of one community by another is no longer acceptable as a basis for being governed.' Hinting that Dublin may adopt a tough stance in behind-the-scenes talks on the framework agreement, Mr Reynolds argued that the two governments' acceptance of the principle of consent had 'implications' for the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, as well as for Ireland's constitution. Though Dublin would support proposals for constitutional changes that 'fully reflect' the principle of consent in Northern Ireland, the Irish Supreme Court had already decided that the articles enshrining its territorial claim were 'fully compatible' with the country's obligation in international law. But Mr Reynolds combined his tough defence of the interests of northern nationalists with a strong condemnation of republican and loyalist violence. If violence continued, then Sinn Fein's quarrel would be 'not only with the British government but with the rest of the Irish people', he said. He called on unionists to tell loyalist paramilitaries that there was 'no valid excuse or justification for continued violence of any kind'.</p>

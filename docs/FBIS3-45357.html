			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong's powerful Liberal Party has completed a  survey which will determine Hong Kong's constitutional future by  guiding the crucial vote on Governor Chris Patten's partial  reform bill. The Liberal Party's Standing Committee yesterday  deferred until tomorrow the final decision which will determine  the success of Patten's bill. The party is considering opting  for a "free vote" which will clear it of adopting a firm stance  on political reform and allow an individual vote.    The fate of the constitutional package will be determined  after more discussions within the conservative party. The  government needs the vote of the Liberal Party's 15 legislators  to ensure the bill passes the Legislative Council. But the  party is deeply divided, with several legislators already  indicating they may vote against their party to oppose the  abolition of appointed seats for district boards.    The party has completed an independent survey of its  1,400-strong membership and several functional constituency  polls on the controversial proposals. Results were said to be  mixed, delaying any clear policy on the subject for a few days.    It was also revealed Liberal Party legislator Howard Young  could join colleague James Tien in opposing the abolition of  appointed seats. Young's surveys of his functional constituency  show support for appointed seats. Young said he would "weigh up  very carefully" the Liberal Party's final stance before a  decision was made. But if the party applied a "free vote" it is  likely he would oppose the abolition of appointed seats -- which  is a key part of Patten's package. He said a lot of people have  reservations about giving up appointed seats and he claimed  there was "great" regret in bringing the bill forward without  China's blessing. One survey indicated Young's constituency was  also opposed to lowering the voting age to 18.    Tien has indicated he would introduce an amendment opposing  the abolition no matter what his party decided. Under the  Liberal Party constitution appointed members are allowed to vote  against the party and support constituents' views.    Support for Patten's partial bill appears to be on the wane  in the Legislative Council after the breakdown in Sino-British  relations and future threats to the legislature after 1997.  Legislators say privately there is only 50 percent support for  the bill and success or failure hinges on the Liberal Party's  vote.    The Liberal Party said it would support the bill if  introduced with China's blessing. But last month it reserved a  decision until a membership opinion poll was carried out.  Liberal legislator Henry Tang said the party had to come up  with a more definitive answer to the problem.    The United Democrats indicated they would back the bill but  would amend it to include more democratic elections in 1995.  Independent legislator Eric Li is also set to introduce an  amendment opposing the abolition of appointed seats.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chris Louw] </F>   [Text] The debilitating power impasse of the nine new  provincial governments will continue until at least the end of  the month, when central government adopts a budget for the  financial year.    The nine provincial premiers, frustrated at the inability to  get their new governments up and running, can do little more  than prepare legislation pre-empting the transfer of powers and  functions they assume will be transferred to their provinces by  central government.    The provinces were also warned this week by the chairman of  the Commission on Provincial Government, Thozamile Botha, to  speedily begin finalising their budgets for the 1995/96  financial year. "It is already too late for them to submit  budgets for the current financial year," Botha told the MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN. "Even next year's budget has largely been prepared by  the previous government."    Botha said it normally took 18 months to prepare a budget.  However, he expected major revisions to the 1995/96 budget drawn  up by the De Klerk administration. Most of the changes will be  in order to accommodate the ANC's reconstruction and development  plan. The nine provincial premiers had a meeting in Cape Town  last week during which serious complaints were raised about  their inability to start governing.    Botha this week could offer the power-starved leaders --  seven from the ANC, one from Inkatha and one from the National  Party -- no immediate solace. He said it would take at least  five years, and probably longer, for the provincial governments  to be fully established in terms of the new constitution.    The premiers will have to accept that they will be almost  completely powerless until the national budget is passed by  parliament on June 22.    Botha advised them to start establishing Provincial Revenue  Funds and to pass an Appropriation Act allowing central  government to allocate funds to them.    Describing the situation as a "Catch 22", he said no funds  could be transferred to the provinces unless they had their  Revenue Funds in place. "As soon as possible, they should  establish full treasury departments. People with the necessary  expertise from the former bantustans and from the previous  provinces are available to assist with this task."    The matter is further complicated by the fact that none of  the nine provinces knows exactly what powers and functions it is  entitled to. They are expected to plan their budgets on the  basis of how they assume "on paper" their new governments will  function.    Botha advised the provinces to invent "prototypes" of what  they assume their new ministries and staff components will be  like, and to plan their budgets accordingly.    The final powers and functions of the various provinces will  be decided by Botha's commission -- but only after the provinces  have applied to "reclaim" functions from central government.  "This will not happen on day one," Botha warned. "It is a  process that will have to be approached step by step."    It was important, he said, that the necessary structures be  securely in place before functions were trnasferred from  existing provincial and homeland administrations to the new  provinces. "The integration will have to run concurrently with  the phasing out of the old administrations."    Provincial governments will only be possible once a  proclamation has been passed allowing President Nelson Mandela  to appoint an administrator responsible for functions belonging  to the provinces in terms of the constitution, but which some of  the economically weaker ones may be unable to assume.    Botha said he was aware of the frustrations of the premiers.  But he cautioned them to rather "start doing some of the basic  things now to ensure that their governments will run smoothly."    These included "less controversial" steps like the  establishment of management structures and ministerial task  forces to liaise with the administrator about the allocation of  functions.    They should also start establishing provincial public  service  commissions to assist them to take over the task of provincial  employers. Provincial standing committees should be put in  place as part of the mechanism of passing bills into law.    Botha said the premiers had to balance their political  ambitions with the administrative capabilities of their  provinces. "Money will follow the functions as soon as they are  reclaimed from central government."    Provinces would also have to accept that they would not be  able to plan outside the provincial budgets for this year.</p>

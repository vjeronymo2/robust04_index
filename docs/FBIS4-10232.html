			<p>BFN     [Text] The second plenum of the national committee of the  Health Workers Union has been held in this capital; $10 million  will be invested to provide sheets and uniforms to workers and  hospitals in Cuba. This was learned during the second plenum of  the national committee of the Health Workers Union, which also  came out in favor of preserving free health care services in all  specialized fields, including cosmetic surgery.    The suitability process among work group personnel will  begin, with serenity and maturity, said Ramon Crespo, secretary  general of the Health Workers Union, who guaranteed that the  administrations of all organizations will benefit from this  action.    It was determined that attention and motivation in regard to  night shift personnel could no longer be postponed. Havana  Province has a successful experiment underway in this connection.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We in the province  have developed and are continuing to develop a program of  sponsorship by large production centers, such as sugar mills,  cooperatives, Basic Cooperative Production Units, and cement  factories in the muncipalities where they exist, by which the  administration and political elements at those centers sponsor  and attend to our night shift workers, including medical  personnel on the night watch and others who work the graveyard  shift.    What does this involve? It involves providing dinner, an  afternoon snack, or some snack or cold drink in the late,  predawn, hours for those workers who are giving their best and  their all to comfort and care for our people. [end recording]    Cuba will be the site of the first international meeting of  health care union leaders, to be held in December, 1994.</p>

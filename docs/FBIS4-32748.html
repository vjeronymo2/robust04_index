			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Egon T. Lansky, journalist and political </F> analyst who served as Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry spokesman  and ambassador to the Council of Europe: "Understanding Our Own  Past, Forming Our Own Future"]    [Text] In the Czech press in mid-May I challenged the  stance of President Havel, who before a gathering of politicians  and intellectuals from home and abroad claimed that the Czech  state, and indeed all post-Communist states, were not  post-Communist anymore but full-fledged democracies like any  others.    My arguments were based mostly on our shortcomings regarding  rule of law, respect for the constitution, and suspected  economic crime, often in the upper echelons of political power.    The events surrounding May's annual congress of Sudeten  Germans (an ethnic group forcibly transferred from parts of  Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia shortly after World War II), along  with a few other international events, serve to remind us that  the problem has a foreign policy dimension as well. A democracy,  I believe, should be able to come to terms even with the nastier  parts of its own past.    The Sudeten German question is loaded with emotion on both  sides of the border. Sudeten Germans in the latter half of the  1930s massively supported Hitler, and demanded to join his  Reich, which they achieved through the Munich Agreement of  September 1938. That date marked the beginning of the end of  pre-war Czechoslovakia and, ultimately, of preparations for the  war.    The suffering this brought to millions of Czechs, Slovaks  and  Jews in this country has been neither forgotten nor compensated.  Czech victims of Nazism say they never received any reparations  for their suffering and loss of property. Sudeten Germans, too,  are demanding compensation and their right to a homeland, in  other words, the right to return to what is today the Czech  Republic.    Although the government of federal Czechoslovakia tried to  reject material claims from the German side (while raising some  claims on behalf of Czech victims of Nazi persecution), it did  admit moral wrongdoing in punishing the Sudeten Germans  collectively.    Current Czech officials, on the other hand, have been making  various noises about dialogue on an unspecified level (as  Premier Klaus suggested last year). And recently, in a rare  display of unity across the entire political spectrum, they flat  out rejected invitations to engage in dialogue made by the  Sudeten German spokesman, Mr. Neubauer. Mr. Klaus even called an  invitation to attend the Sudeten German congress a provocation.    Further underscoring the delicacy of the situation is the  fact that the guest of honor at that congress--to be presented  with the highest Sudeten German honor, the Charles Prize--was  Alois Mock, the foreign minister of neighboring Austria, whose  official speech was published in advance in the SUDETENDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG, a rather unimportant and militant German weekly.    Mr. Mock chose to speak of the suffering Sudeten Germans  experienced as a result of the forcible transfer, while ignoring  the suffering of Czechoslovak citizens under Hitler's  Germany--which indeed is not a very wise or tactful policy from  the foreign minister of a neighboring state. On top of it all,  he had the bad taste to quote Mr. Havel, who once equated the  transfer of Sudeten Germans after the war with "ethnic  cleansing" and was subjected to heavy criticism for it.    Poor Mr. Mock was criticized not only in Prague, but also at  home. Some Social Democrats in Austria even suggested that he  had confused the SUDETENDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG with the SUDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG and the Sudeten German Charles Prize with the European  prize of the same name, and they asked him to reconsider his  decision to accept the award.    So much for Mr. Mock. As for the Czechs, their irrational  attitude toward a less pleasant part of their own past clearly  shows that their thinking is far from free of totalitarian  influence. They simply cannot escape dialogue with an ethnic  group in the country of their mightiest neighbor, which, even  though it may not be very influential politically, is still big  enough to be able to bring the problem back every time it is  most uncomfortable for the Czechs. It will always be a matter of  Czech foreign policy as long as the Czechs themselves are not  able to form a rational attitude of their own to present to  their German neighbors.    The legacy of Czech-German relations is inescapable. If the  Czechs believe the demands of their counterparts (and the  Sudeten Germans are counterparts, like it or not) are arrogant  and/or wrong, it should be easy to refute them. But this issue  has a moral dimension that must be addressed too, a dimension  that is very much concerned with democracy and tolerance. As a  victim of the Holocaust myself, and knowing well the entire  complicated nature of own own German history, I cannot see any  justice being done by causing summary injustice to others.    By accepting the European code of human rights, we have  signed away the notion of collective guilt. We can still be  members of international democratic institutions without  practicing what we have signed, but in that case we won't be  true democrats.    Ultimately, this is not even a Czech-German problem, but a  purely Czech problem to be disposed of, and the sooner the  better. This is a Czech-Czech problem in the sense that it is  the duty of Czech politicians to introduce it and explain it to  citizens. But as long as the premier takes invitations to be  provocations, the efforts of people to turn their totalitarian  minds to democracy will be futile.</p>

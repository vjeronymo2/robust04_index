			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CLARK IS MAKING HIS DRIVE FOR SPOT IN PADRES' OUTFIELD  </P> <P> Jerald Clark, age 25, having spent four years in college and four more in  professional baseball, has already decided what he's going to do if he opens  this season as an outfielder with the Padres.  </P> <P> He's going to buy a car: his first.  </P> <P> "I don't care what kind of car," Clark said softly, the only way he says  anything. "Just as long as I can look on the salesman's contract and see my  name on it and know that it's mine."  </P> <P> First thing he will do in that car is go find Isiah and Phillip. Those are his  two brothers who also play pro baseball. They both have cars. They were both  first-round June draft picks in recent years and signed for bonuses of more  than $100,000 each.  </P> <P> When Jerald signed with the Padres as a 12th-round pick in 1985 out of tiny  Crockett, Tex., he was given just over $1,000. He immediately spent the money  on college tuition in case he wouldn't be good enough to make the minor  leagues.  </P> <P> "My brothers have nice cars, an Audi, a Mazda," Clark said. "You know how you  sometimes dream of something? I've always dreamed of just having my own car  like that."  </P> <P> Next thing he might do is drive to the Mervyn's department store in Las Vegas.  That was his most recent place of employment. He worked there this winter, in  home fashions, selling linens and housewares. At 6-feet-4, 190 pounds of tight  muscle, he was perhaps the biggest Afghan salesman in retail history.  </P> <P> "You get no bonus, and try to live just on minor league money; you have to get  a job," Clark said. "But it wasn't so bad. I bet you didn't know that 200  thread sheets are a little better than the 180 thread sheets."  </P> <P> Finally, while in Las Vegas, he will probably pull that car in front of the  Scandia Fun Center. There, amid the miniature golf course, video machines and  mini-car track, is where he worked on the batting swing that could change his  life.  </P> <P> "They have some batting cages there, 25 balls for $1.25, that's where I spent  my winter," Clark explained. "The pitching machines are old, so you never know  where the ball is going, so you have to be quick with the bat. We'd go down,  hit a few rounds, play a little golf, drive them fast cars and hit some more."  </P> <P> And today the "hit" is him. The unassuming man with the huge swing has become  the darling of this camp, playing and acting his way into the hearts of coaches  and teammates, most of whom before now had barely heard of him.  </P> <P>  Let's see, who are the candidates for the final outfield spot? Shawn Abner and  Shane Mack, right? Oh yeah, and maybe Thomas Howard.  </P> <P>  That was before. Now, when talking about the fifth outfielder, there is only  one name mentioned, and it is triple-A star Clark, who thus far has gone six  for 11 with four RBIs in a combination of three "A" and "B" games.  </P> <P> He isn't a great fielder. He doesn't always run smart. But the Padres say they  can fix those things. What Clark does, besides hit, is work and listen and work  some more until he's now got the Padre bosses believing one of their easiest  job this spring will be turning him into a big league outfielder.  </P> <P> "I go home at night after working with Jerald and think, 'Gee, if I could just  have 24 of him," coach Greg Riddoch said. "So many young people can learn from  him."  </P> <P> Clark's emergence and the demise of the trade talks with Atlanta for slugger  Dale Murphy have combined to make the Padre bosses even consider giving him  special attention. Look for Amos Otis, the Padre hitting coach and three-time  Gold Glove outfielder, to begin tutoring Clark on playing the outfield, an area  that still seems uncomfortable to the former Lamar (Tex.) University first  baseman.  </P> <P> "I'd much rather teach fielding to a guy who can hit than the other way  around," Otis said. "Jerald just needs to learn how to be quicker after the  ball, and we can teach that. He has good work habits, which makes it easier.  He's the kind of guy coaches love."  </P> <P> And the kind that teammates see and appreciate. While Clark was conducting his  first extended interview recently, he was approached by shortstop and captain  Garry Templeton.  </P> <P> "You get asked any funny questions now, you come tell me, and I'll take care of  it," Templeton said with a laugh.  </P> <P> "Thanks for your concern, Garry," Clark replied seriously.  </P> <P> He's serious, and low-key, about most things. This despite hitting better than  .300 in each of his four minor-league seasons, including .301 with nine homers  and 67 RBIs at Las Vegas.  </P> <P> "I've seen what baseball can do to you, I've realized what a blessing it is  just to be here," Clark said. "I know I'm no better than anybody else, probably  worse, because for the Padres to let me go, it wouldn't be any big deal. They  haven't invested any money in me anyway. This humbles you."  </P> <P> So does having two baseball-playing brothers. While infielder Isiah, 22, and  catcher Phillip, 20, are both younger, Clark has learned much from them.  </P> <P> Isiah was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round in 1984. But he  never panned out. He was traded to Oakland, released by Oakland, and recently  picked up by the Padres' minor-league operation, which will evaluate his  chances this spring.  </P> <P> Ironically, the year Isiah was drafted out of high school, Jerald was picked  out of college in the 27th round by the Dodgers and offered around $3,500.  Isiah felt so bad because of the differences in their bonus offers, "He told me  he would negotiate for more money and give me some," Jerald recalled sadly. "I  told him to keep it. Now, I'm the one taking him to dinner, giving him  equipment, doing things for him."  </P> <P> Phillip was drafted in the first round by Detroit in 1986, and has gone the  other direction. He was the Tigers' minor league Player of the Year while  catching for Class-A Lakeland last summer, and could advance as far as triple A  this season.  </P> <P> Along with oldest brother, John, the four Clarks used to do everything together  in their small Texas town, where their father, Jesse, is still one of the local  plumbers. They slept in the same room, crammed into the family's only bathroom  at the same time in the mornings and together learned to play baseball with old  milk cartons.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Jerald Clark didn't appear in the Padres' first spring defeat Tuesday, a 3-1  loss to Milwaukee, which dropped the team to 4-1. Another young Padre  outfielder, Randell Byers, blew a fourth-inning fly ball by LaVel Freeman that  first became a triple, then an instant later became the game's final run when  second baseman Joey Cora threw wildly on the relay to third base. None of the  young Padre outfielders have been impressive in the field this spring, which  led Manager Jack McKeon to observe, "It seems all anyone cares about these days  is hitting, hitting. To make this team, our backup outfielders are going to  have to be good fielders. We may need to do a little review on this." . . . The  loss, absorbed by Bruce Hurst who allowed three earned runs in four innings,  was harder to swallow because the Brewers' team had only one big-league  starter, designated-hitter Glenn Braggs. . . . The Padres also didn't look so  swell in the morning "B" game against the California Angels, as reliever Dave  Leiper allowed four consecutive hits with two out in the eighth to give the  Angels a 5-4 victory. Starter Greg Booker, vying for the right-handed stopper  role, looked good, allowing just two unearned runs in four innings.  </P></p>

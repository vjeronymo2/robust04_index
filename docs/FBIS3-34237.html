During these meetings,  they discussed support for the council, which so far does not  have a budget. Brussels recently hosted a seminar about the  future of democracy and growth in the post-peace age in the  Middle East in which a number of Palestinian figures  participated, including the Palestinian intellectual, Professor  Edward Sa'id.    During the seminar, our correspondent in Brussels Nur-al-Din  al-Faridi met with Antoine Zahlan, Palestinian economic expert  specializing in development affairs, and asked him how prepared  the Palestinian side is to develop the economy of the occupied  territories.    [Begin recording] [Zahlan] Many studies have been conducted  inside the occupied territories on numerous projects for  villages and towns in Palestine. All these studies were  prepared on different aspects. However, there were no funds to  implement the projects. Now many of these studies are being  looked at again, and the World Bank and EU have gathered this  information and are reviewing it. They are now making proposals  on financing the implementation of these projects. However, our  council so far does not have the appropriate bodies to study  these projects.    [Al-Faridi] What is the budget of the Council for  Construction and Development?    [Zahlan] Currently nothing, since we have not had any  assistance to start implementing it. Therefore, most of our  work comes from the contributions of individuals.    [Al-Faridi] Is it right for you to start discussing issues  of regional cooperation with Jordan and Egypt and some  transportation links with Israel, for example, while the  political agreement has not yet been implemented and the  promised international contributions have not arrived yet?    [Zahlan] With regard to the council, it is not holding any  negotiations with Israel for cooperation on its work. Its  speciality is to transfer international, Arab, and Palestinian  aid for specific goals that might serve Palestinian society and  help it integrate once again with its neighbors, the Arab  countries. Our duty is to reunite the Palestinian economy with  its neighbors. [end recording]</p>

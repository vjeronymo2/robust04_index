			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> BOND ISSUE IS BOON TO SENIOR HOUSING  </P> <P> A bond issue that will result in 20% of the units in a major senior-citizens  housing project being rented at reduced rates has been approved by the Garden  Grove Housing Authority.  </P> <P> The City Council, acting as the Housing Authority, last week approved a  $12-million bond issue to benefit the 178-unit Valley View Senior Villas  currently being constructed on the east side of Valley View Street south of  Chapman Avenue.  </P> <P> Greg Devereaux, the city's housing director, said that under governmental  guidelines 20% of the units (about 35) will be rented at reduced rates to  people earning 50% or less of the county median income.  </P> <P> Those units would cost $492 a month for one-bedroom apartments and $554 a month  for two-bedroom apartments. The balance of the units are expected to rent at a  monthly market rate of $635 for one-bedroom units and $875 for two-bedroom  units.  </P> <P> The bond issue allows the city Housing Authority to serve as a "pass-through"  financing vehicle, with the actual loan made by Wells Fargo Bank. The bond  issue also allows the developer to get a lower mortgage rate, according to  Devereaux, a rate he estimates at about 8.25%, two points lower than the market  rate. JIM TORTOLANO  </P></p>

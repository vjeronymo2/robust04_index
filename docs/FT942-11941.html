			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (2): Twilight of the monoliths - Chrystia Freeland and Virginia Marsh explain a two-sided economy Bucharest's monument to Nicolae Ceausescu's megalomania, the People's Palace, is so vast it is visible on satellite pictures. It devoured as much as 10 per cent of the country's GNP during the 1980s when many of Romania's 23m inhabitants lived in the dark after 10p. m. because electricity was rationed while average food consumption was among the lowest in Europe. Yet less than half a mile away from the People's Palace, and the socialist moonscape which surrounds it, once elegant pre-war buildings adorn narrow streets bustling with busy side-walk cafes and window shoppers cheerfully admiring high-heeled shoes and frilly skirts. The People's Palace and the re-emerging retail districts embody the two disparate sides of the Romanian economy, now locked in a struggle over the future of a country which has the potential to be the economic engine of the Balkans. On one hand, Romania is still a hostage of Ceausescu's particularly brutal brand of socialism, the most austere and centrally planned in Eastern Europe apart from Albania. Under Ceausescu, Romania pursued a particularly pig-headed version of socialist autarky. It focused on heavy industry, which rose to 59 per cent of industrial production, and the construction of the monolithic factories beloved by central planners. In 1990, factories employing more than 2,000 people accounted for nearly two thirds of the workforce. This legacy of unwieldy heavy industry, the sector which all post-communist countries have found most difficult to reform, means that in many ways Bucharest's economic dilemma bears more resemblance to the difficulties faced by the former Soviet republics to the east than those being resolved by the Visegrad countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland  -on Romania's western flank. In the four years since the fall of Ceausescu's regime, however, a private sector economy has emerged which now employs more than a quarter of the nation's labour force and dominates agriculture, traditionally Romania's mainstay. Since the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, Romania has returned to its historic place at the back of the East European pack. While neighbouring Hungary and nearby Poland and the Czech republic last year reduced their double digit inflation, Romania's prices rose to an annual inflation rate of 295 per cent. It was a sad relapse for a country that, in the immediate aftermath of the Ceausescu regime, established a framework for market reforms among the most impressive in Eastern Europe. 'Petre Roman's administration, the first government after the revolution, brought creative destruction. The second government, under Theodor Stolojan, introduced rigour,' explains Mr Dan Pascariu, head of a new Greek-Romanian bank, backed by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, launched last month. 'But the third, current administration of Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu brought stagnation,' he adds. The administrations led by Mr Roman and Mr Stolojan, which lasted until the September 1992 elections, privatised agricultural lands, began price liberalisation and introduced the legal framework for mass privatisation of Romania's 6,300 state enterprises. But the seeds of reform have lain fallow since the coalition of former communists and right wing nationalists was formed under Mr Vacaroiu's stewardship after the elections. Mass privatisation, vigorously pursued in Poland, the Czech republic and even Russia, has hardly begun in Romania. The government is still talking about establishing a stock exchange later this year. Macro-economic stabilisation, which appeared within grasp 18 months ago, was sabotaged by the government's failure to improve financial discipline on loss-making factories and to introduce positive interest rates. Frightened by the prospect of hyper-inflationary free-fall and hobbled by the refusal of the International Monetary Fund to extend new credits until Bucharest proved its ability to impose financial discipline, Romania now appears to have a second chance. The tight monetary policy pursued by the country's technically polished central bank over the past few months appears to be working. Interest rates, highly negative for much of 1993, are now determined by weekly credit auctions and are strongly positive. By mid-April short-term rates had risen to the equivalent of several hundred per cent annually. As a result, inflation fell sharply over the first quarter of 1994 to less than 7 per cent a month by March before a blip caused by higher domestic energy prices. The fierce squeeze on short-term interest rates has helped the central bank converge the official exchange rate with the black market rates, while rising exports have helped to boost reserves. This combination has helped create the pre-conditions for internal convertibility of the lei to move from the realm of theory to practical implementation. There is still a danger, however, that the blighted economy inherited from Ceausescu, and the slowness in implementing structural reforms at the micro level, could undermine the country's promising macro-economic stabilisation. The question Romania will face over the next few months - a local version of the issue which dominates all debates about reform in post-communist economies - is the extent to which a tough and successful macro-economic policy can overcome, or perhaps serve as a catalyst for, deeper structural reforms. The immediate outlook is fairly gloomy. At the heart of the problem is the manner in which loss-making state enterprises, dominated by heavy industry and the energy sector, have evaded the central bank's tight monetary policy by amassing enormous inter-enterprise arrears which are believed to exceed 4,200bn lei (Dollars 2.5bn), more than the entire budget expenditure in 1993. Prevented by positive interest rates from subsidising their inefficiency by borrowing money from the banks, large state enterprises have continued to conduct business as usual, with one exception. Instead of paying each other, they have become wrapped in an obscure web of inter-enterprise indebtedness. 'In normal countries bankers speak of M0, M1, M2 and M3,' moans Mr Razvan Temesan, the chairman of the Banca Romana de Comert Exterior. 'But here in Romania we have invented another category: 'M-question mark', representing the unquantifiable inter-enterprise arrears.' This increasingly shaky pyramid of inter-enterprise arrears will, within the next few months, compel Bucharest to address the tough question at the heart of market reforms. Will it bail out the loss-making giants, and shatter the country's fragile macro-economic stabilisation? Or will it allow the mountain of debt to come tumbling down, dragging with it spendthrift factories and risking high unemployment and social unrest? A report written by McKinsey, the management consultancy, in 1993 suggested that 130 enterprises were disproportionately responsible for most of the country's economic woes. Were the government to restructure forcefully or close down these monoliths, some of Romania's economic angst would dissolve. But systematically demolishing the heavy industrial structure would require a political will the nation's ex-communist leadership has yet to demonstrate. Even if, as seems likely, Romania's crippled industrial giants are allowed to continue lumbering along, the private sector is already beginning to come to the nation's rescue. Some of the most hopeful developments are in the countryside, where 80 per cent of land has been privatised, albeit in a chaotic fashion described elsewhere in this survey. The other point of light, or more precisely half a million points of light, is provided by the new businesses which have emerged since 1989. Although only 1 per cent of the state economy has been sold off under privatisation, Romania now boasts 500,000 private enterprises. The private sector will receive another boost if the government makes good on even a fraction of its promise to the IMF to privatise 2,000 companies by the end of 1994. Under the leadership of its new boss, Mr Constantin Dumitru, a communist era deputy minister, the State Ownership Fund, which currently owns 70 per cent of state enterprises and is responsible for selling it off, is gearing up for mass privatisation this year. If Mr Dumitru, who has shown he has the political muscle to coerce his erst-while colleagues, pulls off his ambitious plans, Romania's Stock Exchange will have something to trade. That would be a boon for a country which many insiders believe has vast, untapped capital resources. Lacking a better outlet, Romanians have poured their money into shady schemes such as the Caritas pyramid scam, which collapsed earlier this year, or have taken it abroad. Mass privatisation and the creation of a stock exchange would give them an opportunity to make legitimate investments in their own country, like their Polish and Czech confreres. Romania's nascent bourgeoisie is confident that, willy nilly, market reforms will take root in their country. 'Reforms will go ahead in the long run no matter what,' explains Mr Pascariu. 'We are in a narrow corridor and are being pushed forward, sometimes despite ourselves. There might be zig zags in our course, but our destination is clearly a market economy.'</p>

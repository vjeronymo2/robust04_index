			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wang Yong: "Swap Markets To Be Replaced </F> in April"]    [Text] The reform of China's foreign exchange control  system will be in full swing soon, which will ease the pooling  of enterprise financial resources.    Officials from the State Administration of Exchange Control  said yesterday that a national inter-bank foreign exchange  trading system was expected to be established around April,  replacing the old swap markets.    They spoke at a seminar in Beijing organized by the China  Association of Enterprises with Foreign Investment.    In general, enterprises will find it easier to obtain  foreign  exchange by going directly to banks instead of swap markets,  which have been based on the two-tiered foreign exchange rate  mechanism.    China unified foreign exchange rates in January at $1 to 8.7  yuan.    The impending inter-bank markets will use the single-rate  system.    Seven such markets will be established on a trial basis  toward the end of this month, the officials said.    But they did not say where the experimental markets would be  located.    "Enterprises, including those with foreign investment, will  find it easier to exchange between foreign currencies and the  renminbi yuan via banks," an official said.    For example, a newly-formed joint venture with foreign  investment can buy foreign currencies directly from banks if it  is approved by the State Administration of Exchange Control to  do so.    The approval yardstick is that the venture must be engaged  in  projects encouraged by the State Planning Committee, such as  power stations, railways and wharfs.    The bulk of these ventures' income will be in renminbi.    Also, foreign-invested leasing companies are allowed to  settle their business in foreign currencies, as an exception to  China's latest regulation ruling out such settlement starting  this year.    One official said the leasing companies can sign payment  contracts with domestic clients in foreign currencies to avert  possible losses from the fluctuation of foreign exchange rates.    China's leasing companies have complained in recent years  that limited access to foreign currencies has hurt their  business.    The officials also elaborated on new regulations that would  govern opening banking accounts and the capital movement of  foreign investment enterprises.    China will restrict such enterprises from remitting their  dividends and bonuses overseas if they fail to put in their  share of registered capital on time.    The action is in light of the continuous downward spiral of  the actual input of foreign capital over the past few years.    The actual input has accounted for less than 20 percent of  what was promised by foreign investors last year.    The figure compares to around 60 percent about a decade ago.    The officials also said that foreign investment enterprises  would be free to open banking accounts where they are located,  provided they have registered with the State Administration of  Exchange Control.    But they would face stricter inspection when it comes to  opening accounts in the other parts of China and overseas.</p>

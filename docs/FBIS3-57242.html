At Bishkek airport Kozyrev was met by Kyrgyz President Askar  Akayev, Prime Minister Tursunbek Chyngyshev and other officials.  This is the first foreign trip by the Russian foreign minister  in 1994.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS Kozyrev said that he has  delivered a personal message to Akayev from President Boris  Yeltsin in which he confirmed Russia's readiness to provide  assistance to Kyrgyzstan to further its reform.    In Bishkek Kozyrev is expected to meet with Kyrgyz leaders  to  discuss a wide range of issues concerning bilateral relations  between the two countries, prospects for the development of the  Commonwealth of Independent states and some aspects of regional  and international cooperation.    From Bishkek Kozyrev will fly to Blagoveshchensk,  administrative centre of the Amur region in the Russian Far  East, and then further to China where he will arrive on an  official visit later this week.</p>

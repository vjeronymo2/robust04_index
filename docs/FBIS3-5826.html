			<p>Language: <F P=105> Burmese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the United States Senate  decided on 2 February to establish Radio Free Asia which will  carry news and commentaries on developments in Asian countries,  including Myanmar [Burma], the PRC, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam.  In this connection, the director general of the Political  Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has  invited the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy and expressed  regret over the matter.    The director general said that there are countless public  and  private radio stations in Asia broadcasting 24 hours per day.  He said the latest developments on Myanmar are being reported  by Radio Burma and foreign broadcasting stations, including VOA,  and that they can be tuned in for 24 hours. Furthermore, those  interested can get news on Myanmar and international events from  the satellite service. Local people now have the right of  continuous access to both Myanmar and international news.  Therefore, the establishment of Radio Free Asia is not  necessary and it amounts to interference in the internal affairs  of Asian countries, including Myanmar. Such an attempt cannot  be viewed as a constructive contribution toward promoting  Myanmar-U.S. relations.</p>

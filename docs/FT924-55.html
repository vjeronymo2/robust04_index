			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Letter: Where coal presents an environmentally unacceptable face Sir, Although David Lascelles addressed a number of major issues on global pollution in his article, 'The grimy face of coal' (December 29), he failed to mention the very environmentally unacceptable face of coal which greatly affects local communities where coal is mined and used in the production of electricity. The Selby coalfield, 'the jewel in the crown' of British Coal, was granted planning permission in 1976. At that time it was stated that the 10m tonnes output of pure low sulphur coal would go straight to Aire Valley power stations without any visible coal stacks locally and no colliery waste would be produced. In reality, we now have a coal mountain of around 0.75m tonnes and a waste problem which could easily reach 3m tonnes per year, much of which may have to be disposed of locally. A planning application is expected early in the New Year to develop 400 acres of prime agricultural land adjacent to the one at South Kilford as a colliery waste disposal site. According to present estimates, this will only meet the needs of the Selby coal field for about 12 years. The planning application may be determined by the county council as Selby is not a unitary authority and local residents have real fears, as your article predicts, that environmental considerations will be secondary to the national energy policy and the privatisation the coal industry. The introduction of the Uniform Business Rate removes any financial advantage from coal mining to the local community which accrued under the old rating system. Selby then faces the environmental problem without any recompense flowing from the grant mechanism. No doubt your writer is correct when he states that, 'a balanced answer to the coal dilemma would have to include measures to make coal more environmentally acceptable'.

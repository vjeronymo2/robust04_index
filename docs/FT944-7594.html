			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Molyneaux urges Ulster jobs plan Mr James Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, yesterday urged the government to make the whole of Northern Ireland an enterprise zone in a move he said would have an immediate effect on jobs. He called on companies planning to attend next month's international investment forum in Belfast to consider placing Pounds 250,000 a year of new trade with Northern Ireland companies. He said the access of small and medium-sized companies to European Union funding should be improved. Mr Molyneaux warned MPs that there was still 'some way to go' in the peace process. He said Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, had 'not yet washed the bloodstains off the hands he now holds out to the world as a man of peace'. He added: 'The first step and only the first step has been taken by various paramilitary organisations.' In a sign of his influential role, Mr Molyneaux was watched by no fewer than five government ministers including Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Mr Molyneaux said his enterprise zone plan would 'create a dynamic economy driven by the private sector'. In another indication of the changing environment in the province, an Irish government official was yesterday among International Fund for Ireland representatives who appeared before the Commons Northern Ireland committee. It is thought to be the first time a Dublin civil servant has appeared before such a body. The fund, set up by the British and Irish governments to promote investment in the depressed economies of Northern Ireland and the border counties, could create up to 20,000 jobs over the next three or four years, Mr William McCarter, the fund's chairman, has said. The fund receives contributions from the US, the European Union, Canada and New Zealand.</p>

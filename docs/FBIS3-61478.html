Berezovskiy, Belarussian </F> State Polytechnic Academy; UDC 662.812]    [Abstract] The need to take into account random factors in  order to control the peat brick plant dryer operation more  effectively prompted the development of a computer simulation  technique for analyzing the material balance of the peat brick  plant. The model makes it possible to establish the effect of  the raw material moisture and ash content variance on the  specific peat rate per ton of bricks and identify reserves for  saving milling peat. The study also shows that the peat brick  plant output can be stabilized by computer-based automation of  the dryer operation. The formulae for computing the material  balance are derived. The effect of the raw material moisture and  ash content on the specific milling peat consumption and the  peat moisture content behavior in the Peko dryer are plotted.  The raw material, steam, and air consumption in the Peko dryer  is summarized. The control algorithm developed for the computer  and the devices which control the screw rotation speed and the  gate and fan position on the basis of the computer analysis and  a DZ-28 microcomputer-based unit used for stabilizing the dryer  operation are described. The use of computer simulation makes it  possible to lower the peat consumption and increase the plant  output while computer-based dryer control improves the product  quality, lowers the specific power consumption, and increases  the labor productivity. Publication of the article is approved  by the editorial board for consideration and implementation in  the industry. Figures 3; tables 1.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- The Bank of Latvia exchanges  the old Latvian rubles against lats until June 30 in its central  office and branch offices in Rezekne, Valmiera, Daugavpils,  Jelgava and Liepaja.    The central bank issued 28,510,345,000 Latvian rubles in  paper money, said the bank's spokesman Edzus Vejins. The  transition to the national currency, the lat, started March 5,  1993 when the first lats were introduced. The lat became the  only legal tender in Latvia on Oct. 18, 1993, but rubles are  still accepted for exchange.    Latvian residents kept 58.570 million rubles on April 1,  Vejins said. In June, the central bank exchanged 1,835,498  rubles.    The exchange rate is 1 lats against 200 Latvian rubles.</p>

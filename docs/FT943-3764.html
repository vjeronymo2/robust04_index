			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Finns agree EU farm terms An important hurdle in Finland's progress to membership of the European Union was cleared at the weekend when the country won EU backing for an improved deal on the sensitive issue of farm subsidies. The agreement means 56 per cent of Finnish agricultural land will be eligible for a new special category of subsidy for the special conditions in the far north, with the border set at the 62nd parallel. This is six percentage points more than the Commission originally proposed, but is less than the 64 per cent sought by Finland. Foreign minister Heikki Haavisto said it was a deal the country 'could live with', although Finland's central union of agricultural producers rejected the package as inadequate. Finnish support for the EU ahead of the referendum on October 16 has been falling in recent polls, partly because of concern about the impact of membership on farmers. The latest poll shows 38 per cent of Finns favour membership, with 31 per cent against and 31 per cent undecided.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOORE REGAINS FORM, WINS HIS 18TH FOR A'S  </P> <P> A month ago, Mike Moore appeared to be a cinch to win 20 games and the Oakland  Athletics appeared to be a cinch to win the American League West.  </P> <P> Moore, the hard-throwing right-hander the Athletics signed as a free agent last  winter, won his 16th game on Aug. 20. Moore had held the Minnesota Twins to  four hits in eight innings and had pitched the A's into a virtual tie for  first.  </P> <P> But Moore went into a slump, which is probably why the Athletics are still  trying to nail down their second consecutive division title.  </P> <P> Moore lost four of his next five decisions.  </P> <P> The slump ended Tuesday night at Cleveland and Moore, who lost 34 games in his  last two seasons at Seattle, still has a shot at 20 victories this season.  </P> <P> Moore held the Indians to two hits and an unearned run in a 5-1 victory that  enabled the Athletics to remain 2 1/2 games ahead of the Angels.  </P> <P> His control problems apparently ended, Moore walked only one. He lost his  shutout in the sixth when right fielder Jose Canseco dropped Felix Fermin's fly  ball for a two-base error. Fermin eventually scored on an error by second  baseman Tony Phillips.  </P> <P> Moore (18-10) set personal highs for victories and did not allow an earned run  for the 11th time in 33 starts this season.  </P> <P> "I decided I had been putting too much pressure on myself," Moore said. "I  pretended it was April. So, I went out and pitched the way I did in April. It  worked.  </P> <P> Canseco made up for his error by getting two hits, including a run-scoring  double in the fourth inning, and scored twice. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

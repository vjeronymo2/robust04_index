Once a practitioner or other person has elected the alternative notification option by returning the certification form to the OIG, his, her or its failure to follow through and fully comply with the notification requirements will be considered adversely at the time of his, her or its application for reinstatement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure that patient notification is enforced and provided in a timely manner so that patients are not at risk of receiving poor quality of care, we are soliciting comments on how best to enforce this provision. Under this proposed approach, when the OIG learns through patient complaints or other forms that the practitioner or other person has not fully complied, the IG at that point may additionally consider specific action to remedy the situation, such as pursuing penalties for the filing of a false statement. Comments on this alternative notice process and on whether this enforcement approach is reasonable and effective are specifically invited. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

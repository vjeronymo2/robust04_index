			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM to cut car production GENERAL Motors is being forced to cut production at its Belgian car assembly plant in Antwerp in the face of 'declining prospects' for new car sales in western Europe. The cutback, which is the first at any of GM's assembly plants in continental Europe, follows its move last week to reduce output at its Luton plant in the UK. GM said it would eliminate 13 production days during the first four months of 1993 at the Antwerp plant, which can produce 407,000 cars a year.</p>

On that morning, Gao Dezhan, secretary of the municipal  party  committee, Zheng Zhiying, member of the standing committee of  the municipal party committee, and Pan Yiqing, vice chairman of  the municipal people's congress standing committee, travelled to  a timepiece plant and held a forum with the plant leaders and  workers' representatives. Gao Dezhan attentively listened to  the enterprise production situation and asked in detail about  the income and housing of workers and the educational situation  of their children. Affected by some factors, such as the market,  this timepiece plant, which was once a major profit and tax  delivery plant of the municipality, experienced a slide in  economic returns and suffered losses for many years. The  enterprise leaders led the workers to deeply carry out reform,  worked hard, and enabled the plant to witness an upturn. The  average per capita income of workers rose from 2,200 yuan in  1991 to 3,400 yuan in 1993. In the form of chatting domestic  trivia, Gao Dezhan held cordial talks with the workers. He  said: We are pleased to hear that you have increased your  income. The Spring Festival will come soon. The municipal  party committee and the municipal government have been concerned  about the quality of life of the people throughout the  municipality, particularly those enterprises and workers with  temporary difficulties. Our purpose of coming here to see you  today is to manage this matter of prime importance to you and to  let the broad masses of workers across the municipality to have  ease of mind and spend the Spring Festival happily. Your plant  is an enterprise with difficulties, but it is an enterprise with  hopes which will have a favorable turn for the better. From  your experience, we have gained this enlightenment: Some  enterprises with temporary difficulties may have a turn for the  better, and may free themselves from difficulties, and  revitalize as long as their higher and lower levels make  concerted efforts and unceasingly deepen reform. During this  year, all enterprises should regard deepening reform as the main  task, do well in all aspects, and enable more enterprises to  vitalize and more workers to become prosperous. Gao Dezhan  said: Each and every enterprise, unit, and department, and all  sectors across the municipalities should consciously submit  themselves to and serve the overall situation of the whole  party's work. That is to seize the opportunity, deepen reform,  expand opening up, promote development, and maintain stability.  We must firmly foster the ideology of relying on reform to  promote development, correctly handle the relations of reform,  development, and stability, promote the practice of doing solid  work, speaking the truth, boosting enthusiasm for work, and  achieving actual results in an effort to maintain and promote a  sustained, speedy, and sound economic development, and social  and political stability and unity in our municipality.    Gao Dezhan said: Recently, Comrade Jiang Zemin and Li Peng  stressed repeatedly: "Things that have a bearing on the people's  basic life and immediate interests are major matters of prime  importance." Party committees and governments at all levels  across the municipality and all working departments should  conscientiously implement this directive, attach prime  importance to these major matters, pay close attention to  solving the issue on the immediate interests of the broad masses  of people with a high sense of responsibility and great energy,  and allow no carelessness or dereliction of duty of any kind.  At present, it is necessary to realistically attend to the work  of caring for the well-being and doing practical things for the  masses during the Spring Festival period and concentrate energy  on managing well all things we should manage. We should give  special care to the living of resigned and retired cadres,  workers, families of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen,  people enjoying government subsidies, urban and rural workers  with difficulties, households taking relief, and childless old  people and guarantee that no household will have great  difficulties in living. Around the Spring Festival period, we  should attend to the issue of "nonstaple foods," guarantee  market supply, strengthen price management, and stabilize the  market prices. Leading cadres at all levels should step up  efforts to make this work a success with a sense of great  responsibility and initiative. Leaders of departments,  localities, units, and enterprises that fail to do this work  well should be held responsible for the consequences and called  to account if problems arise.    Gao Dezhan also went to see Zhang Fenglin, a worker of  Tianjin Canvas Plant. Zhang Fenglin has been elected municipal  model worker for the third time. Serving as a lathe operator for  more than 20 years, he never took sick leave until he sprained  his back recently. Gao Dezhan held his hands firmly and said:  Our Tianjin's working class has made tremendous contributions  to the whole country and Tianjin's development. The party and  government will never forget you. The working class is the main  force in deepening reform and developing the economy. Model  workers are also the same. We should give them greater  attention and good care. Gao Dezhan hoped that Zhang Fenglin  would feel at ease while taking rest and nourishment to regain  his health and wished him a happy Spring Festival. Gao Dezan  urged the plant leaders to arrange work for Zhang Fenglin after  his recovery and take more care of his quality of life.    At 0900 in the morning, Mayor Zhang Lichang and Zhang  Guangwen, secretary general of the municipal government,  traveled to the municipal woolen sliver plant. As soon as they  got out of the car, they went directly to the workshop to visit  workers at the forefront of production. Zhang Lichang cordially  shook hands and held talks with the workers. He asked in detail  about their living conditions, particularly about the issuance  of their Spring Festival subsidies. On hearing an affirmative  rely, Zhang Lichang was very pleased and smiled. Zhang Lichang  also held a forum with the plant workers and directly listened  to their opinions about the municipal government. Zhang Lichang  said: Our party's fundamental purpose is to serve the people  wholeheartedly and the final aim is to improve the living  standards of the masses. Leading cadres at all levels should  always care for the hardships of the masses and unceasingly  enhance awareness in serving the people. In doing our work, we  should begin with caring for the living of the masses and end at  raising the masses' living standards. All our leading cadres  came from the masses. There is no reason for them to forget or  cut themselves off from the masses. They should always keep the  well-being of the massed in mind, speak for them, and support  them. Leading cadres at all levels, particularly enterprise  leading cadres, should emancipate the mind, change ideas, expand  the degree of reform, do a good job in enterprise grafting,  readjustment, and transformation, raise economic efficiency, and  improve their living standards. Enterprises running at half  capacity or brought to a standstill should use their brain, try  by all possible means to find work for their workers, guarantee  their basic income, let them feel ease of mind and have  enthusiasm for work, and make contributions to promoting  Tianjin's development.    On hearing that although the woolen sliver plant suffered  deficits, its workers still have an unyielding spirit, Zhang  Lichang praised them repeatedly and said: The Tianjin people  have the spirit of acknowledging their disparities but never  admitting that they have been defeated. The people of Tianjin  are not stupid and the level of cadres across the board are not  low. As long as we mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses,  Tianjin will have great hope in development.    Zhang Lichang also travelled to home of Xing Songshi, a  retired model worker of Dongfeng Building Materials Plant, to  give him a salute. He sincerely asked Xing Songshi about his  living conditions, income, health, and application for medical  expenses after his retirement. He said: Tianjin has a great  number of model workers who worked quietly and made  contributions at their ordinary posts. Although they have  retired, the party and the people will not forget them. Cadres  at all levels should show concern for and give them great care.  On hearing that Xing Songshi is not in good health, Zhang  Lichang said to him with great concern: You should see a doctor  quickly and take care of yourself. Executive Vice Mayor Li  Shenglin saluted workers at the state-run Tianjin printing and  dyeing plant. He said: Developing production, solving the  difficulties of workers, improving their living conditions, and  raising the living standards are our urgent tasks. We should  take advantage of this opportunity to send warmth to all  households, further mobilize all workers to follow the path of  reform, and urge them to improve themselves with their own  efforts. Li Shenglin also visited Ma Fengqian, a worker of  quartz watch plant with difficulties.</p>

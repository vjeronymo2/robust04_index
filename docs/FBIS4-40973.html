			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By KRIM-TASS correspondent Olga Semenova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- Allegations that Russia has leaked  enriched uranium suitable for the manufacture of nuclear weapons  have been decisively denied by Aleksandr Mikhaylov, head of the  Central Public Relations Service, in a conversation with a  KRIM-TASS correspondent at the Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service today. At the same time, he did not  rule out that there have been instances of radioactive  components being smuggled out. "Yes, such attempts have been  made, and we have informed the public that we have put a stop to  them," he said. "However, no enriched uranium or plutonium  (apparently used to manufacture arms) has been taken out of  Russia."    Asked about the possibility of a leakage from former Soviet  republics following the collapse of the USSR, none of the  participants in the conversation could be equally certain. The  KRIM-TASS correspondent requested a meeting with  counterintelligence nuclear experts in connection with the noise  raised by Western media around the false allegations that Russia  helped North Korea develop a nuclear bomb and that Russian  mafia-style groups have control over the nuclear potential of  Russia itself.    Regarding the apprehensions recently expressed by FBI  Director Louis Freeh that "nuclear materials can be smuggled out  of Russia into the United States for the purposes of terrorism"  or that in Russia's black market "components of nuclear weapons  and highly enriched nuclear materials suitable for the  manufacture of weapons are being offered for sale," the  counterintelligence experts said unanimously: "None of the  world's special services has detected any leakage of any  components used in the production of nuclear weapons. And even  Freeh himself could not cite any specific examples. We would  only thank anyone who could tell us specific facts, since this  is a matter directly affecting the security of our country."  "All these conjectures directly affect us counterintelligence  men. Indeed, the export of strategic uranium and plutonium and  also of nuclear components allegedly taking place cannot occur  behind the back of the Federal Counterintelligence Service," the  KRIM-TASS correspondent was told by a high-ranking official of  the Russian Federation's Federal Counterintelligence Service.  "Therefore, experts of the Federal Counterintelligence Service  have deemed it necessary to provide a few explanations."    "As for the problem of so-called assistance to North Korea  in  creating its own nuclear bomb, be it with technology or with  experts, various officials of our country have repeatedly  declared our loyalty to the international agreements.  Cooperation in this field has been conducted exclusively for  peaceful purposes and under the supervision of the International  Atomic Energy Authority [IAEA]," said an operational worker of  the Federal Counterintelligence Service who at the end of 1992  took part in measures to detain a group of Russian nuclear  experts trying to fly to North Korea. "Thus far we have  successfully thwarted all such attempts to `recruit' people with  secret information in the said field, making use of the  difficult economic situation of our country, and all attempts by  secret services, including those of North Korea, to extract  information from nuclear facilities and to steal nuclear  technologies."    "Summing up the conversation with experts from the Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Aleksandr Mikhaylov told the  KRIM-TASS correspondent that attempts to accuse Russia of being  incapable of controlling the nonproliferation of its nuclear  weapons, technology and materials are obviously being made in  pursuit of political aims. They are aimed at preparing public  opinion in the West for the idea of establishing political  control over Russian nuclear weapons."</p>

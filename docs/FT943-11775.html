			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructured Rubicon up 84% Rubicon Group, which in a series of acquisitions and sales has been transformed from a shop equipment business into a precision engineering group, yesterday reported an 84 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for the year to May 31. The increase, from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 2.25m, was achieved on turnover almost trebled from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 50m. Earnings per share came out at 9.1p (7.5p) and a recommended final dividend of 2.8p makes a total for the year of 4.6p (4p). The improvement was principally the result of a strong contribution from High Speed Production, a manufacturer of precision components and assemblies for the electronics industry, acquired for Pounds 9m in July last year. At the year end the shop equipment businesses were sold. These operations had been suffering from weak demand, directors said, and had incurred an operating loss of Pounds 160,000 (Pounds 1.17m profit) on turnover of Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 18.1m). At the same time the company had acquired Beeley Wood, a manufacturer of precision metal components and assemblies, for Pounds 4.8m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Thomas Dietl report: "Ericsson Leads the Patents League"] </F>   [Text] The telecommunications company Ericsson ranks number  one in DAGENS INDUSTRI's Patents Index for the last two  quarters. This is not surprising, since the company has  invested 10.9 billion kronor [SKr], i.e., 17 percent of its 1993  sales figures, in research and development. This result was not  beaten even by research-intensive pharmaceutical companies.    But Ericsson is not uncontested in the Swedish top league.  Sandvik AB performed best during the first three months of the  year. Sandvik has more published patents applications than any  other Swedish enterprise and this ensures the company a  continued strong position in future index ratings.    Ericsson has for some years maintained a clear strategy,  filing patent applications in a more active and well-prepared  manner. This is where Erling Blomme, the company's legal  executive, plays an important role. He is in charge of the way  the corporation handles its patents.    Erling Blomme maintains that since the 1980's Ericsson has  been placing an increasing emphasis on protecting itself through  patents. The results show in a gradual increase of the number of  patents granted. In the first index published by DAGENS  INDUSTRI in October 1993, Ericsson scored 22 patents granted.  By the next quarter, this figure had grown to 27. The latest  patent index shows 28 patents between October 1993 and the end  of March 1994.    Japanese telecommunications companies have not caused  Ericsson any problems in the area of patents. The Japanese are  known for their "lightning-fast" action to secure important key  patents by patenting all surrounding applications. But these  obstructive patents make it impossible for the original  constructor to apply his design without infringing his own  patent infringements.    "On the other hand, we have become aware of new operators in  the West," Erling Blomme said.    "For instance, there are U.S. companies with a patents  portfolio as their only asset and source of income."    The U.S. telecommunications company AT&amp;T ran into  difficulties with a "patents company" that attacked all  telephone exchange suppliers on the U.S. market, including  Ericsson, which got its share of problems. The patents company  succeeded in obtaining a SKr280-million settlement from AT&amp;T  the  first time the issue went to court.    Last fall Ericsson was summoned to court in the United  States  by the U.S. telecommunications company IDC. The U.S. company  alleged that Ericsson had, among other things, violated an  important subpatent within the new digital standard for mobile  telecommunications. Ericsson responded with a countersummons,  claiming that the patents of IDC are invalid.    "We have managed quite well on the U.S. market so far,"  Erling Blomme said.</p>

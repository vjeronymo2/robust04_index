			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Letter: The right way to learn maths Sir, Maths teaching today is more than just adding up numbers. I think someone may have pushed Mr Ripley's prejudice button (Letters, June 17). My wife, who is a maths teacher, observes that over the last 10 years the highest priority has been to teach children to understand how numbers work. She regrets that there are those, mostly in the private sector, who still hammer formulae into their pupils. In most cases learning by rote or learning 'tricks' can still produce the results without understanding and after all, that's the way they were always taught] T P W Dowlen, Hollybank House, Hook Heath Avenue, Woking, Surrey GU22 0HN</p>

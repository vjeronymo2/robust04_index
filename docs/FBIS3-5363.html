The statement pungently denounced the moves of the traitor  Kim Yong-sam in seeking dependence, fascism, nuclear war and  permanent division, not independence and democracy, peace and  reunification, as unpardonable criminal acts challenging the  aspiration of the South Korean people and the trend of the times.    "We will stand firmly on the side of Hanminjon and the South  Korean people who are intensifying the movement for the  overthrow of the Kim Yong-sam regime, expulsion of the U.S  Forces and reunification, upholding `10-point programme of the  great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the  country' and extend positive support and solidarity for their  cause of independence, democracy and reunification," the  statement said.</p>

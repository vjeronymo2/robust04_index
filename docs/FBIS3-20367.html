			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Romantschuck: "Left Alliance and Communist </F> Unity Party Separate: `An Important Day for Finnish Left'"]    [Excerpt] The Left Alliance [VL] and Unity Communists  [SKP-Y] have jointly decided that activity for these two will  continue as two separate parties.    "We are not going to involve ourselves in each others'  internal affairs," said VL general secretary Matti Viialainen  after the decision was reached yesterday. "This is an important  day for the Finnish left."    SKP-Y Chairman Yrjo Hakanen thought that the two parties  actually "didn't apply for a divorce," but rather are  strengthening their cooperation in the fight against mass  unemployment and for maintaining the welfare society.    Yesterday's decision means that leadership of the SKP-Y quit  the VL. The 14 district organizations of the SKP-Y are to later  also leave the VF.    The 19-person parliament delegation will continue its  activity as before, despite the fact that within it there are  some who are regarded as close to the SKP-Y. These four are  Marjatta Stenius-Kaukonen, Ensio Laine, Esko-Juhani Tennila, and  Jaakko Laakso. SKP-Y Chairman Hakanen said he does not consider  any MP as "his own."    How the two parties will continue cooperation -- which now  is  to be normalized -- is still not clear. No decision on campaign  cooperation in the parliamentary elections has yet been reached.  SKP-Y, which in continuing the activity of the [former] SKP,  does not intend to enter the election with its own lists. VL  again expects to have also nonmembers on its candidate lists.  <H5>  Double Membership Restricted </H5>   Viialainen has worked to get SKP-Y members and district  organizations excluded from the VL ever since the foundation of  VL four years ago. To achieve the goal, the Alliance's party  rules are to be amended to allow prohibiting double membership.  Now this amending will not be needed, since the agreement  satisfactorily resolves this issue. Paragraph 7 [of the  agreement] was written so that a member participating in acts  harming the party can be expelled. [passage omitted]</p>

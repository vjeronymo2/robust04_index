			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Ethics code for NHS boards proposed BOARD MEMBERS of the National Health Service are likely to become subject to a code of ethics and business behaviour within the next few months, Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive, said yesterday. In June Sir Duncan set up a task force to examine accountability and probity issues after serious managerial failings in the Wessex and West Midlands regional health authorities. He told a National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts conference in London yesterday that the proposed national ethical code would be one of the likely outcomes. Another probable result of the task force's work will be a register of interests for chairmen, board members and directors of health authorities and trust hospitals. 'Such a register of interest must reassure the public that the people at the very top of each NHS body have a clear understanding that private interests and personal gain must play no part in the conduct of NHS business,' Sir Duncan said. He added that the NHS was responsible for 15 per cent of public spending and 'mismanagement of these funds, or unacceptable risk taking, is a proper and understandable cause for public disquiet'. During the next six months health authorities and trusts should look at their effectiveness as a board, he said.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL AND SUPERVISORS SPLIT ON RESOURCE LAW  </P> <P> Urged on by environmentalists, county planning commissioners on Friday backed a  stringent ordinance to protect the region's sensitive lands and criticized  revisions made by the Board of Supervisors as an attempt to dilute the proposed  law.  </P> <P> The commissioners voted, 4 to 0, with three members absent, to support the  original version of the proposed Resource Protection Ordinance, which was  drafted by a coalition of county officials, planners and environmentalists over  the past year.  </P> <P> But on Monday, the supervisors proposed numerous changes to the ordinance and  eased restrictions designed to protect threatened wildlife and the county's  landscape.  </P> <P> Upon hearing of such changes, the environmentalists voiced their concerns  before the commissioners. On Friday, the commission dismissed the changes and  reaffirmed their support for the unadulterated draft of the ordinance. That set  the stage for a possible confrontation with the board Monday, when the  supervisors meet to consider the ordinance's adoption.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Particularly Alarmed  </P> <P> "If the board is going to make significant changes to our ordinance, I rather  that they not adopt anything at all at this time," Commissioner Toni Kastelic  said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Wright added: "If you put in all these exemptions, the whole  purpose of the ordinance will be weakened."  </P> <P> Many of the environmentalists were particularly alarmed by changes to exempt  the developer of the 22,500-acre Otay Ranch area from the restrictions imposed  by the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> Others were also concerned that changes made by the supervisors would make many  of the county's steep slopes vulnerable to development.  </P> <P> "Especially in the Otay Ranch, there are a variety of threatened plants that  are unique to San Diego," said Emily Durbin, a member of San Diegans for  Managed Growth.  </P> <P> "And there's wildlife, like birds, that live in the area -- for example, the  black-tailed gnat catcher -- that are on the verge of being endangered," Durbin  said. "If exempted, developers will cover every hillside with houses." The  stronger ordinance is also supported by the San Diego chapter of the Sierra  Club and the San Diego Audubon Society.  </P> <P> Supervisor Brian Bilbray, however, dismissed environmentalists' attacks that  the changes would let development run rampant.  </P> <P> "There is not one supervisor who does not have more experience dealing in  land-use decisions than all the planning commissioners combined," Bilbray said.  "We will pass the ordinance that we feel is best for the county."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vulnerable to Developers  </P> <P> Environmentalists said the supervisors' changes make more steep slopes  vulnerable to encroaching developers.  </P> <P> "San Diego's topography is unique because of our steep slopes," Durbin said.  "To grade slopes, to fill in the canyons, will make us look flat. We need to  protect the slopes, not only to save wildlife habitat, but because it provides  visual relief from urban density . . . it's a scenic wonder."  </P> <P> Although many environmentalists expressed delight with the commission's  endorsement, they remained skeptical about whether the Board of Supervisors  would accept a stringent ordinance.  </P> <P> "I'm very pleased by the commissioners' actions," Durbin said. "It's obvious  that they have a pulse on the situation and are concerned about the county's  long-term interests, rather than interests that pop up from election to  election."  </P> <P> "But I'm afraid the chances that the supervisors will accept the stronger  ordinance are slim," Durbin added.  </P></p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Norton gets set for another comeback via US listing Norton, a nostalgic name in British motorcycling, is set to make a comeback as a listed company via a reverse takeover in the US. A group of Canadian investors, who last year bought Norton's motorcycling interests from the receivers, said yesterday they were reversing into a company quoted on the US bulletin board, in so-called pink sheet securities. Under the transaction, shareholders in Wildrose - the Canadian company which paid around CDollars 1m (Pounds 500,000) last October for Norton's name and assets - will receive new shares in the enlarged company. Mr Nelson Skalbania, speaking for Wildrose for which he has described himself as a consultant, said the name of the bulletin board company - to be relisted as Norton Motors or Norton BSA - would probably be disclosed this week. The aim is to revive the motorcycling business, which has struggled to make a profit for more than 20 years. Earlier moves to refinance the company came unstuck last year when Wildrose was suspended from the Alberta exchange after failing to disclose documents on the Norton takeover. Mr Ian Brown, executive vice-president of the Alberta stock exchange, said: 'We have not yet recognised the Norton Motors transaction. Mr Skalbania has been involved in a number of train wrecks with public companies.' Uncertainty over the Canadian investor's moves have been heightened by revelations that in May he will face fraud, theft and forgery charges in Canada relating to a collapsed property deal. Industry analysts in London also voiced concern at Norton's ability to finance motorcycle production at its Shenstone plant in the Midlands. 'With their track record nobody would do anything without cash up-front,' one analyst said. The Serious Fraud Office, meanwhile, is investigating alleged mismanagement at Norton when it was run by Mr Philippe Le Roux, who resigned in 1991 after the Department of Trade and Industry ordered an inquiry. Mr David MacDonald, Mr Le Roux's successor, said the sale to Wildrose 'was not in the interests of shareholders, creditors or employees'. Mr MacDonald resigned in September, before Norton Group was wound up.</p>

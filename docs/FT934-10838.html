			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: Weak Treasuries hit European sentiment THE WEAKNESS of the US Treasuries market continued to dampen sentiment in Europe's government bond markets yesterday. In these unfavourable conditions, German bunds strongly outperformed other continental European markets, with the Bundesbank opening the way for further easing of market interest rates by announcing that today's auction of 13-day securities repurchase agreements will be at variable rates. Weak industrial production data also underpinned hopes that there could still be room for easing. 'The bund market tends to hold on to its value better, when there is uncertainty,' said Mr Adrian James, a bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets. BOND markets in France, Spain and Italy, which were closed on Monday for All Saints' Day, all fell yesterday, with Italy recording the sharpest decline of about a point, which dealers attributed partly to political worries. The Italian Treasury's latest issue of L4,500bn 10-year BTP notes were sold at a gross yield of 9.16 per cent, up from 8.88 per cent at the previous auction of 10-year notes on October 1. Spain and Italy are 'the markets where investors have the the most to lose, having notched up very high returns this year. It makes sense to get out of the market, or move to the short end,' said one trader. Because these markets are more volatile, they typically lose considerable ground when traders become bearish. The French bond market also struggled yesterday, losing half a point while bunds posted a slight gain. This caused a further widening of the 10-year yield spread between French and German bonds to 22 basis points, compared with 14 basis points on Friday and about 5 basis points a week ago. IN LONDON, gilts closed slightly higher after partially retracing earlier gains. Details of the Bank of England's quarterly inflation report were released too late to have much impact on prices, but traders said that the market may react negatively today, as the Bank's worsening inflation outlook is bearish for the bond market. The report said that the Bank of England's near-term inflation expectations have risen and there is a 'slight possibility' that underlying inflation could climb above 4 per cent next year, breaching the government's official target range. US Treasury securities continued to slide at both ends of the market yesterday as investors reacted badly to news of stronger home sales. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  15/32 at 102 15/32 , yielding 6.064 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 15/32 , to yield 4.139 per cent. Recent evidence that the economy is picking up steam has put the bond market on the defensive, and for the second consecutive day prices eased in the wake of fresh economic data. The trigger for the selling was the much bigger-than-expected 20.8 per cent surge in September home sales, the biggest monthly increase since September 1986. Although analysts said the big rise in sales was primarily due to one-off seasonal factors, the number deepened concern among retail investors that accelerating economic growth could drag interest rates higher and eventually lead to a revival of inflation. At one stage the long bond was down a full point, but short covering helped bring the market back from its session lows.</p>

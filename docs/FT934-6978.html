			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / World Bond Markets: Bank may bow to Gemms on repos - Capital &amp; Credit One by one, the various gilt-edged market makers (or Gemms) have been called in to see the Bank of England in recent weeks and invited to give their views on whether the UK should have a fully-fledged bond lending or repurchase (repo) system. Two years ago, such an approach by the Bank would have seemed inconceivable. It was widely felt by the securities houses, especially those with active repo desks in other government bonds, that the Bank had a strong aversion to an open repo market. Yet in the space of two years, the pressure has built up for an open repo market and the Bank's willingness to listen to Gemms' views on the pros and cons of such a system suggests it is genuinely open-minded on this matter. Those who have told the Bank their views believe that an open repo market is inevitable: it is simply a question of time and the determination to overcome certain obstacles, such as the regulation of a repo market and implications for the taxation of dividends. Gemms have enjoyed a privileged position for several years. Because of their requirement to make two-way prices under all market conditions, they need to be able to borrow gilt-edged stock to complete their sales. This they do through Stock Exchange Money Brokers, specialist intermediaries who borrow the gilts from approved lenders, such as large institutions. Increasingly, market participants have argued that the Gemms' privilege should be extended to others: through repos, holders of gilts would be able to sell them for cash for an agreed period of time, at the end of which they would buy them back at an agreed price. Such arrangements exist for US, French and German government bonds, and there are many investors and securities houses who would like to see a similar arrangement for UK government debt. Those in favour of an open gilt repo market claim there would be several advantages. Even with the existing arrangements, Gemms do sometimes face a shortage of certain kinds of stock. 'Sometimes you want to borrow stock as a Gemm so you can go short, and it's hard to get anything other than benchmark issues,' complains a dealer at one leading UK house, adding that an open repo system would improve gilt market liquidity. With an open repo system, overseas investors - who are significant holders of UK government bonds - would be encouraged to lend out their stock to enhance the return on their portfolios. The pro-repo camp argue that an open repo system would entice a broader range of investors into the market. For example, an investor who wants to buy gilts could finance his gilt purchases more cheaply by using the bonds as collateral and borrowing against them. One Gemm calculates that an investor might be able to reduce his borrowing cost quite considerably: he might, for example, pay 50 basis points over Libor to finance his position unsecured, but could reduce it to 10 - 15 basis points over Libor on a secured basis. Those who are in favour of having a repo market argue that the inability to 'repo-out' stock has deterred many investors, particularly those in the US who are accustomed to the freedom to 'repo-out' their US treasury bond holdings. If these investors could be wooed into the gilt market by the presence of a repo facility, they argue, it would encourage more investors to participate in the market, which in turn would mean lower borrowing costs for the government. Not everyone agrees on this point. It is not entirely clear which investors have steered clear of gilts for this reason, given that the gilt market has shown a considerable rally over the last two years and produced bumper returns for investors. While the Bank recognises the advantages of creating a deeper and more liquid market through an open repo system, there are obstacles which would need to be overcome. Even its most ardent proponents will admit in private that repos have a chequered past and have acquired a rather 'spivvy' reputation, thanks to several scandals, such as the Drysdale case in the US in the early 1980s. Clearly, the Bank would want to be satisfied that the market was not open to abuse or disruptive behaviour. This raises the question of how best to regulate the market (whether through legislation or a code of conduct), and how to ensure that stock is not lent out several times over (in the latter case, the solution would be to simply place stock with an agreed third party). 'The regulatory and tax problems are not insurmountable: it's more a question of whether the Bank really wants to relinquish its hold over the secondary market in gilts,' claims one gilts specialist.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    INTEREST RATES AT A GLANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       One week   One Month   One year                           Latest         ago        ago        ago  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK Base rate               6.00         6.00        6.00       7.00 US Discount rate           3.00         3.00        3.00       3.00 Japan Discount rate        1.75         1.75        1.75       3.25 Germany Discount rate      5.75         5.75        6.25       8.25 France Intervention rate   6.45         6.45        6.75       9.10 Italy Discount rate        8.00         8.00        8.50      13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Datastream.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'LI'L ABNER' PLAYS IT BIG, BOISTEROUS  </P> <P> "Peanuts" made its way to the stage. Even characters in "Doonesbury" have found  theater life. Now if someone could only figure out how to put "The Far Side"  under lights.  </P> <P> But it was "Li'l Abner" that started it all. Al Capp's popular comic strip hit  Broadway in the late 1950s as a hee-hawingly loud musical, winning audiences  with its combination of hokum and satire. Norman Panama and Melvin Frank's  adaptation was such a favorite, it was turned into a movie in 1959.  </P> <P> At the Newport Theatre Arts Center, director Tim Nelson does the customary in  bringing this bunch of backwater misfits to life -- meaning the performances  are almost painfully boisterous and unbridled, the colors are right out of the  Sunday comics, and the tempo hardly ever relaxes.  </P> <P> The production has the requisite movement. Trouble is, the show stumbles as  much as it strides, especially when the ensemble finds center stage.  </P> <P> The leads don't always do right by their big numbers, either, but at least they  generate the necessary flavor and make obvious what these very obvious  characters are all about.  </P> <P> Jon Gale is properly muscle-bound and muscle-headed as the archly good hero of  all the silliness. He's the hickest of the hicks, a guy whose only worry before  the government declares Dogpatch, U.S.A., a missile-testing zone is whether he  can avoid the marrying grasp of the ample Daisy Mae.  </P> <P> As Daisy Mae, Jennifer Simpson is lovable enough; Sarah Ann Crawford and Robert  Hopkins as Mammy and Pappy Yokum are plenty goofy, kind of like Ma and Pa  Kettle on diet pills; and Ron Samson bellows at the right thug-ish pitch as  Earthquake McGoon.  </P> <P> What has redeemed "Li'l Abner" over the years are its swipes at bad politicians  and bureaucratic incompetence, and its portrait of Big Business as purely  despicable. Jim Reiss as the money-mad General Bullmoose holds up his end of  the satire, as does Ron Lipp as the opportunistic Senator Phogbound.  </P> <P> 'LI'L ABNER'  </P> <P> A Newport Theatre Arts Center production of the Norman Panama and Melvin Frank  musical based on Al Capp's comic strip.

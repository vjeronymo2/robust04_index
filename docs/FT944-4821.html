			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / US house completions fall US housing completions fell 2.3 per cent in October, the Commerce Department said yesterday. It was the first decrease since July's 3.5 per cent drop. Completions of single-family units fell 0.3 per cent in October after rising in September by a revised 1.7 per cent. Multi-family unit completions fell 12 per cent in October after rising a month earlier by a revised 22.8 per cent. Previously, the department said completions of single-family units rose 1.9 per cent in September, and multi-family units climbed 22.3 per cent. Meanwhile, US mortgage delinquency rates fell in the third quarter to a 21-year low, a Mortgage Bankers' Association of America survey showed. The quarterly national delinquency survey, which covers about a third of all residential mortgages, showed the overall seasonally adjusted mortgage delinquency rate on one- to four-unit homes was 3.9 per cent, down from 4.21 per cent in the second quarter. The third-quarter rate was the lowest since the opening period of 1973, when it hit 3.89 per cent, the MBA said.</p>

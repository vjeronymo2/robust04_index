			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Letter: Japan cautious about economic logic of G7 aid for Russia Sir, I think the recent criticism of the Japanese government's inaction regarding the G7 assistance for Russia is misguided. Contrary to these critical assertions, neither the principle of the northern territorial issue nor a lack of understanding of the impact of a Russian collapse constitute the main reason for Japan's careful attitude. The key issue is the workability and desirability of a hasty reaction by the G7. In the past there has been a common understanding among the G7 countries that western financial assistance will only work with the appropriate domestic economic policy and the development of the institutions necessary for a market economy. Only a small portion of the Dollars 24bn committed by the G7 has been used, mainly because these preconditions have not emerged in Russia. I do not see any reason why financial assistance should suddenly begin to work now without these preconditions. It may be argued that an urgent decision is necessitated by the political considerations. However, it would be quite nave to expect a politically motivated action without an economic result to be of substantial help to President Yeltsin in the current crisis. Given that the battle between the president and the parliament is purely a power struggle, a G7 commitment will not weaken the attack by the parliament. Nor will it strengthen public support for the president until it leads to an improvement in the economic situation. It will certainly be necessary to re-examine the economic reform strategy in Russia. In fact, from the beginning, Japan has been the least enthusiastic country in advocating that market forces alone, without due consideration of the social reality, can achieve a successful transformation. However, a rethinking of this issue should focus on the long-term rather than on short-term political considerations. Nobody can deny the seriousness of the current Russian situation. But one has to recognise what we can do and what we cannot. Your editorial, 'The choice over Russia' (March 17), argued that we should go ahead, despite the fact that there is no guarantee of workability. However, a G7 commitment which disregards economic logic will at best be unlikely to work, and at worst create unrealistic expectations and so be unproductive. This would be nothing but a panic reaction, and as such the G7 countries, in their self-appointed role as world leaders, have a basic responsibility to avoid it.

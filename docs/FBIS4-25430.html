			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori has said that cooperation between China and Peru has  been effective and enjoys vast potentials for further  development.    In an interview with XINHUA prior to his visit to China,  Fujimori said that his forthcoming China tour will promote  bilateral economic cooperation and exchanges and that relations  between the two countries will be further strengthened.    Fujimori and his accompanying delegation left here early  today for visits to Japan and China.    Fujimori's forthcoming China tour will be his third since he  became Peruvian president in 1990. The previous two visits to  China took place in April and November 1991.    Both visits have greatly promoted the development of  relations between the two countries, particularly bilateral  cooperation and trade, the president said.    China has provided a lot of assistance to Peru which also  purchased from China farm machinery and teaching equipment, thus  meeting the needs of its agricultural and educational sectors,  he said.    He noted that there exist vast potentials yet to be tapped  in  cooperation in these two fields.    With his third visit to China, the two countries will have  wider cooperation and more exchanges on a much larger scale, the  president said.    As the economies of the two countries continue to develop  and  become mutually supplementary, bilateral trade will be further  increased, he added.    The president appreciated China's policy of non-interference  in other nation's internal affairs and its stands for  international cooperation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By NEIMENGGU RIBAO reporter Wang Rantong (3769 3544 1749) </F> and Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station reporter Niu  Yaming (3662 0068 5407): "Inner Mongolia's Situation in Economic  Development, Social Stability, Nationality Unity Is Excellent,  and It Has Boundless Future in Accelerating Development and  Great Hope To Be Among the Best"]    [Text] On the afternoon of 31 May, the Inner Mongolia  Autonomous Regional Party Committee held a situation report  meeting. Wang Qun, secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee and chairman of the regional people's congress  standing committee, pointed out at the meeting: Since this  year, the economic development, social stability, and  nationality unity in Inner Mongolia have forged ahead very well,  and, especially, the adaptability to and control over the  transition to a socialist market economic system have  continuously strengthened. Inner Mongolia has boundless  prospects to speed up development and great hope to be ranked  among the best.    Attending the meeting were Qian Fenyong, Bai Enpei, and Wang  Zhan, deputy secretaries, and Wuyunqimuge, standing committee  member of the autonomous regional party committee. Also  attending were leaders of the regional people's congress  standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC]; responsible  persons of the departments of the regional party committee;  responsible persons of the standing committee and various  committees of the regional people's congress; responsible  persons of the regional departments in charge of overall  responsibilities; and responsible persons of the regional press  and propaganda units.    Wang Qun expounded the region's current excellent situation  from 10 aspects. He held: In the first five months of this  year, party committees, people's congresses, governments, and  CPPCC committees at all levels and the cadres and masses of  various nationalities in the region did a great amount of  fruitful work and achieved a marked success in conscientiously  implementing the 20-character guideline of "grasping  opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider to the outside  world, promoting development, and maintaining stability," which  was issued by the party Central Committee. Inner Mongolia has  maintained a good developing situation in the process of  establishing a socialist market economic system. Generally  speaking, the situation of Inner Mongolia is very good.    Wang Qun pointed out: First, a good situation has prevailed  in the region's economic development of industry, agriculture,  and animal husbandry. Rural and pastoral areas have been  prosperous; the people have been intent on advancement; and  animal husbandry has reaped another bumper harvest. In  agriculture, sown areas have been expanded, and the farming  structure has been positively readjusted, making it most  possible for peasants and herdsmen to increase their income by  100 yuan over last year. A more gratifying achievement is that  new headway has been made by the broad masses of peasants and  herdsmen in adapting themselves to the socialist market economic  system. Although industrial production confronted many  difficulties and problems on the way of reform, Inner Mongolia's  enterprises at and above the township level achieved an output  value of 10.594 billion yuan in the January-April period, up  11.1 percent from the corresponding period of last year. The  ranking of our development speed rose from 24th in the country  to 16th as compared with the corresponding period of last year.  State-owned medium and small-sized enterprises have developed  more rapidly than large and medium-sized enterprises; and the  development speed of collective enterprises, the "three types of  foreign-funded enterprises," joint-stock enterprises, and  individual enterprises has outstripped that of the enterprises  owned by the whole people. Especially the township enterprises  have increased by a large margin, showing their characteristics  of strong adaptability and flexibility to the market economic  system. The large-scale increase of the tertiary industry,  commodity circulation, service trades is also heartening.  Second, tax revenue has increased synchronously. The financial  revenue of the whole region in the January-April period of this  year increased by 12 percent over the corresponding period of  last year, and taxes increased by 20.5 percent. Commodity  prices have been stable basically, and the level of commodity  prices has been lower than the national average. This proves  that the reform of the state's financial system has developed  steadily and yielded good results. Third, urban and rural people  have made gratifying progress in adapting themselves to and  controlling over the socialist market economic activities. The  concept of "finding the market instead of the mayor" has been  accepted by more and more people. People have come to  understand more how to follow the guidance of the market to  readjust the structure of farming and livestock breeding, to  take the road of merging into groups and exploiting small areas,  and to develop a coordinated economy. In this aspect, many  typical examples have sprung up in many areas, and a wealth of  experiences have been accumulated. Fourth, the accelerated  development of the state's key industries and basic industries  in Inner Mongolia will certainly push the region's economy to  develop fast. At present, the state is accelerating the pace in  implementing the preferential policy in minority nationality  areas. We should grasp the opportunity, make use of the party  and state's preferential policy to minority nationality areas to  speed up the region's economic construction by every possible  means, make efforts to construct the region into China's largest  base of agriculture, animal husbandry, sideline production, and  foodstuff industry, and construct it into the state's important  energy base. The central authority's policy to enrich the  country and to strengthen the border area will certainly bring  very favorable opportunity for Inner Mongolia's development, and  Inner Mongolia's prospect is boundless and full of hope. Fifth,  reform, opening up, and the endeavor of bringing in investment  from abroad and developing lateral cooperation at home have  greatly pushed forward the unconventional development of the  region's township enterprises, "three types of foreign-funded  enterprises," and individual enterprises.    Township  enterprise is the promising and the only means to enrich the  broad masses of peasants and herdsmen and also to develop the  region's economy. The increase rate of the region's township  enterprises in the first four months of this year was registered  at 119 percent. Township enterprises have slashed a road of  development characterized by little input, high yield, and high  efficiency, thus demonstrating their great vitality. The region  has also the six large backbone industries, such as coal,  electricity, chemical, and light and textile industries. As  long as our understanding is unified and the leadership and the  rank and file are of one mind and do their utmost together, the  development of Inner Mongolia will certainly be accelerated, and  it is very possible for it to be "ranked among the best."  Sixth, the 3 million people of all nationalities have fired the  first shot of the fight to shake off poverty and to get rich,  and the victory in shaking off poverty and getting rich in six  years is within grasp. The key is that the higher and lower  levels should take the matter seriously and unite and work hard.  To unite in the fight is the key to winning victory. This  fight should be made successful at any cost. We may adopt the  means of coordinating state's support with the self-reliance and  arduous efforts of the masses, supporting the poor with  intellectual resources, science, and technology, and sending  persons to selected poverty-stricken areas to help improve their  work. People at higher and lower levels of the whole region  should unite as one, work hard together, and put into effect the  party, the state, and the region's every support-the-poor policy  and measure. Seventh, the endeavors to rejuvenate the region  with science and technology and to do a good job in  comprehensive service are developing from the past decentralized  pattern characterized by each doing his own way into a new  pattern suitable to the market economy, which is characterized  by a broad sphere, a merging into groups, coordination of  agriculture, industry, animal husbandry with trade and  technology, and combination of companies with peasant  households. What the market demands is what technology will  serve to produce. The concept of the victory belonging to the  superior in market competition is being accepted by more and  more producers and managers. Winning by superior quality and  aiming at improving efficiency have become the irresistible  development trends in rejuvenating the region with science and  technology and improving comprehensive service. Eighth, being  built on a fine basis, the ecotypic agriculture and animal  husbandry of good economic efficiency are developing more  rapidly. The region's agriculture and animal husbandry have  already had a nice basis, and the ecotype and good economic  efficiency are the higher demands on the development of  agricultural and animal husbandry production. In ecological  construction and environmental protection, the region has the  precious experiences of "growing trees, growing grass, and  growing shrubs," and "turning cultivated land back to forests or  pastures." We should further spread these experiences to have  them yield positive results throughout the region. Party  committees, people's congresses, governments, and CPPCC  committees at all levels in the region should, according to  their own duties, do a good job in the work which has a  strategic meaning to benefit future generations. Ninth, to be  actively intent on advancement and to be united and stable are  another characteristic of the region's situation. That people  of all nationalities in the region help each other and achieve  progress and prosperity together has become a common practice.  Cadres of all nationalities and the broad masses of the people  have shared comforts and hardships, communist party members have  set the example of carrying on the fine tradition of the party,  and the socialist style has been carried forward. A number of  heroes and models have emerged in this. Organizational  departments and propaganda departments at all levels should make  great efforts to carry forward the new practice of the times and  publicize advanced and heroic deeds to further develop the good  situation characterized by active efforts in making progress,  unity, and stability. Tenth, the leadership has been  strengthened, style of work has been improved, and the guideline  of attaching equal importance to and achieving success in two  tasks at the same time has been carried out further. When  building the socialist material civilization, leaders at all  levels have had high enthusiasm for building the socialist  spiritual civilization, and their measures have been powerful  and achievements conspicuous. Stressing lofty ideals, morality,  styles, and discipline has become the common wish and action of  cadres and masses of all nationalities. Comrade Wang Qun  pointed out that the ten aspects described above were the major  indicators of the region's excellent situation.    Wang Qun pointed out: We should attach much importance to  the existing problems and difficulties, though facing the good  situation. Problems such as the development of enterprises,  banner and county's finance, and commodity prices should all be  taken very seriously by leaders at all levels. As long as the  people at higher and lower levels of the region work hard  together, these problems that have occurred in the process of  progress and development can be totally overcome and resolved.  The whole region's cadres and masses of all nationalities  should persistently carry out the basic line of the party, take  the 20-character guideline of the party Central Committee as the  guide, uplift spirit, work hard together, adopt positive  measures to solve the practical problems we have faced, and  consolidate and develop the region's excellent situation which  has been hard-won.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Takare rises 35% and defends its accounting Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman of Takare, yesterday defended the nursing home group's accounting policies as it announced a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.4m for the six months to June 30, on sales 22 per cent higher at Pounds 42.5m. 'Within the sector we are not soft on accounting policies,' Mr Bradshaw said. 'We are hard on them and always have been.' Takare's share price has been hit in recent months by concerns over its depreciation and capitalisation of interest policies. The group, like many other nursing home operators, does not depreciate the value of its homes. It also capitalises the interest costs of building the homes - adding that value to its fixed assets - for up to three months after opening. Others in the sector stop capitalising when the home opens. Mr Bradshaw said since the group only opened homes on a phased basis, it was justifiable to stop capitalising costs in an equally phased manner. On depreciation, Mr Bradshaw said: 'If you have a company that does not revalue and which expenses the maintenance and refurbishment of assets, to depreciate on top of that would be understating the performance of my company.' Mr Bradshaw was confident the group would allay fears about its profits through continuing growth. 'We are filling our beds faster than ever before,' he said. This was in spite of the Community Care Act which has introduced means testing for potential residents and was expected to hit companies such as Takare catering for the state-funded resident. Takare was stepping up its expansion programme, with 1,500 and 1,800 extra beds planned for this year. Some 900 were already under construction. The group had 5,610 beds in operation at the end of the period, against 4,770 last time, with a 97.5 per cent occupancy rate. The increase in profits was largely fuelled by the increased number of beds. Price inflation was about 2 per cent, Mr Bradshaw said. The Pounds 68m rights issue last September helped Takare cut interest costs from Pounds 1.7m to Pounds 243,000. About Pounds 1.6m was capitalised. The interim dividend is increased by 14 per cent to 0.8p. Earnings, depressed by the rights, fell by 0.3p to 6.4p. COMMENT Mr Bradshaw's robust defence of accounting policies has failed to set the ghosts to rest. While the group's potential for growth remains encouraging, particularly next year when the capital spending comes through, the dispute about what is conservative accounting for a nursing homes group will never be far from most investors thoughts. Whatever Mr Bradshaw may say, this will have to be thoroughly addressed. Forecasts are for profits this year of Pounds 20.8m, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of almost 16. This looks up with events in the short-term, but next year's prospects make the shares look more attractive.</p>

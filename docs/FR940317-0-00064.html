Dissemination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, the municipal market today lacks an effective mechanism for dissemination of material information to investors and the marketplace. To be effective in minimizing the issuer's risk under the antifraud provisions, the annual financial information and event disclosure should be disseminated in a manner reasonably designed to inform the holders of the issuer's securities and the market for those securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Trustees can serve as cost effective disseminators of information to the market due to the capacity and duties of trustees under the terms of the indentures, which positions them to have knowledge of the events requiring disclosure, and the ability and authority to communicate with bondholders. <FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>  The Commission encourages the inclusion of provisions in trust indentures that authorize trustees to transmit information to the market, particularly in structured financings where the issuer's obligations generally are delegated to various participants. Trustees also may provide a service to other small issuers, by enabling them to notify the market in a timely manner and at a lower cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 100 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See ABA 1991 Guidelines at 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The common denominator for current proposals to improve secondary market disclosure for municipal securities is the establishment and designation of one or more information repositories to serve as a collection and access point for annual and current information. <FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>  Such repositories would serve as predetermined sources for information concerning a particular issuer, allowing participants to verify that they have the latest available information concerning the issuer before recommending, purchasing, or bidding for a security. The repositories would supplement, not substitute for, the existing access bondholders may have to issuers to obtain current information. <FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 101 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the recent recommendation of the Joint Statement, the GFOA Guidelines call for lodging secondary market disclosure with a repository, as did the ABA guidelines published in 1991. GFOA Guidelines, Procedural Statement No. 8; ABA 1991 Guidelines at 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 102 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The American Bankers Association Corporate Trust Committee and the National Association of Bond Lawyers, as well as the Joint Statement, have expressed concern that securities depositories and their participants do not retransmit notices they receive from trustees and issuers to the beneficial owners of the issuer's securities. The ABA Corporate Trust Committee sought to address the problem by calling for simultaneous dissemination of the information to the marketplace through an information repository. The National Association of Bond Lawyers has suggested that the Commission promulgate a rule mandating that all depositories and their direct and indirect participants promptly retransmit notices received from the issuer or indenture trustee. While the establishment of information repositories may address the problem to some extent, the Commission staff intends to work with the relevant organizations to assure that steps are taken to provide for consistent retransmission of the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Companion Release, the Commission is proposing an amendment to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 to prohibit, as suggested by the Joint Statement, underwriting of a municipal securities issue unless the issuer of the municipal security has covenanted to provide annual and ongoing disclosure to a repository.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> V. Interpretive Guidance With Respect to Obligations of Municipal Securities Dealers <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Proposing and Adopting Releases for Rule 15c2&hyph;12, the Commission set forth its interpretation of the obligation of municipal underwriters under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. The interpretation discussed the duty of underwriters to the investing public to have a reasonable basis for recommending any municipal securities, and their responsibility, in fulfilling that obligation, to review in a professional manner the accuracy of statements made in connection with the offering. The interpretation was set out in the Proposing Release, and modified slightly in the Adopting Release. The Commission reaffirms its Interpretation with respect to underwriters' responsibilities under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. <FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 103 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In light of the underwriter's obligation, as discussed in the prior releases, to review the official statement and to have a reasonable basis for its belief in the accuracy and completeness of the official statement's key representations, disclaimers by underwriters of responsibility for the information provided by the issuer or other parties, without further clarification regarding the underwriter's belief as to accuracy, and the basis therefor, are misleading and should not be included in official statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, the Commission believes that it is also appropriate to emphasize the responsibilities of brokers and dealers in trading municipal securities in the secondary market. The Commission historically has taken the position that a broker-dealer recommending securities to investors implies by its recommendation that it has an adequate basis for the recommendation. <FOOTCITE>104</FOOTCITE>  A dealer, unlike an underwriter, ordinarily is not obligated to contact the issuer to verify information. A dealer must, however, have a reasonable basis for its recommendation. <FOOTCITE>105</FOOTCITE>  If, based on publicly available information, a dealer discovers any factors that indicate the disclosure is inaccurate or incomplete, or signal the need for further inquiry, a municipal securities dealer may need to obtain additional information, or seek to verify existing information. <FOOTCITE>106</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 104 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Donald T.

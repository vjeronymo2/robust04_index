			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Lilley says DTI will promote competition COMPETITION and the extension of a competitive environment will be the basis of the government's industrial policy for the 1990s, Mr Peter Lilley, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday. 'It is vigorous competition in home markets which makes industry competitive globally; domestic monopoly and protection from foreign competition ultimately undermine its competitiveness,' he told the Institute of Directors in Birmingham. Setting out a series of revised objectives for the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Lilley produced a characteristically firm statement of free market principles but no initiatives other than administrative changes in departmental programmes. In the competitive environment Mr Lilley is concerned to foster, the government's role would be restricted to taking the steps necessary for creating and maintaining a competitive market, financing research, fostering collaboration between companies and providing mechanisms for 'the spread of best practice from one business to another.' His definition of objectives represented a polishing of the department's practice during the Thatcher years - Mr Lilley described what he had to say as 'an evolution of policy; you would not expect me to be the author of a U-turn'. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry spokesman, dismissed Mr Lilley's speech as 'a vacuous public relations exercise.' Mr Lilley's vision of industrial policy is less interventionist than that of Labour, whose latest policy documents promise regional aid with measures and state funding to support manufacturing and to promote research and development. Mr Lilley said only competition would encourage commercial innovation. He conceded that 'there is little market incentive to undertake pure research', so the government had to contribute to its cost. Yet the idea that 'government spending on the science base automatically generates a commercial spin-off and that all we need is more government spending is manifestly untrue.' Industry and science had to work together. Editorial comment, Page 18 A responsible remedy, Page 19</p>

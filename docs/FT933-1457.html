			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Manchester gives its all on the last lap 'WE COULD not have done anything more to win,' Mr Bob Scott, chairman of Manchester's Olympic bid, said as delegates from the International Olympic Committee voted on where to stage the 2000 Games. The feeling among Mancunians was that, win or lose, the city's bid represented Britain's best effort. Those supporting Manchester's bid included Mr John Major, the prime minister, Princess Anne, the Princess Royal, political and business leaders and a galaxy of sporting stars. It was the second time Manchester had reached this stage in the contest to host the world's biggest sporting event. To get this far it had to beat rival British bids from Birmingham, for the 1996 games, and London for the 2000 games. Adding to the attraction of Manchester's bid was a guarantee by John Major that costs would be met, an athlete's village within walking distance of most events, the UK's position as a stable democracy, the country's best regional transportation infrastructure of roads, railways and airport, and good telecommunications. Mr Scott's team persuaded 79 of the IOC's 91 members to visit Manchester - more than went to any other bidding city. However, this was a double-edged weapon, for there was a risk of confirming Manchester's problem of lack of glamour. After Atlanta won the race for 1996, Mr Sebastian Coe, a double Olympic gold medallist and now a Conservative MP, said only London had enough status and prestige to win for Britain. London lost to Manchester, however, because it could not get a single bidding team together and because it was felt that the city's over-stretched infrastructure would hinder the logistics of staging the games. The crucial phase of Manchester's campaign was in 1990 and 1991 when Mr Major was persuaded of the economic value of winning the games - calculated by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, as Pounds 4bn of added value, more than 11,000 jobs and Pounds 400m of tax revenues. With 20 marginal seats in north-west England and a general election looming, Manchester received Pounds 75m from the government to help fund the bid and start building a velodrome and indoor arena.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters stated that HCFA is narrowing the legislative intent by requiring institutional bed capacity to offset increases in waiver recipients, especially since section 9502(c)(2) of COBRA eliminated HCFA's proposed cap on total waiver costs as established under &sect;441.304(d)(1). The proposed cap was the product of the State's estimate of waiver participants times the estimated average per capita cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree. The regulatory cap on total waiver costs has already been eliminated by legislative action (section 1915(c)(6) of the Act). Moreover, we believe the requirement that States establish that there would be sufficient institutional bed capacity for their waiver population in the event there was no waiver should be rescinded. While this requirement served a sound analytical purpose as part of the cost-neutrality test in the early days of the program, our experience over the last several years has shown it to be of diminishing value. The requirement placed an unreasonable burden on States by requiring them to project the estimated development of additional institutional capacity. That additional burden was never the requirement's intent and its development was contrary to the interests of the States and the Federal Government. Moreover, States have generally been successful in documenting additional bed capacity sufficient to allow the expansion of their waiver programs. Because the bed capacity test has become an unnecessary and nonproductive exercise, we are deleting this requirement. In lieu of this test, and in the absence of information to the contrary, we will accept a State's assurance that, absent the waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate level of Medicaid funded institutional care. Also, because the elimination of the bed capacity test recognizes that data regarding program utilization will no longer be relevant to the waiver application process, we have simplified the waiver formula to eliminate those formula values that relate to utilization. Instead, the formula now deals exclusively with program costs, with and without the waiver. As noted above, we will continue to require States to submit estimates of the number of unduplicated waiver recipients it will serve in each year of the waiver term. This figure will be indicated as ``C'' value and may be revised as a State deems necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have adopted, as final, the revised &sect;441.303(f) and the proposed new &sect;441.305 that incorporated the provision of section 1915(c)(9) of the Act as added by section 9502(i) of COBRA, with one change: We have revised paragraph &sect;441.305(b) to specify that there is a 200-person limit (instead of 50) for model waivers under section 1915(c)(10) as amended by section 411(k)(10)(A) of MCCA. The revised &sect;441.303(f) reads, ``An explanation with supporting documentation satisfactory to HCFA of how the agency estimated the average per capita expenditures for services.'' We will consider timely comments on these revisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are also redesignating proposed &sect;441.302(g) as (h) and adding a new &sect;441.302(g) to require that a State provide assurance that, absent a waiver, recipients in the waiver would receive the appropriate type of Medicaid-funded institutional care (hospital, NF, or ICF/MR) that they require. We will consider timely comments on this addition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Waiver Extensions and Renewals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Initially, section 1915(c) of the Act provided that approved home and community-based services waivers could be granted for an initial term of 3 years and could be extended for additional 3-year periods if a State requests an extension. The Secretary could approve a request for a waiver extension if the extension request met the waiver requirements for the extended period and HCFA determined that the State met all of the required assurances for the term of the initial waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9502(f) of COBRA provided that the Secretary, upon a State's request, may extend any home and community-based services waiver that expired on or after September 30, 1985, and before September 30, 1986, subject to the State's meeting all requirements for the waiver. The extension granted must be for a period of not less than 1 year and no more than 5 years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 9502(g) of COBRA amended section 1915(c)(3) of the Act to revise the periods of time for which a waiver may be renewed from additional 3-year periods to additional 5-year periods under section 9502(j)(6) of COBRA. This amendment is effective for waiver renewals approved on or after September 30, 1986.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In our proposed rule, we revised &sect;441.304(a) to change waiver extension or renewal periods to reflect the statutory requirements. We did not receive any public comments on this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4102(c) of OBRA `87 provided that the Secretary extend approval of a State's section 1915(c) waiver for the elderly on the same terms and conditions through September 30, 1988, when (l) the State as of December 1, 1987, had a waiver approved for elderly individuals under section 1915(c) of the Act; (2) the waiver was scheduled to expire before July 1, 1988; and (3) the State notified the Secretary of its intention to file an application for a waiver under section 1915(d) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Provisions of the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have adopted, as a final rule, the proposed &sect;441.304(a) to change the waiver extension and renewal periods to conform to section 1915(c)(3), as amended by section 9502(g) of COBRA. We have not included in the final rule changes to paragraph (a)(2) that were included in the proposed rule because those changes are no longer necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> K. Technical/Administrative Changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Terminology Change  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have revised proposed &sect;440.185 and amended &sect;441.301 through &sect;441.304 and &sect;441.310 by changing references to ``SNF'' and ``ICF'' to ``NF'' to conform them to nomenclature changes made to section 1915(c) by section 4211(a)(3) of OBRA `87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Independent Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although not specifically addressed in the proposed rule, a State agency asserted that our requirement in &sect;441.303(g) for an independent assessment of a State's waiver program that evaluates the quality of care, the access to care, and the cost effectiveness is costly and duplicates HCFA's regional office (RO) reviews.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the publication of this requirement (50 FR 10028, March 13, 1985), various State agencies have asserted that the requirement is costly, unproductive, and duplicative of RO assessments. We agree with the commenter and are making the independent assessment voluntary. If a State determines it will contract for an independent assessment, FFP is available for the costs attributable to the assessment. The results should be forwarded to HCFA by the 90th day prior to expiration of the approved waiver and cover at least the first 24 or 48 months of the waiver.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

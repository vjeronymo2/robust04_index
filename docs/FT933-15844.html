			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Michelangelo reaches record for Old Master drawings ONE OF the last major drawings by Michelangelo still in private hands, 'The Holy Family with the Infant Baptist on the Rest on the Flight into Egypt', sold for Pounds 4,181,500 at Christie's in London yesterday, a record for an Old Master drawing. The price was anticipated, as was the buyer, the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, which had just one competitor. The only element of excitement in the two minutes of bidding was when the Getty's curator, Dr George Goldner, made a bid to ensure that the official bidder for the Getty, Ms Katrin Bellinger, could return to bidding in even numbers to ensure that she kept to the upper limit approved by the board. The drawing had once belonged to the British artist Sir Thomas Lawrence. It was sold in the 1830s for 250 guineas and for more than a century has been hidden away at the Great Tew, Oxfordshire, mansion of the reclusive Major Eustace Robb. The Getty is keen to acquire works by all the masters and with little chance of a Michelangelo oil appearing on the market it was 'happy to have the drawing'. Dr Goldner said: 'To get a large major example is something we are thrilled about.' The other important lot of the day - two portrait miniatures in a single frame of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex, by Hans Holbein the Younger - failed to sell. This was a great disappointment. Fewer than 20 miniatures by Holbein have survived and these two have an excellent provenance, descending through the Blount family for 400 years until the 1930s. Christie's had fixed an estimate of Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 750,000 on the lot, but the bidding petered out at Pounds 350,000. The miniatures came from the collection of the late Dr Anton F. Philips. All told nine of the 14 miniatures from his estate found buyers for a total of Pounds 216,692. A portrait of a noblewoman by Nicholas Hilliard sold for Pounds 84,000, at the bottom of its estimate.</p>

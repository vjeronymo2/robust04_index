			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Our sources in the south expect tyrant Saddam's  troops to launch a new attack against villages and populated  areas on the [word indistinct) River, which extends from  al-Qurnah district in al-Basrah Governorate to the (al-'Izar)  area in the marshes of al- 'Amarah Governorate.    In a report from the marshes, our sources note that the  regime has massed many troops, including armored and artillery  units, in preparation for the attack. The same sources add that  the regime has beefed up its forces by sending units from the  Republican Guards, the emergency forces [quwat al-tawari'],  large elements from the security and intelligence services, and  units from the so- called Popular Army, which has been  reestablished to confront popular protests against the regime.</p>

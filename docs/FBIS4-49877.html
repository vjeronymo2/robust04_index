			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 11 May (XINHUA) -- State Council Premier Li  Peng said here today that ousting China from GATT for a long  time is detrimental [bu li yu 0008 0448 0060] not only to China  but also to the world.    While meeting with some Chinese and foreign delegates to the  1994 international high-level economic forum in Beijing, China,  that opened today, Li Peng stressed: China is willing to resume  its status as a GATT contracting member at an early date and to  become a founding member of the future World Trade Organization  [WTO], and China has made great efforts in this regard.    Li Peng said: China will maintain two-way relations with the  currently existing GATT and with the future WTO. China needs  multilateral trading organizations like GATT, while GATT and the  future WTO also need China.    He said: If the WTO refuses to admit China -- a country with  over 1.1 billion people and a rapidly developing economy and  expanding trade volume, it will be very hard to regard the WTO  as a wholesome organization.    During the meeting, Li Peng also briefed the delegates on  the  characteristics and contents of China's socialist market  economy; on the conditions of China's large and medium state  enterprises; on China's efforts in handling relations among  reform, development, and stability; and on measures taken to  deepen reform and strengthen macroeconomic regulation and  control.    Li Peng said: After 15 years' practice and exploration,  China has proposed the objective of establishing a socialist  market economy. In the process, China will pay attention to  properly handling the relations among reform, development, and  stability.    He pointed out: Development is the purpose; reform, the  driving force; and stability, the condition.    Later, Premier Li Peng hosted a banquet for all forum  delegates at the Great Hall of the People. He said in his  speech: He was very happy to be with distinguished guests and  friends in Beijing at a time of bright sunshine, gentle breezes,  and blooming flowers.    Li Peng said: China is a peace-cherishing country.  Initiated by Deng Xiaoping, chief architect of the reform and  opening up, China has formulated, as early as the end of the  seventies, the general policy regarding economic construction as  the central task and has been implementing policies of reform  and opening up. Such efforts have brought tremendous changes to  China.    He said: Currently, China is enjoying political stability,  economic development, unity among its nationalities, and social  progress. Full of hope and under the CPC leadership with Jiang  Zemin as the core, the Chinese people are moving toward the  21st century and the future. We are full of confidence in our  country's future as never before.    However, Li Peng added: Owing to its large population and  underdeveloped economy, China still has a long way to go. To  develop its economy as rapidly as possible, China needs the  international community's long-term support and cooperation.    He said: "We enthusiastically welcome foreign friends all  over the world to cooperate and exchange with China in funds,  technology, management, and many other fields."    Li Peng said: China is a huge market, open to all countries  willing to develop friendly cooperation with it.    He said: China is willing to understand the world and the  world also needs to understand China. Judging from the forum's  speeches, this objective is definitely attainable.    Li Peng said: The meeting's agenda concerns not only China's  economy, but also the world's economy and its long-term  development. That is why we said: "Our common tasks are to  attain peace and development."    Li Peng believed: Asia, including China and particularly  East Asia, is the most active region in the world economy [shi  jie jing ji zui wei huo yue de di qu 0013 3954 4842 3444 2584  3634 3172 6460 4104 0966 0575] and has a very bright future.  Therefore, he expressed the hope that after the forum ends in  Beijing, similar international high-level forums will be held  annually or every other year in China, adding that the Chinese  Government is willing to provide effective support in this  regard.    Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir delivered an ebullient  speech at the banquet. He hailed new changes in Beijing since  his last visit to China in 1993. He said these have been the  results of efforts made by China's leaders, government, and  people.    He said: "It is hard to administer a country with more than  10 million people, not to mention one with more than 1.1 billion  people." He added: As an Asian, he admires China's  achievements.    Mahathir said: China's prosperity is sure to bring about  prosperity in East Asia and in the whole of Asia. He wished  that the Chinese people will accomplish more in their future  construction.    Attending the meeting and banquet were Helmut Schmidt,  former  chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany; Ernest Stern,  deputy managing director of the World Bank; and Richard McLean,  chairman of the INTERNATIONAL HERALD TRIBUNE.    Li Tieying, state councillor and minister in charge of the  State Economic Restructuring Commission, also attended the  meeting and banquet.</p>

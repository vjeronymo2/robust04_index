			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Geneva talks on Bosnia In a last-ditch attempt to revive talks on Bosnia's partition, leaders of the republic's warring parties today meet European Union foreign ministers in Geneva. The meeting aims to establish a platform for fresh talks, centring on a phase-out of sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro in exchange for territorial concessions by Bosnian Serbs to the Moslems. Five people were killed and five wounded in Sarajevo yesterday when a shell exploded in a city street, showing there was no sign that the violence might end or that Serb, Croat and Moslem leaders would succeed in reaching a political settlement for the republic's division into three ethnic states. Before leaving for Geneva, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, urged tighter United Nations sanctions on Serbia if the Bosnian Serbs refuse to hand over land. 'If the Serb side does not return territories, sanctions should be tightened and not lifted,' he told a news conference in Sarajevo, which is besieged by Serb forces. The EU initiative is a revitalised version of a deal, mediated by envoys Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg, which collapsed in September when Bosnian Serbs refused to meet Moslem demands for 3-4 per cent more territory in order to create a viable state. In an ominous signal for the Geneva talks, Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said at the weekend his forces, which control 70 per cent of Bosnia, would insist on the lifting of sanctions on Belgrade before conceding any land. Serb leaders who previously endorsed the Geneva plan to hand over 20 per cent of their land show no trace of intending to fulfil their pledge. In fact, their troops are seizing more Moslem-held land in northeast Bosnia. They are apparently confident sanctions will be lifted anyway. However, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic is likely to press his Bosnian proxy, Mr Karadzic, to hand over land in an attempt to get the sanctions eased before elections on December 19.

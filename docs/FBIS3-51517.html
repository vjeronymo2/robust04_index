			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today President Alberto Fujimori said he hopes  Alexander Watson, assistant secretary of state for  inter-American affairs, will verify the human rights situation  in the country's interior areas. He said this after he  inaugurated the Huamanga-Huanta road, a project requiring an  investment of more than 3 million soles, in Ayacucho Department.    President Alberto Fujimori inaugurated 20 km of the  Huamanga-Huanta road in Ayacucho Department. He was accompanied  by (Pierre Ramba), UN permanent representative in Peru. This  road represents a 3.3 million new soles investment and will  allow trade in this area of the country to be stimulated. It  includes the (Ayaorcuna), (Guaiguas), and Cusca bridges.    [Begin unidentified resident recording] We wish to express  our deepest gratitude because we now know the jobs are being  completed. [applause] [end recording]    In response to the residents' repeated requests, the  president pledged to undertake the Rashuillca project, which  will use lake water for irrigation. The president took the  opportunity to briefly visit the Santa Clara Convent where he  spoke with the nuns.    Alexander Watson was not present. President Fujimori and  Ayacucho Bishop Monsignor Juan Luis Cipriani both agreed that  the U.S. official should verify human rights accomplishments in  situ and not from a desk.    [Begin Fujimori recording] I do not believe the human rights  problem can be viewed simply from a desk, taking into account  the partial speculation and information that reaches him. Human  rights is an issue to be discussed here in Ayacucho,  (Huancasanco), and Huanza, where there are so many orphans.  Here, the Army, the Armed Forces in general, the peasant  patrols, and the people have defended human rights. That is why  we can talk of human rights now, and here human rights are  respected because we have defended them. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet the  Ukrainian party has done its utmost in order to fulfil the  instructions of Ukrainian and Russian presidents, Ukraine's  deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said in his interview  with journalists in Kiev.    In his words, Kiev was holding the negotiations  "constructively," however, it confronted "inadequate actions of  the Russian party."    Tarasyuk said that probably it is necessary to listen to the  proposal of Ukraine's Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy and to  draw "a third party" to the negotiations, which would help to  find a way out.    During a press conference on Friday in Kiev, Ivan Plyushch,  speaker of the Ukrainian parliament, also spoke about possible  solution of the Fleet's problem with the participation of the US  president on analogy with the January tripartite statement on  Ukraine's nuclear disarmament.    Vyacheslav Kostikov, press secretary of the Russian  president, was critical of this point of view and declared that  Russia would not tolerate any outer interference on the Black  Sea Fleet issue.    In any case, Tarasyuk said, the major results of the meeting  in Sevastopol is "Russia's return to the concept of the Black  Sea Fleet division about which it "forgot" late last year."    He pointed out that Ukraine and Russia "have found consent  regarding the starting point while counting the Fleet's ships."  Russia and Ukraine also reached a consent concerning the issue  what part of the Black Sea fleet would be transferred to  Ukraine's Navy.    Unfortunately, Plyushch noted, "we cannot regard as an  achievement the unclear departure of the Russian delegation from  the meeting and the fact that we have failed to reach an  agreement on separate basing of the Black Sea Fleet and  Ukraine's Navy."    An unexpected departure of Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev from the negotiations in Sevastopol arouses only regret,  Tarasyuk stressed.</p>

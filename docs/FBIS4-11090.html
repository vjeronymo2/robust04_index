			<p>BFN     [Text] The deputies to the National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP] from Ciego de Avila Province are  ready for the special session of the ANPP to be held on 1 May.  This was announced at the meeting chaired by ANPP Vice President  Jaime Crombet at the seat of the provincial government. During  the meeting, also attended by the presidents of the People's  Councils, and the provincial Administration Council, it was  reported that over 40 percent of the suggestions made at the  workers assemblies have been implemented. The importance of this  new democratic practice to solve countless problems with  production and services as well as to help rejuvenate the  national economy was also stressed.    Crombet pointed out that the idea is not for the ANPP to  take  specific measures during the forthcoming meeting, but to set the  policies and guidelines to guide the government efforts to save  the Revolution and accomplishments of socialism.</p>

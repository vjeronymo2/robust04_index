			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hani 'Abbas Ilyas Khidr al-Hadithi, Baghdad </F> University: "Political Insights Into the Attitude of the  Security Council"]    [Text] In the last few days, there has been a difference of  opinion over new developments in the international [UN] Security  Council [UNSC] regarding the continued economic sanctions on  Iraq, especially after the council's failure to issue its usual  statement. This was due to the differing points of view among  the permanent member states over the nature of the statement,  and the extent of Iraq's compliance with the Security Council's  resolutions.    The question that must now be asked is related to the  significance of this difference of opinion and its implications  for the future.    In other words: do the permanent members have genuinely  different interpretations in their common views, or have  political fabrication and selfish interests led to this relative  change?    We believe that the answer to this question is what defines  the true worth of the UNSC's recent change.    First, we can see that Iraq's implementation of the Security  Council resolutions and its genuine commitment to them has given  an opportunity to the powers that so wish, to rectify the  situation to reformulate a political view at variance to their  unfair foreign policy conduct towards Iraq. Thus Iraq has set  the scene for a new political course on their part.    As to the other powers, their political views and positions  can be analyzed on the bases of crucial changes that have had an  effect of their subsequent conduct.    With Russia, there is an objective fact that must be taken  into consideration. It is the legacy of the Soviet Union, as  well as a tsarist imperialist legacy, that has always played a  distinct role in its international relations. History has  inevitably left its mark on the role political powers play in  the world.    One must note that communism, and the misery and official  oppression it caused, led to a general stampede away from it and  inability, after getting rid of its nightmares, to revert to a  system capable of providing the minimum of humanity, freedom, or  democracy. The nationalist factor began to play a more active  role, pressuring and influencing Russian decisionmaking, and  pushing it in the direction of restoring Russia's role in the  former Soviet republics, based on Russia's restored standing as  a superpower. This tendency was able to impose political  settlements between President Yeltsin and the former leaders of  the parliamentary opposition, accused of plotting against him.  Thus this internal variable was bound to have an effect on  Russia's external political policies. This has become clear in  subsequent statements, not only in terms of Rssia's role as a  global superpower, but also in terms of many international  issues such as Yugoslavia and Iraq.    This should not cause us to ignore another basic and  important factor: the economic factor. The collapse of economic  growth has brought it back to zero, according to Gorbachev's  statements, the basis and natural prelude to the retreat and  collapse of the Soviet Union, both economically and politically.  Hence, the economic pressure, in the form of covetousness and  intimidation not only on the part of the United States, but also  on the part of its Gulf regimes, through bribery. And yet the  position is still suspended between Russian readiness to  persevere in strategic order, or submitting to the strict  measures, which the last two years have not appeared feasible  for the Russian economy.    As to France, it has long had a deeply rooted tendency  towards independence; here we must recall that France deserves  the greatest credit for calling for European unity. Its plan  with Germany after World War II, in 1951, specifically, to  establish an iron and steel joint venture, marked the beginning  of the European bloc that led to the European Common Market, and  the movement to form a federal European bloc.    It was also natural that France, and Germany as well, should  continue their joint efforts in this plan; and it was also  natural that Britain should find the object of its dreams in the  United States, which saw, in European unity, a threat to its  ambitions to build a monopolar new world order.    Thus there were special circumstances and causes for the  French alignment with the United States in the aggression on  Iraq, but this situation will not necessarily continue, due to  the profound disparity in the political course, which France has  previously strengthened by withdrawing from the military  committee of the Atlantic alliance, and reaffirming the French  nuclear umbrella to guarantee French-European security. France  also refused to subject its nuclear capability to the nuclear  arms limitation talks between the United States and the former  Soviet Union.    This gives France credibility in its different  interpretation  from the United States, if we assume France's return to its  common "strategic" view, giving it ample opportunity to achieve  its interests in Iraq and the Arab region, and throughout the  Middle East, contrary to American hegemony and subjugation to  the United States.    This leaves us the Chinese position, which is influenced by  three basic variables:    The problem of Taiwan, and China's wish to gather American  support for restoring it to mainland control; the question of  its continuing to enjoy most favored nation trading status,  which enables it to to take advantage of Western, especially  American, aid and technology, to modernize the Chinese economy;  and the Hong Kong problem, which is directly connected to  Britain, as negotiations are still ongoing, and sometimes  difficult, on its return to China in 1999. And there is the  issue of America's pressure on Britain, for good or ill.    These strategic issues face China, which finds that its  abilities, in light of the collapse of global equilibrium in  favor of the United States, do not allow it to resist American  pressure. And yet it has not forgotten its program, which relies  on a combination of socialist thought and China's cultural  heritage. Its ambitions as a superpower have significant  interests throughout Asia, chiefly, and in the world. It is  entitled to confirm the well-known Chinese wisdom between  practical reality and future aspitations. Thus in the Security  Council it has abstained from voting on the criminal resolutions  against Iraq, to give itself a special attribute, setting itself  apart from the other permanent members.    It appears that China is still waiting for its chance, and  the right time, to voice its opinion on global issues of  importance, especially since China considers itself a superpower  defending the rights of the states of the South (the Third  World) and an Asian power, which is an alternative to the former  Soviet role, and a competitor to Japan in southeast Asia, and  Asia as a whole.    The history of China shows that its leaders know how to be  patient and wait for long periods, and because of this China can  find, in any international change affecting the rebalancing of  global relations, a way in which to serve its own interests.  Perhaps in what preceded there is a convincing explanation for  its standing beside Russia and France in having views different  from those of the United States and Britain.    Based on this, common strategic assumptions lead one to say  that persisting in these positions will lead in the future not  only to helping Iraq's position in the Security Council, but  also to an important tendency restoring global relations to  equilibrium and stability, incompatible with absolute American  hegemony. And in any case this may be a relative balance in  which economic, technological, and military capabilities can  impose their will in defining this relativity.    We still have an important question: will the United States  allow these powers to profit from this "gap," to accomplish what  they want?    I believe that it is useful to say that the United States  may  find itself in a course with these powers to prevent them from  achieving their interests at the expense of the United States.  Thus the world may see numerous changes in global policy, but in  the end they will favor the balance of global relations, even if  it is an exploration of a historic era, with the logic of nature  prevailing.    Putting aside the extent of disparity in interpretations  among the Security Council's permanent members over Iraq's  cooperation and readiness to end or ease the unjust sanctions on  our people, there remains an important question before  us--specifically, before Iraqi diplomacy: what to do?    We think that the present position requires profound  analysis  by relevant specialists who find that their options are limited,  and that political acumen is needed to identify them. None of  these options should be ignored in order to complete the  comprehensive and genuine story as a basis that is indispensable  in choosing the best alternative. The first vital conditions  required by that are accurate information, time, steadiness, and  decisiveness.    This means necessarily not giving any chance, however small,  to our enemy, for him to exploit in an attempt to reassemble  opposition to Iraq. This means, in result, delicate control of  media policy, to say nothing of official political statements  going in only one direction, and this is a service to  rationality and goal of political decisionmakers.    This is in domestic terms, which require the preparation of  careful and balanced plan of action, making media policy  comparable to foreign policy. Thus it is necessary for Iraqi  minds to take part in the discussion and prepare this plan of  action.    In terms of policy abroad, we believe that foreign events  that may appear positive, however small or minor, require a  positive reaction, not proportional to the event but surpassing  it in positivity.    This does not mean that Iraqi action must constituute mere  reaction to action abroad; it should move from a state of  inaction to one of action. This action should take concrete form  and be used it at the highest levels. The policy should be put  to use in influential global quarters, secretly or openly, as  circumstances require. Popular diplomacy--quasi-official or  party-level diplomacy--can play an ancillary role here, but it  is not necessarily the means intended to take over the basic,  effective policy.    What we need to do is assess the policy by its outcome;  assess profits and losses with extreme care, in action and  struggle, so that positive and impressive events will  accumulate; and accept some losses, perhaps as a necessary  condition, as we know that these events may lead to changes that  can help to rebuild the new world order.</p>

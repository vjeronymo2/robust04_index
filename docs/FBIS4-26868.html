			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Loans from  international financial organizations and governments are used  in control of water and atmospheric pollution in Shanxi  Province, one of the most important energy and chemical industry  centers in China.    With the approval of the State Council, the province plans  to  construct five intensive heating and coal gas projects to reduce  air pollution. It has asked for loans from the Asian  Development Bank (ADB). At present, the 120 million U.S. dollar  loan has been listed among the ADB's reserve projects for 1996.    The five projects involve three big industrial cities in the  province -- Taiyuan, Datong and Yangquan. They will provide  residents with heating and coal gas and will greatly improve the  atmospheric environment of the three cities.    The scheme will cut out the release of 21,800 tons of  sulphur  dioxide and 50,900 tons of dust and smoke every year. It will  also save the consumption of 1.19 million tons of coal annually.    The main industries in Shanxi are coal mining, electricity,  metallurgy and chemical industry, which are all pollution  intensive industries.    Shanxi is rich in coal but severely short of water. Much of  the water the province does have is heavily polluted. The  control of water pollution is the key aim in using foreign  investment.    A loan from the French Government amounting to 4.95 million  U.S. dollars is expected to be used in control of polluted water  in Yangquan city. Another joint project in disposal of waste  water containing nitrogen is under negotiation between Shanxi  Fertilizer Factory and Germany.    The head of the Environment Protection Bureau of Shanxi said  that the use of foreign funds in environmental protection would  not only solve the problem of money, but also introduce advanced  technical equipment and scientific management methods.</p>

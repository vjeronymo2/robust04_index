			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / People: O'Connell takes on the top job at Ireland's low-profile central bank It remains to be seen whether the appointment of Maurice O'Connell as the next governor of Ireland's central bank will shed any light on the inner workings of this august institution, writes Tim Coone. Although it plays a key role in the Irish economy, it maintains a very low public profile. In Ireland, the 57-year old O'Connell is barely known outside the confines of the Department of Finance where he has worked for the past 32 years, rising to the post of second secretary responsible for its finance division. Trained in classics rather than finance, he is none the less considered an authority on the EMS and central bank legislation. Indeed, he will be more familiar to finance officials from other EU countries since he sits on the monetary committee and is a director of the European Investment Bank. O'Connell takes up the governorship on May 1, replacing Maurice Doyle who, at 62, announced last month that he would not be seeking a second seven-year term of office. Doyle rarely gave interviews to the press, so his decisions and views have never been exposed to much public scrutiny. But his frequently outspoken views, which he chose to make public on occasion, gave him a reputation as an independent thinker who had no qualms about criticising government economic policies  - so various directorships of prominent Irish plcs doubtless await him. Both O'Connell and Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, will be anxious that the independence of the central bank be maintained, and that political considerations are kept out of exchange rate and interest rate management. But to be convincing, O'Connell might be required to display a higher profile than he has done as a director of Irish Telecommunications Investments, the treasury arm of the state-run tele- communications company Telecom Eireann. The utility has a IPounds 1bn debt and is not yet considered to be in a suitable financial condition to be privatised.</p>

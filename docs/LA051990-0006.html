			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOCK OF LAKER FANS OVERCOME BY WONDER: WHERE TO PLACE BLAME  </P> <P> How ironic that Pat Riley gets the NBA coach-of-the-year award right before his  coaching (or lack thereof) contributed greatly to the Lakers' downfall against  Phoenix.  </P> <P> Example A: Games 1 and 3 are lost because Riley double-teams Kevin Johnson with  the men who are guarding Tom Chambers and Jeff Hornacek.  </P> <P> Solution: Double-team Johnson with the man guarding Kurt Rambis. Riley finally  does this in Game 5. What took him so long?  </P> <P> Example B: Games 4 and 5 are lost because Riley has Byron Scott "guarding"  Johnson instead of Cooper. With Cooper on Johnson in the fourth quarter, the  Lakers take a five-point lead. Riley substitutes Scott and puts him on Johnson,  who scores eight of the Suns' final 14 points.  </P> <P> I'm a six-year season-ticket holder whose seats were just converted to Senate  Seats next year with a raise in price from $14.50 to $60 per game. I'm more  upset about Riley's defense than the 400% increase in ticket price.  </P> <P> DON KARR, Agoura  </P></p>

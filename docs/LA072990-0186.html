			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE WAS NO EXCUSE FOR SCHROEDER'S SEASON;  </P> <P> RAIDERS: QUARTERBACK WAS HURTING IN 1989, BUT HE'S FEELING GOOD AND WORKING  HARD NOW.  </P> <P> Practice had been over for almost half an hour, but quarterback Jay Schroeder  was still on the field. Although wide receivers Mervyn Fernandez and Sam Graddy  wanted to end the session, Schroeder was determined to throw more passes.  </P> <P> Mike White, the Raider quarterback coach, hopes Schroeder's work ethic will  translate into a successful season.  </P> <P> "I'm impressed with Jay's attitude," White said. "I think he's made a real  commitment to improve. If you've watched the last couple of days, he's still  out after every practice and wants more work. He's looking for people to catch  the ball.  </P> <P> "Mechanically, which is my role, he's improved, and now he's got to apply it to  the system and get it polished up."  </P> <P> Schroeder suffered through a terrible season in 1989, losing his job to Steve  Beuerlein. Schroeder, who completed only 46.9% of his passes, threw for 1,550  yards with eight touchdowns and 13 interceptions. He was 4-5 as a starter.  </P> <P> It wasn't supposed to happen this way for Schroeder, acquired from the  Washington Redskins in exchange for tackle Jim Lachey in 1988. Despite winning  24 of 31 starts in Washington, Schroeder lost his job to Doug Williams and was  traded to the Raiders.  </P> <P> Although Schroeder has been unsuccessful with the Raiders, they apparently  haven't lost faith in him, signing him to a $1.1-million, one-year contract  last week.  </P> <P> Is Schroeder out to prove that his first two seasons in Los Angeles were an  aberration?  </P> <P> "He's got a lot of pride and he wants to show people the kind of quarterback he  is," White said. "He seems to be the kind of guy that accepts responsibility  himself. And that's a start. He realizes that it's up to him. And in my  experience with quarterbacks, that's important. One thing about quarterbacks is  that no one wants to hear excuses."  </P> <P> Although Schroeder suffered a torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder when he  was blindsided by San Diego linebacker Leslie O'Neal on the first play of the  Raiders' 1989 season-opener and said the injury never healed, he refused to  offer that as an excuse.  </P> <P> "I never will make excuses," Schroeder said. "I played on a bad knee for a  while, and I played with a bad shoulder. You're going to have injuries, but  you've got to play. There's no sense complaining about it because nobody wants  to hear it."  </P> <P> Schroeder moved from El Segundo to Poway over the winter, where he worked by  himself to improve.  </P> <P> "I did a lot of the training on my own because I know what I have to do to get  ready," Schroeder said. "I worked on my dropbacks and my footwork."  </P> <P> After losing 10 pounds, Schroeder, 6-4 and 210, hopes to have improved his  quickness.  </P> <P> Although he lost his job to Beuerlein last season, Schroeder has won it back by  default, since a contract dispute has kept Beuerlein out of training camp.  </P> <P> Does Schroeder think he will be able to retain the starting job once Beuerlein  is signed?  </P> <P> "I'm not worried about it," Schroeder said. "I'm not worried about who's No. 1.  You're here to compete and that's all. This game is based on competition.  You've got to do it every year."  </P> <P> Dissatisfied with Schroeder's performance last season, there was speculation  that the Raiders would try to trade for New Orleans quarterback Bobby Hebert.  But the deal never took place.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter who's here," Schroeder said. "They can bring in anybody in  the world, and if you get a fair shot, then it's on your shoulder. That's what  I like about it. The bottom line rests with me. I have to do what I can do."  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Defensive end Lyle Alzado, who underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove torn  cartilage from his left knee Friday, is expected to return in six weeks, said  Dr. Robert Rosenfeld, who performed the surgery. "I went to the hospital this  morning to see him, and they told me he had left," Rosenfeld said. "If he's  walking around without crutches like I hear, his prognosis is good."  </P> <P> Coach Art Shell was pleased after putting his team through a non-contact  controlled scrimmage that was marred by penalties Saturday morning. "I'm  satisfied with where we are and where we're headed," Shell said. "I feel good  about our football team. I think our fans are going to see an exciting brand of  football." . . . Tailback Marcus Allen, practicing for the first time since he  ended his holdout Friday, had three carries for seven yards in the scrimmage,  and quarterback Jay Schroeder threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver  Tim Brown. . . . Although defensive end Greg Townsend had hoped to accompany  the Raiders to London for their Aug. 5 exhibition against New Orleans, it now  appears unlikely because he's still unsigned.  </P></p>

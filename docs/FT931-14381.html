			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Arts: Today's Television Europe on the Brink (BBC 2, 7.45) looks like an expensive enterprise, with presenter Francine Stock wafting around Europe in search of things to come. Part one got off to a rather slow start last week, with the worthies of Watlington on Remembrance Sunday burbling away about what it means to be British. However, once we got to the experts' views and predictions, the programme improved and was notably good, if hair-raising, about immigration. This week's investigation focusses on the long-term economic prospects for Europe weighed against America and South-east Asia. Human nature being what it is, I am willing to bet that attendance figures at London Zoo have been given a fillip by the recent episode of the poor man who carried an armful of dead chickens into the lions' den and was mauled for his pains. The Ark (BBC 2, 9.25) is the first of no less than four documentaries about the parlous state of London Zoo and the new management's plans to save the rats - not to mention all the other hapless beasts - stuck on the sinking ship.</p>

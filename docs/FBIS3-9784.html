			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 29 (CTK) -- In view of the  transformation of the Czech Army, the number of military  airplanes will be reduced by 30.6 percent against the present  situation, Air Force and Air Defense Inspector Pavel Strubl said  at a press conference today. Seventy-seven fighter planes, 11  helicopters, 20 training planes, 10 transport and special  planes, and 20 transport helicopters will be withdrawn from  service.    In 1994 and 1995, the Czech Army will operate at six  airports, later at five airports, General Strubl added.    Asked by journalists what the fate of the Soviet-made  turbo-jet fighters MiG-29 would be, Strubl said that the command  of the Czech Army decided not to buy any more aircraft equipment  from the countries of the former USSR. "It would be uneconomic  to operate only 10 MiG-29 planes," Strubl said. All  transformation intentions within the army are built mainly on  present economic possibilities, he added.    The transformation of the Air Force will afflict some 250  pilots. "We will do our best to provide them with jobs in the  aircraft area," Strubl stressed. He added that he held  negotiations with several firms, including Czechoslovak  Airlines, which showed interest in the pilots.    The gradual modernization of Czech Air Force will be  launched  this year by a purchase of training aircrafts Z-142. Airplanes  L- 159, helicopters and transport planes are to be bought after  1997, and multi-purpose super sound planes after the year 2000,  Strubl said. The Czech Air Force should be completely  re-equipped by 2005, Strubl said.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): HK gains ahead of talks on new airport WITH Tokyo closed for a public holiday, the region's markets concentrated on domestic news yesterday, while investors remained cautious about New York's overnight gain. HONG KONG extended its rally to two days, the Hang Seng index closing a net 46.69 higher at 5,653.84 after profit-taking had dragged it down from the day's peak of 5,671.97. Turnover, however, was down to a modest HKDollars 1.29bn from Monday's HKDollars 1.39bn and investors were said to be awaiting the result of today's meeting of the Airport Committee, which comprises Chinese and British diplomats and Hong Kong officials, amid hopes that a deadlock over financing the HKDollars 175bn new airport project will be broken. Individual counters attracted bargain hunting, with Jardine Matheson finishing HKDollars 1.50 ahead at HKDollars 52. HSBC Holdings was the most active stock, steady at HKDollars 55. AUSTRALIA reversed three days of advances with a 6.2 retreat in the All Ordinaries index to 1,530.4. Turnover came to 96m shares worth ADollars 246.7m. Activity focused on BHP and Foster's after the former announced that it had taken a 32 per cent stake in the brewer. BHP receded 26 cents to ADollars 12.48, while Foster's relinquished 13 cents to ADollars 1.46 with some 14.3m shares traded. News Corp rose 40 cents to ADollars 22.94, recovering half of Monday's drop. In the banking sector, Westpac firmed 2 cents to ADollars 3. SINGAPORE failed to sustain an early advance, uncertain about whether Wall Street would hold on to Monday's gains. The Straits Times Industrial index closed just 3.02 up at 1,383.42, after reaching 1,390.34. Volume improved to 35.34m shares from 25.33m. Keppel Corp, the diversified conglomerate with its core businesses in shipbuilding and ship repairing, rose steadily from SDollars 5.95 to SDollars 6.40 but retreated to close at SDollars 6.15 after sellers emerged. SEOUL cooled its heels after two weeks of wide fluctuations, the composite index losing 6.49 to 544.82 in the absence of institutional support. Institutions have been required for the past three weeks to be net buyers of stocks to comply with government market-boosting measures, but profit-taking in big manufacturing shares, which led the recent rally, contributed to the market's fall. TAIWAN moved lower initially after Monday's 2.7 per cent fall, but then staged a technical rebound to close higher on the day, although brokers said investor confidence remained very weak. The weighted index, down more than 50 points at first, ended 31.68 up on the session at 3,716.72. Turnover stayed thin but increased to TDollars 18.2bn from TDollars 17.4bn. Buyers stepped into the market just before the close, focusing on export-related electronics shares, which could benefit from the recent depreciation of the Taiwan dollar. NEW ZEALAND finished a moderately dull session little changed, the NZSE-40 index gaining 1.17 at 1,480.26, after an intraday high of 1,491.26. Brewery shares remained firm but showed little extension of Monday's gains. Lion Nathan rose 4 cents to NZDollars 4.50 and Brierley Investments put on a cent to 90 cents. MANILA gained strength as PLDT rose on a good overnight performance in the US. Its shares advanced 20 pesos to 995 pesos, while the composite index added 10.76 at 1,429.27. Combined turnover fell to 173m pesos from 344m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's highs on lack of follow-through support. The composite index was finally 2.17 up at 585.91. Rises outpaced falls by 120 to 98 after volume of 53.3m shares, against 48.3m on Monday. BANGKOK paused following a period of gains ahead of Sunday's general election. The SET index eased 0.21 to 817.74 in a turnover of Bt11.5bn. BOMBAY climbed 3.8 per cent after the Indian government's opening of stock markets to foreign institutional investors, the BSE index closing 135.44 higher at 3,410.29.</p>

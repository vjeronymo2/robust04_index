			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / The Long View: French without fears IT IS HIGH time to restructure your economic model or, better, to throw it away. If you feed in the current economic data for the British economy your screen is liable to flash up the message 'does not compute'. Judging by the foreign trade data Britain must be booming, with the monthly current account deficit for December jumping to Pounds 1.54bn and imports 7 1/2 per cent higher than a year earlier. We also know that industrial production is down and unemployment is shooting up. Meanwhile it looks as though the narrow version of the money supply, M0, is bursting through the 4 per cent ceiling of its official target growth range, while in complete contrast the broad version, M4, is slowing down to a degree - growth of just 3.7 per cent year-on-year - which is beginning to alarm monetarists. This week the traditional signs of British economic mismanagement were strongly in evidence. A hasty and ill-prepared one-point cut in short-term interest rates was ordered on Tuesday, but on Wednesday the Pounds 2.5bn auction of 14-year gilt-edged almost flopped, which is especially disturbing given that it is only the first of many such sales which the Bank of England will have to organise this year. Meanwhile share prices jumped for joy at the hints of further devaluation and inflation to come, although rights issues from struggling retailers have brought a reminder that in buoyant markets unselective demand tends to encourage low quality supply. With excellent timing, brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd produced on Tuesday the latest edition of their Equity &amp; Gilt Study, the one which annually spells out just how much of a swindle gilts have proved to be over the years. During the entire 74 years of the study gilts have returned just 1.2 per cent pre-tax a year on average after inflation, which means that a taxpayer would almost certainly have suffered a real loss. In contrast, equities have returned an inflation-adjusted 7.3 per cent (income plus capital growth). The defrauding of gilt-edged investors has varied considerable in its intensity, however. The worst period was in the 30 years or so after the war, during which a gilt-edged portfolio lost three-quarters of its real value even with gross income reinvested. But recently things have got much better. Over the past ten years, with the Thatcher government getting a grip on the economy and then with John Major taking the UK into the European exchange rate mechanism, real returns on gilts have averaged a very acceptable 6 per cent a year. Honest money was being restored. Indeed, in 1992, despite our exit from the ERM, the gross return on gilt-edged was 17 per cent while inflation was only 4 per cent. But the reversal of policy now appears to be almost complete. Remember that a year ago short-term interest rates were at 10 1/2 per cent and the overwhelming policy objective was the reduction of inflation. Now, interest rates are at 6 per cent and could easily be below 5 per cent soon. That is one reason why the money supply numbers are going haywire. But the government is being panicked by the unemployment figures. If the price of an economic recovery is another dive in the sterling exchange rate, the government now seems unlikely to resist it, and will simply ignore any 'temporary' overshooting of its 4 per cent tolerance limit for underlying inflation: the falls in mortgage rates will, of course, ensure that the headline rate for inflation will remain very low, at least until the early part of 1994. By a curious coincidence the German inflation rate hit 4.4 per cent this week. But you can be sure that the Bundesbank will not relax its struggle, whereas the Bank of England has to do the bidding of its masters at the Treasury. I am surprised by just how cynical institutional investors in the City of London have become about the prospects of being given a fair deal in gilts as the government cranks up its huge borrowing spree. Certainly, given the choice between ten-year gilts yielding 8.1 per cent and French government bonds yielding 7.9 per cent it is easy to see why a lot of British institutions prefer the Parisian paper. British pension funds now have more money - twice as much, the latest figures suggest - in foreign bonds than in gilts, and if these attitudes persist a funding crunch could be closer than I have supposed. In this context, a fascinating chapter of the BZW study is highly relevant. Using an optimisation model the brokers suggest that on the basis of the historical data a rational UK investor would not hold any gilts in a long-term portfolio; he should either hold 100 per cent in equities, or a proportion of short-term deposits if he wishes to reduce the volatility. The implication is that in the past gilts have not yielded a big enough margin over cash to reward the extra risk. Indeed, until four months ago long gilts were yielding less than money market deposits. In opening an increasing gap between short-term and long-term rates Norman Lamont is beginning to address this problem. But he is also, of course, sending out strong hints to the foreign exchange market that he is prepared to allow sterling to slide. What about the other method of steepening the yield curve, by pushing up the yields on long gilts from 9 to 10 or 11 per cent? Such were the hair-raising tactics used in the 1970s. But in those days British institutions were a captive market because they could not invest overseas. Nowadays their response to official desperation is likely to be an increasing determination to seek refuge in better currencies. As for the government, the economic computers may be on the blink and the way ahead is obscure. But we have the historical statistics that tell us how administrations like this one behave.</p>

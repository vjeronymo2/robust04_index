			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Sting in tail of court's judgment THE constitutional court's judgment on President Boris Yeltsin's appeal to the Russian people was described yesterday by a court official as 'very mild'. But on closer inspection the judgment has all the mildness of a ticking time bomb. The official noted that the preamble to the judgment expressed understanding of the president's desire to provide stability in Russia, and that the ruling did not demand impeachment. It is true the preamble stresses that the court agrees on the need to end the crisis over the division of powers, on the need to continue political and economic reform and to safeguard the unity and integrity of the country. It is also true that there is no call for impeachment, though the Interfax news agency said such a clause had been in early drafts of the judgment. Further, the judgment is careful to say that the two notorious articles of the constitution which give all power to the congress - articles 104 and 109  -cannot be taken at face value, but must be read in conjunction with other articles - 1, 3, 72 and 81 - which guarantee the principle of the division of powers. In the past Mr Yeltsin and his supporters have pointed to articles 104 and 109 as proof that the Soviet-era constitution which still governs the powers of the different levels of government is simply impossible to work with. But the conclusion to the six-page judgment is, in constitutional terms, devastating. The president is judged to have broken nine provisions of the constitution, and various provisions of the federal treaty which Mr Yeltsin signed with leaders of the autonomous republics, regions and districts of Russia. The verdict by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, yesterday that there were clear grounds for impeachment of the president has a clear legal basis. The one concession made is to say that Mr Yeltsin has a right to ask the people for an expression of trust in himself. But he is not, in the court's view, constitutionally able to pose a question of relative trust between himself and the parliament (as he has said he wishes to do), nor can he ask the people who they wish to lead the country - president or parliament. By centring all power into his own office, says the judgment, he destroys the principle of division of powers. He cannot hold a referendum on a new constitution nor on a new electoral law without the permission of congress, since that breaks a key provision of article 104. Above all, his declaration of 'special rule' is provided for only in extraordinary situations (which do not at present exist), and according to a set order, which has not been followed. The judgment is thus 'mild' only in relation to what it was thought it might say. In fact, to have stated that the president must be impeached would have transgressed the court's powers and intruded on those of congress, which must make that decision. Its preamble merely says that it agrees that life should improve. The power of the court's judgment lies in the rehearsal of what it believes to be the breaches of the constitution. Mr Yeltsin and his supporters have never seriously proposed that they were acting within the constitution: they have cast doubt on the constitution itself, called the court biased and said that they will ignore its findings. Most seriously, the judgment presents the congress - expected to meet on Friday - with a momentous decision. It must either vote for impeachment as Mr Khasbulatov urges, or, if it backs away, face political oblivion.</p>

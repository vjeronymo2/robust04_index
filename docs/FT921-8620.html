			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Arts: Die Eroberung von Mexiko - Hamburg Wolfgang Rihm's commission from the Hamburg Staatsoper is his fifth work for the opera house, though he has shrunk from calling them 'operas' and settled instead for the more neutral, capacious description of 'music theatre'. But Die Eroberung von Mexiko ("The Conquest of Mexico") makes a thrilling piece of music drama on the grandest imaginable operatic scale, with its requirement for orchestral ensembles to be dispersed around the auditorium, pre-recorded tapes, a huge chorus, and singers and speakers in the pit who 'shadow' the voices of the onstage protagonists. It also deals in big and intrinsically dramatic cultural ideas, chronicling the arrival in pre-Christian Mexico of Cortez and his conquistadores and their bloody subjugation of the native people and their beliefs. The confrontation between Cortez and the Mexican god-king Montezuma is at its core, and that clash of larger-than-life personalities was the starting point for Rihm's libretto, which he has based upon Antonin Artaud's 1934 outline scenario of the same name. Other textual references are drawn into the dramatic net too - the poetry of Octavio Paz, for instance - but in many ways the treatment of Die Eroberung is far more direct than in Rihm's previous large-scale dramatic pieces: there is none of the bundling of myths and philosophical commentaries to be found in his Hamlet maschine and Oedipus from the 1980s which, together with Rihm's Artaud ballet Tutuguri from 1982, are the new work's likeliest precursors. What is carried over from these works is the economy of dramatic means; there is no clutter of superfluous characters to supply local colour, no weighing-down narrative to impede the action. The text focuses upon Montezuma and Cortez, the clash of masculine and feminine, animus and anima; to underline that the Mexican king is sung by a soprano onstage (the wonderfully eloquent and assured Renate Behle) and doubled by high soprano and contralto in the pit. The Spaniard is portrayed by a baritone (the light-toned, sympathetic Richard Salter) and reinforced by two narrators offstage. The part of Malinche, the go-between for the Spanish, is taken by a mime and danced with automata-like compulsiveness by Miriam Goldschmidt. Though the synopsis identifies four distinct parts - Prologue, Confession, Overthrow, Abdication - the action moves seamlessly, wonderfully paced. The opening section presents a potent image of a 'waiting Mexico' dominated by magic and intuition. The music and action grows steadily out of nothingness. Percussion figures are tossed around the auditorium, muttering choruses begin to well up are heard, and identifiable vocal lines begin to define themselves. Elsewhere there is an astonishing range of vocal and instrumental effects, always precisely focused - massive choral outpourings (recalling the power and weight of Rihm's Dies, heard in London last year), sensuous melodic lines wrapped around the entwined voices, fierce declamatory explosions, threatening rhythmic chanting, snatches of consoling tonality. Without a complete score or libretto it was impossible to determine how much of the detailed dramaturgy of the Hamburg staging that counterpoints the musical scheme is part of Rihm's prescription, and how much the work of the director/designer Peter Mussbach. After the horrors of Mussbach's Idomeneo in Amsterdam last year it is reassuring to encounter a production as visually stunning and dramatically cogent as this. With bold, simple geometric designs and the use of primary colours, he never obscures the action, and finds images that complement precisely Rihm's aural imagination. Die Eroberung von Mexiko ends with the sight of a huge black cube, teetering obliquely downstage; inside it are Cortez and Malinche, trapped in irresolvable conflict, while the music fades out on a luscious, unaccompanied duet for Montezuma and Cortez that seems on first hearing as haunting as anything in contemporary opera. It is an important new work.</p>

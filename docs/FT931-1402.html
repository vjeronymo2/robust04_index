			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian investment board clears bauxite growth plan INDIA'S PUBLIC Investment Board has cleared a proposal by the government-owned National Aluminium Company (Nalco) to expand the bauxite mining capacity from 2.4m tonnes to 4.8m tonnes and alumina refining from 800,000 tonnes to 1.35m tonnes. But it has put on hold the proposed 50 per cent capacity expansion of Nalco's aluminium smelting to 345,000 tonnes. The PIB decision has been influenced by two factors. First, domestic demand for aluminium falls far short of the industry's total production capacity of 610,000 tonnes; and second, Indian power costs are high. India has, however, an abundant supply of rich bauxite and low manpower cost for producing alumina. All the additional production will be earmarked for export. For the expansion of the mines and alumina refinery at Koraput in Orissa, Nalco will be using technology from Aluminium Pechiney of France, its original collaborator. The big alumina export boost will come in the next four years when three export oriented refineries of a combined capacity of 2.9m tonnes are commissioned - all in Orissa, which accounts for 1.5bn tonnes of metallurgical grade bauxite out of India's total reserve of 2.44bn tonnes.</p>

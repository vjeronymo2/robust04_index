			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD BANK PLANS TO BOOST GULF AID  </P> <P> The World Bank said Thursday it expects to channel an extra $4 billion over the  next two years to countries hard hit by the economic fallout of the Persian  Gulf crisis.  </P> <P> Alex Shakow, director of external affairs for the bank, said the extra cash  would be meant to cushion social and economic disruption caused by the crisis.  </P> <P> Increased funds, generated either by speeding up payments or by increased  allocation of resources, would be aimed primarily at the three "front-line  states" -- Egypt, Jordan and Turkey -- and at nations in Eastern Europe and the  Indian subcontinent.  </P> <P> The World Bank, together with the International Monetary Fund and major  industrialized nations, has campaigned for increased funding for countries hit  by spiraling oil prices or a sudden drop in remittances by expatriate workers.  </P></p>

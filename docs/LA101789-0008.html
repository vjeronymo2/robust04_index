			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIGOTRY ON CAMPUSES  </P> <P> What Slaughter has to say is, sadly, very true; I have perceived what he  describes. But my perception is that bigotry is but a part of a swelling tide  of intolerance in this country. The mood began seeping to the surface during  the Reagan Administration, which made us feel comfortable with our prejudices.  Not only are blacks' civil rights being threatened, but also the civil rights  of other minorities and women.  </P> <P> What a striking coincidence that this mood of bigotry and intolerance is  worsening as Christian fundamentalists are becoming more politically active. It  seems that the Christianity of these religious fanatics is based on  intolerance, conformity and ignorance.  </P> <P> KATHRYN S. TARBELL  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

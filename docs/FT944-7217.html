			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia Investments declines to Pounds 22.7m Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 25m to Pounds 22.7m in the six months to September 30 and warned that it would be 'challenging' to improve on last year's record Pounds 45.2m annual profits. The shares fell 25p to 660p, compared with net assets of 645p, down from 681p at the start of the year. Operating profits, which exclude disposal gains, edged up to Pounds 23m (Pounds 22m) helped by a strong improvement at Exco, the recently floated money broker where Caledonia retains a 27 per cent stake. But Exco has warned of subdued trading in the third quarter, while Bristow Helicopters, Caledonia's other large associate, is suffering from increased competition and reduced activity in the North Sea. In addition, Caledonia has made two significant investments recently which will not contribute to its results until next year. It has spent Dollars 44m (Pounds 26.8m) on a one-third interest in Sun International Investments, which owns the Paradise Island resort in the Bahamas; and it has paid Pounds 20m for a 29.9 per cent holding in Ivory &amp; Sime, the Edinburgh-based fund management group. After a higher tax charge, earnings per share dropped to 16p (18.9p), but the interim dividend is raised by 0.3p to 5.7p. Of the 36p drop in assets per share over the first half, 20p represents the write-off of goodwill on the Ivory &amp; Sime acquisition. Caledonia has written off a total of 60p a share of purchased goodwill. 'By any objective yardstick it is hard to regard this write-off as necessary,' the company said. Assets per share have also been affected in the period by the fall in value of Caledonia's stakes in The Telegraph and Close Brothers. Trading profits rose to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 2.3m) reflecting progress at Amber, Abacus and, particularly, Clan Asset Management.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Russia applies for entry to WTO Russia yesterday applied to join the new World Trade Organisation, a day after the formal decision to launch the WTO next month. Mr Oleg Davydov, Russia's trade minister, said his country was determined to continue trade liberalisation and was ready to comply with WTO rules and disciplines. Russian membership would permit the new organisation to become 'truly universal', he said. Moscow applied to join the 124-member General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last year and these negotiations, on trade in goods, are well under way. Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, welcomed Russia's WTO move. He said it showed a willingness to drive trade and economic reforms forward 'with vigour'. WTO entry will require Russia to open markets for services as well as goods and enforce international rules to protect intellectual property. Trade officials said yesterday that if all went well Russia could join the WTO in 1996. Meanwhile, China's chief Gatt negotiator, Mr Long Yongtu, told Gatt's annual meeting yesterday that Beijing's decision to set a year-end deadline for concluding 'the substantive stage' of its Gatt/WTO entry negotiations had 'begun to play a positive role' in the eight-year-old talks. This view contrasts with earlier remarks by trade diplomats from the US, the EU and other western nations, who say negotiations are not going well.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / People: AITC picks stockbroker The Association of Investment Trust Companies has again gone outside the immediate confines of the industry to find its next boss, replacing Philip Chappell, who retired last November because of ill health. Ernest Fenton, who had latterly been chairman and chief executive of Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers, has spent almost all his working life in stockbroking, having joined W Greenwell in 1968. Chappell, credited with having greatly raised the profile of the investment trust business, had a largely merchant banking background. 'We wanted another fresh face,' says AITC chairman Paul Manduca. 'He has run a business, he has good communication skills and he is steeped in the City.' Fenton, 54, whose Scottish pedigree will be regarded as an asset in an important quarter of the industry, says he has become increasingly interested in investments trusts in recent years; he was closely involved in setting up the Fleming Income &amp; Capital investment trust a year ago and has gone on its board. Greenwell Montagu Stockbrokers was merged into James Capel last autumn as a result of the Hongkong Bank takeover of Midland. Whereas Chappell, who spent only two or three days a week on the job, was plain old 'director' at the AITC, Fenton becomes the association's 'director-general', a full-time position, reflecting how the business has grown. 'Clearly there is still a big job to do in educating the consumer about investment trusts,' Manduca says, adding that work has just begun on convincing independent financial advisers of the industry's merits. 'But Fenton will need to be more methodical and planned in what he does. You cannot expect investment trusts to lift their marketing expenditure in the current climate of falling dividends across British industry. In the short-term, he will have to use existing resources more effectively'. ***** Lord Stevens steps down as chairman of Drayton Far Eastern Trust and is replaced by Sir Michael Richardson, chairman of Smith New Court, who has been on the board of the trust for 29 years.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Kaiser Aluminum Finishes Restructuring: Oakland-based Kaiser Aluminum said it  sold its 20% stake in Boyne Smelters Ltd. of Australia for an undisclosed  amount. As a result, Kaiser "has substantially completed" its restructuring  program, the company said. Kaiser Aluminum, which is owned by Los Angeles-based  Maxxam Inc., has received net cash proceeds of about $452 million from the sale  of various assets so far this year. Most of the money was used to retire debt,  which now stands at about $220 million, down from $606 million at the end of  1988.  </P></p>

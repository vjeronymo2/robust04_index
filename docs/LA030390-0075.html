			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN ONE;  </P> <P> COLD WAR OF WORDS HEATS UP;  </P> <P> ACADEMICS DEBATE THE DECLINE OF OLD-GUARD COMMUNISM IN EASTERN EUROPE. HAS  SOCIALISM BEEN DEFEATED OR REINVIGORATED?  </P> <P> Economics professor Richard Wolff expected 150 academics to attend a scholarly  conference entitled "Rethinking Marxism." Instead, about 1,500 showed up at the  meeting at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, straining hotels,  restaurants and auditoriums.  </P> <P> When Wolff began planning the event in the fall of 1988, Stalinist regimes  controlled Eastern Europe and perestroika was in its early stages in the Soviet  Union. But by the time the meeting took place several months ago, the world had  changed.  </P> <P> According to Wolff and other leftist scholars, the huge turnout proves that  there is more interest than ever in Marxism among U.S. academics -- despite  claims to the contrary by their conservative counterparts.  </P> <P> The upheaval in the communist world "has made many more Americans who are  interested in Marxism feel much more comfortable about saying so," said Wolff,  who conceded that some people may find that ironic. "When this Cold War stuff  ebbs and cracks and breaks down, we can openly debate and explain without a  shadow."  </P> <P> Beyond any political debate, the events in Eastern Europe have sparked  intellectual turmoil on American college campuses. There is a nervous rush to  update textbooks made obsolete by daily headlines. Yet there is excitement  about new research opportunities, and there is professorial pleasure that  students are becoming more passionate about history, economics and human  rights.  </P> <P> Conservative scholars are gloating over the West's supposed victory in the Cold  War and predict a steep decline in the study of Marxism. And socialist  professors are saying the changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have  freed them from perceived ties with the abuses of Stalinism while depriving  conservatives of their anti-Soviet intellectual anchor.  </P> <P> Wolff and other like-minded professors maintain that the overthrown leaders in  Eastern Europe enforced repressive policies that perverted true socialism.  </P> <P> "The slogan I came up with is: 'Socialism is dead. Long live Socialism,' " said  Anatole Anton, a professor at San Francisco State University who teaches  Marxist philosophy and describes himself as a democratic socialist. "The old  model of statist, authoritarian socialism really has been dealt a death blow.  That sweeps the slate clean and asks intellectuals to think about the meaning  of democratic socialism."  </P> <P> Besides, Anton and others say, few on the left had kept faith with the  pre-glasnost communist systems.  </P> <P> It is wrong, Anton said, for conservatives to assume that American-style  capitalism will suddenly blossom in places such as Romania and Bulgaria.  Rather, he predicted, nations whose governments have been overthrown will look  to such countries as Sweden -- with its mixture of state planning, private  enterprise and social welfare benefits -- as models.  </P> <P> At Columbia University, undergraduates are asking history professor Martha  Howell about whether socialism is indeed in its death throes. But Howell, who  is chairwoman of the Radical History Review, a publication that often  interprets history from a Marxist point of view, tells them that the toppled  Stalinist regimes in Eastern Europe gave socialism a black eye.  </P> <P> "What you want to do is get students in the class to think about how socialist  states, as they existed post-war, failed to deliver the democracy as promised  by the theorists. I think anybody who has worked in the history naturally makes  those distinctions. But the average student doesn't," Howell said.  </P> <P> On the other side of the political spectrum in academia, conservative scholars  insist that their long-held beliefs have proven true: that now-toppled Eastern  European governments never had popular support and that the American military  buildup under the Reagan Administration encouraged the changes. Marxism, they  say, is challenged in each day's headlines, and teaching about it faces a grim  future in American higher education.  </P> <P> "My feeling is that we hard-liners have been right all along," said Richard  Pipes, history professor at Harvard University and former director of East  European and Soviet affairs for the National Security Council in the Reagan  Administration. "I think we have been completely vindicated." Only the speed of  the changes in Eastern Europe surprised him, Pipes said.  </P> <P> Pipes and others predict a resulting decline in student interest in Marxism in  the United States, although they believe that interest in the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe will continue to mushroom.  </P> <P> Stephen H. Balch -- president of the National Association of Scholars, an  organization with conservative ties -- believes that a new generation of  scholars will shun socialism. "They will start to learn the lessons of the  world and will show more of an unwillingness to naively imbibe all that stuff,"  said Balch, an associate professor of government at John Jay College of  Criminal Justice in New York.  </P> <P> Students, he said, will become more interested in the nuts and bolts of making  economies and governments work.  </P> <P> "I don't know how they are going to cope," Pipes said of the intellectual left,  dismissing its claims of rejuvenation.  </P> <P> But their opponents argue that it will be the conservatives who have trouble  coping. They say the self-congratulation among conservative scholars masks a  deeper insecurity. The theory that the Soviet system was inflexible -- as made  famous by former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeane J. Kirkpatrick --  has proven false, the liberal scholars insist.  </P> <P> "Fear of the Soviet Union has been the basis of conservative power and thought  in America since about 1948. Or I should say manipulation of fear of  communism," said Jon Wiener, history professor at UC Irvine. "What will hold  conservatism together now that conservatives have really lost the bedrock of  their interpretation?"  </P> <P> Whatever their political persuasion, however, scholars in Soviet and Eastern  European studies are tossing old assumptions into the dustbin of academia.  </P> <P> "It is a tremendous upheaval," said Richard Lyman, former president of Stanford  University, who is now director of its Institute for International Studies. "A  whole lot of stuff written even recently has to be read with a red pencil on  every page. I think it's a very big problem for everybody teaching in relevant  areas."  </P> <P> The result has been a rush to update textbooks to reflect the revolutions in  the Soviet bloc.  </P> <P> "Textbooks are very far behind," said Christopher S. Allen, assistant professor  of political science at the University of Georgia at Athens. He and his  co-authors are updating a book on European politics but worry that the  revisions will be out of date by publication. Allen and several professors  across the country report that they have stopped using certain texts and are  requiring students to read foreign-affairs coverage in daily newspapers.  </P> <P> Much past scholarship concentrated on power struggles within communist parties  and on centralized economic planning within the communist system. Now, scholars  say, there is a flurry of interest in the lesser-known aspects of Soviet and  Eastern European life -- churches, unions, underground economies, pre-World War  II political parties and ethnic minorities.  </P> <P> Glasnost will help, everyone agrees, by opening to Western researchers an  enormous amount of previously suppressed information about the Soviet system.  </P> <P> "The material coming out now is very exciting indeed," said Robert Conquest, a  senior research fellow in Soviet history and international affairs at the  Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford. He likened some  past scholarship about the Soviet Union to writing about ancient Roman history  by contemplating ruins and reading a few memoirs.  </P> <P> With the situation so much in flux, many scholars are reluctant to predict what  might happen in Eastern Europe, said Conquest, who is working on a new edition  of his book about Stalinist terrors.  </P> <P> "Somebody asked me: 'Will Gorbachev win the political struggle?' And I said,  'Look, at 10 o'clock in the morning on the day of the battle you couldn't  predict the outcome of . . . Waterloo.' " Gorbachev's policies, according to  Conquest, are "that of a guy going down the Grand Canyon in a canoe. He doesn't  want to sink."  </P> <P> William Tabb, economics and sociology professor at Queens College in New York,  said one of the hardest tasks will be deciding what is worthwhile to save from  past research. On the right, the idea is discredited that the Soviet system is  incapable of change, he said. But so is leftist ideology that the now-toppled  communist governments in Eastern Europe were evolving toward democracy.  </P> <P> "So much of what was written was so off base," Tabb said. "The presumptions,  the assumptions were so far off the mark."  </P> <P> But despite the turmoil, there is exhilaration that students want to delve more  deeply into the dramatic changes.  </P> <P> "This provides a wonderful opportunity in the classroom to examine 20th-Century  history and the complexity of politics," said Howell of Columbia.  </P> <P> Professors across the nation report significant increases in student enrollment  in classes dealing with the Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've suddenly improved as a teacher," Andrei S. Markovits,  political science professor at Boston University, remarked about the more  crowded classrooms. "There is just an awareness that this is a momentous time."  </P> <P> Larry Caldwell, a Soviet affairs expert who teaches political science at  Occidental College, described his students as "irrepressible" in their urge to  discuss current events, even when the day's lecture is about medieval Russian  history.  </P> <P> "The challenge for me is how to get students to look at the longer-term trends  and the broader picture when their interest is so consumed by the headlines,"  Caldwell said. "And I don't mean that critically because the headlines are so  interesting."  </P> <P> At USC, international relations professor Steven Lamy also said that student  excitement must be channeled into more than celebration about the end of the  Cold War. "Most students are running around like we just won the Rose Bowl,"  Lamy said, referring to campus reaction to the toppling of the Berlin Wall. He  said he now wants students to focus on the many economic and environmental  problems that remain worldwide.  </P> <P> Madeleine Albright, international relations professor at Georgetown University,  said she is urging students to "free themselves from old thinking" -- to be  wary of scholars with vested interests.  </P> <P> "It's hard even for students between 18 and 22 to take a leap and think about  the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe being different. They are nervous about  treading new ground," she said. "So I tell them I don't have the answers and  that I am exploring new ground with them."  </P></p>

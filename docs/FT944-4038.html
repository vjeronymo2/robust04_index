			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Move to end transport funding dispute The European Commission yesterday moved to end a dispute with European Union ministers over funding for multi-billion dollar road and rail links in an effort to sharpen EU competitiveness. Under pressure from France, which is keen to press ahead with a fast rail link to Belgium and Germany, the Commission said it would be willing to draw down a further Ecu1.2bn (Pounds 932m) of EU budget reserves to supplement the Ecu1.9bn already allocated to the 14 infrastructure projects under the Union's high profile Trans European Networks programme. Mr Henning Christophersen, the commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs, said there were no objections to the proposal from member states as it would not increase the overall EU budget. 'There are many difficulties we can expect as far as financing these projects is concerned,' said Mr Christophersen, after talking to EU heads of state at the European summit in Essen. 'One difficulty will be a lack of equity.' The decision to draw on extra funds may go some way to easing tensions between Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and economics and finance ministers of the member states. Mr Delors has persistently argued that without extra public funding, many of the projects will not get off the ground. His will, however, has been frustrated by the more cautious economics ministers who believe sufficient resources already exist - from existing EU funds, national exchequers, loans from the European Investment Bank and the private sector. They were worried that excessive EU borrowing would create inflationary pressures and unsettle financial markets. 'Mr Delors believes that for infrastructure projects, free enterprise is not always enough,' said a Commission official. To secure the extra resources for the Ecu91bn projects, the Commission must be asked formally to put forward a proposal to the council of ministers. 'Some member states have asked if we can have additional resources. My answer is Yes if the European council asks us to do so,' said Mr Christophersen. A working group headed by Mr Christophersen has identified 14 priority projects. These include high-speed rail links from Paris to Strasbourg and Munich to Berlin; a rail-road tunnel through the Brenner pass in Italy; motorway routes between Lisbon in Portugal and Valladolid in Spain; the Channel tunnel link and development of Milan's Malpensa airport. After talks on the Trans European Networks programme, European heads of state backed a report drawn up by experts from across the Union. This report also proposes adoption of 10 international energy network projects plus pan-European air traffic control measures. So far, financing is only in place for three of the 14 priority projects. These are the airport at Milan, the Cork-Dublin-Belfast-Stranraer rail link and a fixed road and rail link between Denmark and Sweden. The Commission has meanwhile received requests for funding of more than Ecu2bn for three other of the listed projects, including a high-speed train linking Paris, Brussels, Cologne, Amsterdam and London. Reluctant to encourage further EU borrowing, Mr Christophersen has argued that member states should find more imaginative and more efficient financial arrangements. Financing is not always the principal reason for delay in the other areas. Administrative problems and different regulatory programmes between member states have also acted as a hindrance. Mr Christophersen's report says governments must work to change regulations that hinder development and to ensure co-ordination to avoid basic problems such as different electrical systems.</p>

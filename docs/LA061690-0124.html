			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAMES MOODY AT ELARIO'S: MORE THAN JUST SAX  </P> <P> Jazzman James Moody says that a true master can handle many instruments with  equal ease. Wednesday, the first of his five nights at Elario's, he proved that  he practices what he preaches. Exotic streams of bebop-based invention came  from tenor and alto saxes and flute, and even his quirky singing voice.  </P> <P> Backed by locals Bob Magnusson on bass, Jim Plank on drums and Harry Pickens on  piano, Moody started off on tenor for Tadd Dameron's "Good Faith," with  extended solos by Moody and Pickens.  </P> <P> Next came "Yesterdays" (by Jerome Kern, not Paul McCartney), with Moody  switching to flute. Pickens settled in as the rhythm section's glue, building  rhythmic undercurrents with his subtle chord combinations.  </P> <P> Pickens' gave his right hand the full run of the keyboard on an extended solo.  He's a thoughtful, percussive player reminiscent of McCoy Tyner, but with a  more cerebral, calculating approach.  </P> <P> On saxes, Moody shows the same kind of intensity that characterized his  earliest work with Dizzy Gillespie in the late 1940s. Long strings of notes  tumbled out with a precision that forced both an intellectual and emotional  response. How does a guy play so fast without the squeals and squeaks that  sneak from the horns of mere mortals?  </P> <P> "Moody's Mood for Love" featured Moody's facile voice handling both male and  female parts in a love dialogue. He also sang "Happy Birthday" to a friend in  the audience, improvising a series of exotic yodels. There's an album worth of  singing in this guy.  </P> <P> "I Can't Get Started With You," a tender ballad, provided the first set's  highlight, as Moody hoisted his alto to put on an amazing display of  virtuosity, sliding from bright, clear highs to buttery smooth lows.  </P> <P> If there was an overall disappointment, it was that he often yielded solo space  when his own playing was just hitting the hot zone, especially on "Cherokee"  and "Hey Jim."  </P></p>

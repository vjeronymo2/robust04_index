			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 18 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Since the  1990's, the government in Beijing has vigorously encouraged  mainland enterprises to go overseas for development, build  transnational groups, participate in international stock markets  and purchasing activities, and strengthen their ability to  compete.    Mainland enterprises' transnational business activities are  developing step by step along the "mainland-Hong Kong-overseas"  route. In the beginning, businesses primarily concentrated on  commerce, trade, resources development, contracting for  construction projects, transportation and communication, and  international tourism. Up to the end of last year, the total  number of overseas enterprises reached 4,500 in 120 countries  and regions throughout the world.    The Hong Kong-based China-funded large enterprises -- such  as  the China Resources group, China Merchants Steam Navigation  group, China Travel Service group, CITIC Pacific group,  Everbright group, and Guangdong group -- have indeed developed  into transnational corporations, and their business channels  have already reached out to many destinations overseas. The  mainland enterprises which are listed in Hong Kong, such as  Tsingtao Brewery Company Limited, Beiren Printing Machinery  Holdings Limited, Guangzhou Shipyard International Company  Limited, Maanshan Iron and Steel, Shanghai Petrochemical Company  Limited, Yizheng Chemical Fiber, and Kunming Machine Tools, as  well as the several companies which are listed in the United  States, have in fact taken the first step toward becoming  transnational companies.    Over the past two or three years, proceeding from trading  companies, the mainland's overseas enterprises have one after  another organized comprehensive commercial associations, that  is, have grouped together some overseas enterprises and a large  number of medium and small enterprises which are not very  strong, to form transnational groups which possess great  strength. For example, 20 large enterprises in Beijing, which  engage in different trades, have organized themselves into a  joint-stock transnational group, which possesses strong points  in the areas of trading, industry, science, agriculture, and  commerce and is vigorously exploring the market in Latin  America. In Shanghai, approximately 480 overseas enterprises  have recently reorganized themselves into five major overseas  groups of companies situated in America, Oceania, the  Commonwealth of Independent States, Japan, and Hong Kong. Early  this year, the West Europe Group of Companies was founded.    At the same time, the mainland authorities are encouraging  large enterprises to go overseas for development. For example,  in an international bid at the end of 1992, Shoudu Iron and  Steel Corporation bought the Peru Iron Mine, which had been  losing money for years; one year later, the loss-making  situation stopped and profits began to roll in, amounting to $7  million. One and a half years ago, the Shoudu Iron and Steel  Corporation joined hands with Li Ka-shing to buy the Tung Wing  group in Hong Kong; thereafter, it bought four listed companies  in Hong Kong and set up its Hong Kong and U.S. headquarters.  For example, the CITIC group recently bought Australia's  largest meat processing enterprise at a price of 100 million  Australian dollars, and the China National Petroleum Corporation  joined hands with a Japanese company and a Chinese company in  investing $1 billion in exploring and operating an oil zone in  central Papua New Guinea. These are some of the success stories.    Recently, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation  revealed that it will spend five years building a transnational  oil company, which will include a number of sole companies  limited and a number of joint-stock companies, with some  controlling a majority of shares while others holding a minority  of shares. At present, the company is exploring and building 11  oil fields, which are expected to produce 12 million tons of oil  and 4 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 1997. In the  past, the company has absorbed $3.8 billion of foreign funds and  has signed 94 contracts with 55 companies in the international  community; it has already acquired the scale of a big  international company, and will quickly develop into a  transnational petroleum group.    Mainland experts point out that, with the continuous  increase  in China's strength and its improvement of its operational  methods, by following the path taken by the Shoudu Iron and  Steel Corporation and the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation, China will have a large number of companies  developing into transnational groups.</p>

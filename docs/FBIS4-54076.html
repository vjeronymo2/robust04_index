			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Chongnyon Covers Proud Road Full of Victory and Glory" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- MINJU CHOSON today  dedicates an editorial to the 39th anniversary of the formation  of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan  (Chongnyon), a DPRK's dignified and authoritative organization  of Koreans overseas.    With the formation of Chongnyon on May 25, 1955, a proud new  history of the movement of Koreans overseas based on the chuche  idea was opened and, since then, the movement of Koreans  overseas has developed as a genuine national patriotic movement,  definitely getting on the track of chuche, the editorial notes,  and continues:    By adopting the policy of modeling its ranks on the chuche  idea as the main line, Chongnyon has thoroughly established the  chuche- based ideological system and leadership system in the  organization and fortified the singlehearted unity of the ranks  and firmly built up its ranks into a patriotic organization of  loyalty that would believe and follow always only the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il. In recent years, it has made a new progress in  preparing the younger generations as trustworthy successors to  the patriotic cause, thereby creating a firm guarantee for  stengthening and developing the Chongnyon organization into an  eternal chuche-based organization of the citizens overseas of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a patriotic  organisation.    Chongnyon has intensified the work of national unity among  the Koreans overseas under the banner of great national unity,  energetically waged the movement for national reunification as a  mass movement embracing all the compatriots in Japan and  strengthened friendship and unity with the world progressive  people including the Japanese people, contributing to winning  greater international support and solidarity for the socialist  cause of chuche, the cause of national reunification and the  patriotic cause of Chongnyon.    Although the situation has become complicated and the  reactionaries' moves against the DPRK and Chongnyon have become  more vicious, the Chongnyon officials and Koreans in Japan are  giving spurs to the consolidation of the Chongnyon organization  and fulfilment of patriotic tasks, deeply cherishing in their  minds the faith that they will certainly emerge victorious since  there is dear Comrade Kim Chong-il and the faith that the  patriotic ranks of Chongnyon united in one mind around the dear  leader are invincible.    The editorial notes that all achievements made by Chongnyon  are a great victory of the chuche-based idea of the respected  leader Comrade Kim Il-song on the movement of Koreans overseas  and a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership and paternal  loving care of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.</p>

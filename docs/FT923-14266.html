			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Man with a mission moves from Saab to Opel - Robert Taylor profiles David Herman, new chairman of General Motors' German subsidiary MR DAVID Herman arrives at the head office of Adam Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors, this morning with a mission to halt the profits slide by boosting productivity and cutting costs. He takes over after two-and-a-half years as president and chief executive of Saab Automobile, GM's joint venture with Saab-Scania, where he spearheaded a turnround in its performance despite the slump in the world car market. 'The underlying problem in Germany is inflation and high costs, but changes are coming at Opel,' he promises. 'I hope I can be part of the transition to improved competitiveness.' Mr Herman comes to his new post as Opel's chairman and managing director with clear lessons from his Swedish experience: to encourage greater flexibility and hold down excessive wage costs. During his spell at Saab he did not take the company back into profit but he pulled it through a difficult period. In the year before the company was formed out of Saab-Scania's car division in January 1990, it had make a SKr2.1bn (Dollars 384m) operating loss. Mr Herman says he does not know when Saab will be in the black, but its losses are likely to be much less this year than last year's SKr1.39bn deficit. Productivity has more than doubled. In early 1990, it took around 120 hours to build a Saab car. Now that figure is down to 58 hours. Although still far behind the Japanese 30 hours per car, it is in the mainstream of European auto production. It was achieved with plant closures and a cut of nearly one-third in the workforce. Latest sales figures suggest Saab is bucking the trend. In Europe, it increased sales in the first six months of the year by 16 per cent to 2,500 units, with a 66 per cent surge in Italy. In the vital US market in June, Saab recorded its highest monthly figure since August 1987, despite the recession. In Sweden, the Saab 9000 has topped the sales statistics for three out of the past four months. 'I have been the catalyst for change,' declares Mr Herman, but he is warm in his enthusiasm for the 'tremendous adaptability' of his Swedish workforce. 'When I arrived the arrows were not pointing in the right direction but now they are,' he explains. Absenteeism is down from 10 to less than 5 per cent and labour turnover has declined from 25 to less than 8 per cent. Mr Herman praises the Swedish trade unions for their positive response. 'It has been a partnership,' he asserts. 'Our labour people have not just been rubber stamps. The workforce has been involved in all the discussions. There is a real team spirit here.' Indeed, union leaders are disappointed at his departure, even though he was forced to close a new SKr1.3bn assembly plant in Malmo. The turnaround at Saab comes from its Swedish managers and workers. Only around 10 of its personnel were drafted in from outside by GM. The long, hard road back to profitability at Saab was made no easier by events outside the company's control. In particular, the low exchange rate of the US dollar against the over-valued Swedish krona has made it hard to recover in the US market. The chairman is critical of past Saab management. 'They were less willing to accept the burdens of responsibility for productivity problems,' Mr Herman suggests. What he believes he provided was a strong sense of leadership. Mr Herman did not bring the ways of Detroit to Sweden. He remained keen to work with the grain of the country's industrial culture. However, he also believes Saab is much more aware of the worldwide perspective. He also believes the true test of his time at Saab will not come until the company's new models are in the showrooms in the next few years. 'The product comes first before anything else,' Mr Herman argues. Saab is set to sell up to 100,000 cars this year compared with 87,500 in 1991, and he can see the day when the Trollhattan plant will turn out an annual figure of 150,000. With a new paint shop on stream and an extra 500 jobs to come, he declares that GM is not going to abandon Saab. 'There is no turning back,' he says.</p>

			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Observer: Official text Not many companies see fit to publish a corporate history after just 15 years in business. Even so The Argyll Story, which is all about Britain's third biggest grocery chain, the Safeway supermarket group, is unnecessarily slim. The unknown author could have made much more of the available material. After all, the most famous thing most people remember Argyll for is its ambitious Pounds 1.9bn bid for Distillers, a company more than three times its size. This earns only one paragraph with a vague reference to 'the intervention of Guinness' and Argyll's subsequent decision to withdraw from the drinks business. No mention, for example, of the resignation of James Gulliver, Argyll's chairman, said by some never to have recovered from his failure to win Distillers. It's tomes like this that give business biographies a bad name.</p>

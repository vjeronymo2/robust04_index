			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Nissan extends shake-up at troubled Spanish unit NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is looking to restructure its Spanish subsidiary, Nissan Motor Iberica, further and cut the workforce by 16 per cent over the next two years. It faces a further capital restructuring of the troubled Spanish majority-owned company, which is expected to involve a write-down of a significant part of its equity capital to comply with Spanish law on corporate solvency. The heavy losses have wiped out a large part of the company's net worth, and the losses in the second half of the year are expected to equal the first-half deficit. The Japanese carmaker had been planning to inject Pta10bn (Dollars 75.6m) in new equity into the company. However its room for financial action is being severely constrained by mounting losses in Japan. Nissan has asked its Spanish labour unions to consider a company proposal to eliminate a further 500 jobs in addition to the 600 it had already planned. It is also asking its unions to accept a wage freeze for 1994. The moves by Nissan highlight the increasing difficulties Japanese carmakers face in western Europe, where new car sales have fallen by 16 per cent in the first nine months of this year. Nissan, which was the first Japanese carmaker to start manufacturing in Europe, has recently announced it will also have to halve output at its Sunderland car plant in the UK. The company has already adjusted production in Spain by introducing an average of 11 extra holidays in October and November. Nissan said production at its Spanish operations, which made a Pta23bn loss in the first half of 1993, would fall by about 4,000 units to 86,000 units this year. Actual production between January and September came to 60,000. In the UK, meanwhile, production plans have been revised down to 246,000 from the 270,000 forecast at the beginning of the year. Capacity at Sunderland is around 300,000 a year. Nissan is facing severe pressure at home as well, where it is reducing the age for voluntary retirement to 45 from 50 in an attempt to cut its domestic workforce from 53,000 to 48,000 by 1995. Like many other Japanese companies, Nissan needs to reduce the number of middle-aged white collar employees. Lowering the voluntary retirement age requirement for these workers to 45 would add another 1,000 employees to those already eligible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat has said  negotiations with the United States over an eventual free trade  treaty should start in September or October of this year.    Aninat said Chile will wait until the U.S. Congress empowers  President Clinton to negotiate such an agreement. He added that  official negotiations will be undertaken immediately after this.    He explained that the Chilean Government will consult all  national sectors prior to signing any agreement. He added that  after assessing the impact of a trade agreement on the Chilean  economy, the government will decide whether to negotiate a  bilateral agreement with the United States or join NAFTA.</p>

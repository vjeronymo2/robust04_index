In his first public speech after his appointment Dubinin  told  the Duma Budgetary Commission Wednesday night that there had to  be no replay of 1993 "when the budget indices were unduly high."  That approach, he said, was justly criticized by numerous  ministries who complained of shortage of funds, in particular  for defense orders and agriculture.    "We agree that the projects planned in 1993 for the first  quarter (of 1994) have to be financed. We are looking for  additional sources of revenue and believe that financial  priorities must be set," Dubinin said. In his words, 4 Tn  [trillion] rubles will be appropriated for that purpose in the  first quarter of 1994 but "now priorities are being set for  using this amount."    The acting minister said: "We know that tax revenues in the  first quarter of the year will amount to 8.5 Tn rubles and we  will receive nothing over that amount. Therefore the expenses  must be kept within these limits. We also know for sure that  the tax revenues will not exceed 80 to 100 Tn rubles during the  year."    Dubinin thought that significant revenues were not to be  expected from foreign trade because the export prices of Russian  goods have become nearly equal to world market prices.    He said that the 1994 budget draft would be submitted to the  government before Monday, February 7.</p>

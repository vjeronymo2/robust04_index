			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / International Company News: Du Pont oil arm in Russian joint venture CONOCO, the energy subsidiary of the Du Pont chemicals group, has agreed to a joint venture with the Russian government that could involve total investment of as much as Dollars 3bn. Conoco claimed last night the deal would mark the first time a US company had become involved in the development from scratch of a Russian oil field. First production is not planned until late in 1994. Conoco said the 50-50 venture, between Arkhangelskgeologia of Russia and Conoco Timan-Pechora Limited, would be named Polar Lights. The area to be developed is in the northern Timan-Pechora basin, west of the Ural mountains and near the Arctic Circle. Recoverable reserves in the first field set for development are estimated to amount to about 110m barrels. Conoco claimed the Polar Lights project differed from previous US-Russian oil projects in that there was no current production in the area and the entire infrastructure needed to be designed and built from scratch.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE  </P> <P> Lowery's Stand Garners Both Brickbats, Bouquets  </P> <P> When Sharon Rogers' van exploded March 10, the city's major politicians reacted  quickly to the horrifying possibility that terrorism had hit the streets of San  Diego.  </P> <P> Mayor Maureen O'Connor, Supervisor Susan Golding, U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson and  Rep. Bill Lowery all talked about the need to remain calm and let law  enforcement do its job.  </P> <P> In the weeks that followed, however, only one politician stayed publicly  involved in the case: Lowery, who blasted La Jolla Country Day School for  removing Rogers from her teaching job and then encouraged her to seek legal  counsel to negotiate a better deal.  </P> <P> At the Friday press conference to announce a $135,000 settlement from the  school, Rogers was direct: "Bill Lowery is my hero."  </P> <P> Not all the parents at the exclusive school agree, and Lowery may yet reap a  political backlash. As a group that includes many lawyers, doctors, professors  and business executives, the Country Day parents have the ability to make their  political displeasure evident.  </P> <P> Some parents have talked of working against the five-term Republican in his  next election, possibly finding a candidate to oppose him.  </P> <P> "Once Lowery got involved in the process, all chance at a calm compromise was  impossible because he was grabbing headlines bashing the school," said one  parent.  </P> <P> "I lost a ton of respect for Lowery," said another. "I think it was a  grandstand play on his part. I'm a staunch Republican but that SOB will never  get my vote again."  </P> <P> Said a third parent: "I'm sick of Lowery using my school and my kids to get his  name in the newspaper. He was playing to the crowd by portraying us as a bunch  of rich cowards."  </P> <P> Still, Lowery is not without supporters among Country Day parents. In fact,  some say he should be congratulated for "shaming" the school into an equitable  settlement.  </P> <P> "Yes, there are some parents mad at Lowery, but there are far more who are mad  at the way the headmaster bungled the issue from the start," said a parent.  </P> <P> Lowery's chief aide, Karl Higgins, accompanied Rogers' attorney, Pat Shea, to  the Friday press conference and released a statement from Lowery.  </P> <P> Higgins said Lowery's only desire has been to urge the community not to be  intimidated.  </P> <P> "I know absolutely in my heart that this was not political grandstanding,"  Higgins said. "This was strictly an attempt by Bill Lowery to raise the public  consciousness to a higher level and educate the community that we cannot  respond to terrorists in a way that invites additional acts of terrorism."  </P> <P> Despite the settlement, Lowery is not finished.  </P> <P> He has a public meeting planned Saturday morning at Wangenheim Junior High  School in Mira Mesa to hear what the voters think about the Rogers incident and  terrorism in general.  </P> <P> Lowery sent notices recently to all 225,000 households in his district  advertising the session, and restating his view that "when we give in, they  win."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boot Camp Loses Punch  </P> <P> The Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego has quietly dropped any plan to  resume holding "smokers" -- boxing matches between recruits.  </P> <P> MCRD is the only Marine base in the country to dump smokers. The move is in  response to the death of a recruit during a boxing match in August, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Moscow With Fun  </P> <P> Moscow Circus clown Alexander Frish, known to his fans simply as Sasha, has  signed on as a roving ambassador for this fall's Soviet arts festival in San  Diego.  </P> <P> Sasha's goal will be to involve schoolchildren in the festival's free  activities by escorting performers to the schools. Among other things, he will  be part of the festival kickoff: an outdoor gala at Balboa Park on Oct. 22, to  be called Superpower Sunday.  </P> <P> A festival organizer will leave soon for Moscow in hopes of signing up more  mimes, jugglers and acrobats from Soyuzgoscirk, the talent agency for circus  performers.  </P></p>

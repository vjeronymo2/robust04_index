The man defending the status quo, Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of the London ITV company, comes originally from County Down in Northern Ireland and is a former second lieutenant with the 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoon Guards. Meanwhile, the cross-border raider Gerry Robinson, Granada's chief executive, hails from Donegal in the Irish Republic.</p>

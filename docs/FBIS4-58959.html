			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed political sources in Aden have discovered  evidence showing the participation of Arab states in the  fighting currently taking place in Yemen, which was sparked off  by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang of the al-Ahmar clan. The  Yemeni news agency, SABA', was informed by those sources that  there are soldiers involved in the fighting within the ranks of  units of the al-Ahmar mercenary gang, in coordination with the  governments of the countries they belong to. The sources said  that among these countries is Sudan, which is ruled by General  'Umar al-Bashir. Accordingly, Sudanese airports have been made  available as assembly points for the military aircraft of 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih and the gang of the al-Ahmar clan to take off  from and carry out military operations against al-Hudaydah  Airport.    These sources connected the position taken by 'Ali Abdallah  Salih before the [word indistinct] parliament toward the call by  the Arab League for the fighting in Yemen to stop, a stance that  was the same as Sudan's, which considered the call by the Arab  League as interference in Yemen's internal affairs. The sources  went on to say that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is currently facing  internal problems in Sanaa, arising from the losses incurred by  his armed forces and their defeat due to the blows they received  from the heroic armed forces representing national accord,  unity, and democracy.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY WILL APPEAL $300,000 SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> The City Council Monday night authorized the city attorney to appeal a $300,000  award to Ricky Patrick Miller, who was shot in the back by a Newport Beach  police officer.  </P> <P> Miller, 28, was awarded $200,000 in compensatory damages and $100,000 in  punitive damages against Newport Beach Police Officer Jun Payoyo in  mid-November.  </P> <P> The lawsuit stemmed from an incident in 1988 when Miller, a parolee from Texas  who was then a Newport Beach limousine driver, was shot after a lengthy chase  by police. He was left partially paralyzed by the shooting, which City Atty.  Robert Burnham said was caused when Payoyo's gun accidentally discharged.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Chin-nien (3769 6855 1628): "Credit </F> Investments Largely Out of Control"--First paragraph is  introduction.]    [Text] In the past year, bank credit investments have  lost control. Zhu Rongji recalled all loans that did not conform  to regulations within a definite time limit. Actually credit  that conforms to regulations also is out of control. Bank loans  cannot be decided by banks. They must be in accordance with the  mayor's directives. All new projects have "gravy" added. No one  is responsible for repayment.    The first of the three "draconian" measures that Zhu Rongji  devised when he appeared on the scene to rectify the economy was  to require all local banks to recall all loans that did not  conform to regulations before 31 August. It is estimated that  this involved 160 billion yuan. By the beginning of September,  Zhu Rongji had extended the date for the recall of the loans to  the end of this year, because only 20 percent of the loans that  should have been recalled actually were recalled in August.    How has 100 billion or 200 billion been loaned out? In  addition to the loans that do not conform to regulations, there  are the regulation bank loans. Why has bank credit gone out of  control in the past year or so? There are a few specific facts  here from which we can view the credit investment situation.  <H5>  People On All Sides Contending for a Sum of Money </H5>   Since last spring and summer, localities have been  contending  one after the other to take on projects and economic development  regions. Those who are equipped come forth as well as those who  are not equipped. The banks faced with so many "hungry monks"  and "so little gruel," are often in an awkward situation.  Sometimes they have no choice. They can only treat everyone  alike. This situation has occurred in a certain region. Three  large enterprises urgently needed a large loan to replace  equipment. When they suddenly heard that the bank had a sum of  money, the three almost simultaneously crowded in to contend for  the loan and none would relent. Finally, the bank had no choice  but to give in to the quarreling and divide it equally "one bowl  of gruel to a person."    Logically, whom to give loans to and whom not to give them  to  should be decided by the banks themselves after a detailed proof  of the use to which the borrowing unit would put the loan. But  this is actually very hard to do. In one area this type of  incident occurred. The bank decided to give a loan to a rather  efficient baby food factory, but the mayor decided to give the  loan to a refrigerator factory with rather serious losses,  because it was a key enterprise in the city. Ultimately, the  bank could only shift the abacus beads to the refrigerator  factory. A township enterprise in a certain locality, because  its products were of high quality and had a good reputation and  it strongly broke into the international market, earned $2.55  million in foreign exchange annually. But because the factory's  current equipment was limited, it urgently needed a sum of money  to replace its equipment. If its equipment were replaced, it  could more than triple its production capability and it could  earn at least $7.1 million in foreign exchange. But just because  it was a "township enterprise," it ran all over and still could  not borrow the money.  <H5>  Much Gravy in the Budget, Black Holes Know How Much </H5>   The money is the state's and everyone spends the money. So,  in the investment budget of almost every new project there is  quite a bit of "gravy." Increasing the "gravy" in new projects  has become a "legal" method for a great many units and regional  leaders to seek state funds. "Am I not doing the unit (or  region) good? In any case, I am not filling my own pockets."    City A is constructing a large luxury hotel and needs a new  type of decorative material. The unit in charge of construction  budgeted for 8,486 meters, but after repeated detailed  calculation by technical engineers of the department concerned,  it was determined that they could get by on 842 meters. The  reason was quite simple. After the fact, the leaders concerned  laughed and said, "We intended to do a little something else  with that bit of money."    A certain county was constructing a key middle school and  budgeted several 10,000 yuan. But with careful accounting by the  department in charge, no matter how many times they figured it,  it was nearly 40,000 yuan. When that county's education office  was asked, the head of the office boldly and self-assuredly  said, "So, that was money to invite guests, send gifts, make  connections, and do public relations!" Consider that this cost  also must be borne by the state. The state's money is constantly  sliding down innumerable "black holes" in this way.  <H5>  Stop and Start Projects and Stop and Start Development Zones </H5>   The so-called stop and start projects stop and start  construction. Stop and start projects also can be said to be a  characteristic of China. Stated a little more clearly, it is the  product of the cleverness of local leaders or unit leaders in  contending with the banks.    A few years ago, quite a few of these stop and start  projects  were stopped. By last spring and summer, the stop and start  projects were finally "successfully completed." But new stop and  start projects also appeared. According to statistics from March  of this year, in 1992 there were a total of 88,531 new capital  construction starts by state units throughout the country, a 19  percent increase over 1991. The average planned total investment  for each project is 3.38 million, a 45.7 percent increase over  the previous year. Because the excessively fast growth of these  new starts spurred the rapid growth in the need for investment,  it caused the prices of related capital goods to continue to go  up. Some exceeded market demands, but "they could prohibit them,  but it was hard to stop them."    Actually, "stop and start projects" are nothing compared  with  the "stop and start development zones." Since last year's wave  of layer after layer of development zone started, it has  seriously impacted on current economic development. The greatest  problem with the development zone craze is, whether they are  prepared or not, everybody comes forward. The provinces come  forward, the localities and cities come forward, the counties  come forward, and even the townships come forward, to the point  that whether or not they can "be developed," that many cannot be  attended to.    Presently, there are more than 6,000 of various types of  development zones throughout the country. A 300 million yuan  investment is required to do the "seven connections and one  leveling" on one square kilometer. Of this 300 million yuan, the  state normally invests 100 million and for the remaining 200  million they must go to the bank themselves for a loan or raise  the money themselves. (Actually, it is still the state's money.)  Not to have 450 billion for 15,000 square kilometers of  development zones throughout the country is unacceptable. But  where does the state go to find so much money?! The total of  more than 700 billion annual national capital construction  investment is all used to make development zones, and it is done  for six years. In these six years, it cannot be used for  anything.  <H5>  If I Cannot Pay Back, What Can They Do To Me? </H5>   "One must pay back the money that he borrows." This is  justice. But today in the mainland debtors are extremely  relaxed. The wife and children live in the house and use the  car, the electricity, and the telephone; eat, drink, and sleep,  and it has no affect---after all, it is all the state's money.    A certain steel enterprise group to put up a new steel  rolling plant borrowed 30 million yuan from the bank. Because of  a policy error, they did not roll a single piece of steel. When  they had to pay back, they did not have a single cent. What  could they do? In any case you cannot make a deduction every  month from the factory head's 400 yuan salary. Ultimately, there  was no way. They could only transfer the factory head to a  municipal economic committee as vice chairman to act as an  official in another place. As to that 30 million yuan, who  knows. . . . . .    A certain township even exceeds this joke. The township  borrowed 2 million to construct a silkworm station and a base to  raise silkworms. For various reasons, the situation failed. When  the loan expired and the bank came to press for repayment, the  township head concerned could not be found. That afternoon a  call came from the county procurator saying that the township  head, carrying a bed roll, had come to "report." He claimed that  if they wanted money, he did not have it and would have to give  up his life. What could be done? After all you could not shoot  him. That evening, the township head was let go by the county  magistrate.    Specific debtors are this way. So, what about the officials  who gave the approval at that time? Now it is even more  difficult to find them. Why? Because they have changed office.  The mayor of a certain city approved this type of loan. But over  a year later, this mayor had gone to be a vice chairman in the  People's Congress. There is a saying, if he is not at his post,  he does not run the government. If I am not now in charge, go  find the new mayor.    Whenever this time comes, it is the person in charge at the  bank that has the greatest headache. When he first loaned the  money the person who borrowed it bowed and scraped and wanted to  call him "grandpa." Now when it is time to pay back, he becomes  the "grandpa." No matter how much you run around and press him,  in any case he does not have it. The person in charge at the  bank jokes that he is "the grandpa turned grandson."</p>

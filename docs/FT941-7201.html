			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Asia-Pacific Telecommunications (8): On course for multimedia age - Japan For the past few years, executives at Japanese telecommunications companies have watched anxiously as their US counterparts moved swiftly to lay the foundations for a new era of advanced communications. While US companies in the telecommunications, cable TV and entertainment industries joined hands in one cross-border deal after another, Japanese telecoms operators and equipment suppliers have grown concerned about their country's delayed entry into the race to develop advanced information networks. The ministry of posts and telecommunications, criticised in the past for its bureaucratic approach, has now recognised the need to improve the regulatory environment and has put Japan firmly on course for the coming multimedia age. Last month, Mr Takenori Kanzaki, minister of posts and telecommunications, indicated the government's intention to nurture the development of advanced information communications networks as a key sector for the future Japanese economy. The multimedia market in Japan, Mr Kanzaki declared, was expected to create 2.4m jobs by 2010 and could be worth Y123,000bn (Dollars 1,138bn) by that year, making it comparable in size to the motor, electronics and communications equipment industries. To promote the development of advanced information networks the ministry plans to support the laying of an optic fibre infrastructure nationwide and wants this to be completed by 2010. Rules will be relaxed to create an environment more conducive to the emergence of new businesses taking advantage of the info-communications networks. The ministry is also examining policy and technical issues that need to be addressed before it can give the go-ahead for the integration of telecommunications and broadcasting services. Growing alarm that Japan is being left behind by the US in the race to develop advanced communications systems has spurred the hitherto complacent Japanese authorities into action. They face a formidable task. On the broad policy front, the ministry must decide who will fund the laying of the proposed advanced communications network, and therefore have ultimate control over it, and who ought to be allowed to use it and in what ways. On both points it is in direct opposition to NTT, the former public telephone company which was privatised in 1986 and which, in spite of liberalisation efforts by the ministry, still dominates the industry. NTT believes it should build the network and has stated its plan to lay optical cables to all private homes by 2015. By March next year, NTT plans to complete digitisation of its switches throughout Japan, an essential part of the multimedia infrastructure. The company wants to retain its leading position in advanced telecommunications and believes that because it will have to manage the network, it should be allowed to build it. The telecommunications ministry disagrees. If the private sector builds an advanced communications network, it fears the interests of the country may not be best served. The ministry is concerned that private companies, driven by profit considerations, could lay optic fibre only where they can expect satisfactory returns. The differences between the ministry and NTT extend to the issue of who should be able to provide what kind of services on the new information highway. Not surprisingly, NTT is keen to use its dominant position as a carrier to provide new services beyond its conventional telephone operations. In addition to high-speed communications services, the company is eyeing markets for video communications, interactive games and video shopping, among others. 'NTT will co-operate with a diversity of industry players as it explores the vast potential of these arenas,' the company says. However, NTT's activities are strictly regulated by the NTT law, which stipulates that the company may not engage in businesses outside telecommunications and other closely related activities. The ministry of posts and telecommunications is wary of NTT becoming too dominant in these industries. So, unless the law is revised the telecoms giant would be barred from using any new network it builds to provide cable TV and Mr Masashi Kojima, the company's president, publicly states that 'NTT does not intend to get involved in the cable television business'. That leaves other carriers and the cable companies as leading contenders to combine telecommunications and broadcasting services on the new information highway. The authorities are planning to allow cable television operators to provide 'full' services, including telecommunications services, and to permit new common carriers to offer multimedia services. Recently, the telecoms ministry announced its intention to relax rules which have been widely blamed for stunting the growth of the cable industry. The local capital rule, which prevented companies from providing nationwide services and thereby taking advantage of economies of scale, is being phased out. Foreign capital restrictions are also being relaxed, leading to the possibility of increased participation in the Japanese market by large US cable companies such as TCI, which has a deal with Sumitomo, the trading house. It will take some time for Japan's fragmented cable TV industry to sort itself out to become a force capable of participating in the info-communications network as envisioned by the telecoms authorities. Neither is it clear what uses consumers will want to make of the high-speed capacity and interactive functions offered by the new information super highways. Meanwhile, steps are also being taken in the mobile phones industry to allow greater competition and more diversified services and to pave the way for the advanced information communications infrastructure. As in the cable TV industry, most of these involve the relaxation of ministry rules which are blamed for inhibiting growth in this industry. For example, the ministry is liberalising the cellular phone market further by allowing three new entrants into the market in April. Handsets, which have to be rented by an operator, will be allowed to be sold, leading to greater competition and lower prices. Such long-awaited steps are expected to trigger significant growth in Japan's cellular phone market, which in spite of being the second largest market after the US with 1.8m subscribers, has a low diffusion rate. Only 1.8 per cent of Japanese use mobile phones compared with 4.4 in the US and 7.9 per cent in Sweden, according to a report by SG Warburg, the securities company. Deregulation which will lead to greater competition and price reductions, is expected to make Japan one of the world's fastest growing markets.</p>

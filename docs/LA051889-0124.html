			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A card game between two men who were reportedly known to be good friends ended  with the death of one after the other shot him several times with a revolver,  police said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Warren Henry Jones, 69, of Logan Heights, was pronounced dead at the scene in  the 7800 block of Bloomfield Road in Southeast San Diego about 6 p.m. Police  arrested the man who lived at the house, Roland Grooms, 25, on suspicion of  murder.  </P> <P> Grooms was being held without bail in the San Diego County Jail Wednesday night  and was scheduled to be arraigned at 10 a.m. today.  </P> <P> Officers found the body of Jones, who had been shot several times in the upper  body, outside the house. Grooms called police to report the shooting shortly  after it occurred, according to Sgt. Frank Martinez.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that the two, who had been good friends until the  incident, were playing cards in the house when they began arguing, Martinez  said. Jones pulled out a 2- to 3-inch pocket knife and cut Grooms, Martinez  said. Then Grooms reportedly ran outside to Jones' car, where he knew there was  a handgun in the glove compartment.  </P> <P> When Jones approached Grooms with the knife again, Grooms pointed the handgun  he found in the glove compartment at Jones and fired several fatal shots, said  Martinez, who was unsure whether the card game had involved money.  </P></p>

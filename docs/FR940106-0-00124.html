			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Change to &sect;617.15(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Amendments to &sect;617.15 were included in the proposed rule published for comment on November 30, 1988. A further change in &sect;617.15 was considered as a result of the reinstatement of the movable eligibility period for basic TRA. This change was to base the 210-day period for filing an application for training, in order to qualify for up to 26 weeks of additional TRA, on the worker's most recent partial or total separation from employment under the certification, rather than within 210 days after the date of the first qualifying separation. This change reinstates the rule that was applicable prior to the 1981 Amendments, when the eligibility period was movable, and was adopted with the issuance of Change 2 to GAL 7&hyph;88, dated May 22, 1989. In view of the new interpretation of section 1430(a), and the law-in-effect rule, a further change was made in the interpretation and application of the 210-day rule, which was announced in GAL 15&hyph;90. The new interpretation applies to all decisions (i.e., determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) which are made after the date of issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90, on August 21, 1990. (See GAL 15&hyph;90 and section E.4 of Attachment A). These changes are incorporated in &sect;617.15(b) of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Change to &sect;617.15(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule was published for comment on November 30, 1988. At that time, the Department had concluded that days ``in which training would not normally be scheduled'' should not be counted as part of a scheduled break in training. Initially, the Department limited the exclusion to Saturdays and Sundays, if training in the applicable training program would not normally be conducted on those days. In GAL 7&hyph;88, and Change 1 to GAL 7&hyph;88, the Department interpreted section 233(f) of the Trade Act as excluding certain weekend days and holidays in counting the days of a break in training. GAL 7&hyph;88 and Change 1 were unclear, however, whether the exclusion of holidays included both National and State holidays. On further consideration, the Department agreed that all officially recognized National and State holidays should be excluded in counting the days of a break in training, to the extent that training in the applicable training program would not normally be scheduled on those days if they did not occur during the break. This change was adopted with the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 and is applicable to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) which are made on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of when the training was approved under section 236 of the Trade Act, or whether the training was approved or is approvable under section 236 as amended by the 1988 Amendments, or when the break in training began or ended. In making decisions under &sect;617.15(d), the law to be applied is the law as in effect on the date the decision is made, and this rule has applied since the issuance of GAL 15&hyph;90 on August 21, 1990. Decisions previously made under prior operating instructions are subject to redetermination in accordance with State law, as set forth in section 4.b. of GAL 15&hyph;90.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to clarify what constitutes a ``break in training'' for purposes of section 233(f), a new clause (2) is added to &sect;617.15(d) defining a break in training as including all periods within or between courses, terms, quarters, semesters and academic years, whether or not such breaks are scheduled by the training provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

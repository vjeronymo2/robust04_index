			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Arts: Tchaikovsky - Edinburgh International Festival AS the Edinburgh festival reaches the middle of the final week, its portrait of Tchaikovsky is nearly complete. The composer has proved to be a rewarding subject, mainly because his life's work spans such a variety of media - opera and ballet, concertos and symphonies, vocal and choral, all had a representative showing in this year's programme. Less attention has been paid to setting his music in context, although the Royal Scottish Orchestra's pair of concerts over the bank holiday weekend each gave a nod in that direction. The first offered a triple novelty: three Hamlet scores, one each by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich, the last a melange of his film score and theatre music, arranged by the evening's conductor, Gennady Rozhdestvensky. This was a clever piece of programme-planning. It told us little about Shakespeare's Hamlet, but a lot about the personalities of the three composers. While Prokofiev and Shostakovich viewed the play from the outside, commenting on the issues with irony and detachment, Tchaikovsky's nature led him instead to try to enter the protagonist's soul. His music is overtly emotional and in Hamlet's tortured, introspective character it is easy to see the composer feeling some personal identification. Given the interest of the programme, it did not matter greatly that the orchestra's playing was less than brilliant. But when Neeme Jarvi arrived a couple of days later to conduct it in some of the best-known Tchaikovsky scores, the untidiness of the playing did make the music's technicolour virtuosity pale rather. This time it was chronology that provided an added dimension, as the concert included both Tchaikovsky's first and last surviving orchestral works - The Storm Overture and the Sixth Symphony. In between Peter Donohoe, the festival's resident Tchaikovsky pianist, played the First Piano Concerto with power and delicacy, if not enough insight always to make the music spark into life under Jarvi's dampening direction. In the last five minutes, though, Donohoe really did set the fireworks blazing. * * * All of this was the public Tchaikovsky. The private man remains more of an enigma and the festival's most important single gesture was to familiarise us with one of the composer's rarely-heard private utterances, the unaccompanied Liturgy of St John Chrysostom. Under the rigid conventions imposed on composers of music for the Russian Orthodox Church, Tchaikovsky was required to adopt a style far removed from that of his worldly self. The result is music of heartfelt simplicity and no small expertise. There could hardly have been a more inspired idea than to site this performance at night in St Giles's Cathedral on the Royal Mile. Under Arthur Oldham's direction, the Edinburgh Festival Chorus made the rafters ring with singing of glorious concentration and power, the basses emulating the imposing growl of a native Russian choir. Choral music in the silence of the night here demands to become an annual festival event. The Royal Scottish Orchestra's concerts sponsored by British Telecom and Scottish Power</p>

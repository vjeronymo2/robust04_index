			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: OUSTED HOSPITAL CHIEF PRAISED BY SUPERVISORS  </P> <P> William Delgardo, ousted last month as chief of the Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew  Medical Center, was praised by members of the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors Tuesday for his years of service at the embattled hospital.  </P> <P> Delgardo, who has been reassigned to a county health department administrative  job, praised the staff at King and thanked community members and Supervisor  Kenneth Hahn, who arranged the ceremony, for their support. He was lauded in a  commemorative resolution presented by Hahn and supervisors Ed Edelman and Deane  Dana.  </P> <P> Delgardo later defended the 430-bed hospital that he called "my home," and said  state inspectors and reports unfairly singled out King over problems attributed  to a shortage of staff and funding -- both things he said were beyond his  control.  </P> <P> In the wake of the controversy that cost him his post, Delgardo said he hoped  that King would finally receive the resources he said he had been seeking in  vain.  </P> <P> "I don't feel I need vindication," he said, adding that he would be willing to  return to the hospital. "Certainly. That's my home. I was there 14 years, but  (returning) is not to be."  </P> <P> Delgardo and two top assistants were replaced Sept. 26. The moves came shortly  after the federal government threatened to cut off $60 million in Medicare and  Medi-Cal funds to the hospital if problems there were not corrected by Dec. 21.  </P></p>

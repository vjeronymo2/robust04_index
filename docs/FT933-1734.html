			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / International Company News: Public ambitions of Bimantara - Indonesian group is poised for more flotations BIMANTARA Group, one of a small number of fast growing conglomerates which dominate Indonesia's private sector, may be about to float further subsidiaries on the Jakarta stock market. The company has expanded rapidly since its formation in 1982. It has almost 70 subsidiaries in sectors as diverse as chemicals, tourism, financial services and animal feed, and has built up assets of more than Dollars 1.75bn. But Bimantara has a reputation for secrecy as well as for rapid growth. Analysts say the group's expansion has relied in part on the political connections of its founders, led by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo, President Suharto's second son, who owns 39 per cent of Bimantara Citra, the group's holding company. The group has been adroit at winning government contracts, often without open tender, and has been adopted as a local partner by many foreign companies undertaking large projects in Indonesia. Other shareholders include Mr Indra Rukmana (Mr Trihatmodjo's brother-in-law) who has a 39 per cent stake. Important projects currently under way include a Dollars 100m toxic waste processing plant in partnership with Waste Management International of the US; a Dollars 350m proposal to own the country's next generation of communication satellites; a joint venture with Indonesia's Barito Pacific Group for a Dollars 1.6bn petrochemicals plant in West Java; and a proposal with Siemens of Germany to build, own and operate a Dollars 2bn power station in East Java. Some analysts say that the company collects businesses in an ad hoc manner, has a weak management structure and depends too heavily on debt financing provided by state banks. Profits, however, have risen rapidly, with net earnings moving up from Rp98bn (Dollars 45m) in 1990 to an estimated Rp200bn for 1992. Three subsidiaries account for 50 per cent of its earnings. They are Food Specialities, a dairy products joint-venture with Nestle; International Timber Corporation, a forestry and wood products company; and Japfa Comfeed, Indonesia's second largest animal feed producer, in which Bimantara has a 20 per cent stake. Mr Ahmad Afdhal, Bimantara's corporate secretary, says that 'in the next few years our chemical and property companies will make a lot of profits'. Oil company executives, however, estimate the Chandra Asri petrochemicals plant, due for completion by 1996, will require an ethylene price of more than Dollars 500 a tonne to break even, compared with recent prices averaging below Dollars 350 a tonne. The company is elusive about which subsidiaries might be taken public, although candidates include its trans-Java gas pipeline operations, a five-star hotel in Bali and an aircraft leasing subsidiary. Mr Afdhal says that only about six subsidiaries currently meet the Jakarta stock exchange's listing requirements, which include audited accounts recording an operating profit for more than two years. Brokers argue Bimantara and other conglomerates close to the current government are keen to complete the flotation before President Suharto, who has led the country for over 25 years, leaves office. By turning subsidiaries public and attracting foreign shareholders, conglomerates will have a measure of protection against a political backlash under a future government, says one observer. Analysts question how attractive its subsidiaries will be to foreign investors. When the group took its Plaza Indonesia hotel and shopping mall subsidiary public last year, it preferred to place the shares almost entirely with Indonesian state pension funds. Brokers say the shares, which have seen almost no trade, are among the stock market's most expensive on a price-to-earnings ratio. Some of its subsidiaries, however, enjoy monopoly trading rights and have attracted criticism. The World Bank in a recent report described Bimantara's monopoly on citrus fruit trade in West Kalimantan, granted in 1991, as 'hurting poor farmers and less well-off customers. Unemployment and labour migration have increased'. Mr Afdhal says that 'competition is part of our life.' But he adds: 'For a new company we would like protection from the government just to make sure our investment does all right.'</p>

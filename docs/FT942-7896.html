			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): Portuguese seek a scapegoat for the broken promises - Peter Wise reports on a country grown disillusioned with the idea of European integration / Financial Times Correspondents in Italy, the Netherlands and Britain follow the fortunes of three candidates seeking election to the European parliament The campaign in Portugal for the European elections reflects a considerable cooling of the country's enthusiasm for Europe after almost two years of recession. Defence of national interests is the dominant note in the campaigns of both the governing Social Democrats (PSD) and the opposition Socialists (PS). Two smaller groups, the right-wing CDS-PP and the communist coalition, CDU, come close to calling for Portugal to quit the European Union altogether. As real wages decline and unemployment grows, the Portuguese are counting the cost of integration into a community they previously saw as a source of nothing but prosperity. 'Europe has lost its glitter here,' says a European diplomat in Lisbon. 'People have grown more inward-looking as a result of the recession and political parties are adopting a more protectionist stance.' President Mario Soares, a Socialist, expressed the growing scepticism at a recent congress of government opponents, where he questioned how wisely EU funds were being spent and what would happen when the flow stopped. Agriculture and industry were suffering severely from the effects of the single market, he said, threatening to leave only services as a competitive sector. 'Are we to become the waiters of Europe?' Mr Soares asked. Early campaigning has been focused on the rural interior, where the single market and the implementation of the EU's common agricultural policy have cruelly exposed the backwardness of Portuguese farming. Mr Antonio Campos, the PS spokesman on agriculture and a candidate in the elections, says Portuguese farmers' earnings have fallen 40 per cent over the past three years to near subsistence levels. Farming is a sector with a political resonance in Portugal beyond its economic weight and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the prime minister, last week removed Mr Arlindo Cunha from his post as agriculture minister so he could run for the European parliament. Both main parties advocate preserving Portuguese agriculture against what is portrayed as the cold logic of a European Commission intent on converting the country's farms into forests. Both the centre-right PSD and the centre-left PS have similarly recast other European policies in a more nationalistic light in keeping with the public mood. In fact, the electorate may find it difficult to distinguish between the two parties' proposals. Despite apprehension over the consequences of European integration, most Portuguese remain pro-European. They blame their own government more than Brussels for their current ills and the vote on June 12 will be more a verdict on Mr Cavaco Silva's domestic performance than a judgment on European policy. In this context, the vote is a bigger test for the PS than the PSD. Recession has produced mounting dissatisfaction with Mr Cavaco Silva, who has been in office since 1985, and the PS are currently ahead in the opinion polls with 39.4 per cent of the vote, compared with 26.2 per cent for the PSD. But a hard-hitting, anti-government speech from Mr Soares at the opposition congress, 'Portugal: What future?', has backfired on the PS by undermining the position of its leader, Mr Antonio Guterres, and reigniting old rivalries within the party. Discord over selecting candidates for the European elections has further detracted from the Socialists' credibility. If Mr Guterres fails to deliver a convincing victory on June 12 his leadership is likely to be challenged in a disruption that could have serious consequences for the PS in the run-up to the next general election in October 1995.</p>

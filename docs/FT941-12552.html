			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Severn Trent Pounds 11m Belgian acquisition Severn Trent, the privatised utility, yesterday announced the expansion of its Biffa waste management operation with an Pounds 11.1m acquisition in Belgium. The company is to buy Cotrans Group, a collector of domestic and industrial waste, with sales of BFr600m (Pounds 11.1m). The deal will make Biffa one of the leading waste services groups in Belgium and increase its sales there by more than 50 per cent. Mr Stephen Pain, of Severn Trent, said Cotrans would fit well with Biffa's existing operation in the region. The Belgian company would benefit from Biffa's landfill site and the waste pre-treatment centre under construction near Antwerp. The acquisition also reinforced Severn Trent's commitment to the waste services sector, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by editor Agata Stanekova on the regular briefing </F> at the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs]    [Text] Mrs. Daniela Rozgonova briefed us today on the  following statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Slovak Republic:    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs considers it natural and  understandable that Hungarian political circles and the general  public follow with interest political and social developments in  the neighboring Slovak Republic. It has, however, met with less  understanding when the information of the governmental Office  for the Hungarian National Minorities Abroad misinterprets a  resolution of the Slovak parliament--the parliament of a  neighboring country--on the basis of which doubts could be cast  about whether the Slovak Republic really wants to observe the  pledges it adopted when joining the Council of Europe.    In this statement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again  informs its partners, including the government bodies of the  Hungarian Republic, that the Slovak Republic will gradually  fulfill all of the pledges it took in connection with joining  the Council of Europe. As is known, the implementation of these  pledges is being assessed by the Council of Europe. At the same  time, the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejects any general  and unsubstantiated accusations that the Slovak Republic is not  observing the obligations following from the CSCE documents.    Journalists also wanted to know why Minister Moravcik did  not  take part in the Slovak delegation's visit to Poland. This was  agreed with the Polish partner due to the fact that the Polish  foreign minister was on a visit to the United States. The two  foreign ministers are to meet at a different date.    In connection with the alleged letter from [former FRY Prime  Minister] Milan Panic to Prime Minister Meciar, the  representatives of the Foreign Ministry confirmed the statement  by Jozef Moravcik yesterday. They said that, in connection with  the possible export of weapons, the ministry is publishing its  view on the aspects of this with regard to international law and  that no export can take place without a decision by the ministry.</p>

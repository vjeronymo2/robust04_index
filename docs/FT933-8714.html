			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland in demand Building materials group Redland was the FT-SE 100's second best performer after Standard Chartered, the shares rising 23, or 4.3 per cent, to close at 553p, their highest point since May last year when the building sector was said to have been reflecting a false dawn on the economic recovery in the UK. The rise in the Redland share price followed news of a sharp increase in housing starts in Germany and news that BZW had increased its profits forecasts for the group. The broker said it had lifted its current year earnings estimate from Pounds 246m to Pounds 255m and that for next year from Pounds 265m to Pounds 287m, to reflect the extent of economic recovery in the UK and the US. The shares also responded, according to dealers, to news that housing starts in Germany rose by 17 1/2 per cent with housing starts in eastern Germany up a massive 90 per cent. Redland's near-6 per cent yield was another strong bull point it was said. Profit-taking and marginal disappointment with the interim results left Royal Insurance one of the FT-SE 100's worst performers and finally 11 off at 333p, after 327p. Water shares spearheaded a general advance by the utilities areas of the market, with the big institutions said to be hunting top quality, high yielding stocks following evidence that the recovery in the UK economy is faltering. The biggest gains in the water sector came in the less widely traded stocks, such as Welsh Water, 20 higher at 605p, South West, 17 better at 532p, and Southern, 14 to the good at 539p. Severn Trent was the pick of the FT-Se 100 constituents, rising 13 to 511p. The Scottish generators continued to attract keen interest from income funds ahead of the stocks going ex-dividend on Monday. Hydro settled 8 1/2 up at 371p and Power 10 firmer at 356p. Berkeley, the housebuilding group, was one of the outstanding performers in a generally strong building sector. The shares closed 7 up at 433p - their highest level since July 1987 - following a strong buy recommendation from Nikko Securities whose building analyst Mr Mark Hake described the stock as a 'unique investment opportunity'. Mr Hake said that Berkeley's focus on relatively small sites means that it is able to avoid the worst of the upward pressures on land prices since the land it acquires does not appeal to most of its quoted rivals. Nikko also adopted a bullish stance on Marley, the building materials group due to announce interims on August 18. The broker recently upgraded its 1993 and 1994 estimates for Marley and forecasts interim profits of Pounds 12m for the group. RMC came in for good support, on the back of Redland, the shares adding 6 at 818p. News of the sale of a 20 per cent stake in Pilkington's Triplex Safety Glass subsidiary to Nippon Sheet Glass for Pounds 13.3m was viewed as good news by building sector specialists who said the move proved that Pilkington is seen as serious in getting its debt burden down. Pilkington shares settled 5 higher at 149p on good turnover of 3.2m with the warrants 3 1/2 to the good at 50p. Crest Nicholson's success in letting over 80,000 square feet of office accommodation at its Farnborough and Maidenhead developments triggered a surge of demand for the shares which responded with an 8 1/2 advance to 71 1/2 p, their best level since July 1991. A stock shortage drove Persimmon 11 higher to 292p while the recent buy recommendation from one of the markets leading agency brokers boosted Wilson Bowden 5 more to 439p. Among food manufacturing stocks, investors sought out those stocks with attractive yields. Booker advanced 6 to 443p, Dalgety 7 to 495p - both stocks being recommended by Kleinwort Benson yesterday - and Hillsdown 7 to 162p. Unilever rose 11 to 976p ahead of results today. The market range is between Pounds 546m and Pounds 570m. In the publishing sector, Mirror Group Newspapers went up 9 to an all-time high of 168p before retreating to 167p with a net gain of 8 on a turnover of 2.8m shares. SG Warburg made a strong buy recommendation on the group's prospects of both revenue rise and cost fall and a healthy figure from an Audit Bureau Circulation survey of national newspapers circulation, due next week. Hoare Govett also believed the stock was undervalued and was recovering from the price war started in mid July among national tabloids which in turn caused the stock to under-perform the market over the past weeks. Reed International, the international publishing group which merged with Elsevier of Holland early this year, eased another 9 to 661p following the weakness of Elsevier listed in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.</p>

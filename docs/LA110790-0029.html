			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY WILL SUE SHERIFF DUFFY ON SECRET ACCOUNT  </P> <P> Angered that San Diego County Sheriff John Duffy set up a secret account for  money seized in drug raids, the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to file a  lawsuit to regain control of the money.  </P> <P> The civil lawsuit is expected to be filed today in San Diego Superior Court.  </P> <P> The board reached a consensus in closed session to go to court over the matter,  which has further soured the already strained relationship between supervisors  and the sheriff, who is retiring from office.  </P> <P> The suit could include a request for a temporary restraining order to prevent  Duffy from making further allocations from the secret account, county officials  suggested.  </P> <P> The board wants the court to force Duffy to account for the more than $300,000  seized in drug raids -- called asset-forfeiture funds -- and return the money  to the control of the supervisors, said county spokesman Bob Lerner.  </P></p>

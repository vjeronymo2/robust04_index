			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 29 KYODO -- The Transport Ministry on  Tuesday [29 March] announced a plan to double the number of  Japanese tourists to the United States to 6.8 million by 2000 as  part of efforts to reduce Japan's swollen current account  surplus with the U.S. Ministry officials said the government  hopes to conduct negotiations with the U.S. on specific measures  if Washington agrees to the plan.    Japan posted a tourism account deficit of 10 billion dollars  with the U.S. in fiscal 1992, while recording a trade surplus of  four times as much.    Under the plan, the tourism deficit is expected to double to  20 billion dollars to help reduce Japan's current account  surplus, the officials said.    The ministry had hoped to incorporate the plan in the  package  of macroeconomic measures the government announced earlier  Tuesday to open Japan's markets and spur domestic demand, but  failed to do so because of policy differences within the  government, the officials said.</p>

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Airport retail space expected to jump SHOPPING space in British airports could increase sharply, a report by property advisers Chesterton says. The UK's 15 largest airports could support a further 250,000 sq ft of retail space by 2000, the report says, increasing their total shopping space to nearly 600,000 sq ft - equal to a large shopping centre. The report says retailing is playing an increasingly important role in British airports as they face up to new opportunities and pressures. These include increasing numbers of passengers, loss of duty-free income after June 1999 and stiffer competition between European airports for profitable long-haul flights. The potential for growth is greatest at Glasgow, Manchester and Newcastle, which have 30 per cent more passengers per shop than the national average of 400 passengers per shop. Airports are attractive to retailers because they have a captive market of passengers waiting for flights. The report says: 'There is a growing realisation that air passengers and other visitors represent an affluent and willing customer base, and that flight schedules give a unique insight into potential customer characteristics.'

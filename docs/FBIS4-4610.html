			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Supports Struggle of South Korean Students </F> Against Rice Market Opening" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- The struggle of the  South Korean students against the "parliamentary endorsement" of  "the Uruguay-Round accord enforcement plan" including rice  market opening is a most righteous patriotic action, stresses  NODONG SINMUN in a commentary today.    It says:    Handing over the whole rice market of South Korea to outside  forces by the traitor Kim Yong-sam is a treacherous act to  prolong his dirty remaining days as a colonial lackey by selling  off the interests of the country and the nation.    It is the unshakable will of the South Korean students and  people to overthrow the treacherous group, not yielding to any  suppression by the "civilian" dictators. Their fighting spirit  cannot be broken by any fascist bayonet.</p>

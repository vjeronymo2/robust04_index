Retail  prices will be 1,790 times higher than in November, and living  expenses will increase 2,839 times.    The draconic sanctions which the U.N. Security Council  imposed on Yugoslavia in late May of 1992 have resulted in  severe shortages of goods, a monetary chaos and general  impoverishment of Yugoslavs the majority of whom now live on a  subsistence level.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Arts: High points from old hands - Jazz in 1992 Nineteen ninety two started and finished well enough. On New Year's Day 1992 over 20 of the UK's fiercest free improvisers crammed into the sub-tropical basement of the 100 Club to celebrate South Africa's Blue Notes in gloriously discordant style. The year's end, with Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek freeze-drying the Barbican as his contribution to the Tender is the North smorgasbord of Nordic art, was a breathtaking contrast. The intervening months - with some notable exceptions - were less inspiring and more temperate. Perhaps it was the relentless drizzle, perhaps it was the recession, maybe it was the carping over Jazz FM. Heaven knows, I have tried to like 'London's 102.2'. I do not smile knowingly when jock Helen Mayhew stumbles over the pronunciation of Bix Beiderbecke. I do not clamour for rare Charlie Parker accompanied by the sound of eggs frying from dawn to dusk. But I do turn the wireless off in the daytime when the Jazz FM computer selects Sade/Robert Cray/Simply Red for the umpteenth time that day. If, as appears to be the case, the new middle of the road formula has paid commercial dividends this year, can the formula be made a bit bigger next year? Now that owner David Maker has succeeded in moving the station into profit thereby securing it, he can surely afford to programme more discs into the machine which runs the station during daylight hours? It was not a good year for television either. Having won precious airtime the right side of the witching hour for its live recordings of the Brecon Jazz Festival, BBC Cymru blew it the way television always blows it by not getting the sound right. Are TV engineers stone deaf? Pat Metheny does not spend thousands of dollars on a synclavier in order to reproduce the sound of a badly tuned ukelele. For the real stuff, neat, the year was better spent out of the armchair and on the South Bank, ears pitted against the chattering classes at Ronnie Scott's or in the Jazz Cafe (which finally found a new owner in September). If not all of it was notable there was a tremendous amount of jazz music to be had in London in 1992 and, perhaps surprisingly, the highpoints were provided by the old hands. Brummie septuagenarian tenorist Andy Hamilton finally took the South having just released his debut album; Pharoah Sanders boggled the Jazz Cafe with undiminished impro; Ornette Coleman dazzled the Festival Hall with his shimmering son et lumiere show; and Tony Williams led Wayne Shorter, Dave Holland, Wallace Roney and Herbie Hancock through old paces, tenderly revitalised, at the Royal Albert Hall. But for embarrassment and riches combined, one performance stands out above the others - that of Keith Jarrett, the John McEnroe of the concert grand. It is increasingly the fashion nowadays for jazzmen to barely acknowledge their audience, pausing between numbers to receive applause before sternly serving up the next piece. Not so Jarrett, who began his Standards Trio set in fine form by lambasting New Music ('like being hit over the head by a nerf ball'), Alternative Musicians ('the neo-pseudo beboppist club') and World Music ('like bringing home an exotic flower and watching it wither'). And all this pleasurable railing delivered before a note had been played. After the first set - of inspired improvisation, Jarrett squealing involuntarily like a seal as is his custom - he returned, hands high on hips, to curse electronic music ('fit only for Disneyland') and jab again for good measure at new music fans. Then, joy, he mistook the mixing desk for someone he thought was bootlegging his gig. 'Whoever you are, whatever you are,' he intoned menacingly, 'you have got a problem . . .' Pity more of our visitors could not have provided so electric a setting for their performances this past year.</p>

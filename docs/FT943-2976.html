			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / M-way toll trials soon: 'Enormous' contract triggers responses from 29 consortia Twenty-nine consortia representing more than 70 companies from around the world have responded to the government's call for proposals for an electronic tolling system for Britain's motorways. Most proposals would involve gantries to read units fitted in vehicles. Others would depend on the satellite tracking of vehicle movements, Mr John Watts, roads minister, said yesterday. The government hopes to introduce tolls on the 1,900-mile motorway network by 1998. Charging cars 1.5p a mile and trucks 4.5p would raise Pounds 700m a year for road improvements. The proposed systems will be evaluated in the next four months with the aim of running trials on a test track and on motorways next year. The government will then draw up a technical specification of the system it wants and put the contract out to tender in spring 1996. Mr Watts said: 'Any contract we let would be enormous. We want to develop a specification which can be sold around the world.' It is likely that the contract would be let to more than one consortium because of its size. One option under consideration is for the winning companies not to be paid on completion but for them to recoup their outlay from tolls. Mr Watts denied that the government had ignored criticisms in a report by the Conservative-dominated Commons transport committee which was published last month. The MPs said the government's arguments for tolls were unconvincing and suggested an increase in fuel duty would be easier and cheaper to collect. Mr Watts said the government was considering its response but had to continue with its preparations. Proposals had come from companies in Europe, the Far East and North America, but nearly all of the consortia had a British member. Well over half of the consortia had a strong base in the UK, sometimes through foreign ownership of British companies. Twenty-four of the systems proposed would involve a monitor mounted on a gantry identifying and charging vehicles passing underneath. Most of these systems depend on microwave links, but two use infra-red and one a laser. These systems could debit a 'smart card' or record a vehicle for billing later. Three companies have proposed satellite-based systems which would debit a smart card and would not require roadside gantries. Among companies which have put forward proposals are Unipass, a UK company; a group comprising News Datacom (UK) and CSEE Peage of France; and a consortium consisting of British Telecommunications and AT/Comm, a US manufacturer. Racal Radio, part of Racal Electronics, has devised a number-plate recognition system.</p>

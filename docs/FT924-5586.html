			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Haiti army allows Senate election HAITI'S military-backed administration has said it will hold Senate elections next month, amid signs of mounting anti-government sentiment, writes Canute James. The vote, for nine of the 27 Senate seats, is seen as an attempt to legitimise the administration, following a coup by the army 14 months ago. The announcement by Mr Marc Bazin, the army-appointed prime minister, coincided with several blasts in Port-au-Prince, the capital of the Caribbean republic. The military is continuing attempts to suppress public displays of support for Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who lost the presidency in the coup and who is now in exile. No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing, in which one person was killed. Meanwhile, Gen Prosper Avril, a former military ruler, was held by the army after returning from exile.</p>

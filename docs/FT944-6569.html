			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Bribery law change in EU would remove blight on business Sir, Andrew Taylor writes of the European Commission's raft of court actions to outlaw unfair practices in the awarding of public sector contracts within the European Union ('Brussels gets tough on public contracts', November 23). Admirable though these moves are they overlook one particular anomaly: it is against the law if you bribe an official in your own country, but not if you do it in your next-door-neighbour's. And you may or may not get a tax break for the bribe you pay to an official in your own country, but you probably will do so if you pay it to an official in another. Ethics apart, this must surely be a wholly unacceptable states of aff-airs. The EU would do well to implement the OECD recommendations of May 1994 and criminalise foreign corrupt payments and tax deductibility for illicit payments, at least as between the member countries of the Union. Then, companies across Europe could compete with each other on equal terms, and without those who bid on their home turf having to comply with norms from which others are exempted. Such a move would, at a stroke, harmonise the legal framework in these respects across the EU. Just as important, it would create an opportunity for developing countries to be judged by the same rules, if they so chose. It would therefore represent a significant step towards tackling, in a positive way, one of the greatest blights on business of contemporary times.

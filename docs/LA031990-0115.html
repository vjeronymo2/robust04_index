			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> EX-MAYOR JABS BACK WITH BOOK  </P> <P> Former Mayor Edward I. Koch takes on old foes with his customary vitriol in a  collection of letters and newspaper columns from his 12-year reign.  </P> <P> "Always give as good as you get," Koch wrote his successor, David Dinkins, who  defeated him last year.  </P> <P> That letter is one of several in "All the Best: Letters from a Feisty Mayor,"  due out in April.  </P> <P> On the scandals that shook his third term, Koch wrote to Dinkins, "The most  searing pain of my twelve years was learning I had been betrayed by people who  were corrupt.  </P> <P> "I was despondent. I must confess, on several occasions when I was alone, I  wept. It was hard to get myself out of bed in the morning."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Viktor Antilov, secretary general of the Russian  Communist Workers Party [title as heard], has stressed that the  Russian people are standing alongside the Palestinian people in  their struggle to regain their rights to self-determination, the  establishment of an independent Palestinian state, and  repatriation. He added that the Russian people also support  peace in accordance with the resolutions of international  legitimacy.    During a meeting with Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of  the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP],  Antilov also asserted that the people of Russia, as well as its  democratic and communist nationalist forces, support the  Palestinian people and the Arabs, and that the Russian people  will not remain silent on the expansionist Israeli plans.    For his part, Hawatimah asserted that the Oslo-Cairo  agreement is doomed to failure because it does not meet the  minimum requirements of a peace settlement according to the  resolutions of international legitimacy and also because the  Israeli occupation and settlements continue to exist in Gaza and  Jericho, as do the acts of bloody repression throughout the  occupied territories.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: Honourable mentions - London Markets JOHN MAJOR'S reform of the honours list encourages everyone to suggest potential honorees. Here are this column's nominations: Lord Schlesinger of Hesse. For services to the London stock market above and beyond the call of duty. By first hinting at a German rate cut over the weekend, then appearing to rule it out, then finally delivering a quarter-point cut in money-market rates on Friday, Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, provided exactly the sort of flirtatiously delayed consummation the market likes. Shares in London set not one but three FT-SE 100 closing highs in response, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, closing the week at 2,922.1, up 54.1. The Mid 250 and SmallCap indices also did well. Sir Andrew Buxton. For services to builders, suppliers of mobile phones, makers of gold-plated Rolls-Royces and tailors of alpaca overcoats. Barclays' dismal results on Thursday illustrated just how lavishly the bank Andrew Buxton chairs has indirectly subsidised these businesses over the past five years: of the Pounds 2.6bn charged for bad or doubtful loans in 1992, Pounds 800m were to property developers, and they spent every penny of it. Lest anyone think that Buxton merely lucked into this award, we reprint alongside what Lex said when the bank made its infamous rights issue in 1988. This was a planned disaster. Brian Pearse CBE. For services to amnesia. By delivering Wednesday's healthy results at Midland (pre-tax 1992 profits up 394 per cent to Pounds 178m) he has managed to make everyone forget that he was Barclays' finance director at the time of the 1988 rights issue. John Birt OM. For services to Companies House. By channelling his pay through a private company, the new director-general of the BBC produced a surge of revenue for the companies registrar, as newspapers rushed to commission company searches on every media executive they could think of. Sir Christopher Hogg GCVO. For services to corporate governance. After advising the Cadbury committee (main recommendation: companies should usually split the roles of chairman and chief executive) he retired as non-executive chairman of Courtaulds Textiles - leaving Martin Taylor, chief executive, to combine the two titles. John Ashcroft BEM. For services to the insolvency courts. Most people restrict themselves to one corporate bankruptcy per recession; he has managed two. Coloroll, which collapsed in 1990, is still fresh in the memory of its shareholders; now Ashcroft's recovery vehicle, Survival Aids, has also gone under. The Bundesbank was not the only motive force behind the stock market's strong performance this week. Shares seemed to benefit from a virtuous circle of improving expectations. The recovery from the recession seemed at last - falteringly - under way. Evidence for this came not just from an upbeat Treasury bulletin ('Retail sales rose strongly in January . . . demand and activity in late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little stronger than the autumn statement assumed'), but also from less parti pris quarters. House-builders, for example, reported new home sales up by a fifth in January and February. The stock market has anticipated this trend for some months, as the chart shows. It contains a couple of ad hoc unweighted share indices, constructed by the FT's Keith Fray, containing 30 'cyclical' companies (including BOC, Taylor Woodrow, Emap, ICI, and Rolls-Royce) and 30 consumer-product companies (Glaxo, Granada, Tesco, Unilever and so on). In late 1992, the recessionary trend - which favours the defensive consumer stocks against the cyclical ones - came to an end. Since then, cyclicals have significantly out-performed. To UK investors, the recovery may thus be old news. But the growing likelihood that the UK will be the EC's only big economy to show any sort of growth this year, coupled with a belief that the pound is safely off its lows, has tugged continental and American investment institutions into the market.

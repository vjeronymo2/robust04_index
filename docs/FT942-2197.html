			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / UK reaction marked by frustration The British government and companies with US operations reacted with frustration to the Supreme Court's ruling against Barclays Bank in its long-standing feud with the state of California over the imposition of a system of unitary taxation. The Confederation of British Industry said: 'We are extremely disappointed to hear this news and are awaiting full details to understand its implications.' The Inland Revenue said: 'We are naturally disappointed and we are awaiting further details.' It appeared unlikely the government would enact legislation to permit potential retaliatory action against US companies in the UK in the event of a court decision supporting unitary taxation. Many companies and professionals had expected the decision to go against Barclays, and downplayed its ramifications now that companies could opt to be assessed instead on a water's edge basis, which assesses only income within US borders. Others expressed fears that the Supreme Court's decision could trigger other US states to impose unitary tax. It also permits California to reintroduce the system. Barclays said last night it was currently 'chewing over' the 'very long and very detailed' text of the Supreme Court judgment. The bank is believed to have already handed over up to Dollars 30m in taxes assessed by California on the unitary basis in connection with its operations from the mid 1970s up until 1983. As a result of the judgment, it may have to hand over another Dollars 10m in taxes in dispute since that time. Barclays withdrew its retail and most other operations from California in 1988. The company said last night: 'We naturally regret that the court has arrived at this decision in relation to what is an important issue of international taxation. It affects not only Barclays but also numerous other UK and foreign-owned multinationals. 'Any weakening of the certainty provided by the internationally accepted arm's length approach to taxation is likely to have adverse consequences for world trade generally.' Mr Tony Hughes, an international tax partner with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'This decision is not unexpected because of the degree of political pressure. I don't expect to see any retaliation because there is not much at stake. But there would be a war if unitary tax was extended to other states.'</p>

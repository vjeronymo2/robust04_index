			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION OFFICIALS GET FOOD FOR THOUGHT;  </P> <P> CITY COUNCIL: ANXIOUS STAFFERS AT ONE POINT LAUNCH A FRANTIC SEARCH FOR VOTE  RESULTS AFTER PRECINCT WORKER FAILS TO TURN THEM IN. SHE HAD GONE TO HER  MOTHER'S FOR DINNER.  </P> <P> Final results in the special election for the City Council were delayed two  hours Tuesday night while a precinct worker had dinner with her mother.  </P> <P> In the meantime, anxious city officials, candidates and their supporters and  reporters cooled their heels at City Hall, fueling wild speculation and at one  point setting off a frantic search for the missing votes.  </P> <P> City Atty. Arnold Glasman said Jennifer Scott was supposed to bring the ballots  from a precinct at the Emerson Village retirement home to City Hall to be  counted. But, he said, she apparently thought there was no hurry and could hand  them in the next day.  </P> <P> By 9:30 p.m. Tuesday night, votes had come in from 25 of the city's 26  precincts. Boyd Bredenkamp, a businessman and planning commissioner, held a  clear lead over two opponents in the race to replace recalled Councilman C. L.  (Clay) Bryant.  </P> <P> The City Council chambers, where the ballots were counted, was crowded with  Bredenkamp supporters waiting to cheer the final results. A beaming Bredenkamp  was standing by to go on cable television with a victory speech.  </P> <P> Time passed and the wait continued.  </P> <P> The audience filled the time with speculation. Maybe someone had stolen the  ballots. Maybe, the concern of council candidates about crime had yielded  another example, an election worker waylaid.  </P> <P> Election officials began making some calls and found out that Scott, the  precinct inspector, had left for City Hall more than an hour earlier. They also  learned that she was pregnant and hadn't been feeling well. More speculation.  Maybe she didn't deliver the ballots because she was delivering a baby.  </P> <P> City Clerk Elizabeth Villeral then called the watch commander at the Police  Department to report Scott and the ballots missing.  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Nell Soto, who supported losing council candidate Bob Dahms,  said she was in bed when she was awakened by a call from a friend who had heard  on a radio scanner that police were hunting for missing ballots. She said the  friend was convinced that chicanery was afoot, and that the results were  tainted. Soto was more realistic. She said she knew one precinct wasn't going  to change the outcome.  </P> <P> But by this time, some Bredenkamp supporters waiting at City Hall were  beginning to think that an election they had won at the polls was in danger of  being stolen. What if ballots had been destroyed? Would there be a new  election?  </P> <P> Then, a report circulated that the city attorney was about to leave City Hall  to pick up the ballots. A dozen Bredenkamp supporters rushed to their cars to  follow. Two reporters chased the supporters chasing the attorney.  </P> <P> Just then, Scott showed up.  </P> <P> City officials ushered Scott off to a private meeting to find out what had  happened. Glasman said Scott told him that she went to her mother's house for  dinner. The mother apparently thought it odd that the ballots had come along  and suggested that her daughter try to get to City Hall before midnight. But,  Glasman said, Scott still thought she had until the next morning to turn them  in.  </P> <P> Scott refused to talk with reporters. A man who accompanied her said it was  simple: "She didn't know she was supposed to bring the ballots in."  </P> <P> Villeral said Scott should have known from the instructions given to her that  she was to take the ballots to City Hall immediately, but no harm was done.  Glasman said the 378 ballots had not been tampered with, and the results from  the precinct nearly matched those of the election as a whole.  </P> <P> When the missing precinct was added at 11:30 p.m., final results showed that  Bredenkamp had captured 54% of the vote. He received 2,903 votes to 1,868 for  Dahms and 604 for Nancy Lopez. The turnout was 13.5% of the eligible voters.  </P> <P> Glasman said he and the city clerk will look into the matter further, but the  precinct worker's excursion to her mother's house for dinner does not appear to  jeopardize the integrity of the election. "There is no indication of anything  but some very poor judgment by a precinct officer," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hiroyuki Yoshinaga, Kazutoshi Masuda, Shigenori </F> Takagi, Bunichiro Abe, Kiyoyasu Shibata, Hisao Kawasaki,  Hirokuni Tokuda, Komukai Works, Toshiba Corporation and Isao  Tokaji, Technical Research &amp; Development Institute, Japan  Defence Agency]    [Text]  <H5>  Abstract </H5>   A 94 GHz-band low noise downconverter has been developed by  combining an InP-HEMT low noise amplifier, a pseudomorphic HEMT  mixer and a dielectric resonator oscillator, each fabricated  using the planar circuit technology. The downconverter shows a  noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain of  greater than 11 dB.  <H5>  I. Introduction </H5>   Recent progress in the high electron mobility transistor  (HEMT) technology has stimulated the development of low noise  amplifiers (LNAs) at 94 GHz-band and above [1-3]. HEMT mixers  [4] and dielectric resonator oscillators (DROs) [5] have also  been developed to realize W-band low noise converters (LNCs). An  LNC incorporating a HEMT LNA and a HEMT mixer has been reported  [6].    We have recently developed a 94 GHz-band LNC by combining a  HEMT LNA, a HEMT mixer and a DRO. Though all the three  downconverter components have planar circuit configurations,  they are connected together via waveguide interfaces as an  initial step to check the downconverter performance. The LNC  showed a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB and a conversion gain  of greater than 11 dB for 94 GHz-band. In this paper, the HEMT  LNA, the HEMT mixer and the DRO using a Gunn diode are described  as well as the overall performance of the LNC.  <H5>  II. HEMT Devices </H5>   We have developed both InP-based InAlAs/InGaAs HEMTs  (InP-HEMTs) and AlGaAs/InGaAs pseudomorphic HEMTs (P-HEMTs) for  W-band applications. Figure 1 shows the top view of the HEMT  chip with a T-shaped 0.1  m x 50  m gate. The chip  size is  150  m x 170  m and the thickness is 70  m. The  bonding  pads of each electrode are designed as small as possible in  order to reduce stray capacitances. The chip layout and size are  the same for both types of HEMTS.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-75A>      Figure 1. Top View of HEMT Chip </FIG>     The InP-HEMT shows a minimum noise figure of 2.7 dB with an  associated gain of 5.4 dB at 94 GHz when biased at Vds=1.0V and  Ids=6 mA. The cutoff frequency ft of this device is as high as  260 GHz, when biased for a maximum gain. The P-HEMT exhibits a  minimum noise figure of 3.9 dB with an associated gain of 5.0 dB  at 94 GHz when biased at Vd=2.0 V and Ids=11 mA.  <H5>  III. Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA) </H5>   Both InP-HEMT LNA and P-HEMT LNA have been developed. These  LNAs are 5-stage single-ended MIC amplifier chains with  waveguide input and output interfaces. Finline waveguide to  microstrip transitions fabricated on teflon-glass substrate with  a relative dielectric constant   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-76A>      Figure 2. Inner View of LNA </FIG>    r = 2.1 and a thickness of 0.13mm are used for the waveguide  to MIC transitions. The insertion loss of each transition is  about 1 dB at 94 GHz.    The single stage unit amplifier is built on a KOVAR metal  carrier which measures 5mm long and 10mm wide. The input and  output matching circuits including the quarter-wavelength  coupled lines for DC block and quarter-wavelength RF chokes for  DC bias are formed on ceramic substrates with      r = 5 and thickness of 0.1mm. The loss of these circuits is  estimated to be 0.2 dB. The unit amplifier has been designed and  fabricated for the minimum noise figure. After embedding the  unit amplifier in the 5-stage amplifier housing, a small circuit  trimming has been performed to obtain a minimum overall noise  figure.    Figure 2 shows an inner view of the LNA. Comparison of the  measured noise figure and gain between the InP-HEMT LNA and  P-HEMT LNA is given in Figure 3. The InP-HEMT LNA shows a noise  figure of 4.6 dB and a gain of greater than 20 dB at the center  frequency f[.sub]0[/], while the P-HEMT LNA shows a noise  figure of 6.2 dB and a gain of 21.5 dB at the same center  frequency. The InP-HEMT LNA has proved to be superior to the  P-HEMT LNA in terms of noise figure.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-76B>      Figure 3. Measured Gain and Noise Figure </FIG>   <H5>  IV. HEMT Mixer </H5>   Devices for mixers should have a higher breakdown voltage  than for LNAs, since they are subject to a relatively high power  LO drive. We have chosen the P-HEMT for the mixer application,  judging from the fact that its breakdown voltage is much higher  than that of the InP-HEMT. The mixer developed in this work is a  drain mixer with LO drive at the drain and RF drive at the gate.  The IF signal of 3 GHz is obtained from the drain through a  choke circuit for LO and RF frequencies. The gate and drain  matching circuits are fabricated on a 0.1mm thick ceramic  substrate with      r = 5. The IF matching circuit including a drain bias choke  is formed on 0.1mm thick alumina substrates to reduce circuit  size, since the IF frequency f[.sub]IF[/] is chosen to be 3  GHz. All the circuits are integrated on a metal carrier as small  as 5mm x 10mm.    Figure 4 shows an inner view of the HEMT mixer with RF and  LO  port waveguide-to-microstrip transitions and a coaxial IF output  connector. Figure 5 demonstrates a measured conversion loss of  the HEMT mixer at the center frequency f[.sub]0[/] as a  function of LO power. The LO frequency f[.sub]LO[/] is chosen  to be f[.sub]0[/]-f[.sub]IF[/]. The conversion loss is  measured to be 5.1 dB for an LO drive power of 10 dBm, at which  the IF output power at 1 dB gain compression point is found to  be -2 dBm. The SSB noise figure of the HEMT mixer is 11.5 dB at  a 7 dBm LO drive.  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-76C>      Figure 4. Inner View of HEMT Mixer </FIG>  <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-76D>      Figure 5. Conversion Loss of HEMT Mixer as a Function of </FIG>    <H5>  V. Dielectric Resonator Oscillator (DRO) </H5>   Figure 6 shows a schematic circuit configuration of the  frequency-stabilized DRO with a drop-in isolator for better load  pulling.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77A>      Figure 6. Schematic Circuit Configuration of DRO </FIG>    Dielectric resonators operating at a higher order mode may  be  preferable for stabilizing a 94 GHz oscillator, considering that  the higher order mode operation enables us to employ a larger  size resonator than those of the TE[.sub]01[/] dominant  mode, thereby giving a higher Q-factor and an easier handling.  The use of whispering gallery mode resonator is an example based  on this idea [5,7]. Higher order mode resonators are, however,  very position sensitive with respect to their coupling to the  circuit. We realized the necessary coupling of higher order mode  resonator by adjusting the coupling position carefully and  adding a mechanical tuner. In this way, we could make our DRO  temperature stable between -5 to 40C . The exact mode  number of the resonator is not determined yet.    Figure 7 shows the inner view of the DRO. The Gunn diode  used  is an InP Gunn diode (NW-50) manufactured by Acrotec. The diode  is packaged in a pill which measures 0.8mm in diameter and 0.9mm  in height. The dielectric resonator is a ceramic disk with  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     [Text] r = 24.6, a thickness of 0.4mm and a diameter of  3.2mm.  The resonator is attached with an adhesive on an MIC substrate  made of ceramic with  &lt;graphic&gt; &lt;/graphic&gt;     [Text]r = 5 and a thickness of 0.1mm. The adhesive not only  deteriorates the coupling condition but also affects the  oscillation frequency. Thus a mechanical tuner is added to the  DRO housing for fine oscillation frequency adjustment. The  frequency can be adjusted by plus or minus 10 MHz.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77B>      Figure 7. Inner View of DRO with Top Cover Removed </FIG>    [Text] Figure 8 shows the measured oscillation frequency  and output  power vs. temperatures from -5 to 40C. The frequency change  is 100 MHz and the output power varies from 6.7 dBm to 7.9 dBm.  In this temperature test, the oscillation has been found stable  for OFF and ON of bias supply. Figure 9 shows a measured  spectrum of the DRO.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77C> Figure 8. Oscillation Frequency and Output Power of DRO as a Function of Temperature </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-77D>      Figure 9. Spectrum of Oscillator Output Signal </FIG>  <H5>  VI. Low Noise Downconverter (LNC) </H5>   Figure 10 shows a block diagram of the 94 GHz-band LNC.  Since  the purpose of the present work is to assess the feasibility of  LNC, the developed InP-HEMT LNA, P-HEMT mixer and DRO are  connected via waveguide interfaces. The waveguide isolator is  used to ensure the LNA performance. The band pass filter is  employed to eliminate the image signal at which the LNA has more  than 15 dB gain.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-78A>      Figure 10. Block Diagram of LNC </FIG>     Figure 11 shows the assembled downconverter. Figure 12  demonstrates the measured noise figure and conversion gain of  the downconverter. The noise figure is 4.9 dB and the conversion  gain is greater than 11 dB at the center frequency.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-78B>      Figure 11.

Conclusion </H5>   We have developed two types of HEMT LNA, a P-HEMT mixer, a  dielectric resonator oscillator using the planar circuit  technology and successfully combined these components to build a  94 GHz low noise downconverter. The downconverter incorporating  the InP-HEMT LNA has shown a noise figure of less than 4.9 dB  and a conversion gain of greater than 11 dB at 94 GHz-band.    Our work in the next phase will include  waveguide-interface-less connection of the planar circuit  components and the development of HEMT DROs.  <H5>  Acknowledgment </H5>   The authors would like to thank S.

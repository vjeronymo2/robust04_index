			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound and franc perform well A GOOD performance by both sterling and the French franc on foreign exchanges yesterday tested the received wisdom that EMS-member countries need to keep their interest rates significantly above Germany's, writes James Blitz. Only two days after the Bank of England engineered a  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base rates, the pound continued to perform well against both the D-Mark and the dollar, with several analysts suggesting that it has not yet fully tested its upside. Sterling ended in London at DM2.9400, up 1 1/2 pfennigs. Against the dollar, it crossed the Dollars 1.80 point in the early afternoon for the first time since February, before receding to Dollars 1.7965, after a previous close of Dollars 1.7945. In New York it ended easier at Dollars 1.7945. At the same time, the French franc suffered only a slight loss in the markets, in spite of a decision by the Banque de France to signal a half-point reduction in base rates. The central bank had lowered the reserve requirement on banks' sight deposits to 1 per cent from 4.1 per cent with effect from May 16. The D-Mark was finally around FFr3.3669 in London, after ending on Wednesday at FFr3.3662. Both currencies will have immediately gained from the German Bundesbank's decision not to raise its emergency Lombard rate yesterday, as some traders had feared. But analysts also feel that the market is being increasingly guided by factors other than the level of interest rates. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London, said yesterday: 'There has been a lot of discussion in Eur-ope about the need for EMS-member countries to keep interest rates above Germany's. That wisdom is now taking a blow after the per-formance of sterling and the French franc.' The Bundesbank's rate decision also gave the US currency its first positive day of the week, with the dollar finishing better at DM1.6360, compared with a previous close of DM1.6305. It ended higher in New York at DM1.6373. According to some traders, the market had been short of dollars before the Bundesbank council meeting, and had to cover itself afterwards. The nervousness about the D-Mark was also compounded by news that German public sector employers had increased their pay offer to striking workers in a bid to end the 11-day-old strike, potentially raising new difficulties over fiscal policy. However, disappointment remained that the dollar had not staged a more impressive rally. It firmed only slightly to Y132.70 from a previous close of Y132.40, and finished in New York at Y132.75. The market's eyes will be fixed on today's US monthly employment report, which analysts see as the first indicator for a week to give signs of the long-awaited US recovery.</p>

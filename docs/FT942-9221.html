			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Dutch telecoms valued at about Pounds 8bn Shares in Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch postal and telecommunications company, are to be offered early next month at a price of Fl 46-Fl 52, valuing the company at between Fl 21bn and Fl 24bn (Pounds 7.5bn-Pounds 8.5bn). Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the UK Post Office, said the Dutch flotation underlined the need for the British government to come to an early decision in its 22-month review of the corporation's future. 'The Dutch privatisation points the way the rest of the leading European post offices are going, with German and Sweden post office flotations following shortly. If ministers decide we should be sold off, they should get on with it or we will lose our position in the first division.' The Dutch government, which yesterday released details of the long-awaited transaction, said it would float up to 138.15m shares, representing 30 per cent of the total. The banking syndicate, led by ABN Amro, will be allowed to sell an additional 20.72m shares if demand is heavy. The flotation could raise more than Fl 8bn for the Dutch state. At the lower end of the range, the shares would still be worth more than Fl 6bn, making the flotation the biggest ever on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. The exact price will be announced on June 6 following a book-building period among institutions. The subscription period opens on the same day and runs until June 9. Trading in KPN shares is expected to begin on June 13. The price range of Fl 46-Fl 52 is roughly in line with predictions by analysts, whose forecasts varied from Fl 45 to Fl 55. About half the shares are expected to be sold in the Netherlands, with the rest divided among the UK, the US and the rest of the world. Late last month, the banking syndicate said private investors would receive a price discount of about 5 per cent on allotments up to 75 shares. They will also be given preferential treatment in the allocation of shares. Government officials said about 200,000 potential private shareholders had responded to advertisements and requested detailed information about the flotation. The shares are to be listed in Amsterdam and London. KPN is expected to apply for a listing in New York by the time the government sells a second tranche of shares in two or three years. The Dutch state's eventual aim is to reduce its shareholding to about 30 per cent. Background, Page 25; Lex, Page 20</p>

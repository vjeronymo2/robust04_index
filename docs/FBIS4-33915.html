			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Ramiro De Leon Carpio by Edgar </F> Gudiel at the Presidential Palace in Guatemala City; from the  "Channel Seven News" newscast -- live]    [Excerpts] [Gudiel] Good evening, dear viewers of "Channel  Seven News." Welcome to this special interview with the  Constitutional president of the Republic, Ramiro De Leon Carpio.    Yesterday marked 365 days since President De Leon Carpio  took  office and, of course, the Guatemalan people would like to know  what has truly happened during those 365 days. What has the  president, his cabinet and his work team really done to benefit  the Guatemalan people. [passage omitted]    Mr. President, welcome to this edition of "Channel Seven  News." Thanks for accepting the invitation to talk, not with me,  but with the Guatemalan people.    I believe the events at the end of May and early June 1993  are still fresh in the minds of the Guatemalan people. Perhaps  the best question to begin this interview with President De Leon  Carpio might be, what was the condition of the country when you  took office on 6 June 1993? What caused this situation?    [De Leon] I believe that is a very scientific way of  establishing whether or not there have been achievements.  First, you must know what the situation was, where Guatemala  was headed, how President Serrano was ruling the country, what  was happening, and what the situation was when President De Leon  Carpio took office. This is the logical, fundamental way to  profoundly and seriously examine my first year in office. I  would divide the answer into five aspects: press, international  affairs, and the three broad areas of policy, economics and  social issues. I will broach the first.    I was presented with a country that had a terrible  international image, a Guatemala that was totally isolated from  the international community precisely because of President  Serrano Elias' disruption of institutional order. This total  isolation was nefarious and negative. This was the  international situation I encountered.    Regarding the press, I say the news media are the expression  of fundamental freedom, of individual and social human rights  which are very important because they are the pillars of  democracy. Remember how things were a year ago in May? The  government and the president directly harassed not only  reporters but the news media. There was total disruption and  incidents took place that had never taken place in Guatemalan  history, not even during the dictatorships. This was the  situation I encountered in these two aspects.    Regarding the broad areas of policy, economics, and social  issues, I would begin with policy because the people had  recently rescued themselves from the abyss into which President  Serrano was leading them with his disruption of institutional  and constitutional order, his anarchy, and his extreme  authoritarianism. The people demanded a reform and a  reorganization of the three branches of state, and they staged  demonstrations. In the political sphere there was always an  urgent desire to cleanse the government and to break with the  past. We were in a state of political upheaval that united  various sectors, but my arrival was politically motivated. I  arrived at the presidency to rescue institutional order and this  is what I encountered.    In the economic aspect, inflation rose to 14 percent in 1992  and the situation in 1993 was quite difficult. The treasury was  totally empty, and there were debts in every area. To mention a  few, in the area of health, the hospitals had a debt of 130  million quetzales, the internal debt surpassed 900 million  quetzales, the government had been unable to reduce the foreign  debt and the international monetary reserve did not amount to  $500 million. In other words, the situation was chaotic.    The general public may not have noticed, but when the  president took office he faced an empty treasury, debts, and of  course, the distrust of investors. There was no security for  foreign or local investors, our economic situation was totally  outdated, and prices for staple products were in utter disarray.    As for social matters, the country was in total upheaval.  Remember that a year ago vans and buses were being burned in the  streets, a student was murdered by a deputy's bodyguard, and  there were demonstrations and riots. The social upheaval was  palpable. People in the countryside were not participating in  social projects. There was a total lack of confidence in the  government for its misuse of state resources and the millions it  spent from secret funds. All in all, it was a chaotic situation  in every respect: economic, political, and social.    I must add that overnight, 72 hours before taking office --  I  did not even know I was going to be president -- I encountered  this difficult situation. Analysts say that no president has  ever taken office in Guatemala under such unfavorable  conditions. It has been a tremendous challenge, and to answer  your question, that was the situation I faced.    [Gudiel] There was definitely chaos in Guatemala. Mr.  President, 365 days have gone by. You have served one year of  the two and a half you will be in office. After 365 days, have  things improved? What is your opinion? Briefly, please,  because I have many questions to ask you before our viewers  start calling.    [De Leon] Very well. Along the same lines I mentioned, I  believe our international situation is totally different. After  being internationally isolated, Guatemala is now recognized by  the international community. I might add, without false  modesty, that the Guatemalan president has considerable prestige  among the international community. The international community  supports and backs the Guatemalan president and the  administration over which I am honored to preside. The  isolation I found has been totally reversed.    [Gudiel, interrupting] Nevertheless, and forgive me for  interrupting, Mr. President, but you mentioned five points and  now you are going to defend them. We are on the first one.    [De Leon] I am not going to defend them. I am going to make  a comparison. I answered your question about the condition in  which I found the country in terms of those five aspects, and  now I will explain the current situation.    [Gudiel] You will compare one with the other. What about  the travel warning? [previous two words in English]    [De Leon] Well, that is something very special. The travel  warning was issued for Guatemala because of certain situations  and due to incidents like the recent explosion of a terrorist  bomb at a residence.    [Gudiel, interrupting] We opened our newscast with that  information today.    [De Leon] Exactly. It is part of an internal  destabilization plan because that is the only way to delay the  attainment of peace. The travel warning is the result of a  series of manipulated situations, and we are struggling against  them. Their origins are not in the international community but  in sources that are foreign to the states. When I say that upon  arrival I found Guatemala to be internationally isolated, it is  because international doors were totally closed.    [Gudiel] It pleased us very much to see the Costa Rican  president in Peten yesterday.    [De Leon] That was a truly historic event. In the past we  had to go to Costa Rica. Guatemalan presidents would wait for  invitations from Costa Rica because it was the only democratic  country. It was a luxury for a Guatemalan president to go to  Costa Rica. That, however, is no longer the case. The Costa  Rican president asked me to invite him on a working tour and he  visited Peten. This proves -- and here I speak of Asia, Europe,  and Latin America -- that there is support for the president and  the administration. In short, Guatemala is no longer isolated  from the concert of nations. That is the situation from the  international viewpoint.    As far as the news media are concerned, I will say little  because the differences are obvious. Following the harassment  suffered by the news media in the past in what I would describe  as a war waged by [former] President Serrano with an  authoritarianism unprecedented in Guatemalan history, after  those attacks on reporters, the news media, and so forth, there  is now full and absolute freedom of the media and expression.    There are isolated problems. Problems exist in Guatemala as  they do everywhere in the world, but freedom of the media and of  expression are pillars of democracy that I defend and practice.  This government has been and will continue to be tolerant,  because I believe in freedom of expression and of the media.    Let's move on and discuss the three main areas. As for the  political aspect, our main problem was the disruption of  constitutional order. That order has never been as preserved,  strengthened, and supported as it is now by the Guatemalan Army.  As I said before, and because we are talking in such a [word  indistinct], pleasant, honest, and open manner, I am not losing  any sleep over a possible coup d'etat. That is entirely out of  the question.    [Gudiel, interrupting] Do you sleep soundly?    [De Leon] I sleep very soundly, particularly if I am  exhausted after a hard day of work. Economic and social  problems keep me awake and concern me, but the prospect of a  coup d'etat does not. I am categorical about this because coups  d'etat are a part of our history that we have overcome. All  Army officers are aware of their professional responsibility and  the role they should play in a democracy. This circumstance,  which did not exist when I took office, has helped preserve and  reinforce constitutional order. Previously the country's  constitutional order was undermined by the rupture created by  this organization.    People also asked me to purge state organizations; that is,  the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. That purge  is nearly a reality. Although I took the long way -- the legal  and democratic path which I had to choose -- we are only two  months away from a new Congress and two and a half months from a  new Supreme Court of Justice. In sum, the political problems I  encountered when I became president are close to a resolution.  It has taken some time, if you will, but the legal path  required time. This choice led to the constitutional reforms  which -- despite criticisms against the referendum -- are being  implemented and are yielding results. I will give you several  brief examples.    First, the constitutional reform is yielding results in  terms  of pretrial proceedings. For the first time in Guatemalan  history, a deputy has been separated from his post. It was made  possible by a change in procedure. Now the deputies cannot be  judges and defendants at the same time. The organization has  changed. This has helped eliminate the prevailing political  impunity. Discretionary funds are another example. The  president eliminated confidential expenditures last year, and  this year those funds were transferred to areas such as family  and education. Discretionary funds were entirely eliminated  from all state organizations by a constitutional reform. In  addition to being an extremely significant and unprecedented  step in Latin America, this step precludes corruption because,  as we all know, discretionary funds often give rise to acts of  corruption. On the other hand, a constitutional reform also  gave full autonomy and independence to the prosecutor, attorney  general, and comptroller general. There is also a reform  regarding the prohibition of domestic debt without collateral  and the nonissuance of currency without reserves. At that time  people demanded several constitutional reforms. Now the  situation is different.    As for the economic aspect, I cannot give you many details,  but at the end of 1993, inflation was at 11.6 percent, which is  a substantial reduction from 14 percent in 1992. This year we  are aiming for a 10-percent inflation rate. The foreign debt  has been reduced by $174 million. The internal debt of the Bank  of Guatemala to the central government has been reduced by $484  million quetzales. The national currency has been stabilized  and strengthened. In addition, for the first time in many  years, international monetary reserves have reached $801  million. The situation is different despite the widely known  difficulties and circumstances.    As for the social aspect, I found a nation immersed in total  chaos and without any confidence to participate. Now there is  administrative and economic decentralization and a drive toward  increasing social participation. Above all, based on the  principles of honesty, clarity, and authority, the Guatemalan  community participates in social projects. As a result, and  based on available information, I think the situation has  changed.    In terms of investment, operational costs represented 60 to  65 percent of the budget, yet the government was never able to  reach a 30-percent investment level. It was never able to  invest more than 20 percent. Now the budget has a 28-percent  investment level and 50-percent operational costs. In 12 months  we have been able to do what was not achieved in many decades:  invest 67 percent of the full amount programmed. Previous  governments were only able to achieve 35 to 40 percent. That is  the difference between the previous and current situation.  [passage omitted]    [Gudiel] Mr. President, you were a renowned human rights  ombudsman. Everyone knows that you did an excellent job, and  that is why virtually everyone asked that you be chosen to  replace President Serrano Elias. What is the current human  rights situation? For example, what is the status of the  notorious obligatory military recruitment, an everyday news  story that receives a lot of attention from the people and the  media. What is your view on this issue, and how can this  recruitment, which is undoubtedly needed to maintain the Army,  be done without harming the rights of the citizens being  recruited?    [De Leon] With regard to an overall reply on human rights,  I am not the one to give this answer. It is the institution in  charge of this matter, it is the human rights ombudsman; he will  issue a report at the year's end. There is also Monica Pinto at  the international level. We currently have a list of  recommendations from [name indistinct] as well as from Monica  Pinto. We are trying to comply to the greatest extent all the  recommendations.    We believe that at the end of the year we will have a very,  very positive report. Of course, this does not mean that no  more individual human rights violations will occur; the main  source of these violations is political violence, the internal  armed conflict. I pointed this out when I was ombudsman, and I  repeat this now. Until this internal armed conflict is solved,  the main cause, the main source of these individual human rights  violations will not be eliminated. I am referring to the right  to life, physical integrity, dignity, security, freedom, and so  forth.    Now, as far as economic, cultural, and social human rights  are concerned, these continue being violated, however, here I am  referring to a more structural matter. Nevertheless, what is  true is that no government can accuse this government of  engaging in systematic violations, as a result of a government  policy, a state policy. This no longer exists. Here I make a  comparison once again. When I took office I found a situation  of human rights violations, I dare not say as a government  policy because at that time a policy such as that no longer  existed. Currently, however, there is a very big difference.  Here I am going to repeat the words I spoke as ombudsman about  human rights violations. There can be no conditional response  to this if human rights have more or less been violated. Either  they are respected or they are violated.    In this case, I seek to leave my successor a legacy of a  nation where human rights are totally respected. In those cases  -- as happens in any part of the world -- where a human right is  violated, the person responsible must be tried and punished, no  matter who it is and what institution he belongs to. This is in  broad terms. I would like to say that for me it is very  satisfactory that the situation is different, even though there  are still isolated problems.    With regard to military recruitment, in principle, as I have  always said, this is a right but at the same time a duty. This  is set out in the Constitution, it is not the Army that decides  there must be recruitment, rather this is a constitutional duty.  This is stated in the Constitution.    There have been three types of problems -- I pointed this  out  when I was ombudsman -- and they continue occurring although on  a much lower scale. We have data, statistics on these problems.  One has to do with discrimination, the second is the methods  used, and the third has to do with cases in which minors are  involved. One must acknowledge.... [pauses] the very defense  minister acknowledged the other day, that there are problems, of  course errors exist. Nevertheless, this year a very special  phenomena has occurred. That is, in the majority of the  departments there has been a large voluntary flow of young  peasants enlisting. Maybe it is for the salary, or due to  necessity, in any case they come of their own free will. We  have statistics on this. This has avoided greater problems,  although they continue to exist, this must be acknowledged.  What are the solutions? One is in the law. There is a draft  bill that was presented some time ago to the Congress; however,  it has been placed on the back burner. I do not think there is  any hope that this Congress will pass this law.    [Gudiel] That will not be until after 14 August....    [De Leon, interrupting] That is a possibility. The solution  is there, a law. Subsequently, as you said at the beginning of  your question, we must take into account reality. The army  anywhere in the world where it is organized constitutionally, as  in Guatemala, is an army that requires recruitment. Logically  this must be in a form regulated by the corresponding laws, and  in this case it should be. Now, we must recall that there is  still an internal armed confrontation going on. Anyone who says  there should be no forced recruitment is either naive or wants  the Army to not have the means to face a subversive group. He  does not want to face the situation, and face an obligation, the  goal for which the Army has been constitutionally created. That  is, to maintain the nation's domestic peace and security. That  is the reply to that question.    Now I believe this is part of an overall situation we are  experiencing that is drawing us closer to peace. As I did not  touch the political aspect of this issue I want to take this  opportunity to explain the peace process situation as it was one  year ago and how it is now. A year ago this process was totally  bogged down and we have never been so close to peace as now. An  overall human rights agreement has been signed. This was the  Gordian knot that one year ago did not allow the process to  advance. A timetable has been signed. In this timetable there  is a cease-fire slated for September. We have hopes that the  cease-fire will take place before, we have hopes that the URNG  will accept it taking place before. Nevertheless, by September  there must be a demobilization and in December the signing of  the peace agreement.    [Words indistinct] there is a great difference. When I took  office on 6 June, the process was totally bogged down. There  was no credibility in the peace process. Currently we are one  step from achieving peace; however, this is the most difficult  step. This is why there currently is terrorism, this is why  there is upheaval, this is why there is a series of created,  provoked deteriorations. I fear that the current URNG  philosophy, strategy -- given it is not prepared to join  national political life -- is to prolong the situation. This is  the reason for the acts of terrorism, this is the reason for the  provoked upheavals, this is the reason the very xenophobia was  created in some places. It was not by chance that these  problems arose.    I have taken this opportunity to touch on the issue of peace  because it embodies the overall human rights agreement. It also  draws us to something very important: that Guatemala can end the  internal armed conflict that has been going on for more than  three decades. This has left behind a balance of hundreds of  thousands of dead, widows, orphans, shedding of tears,  destruction, desolation, hate, and resentment. When the end of  this armed conflict comes, we will be faced with an even more  difficult task: for this to be a lasting peace. For this we  must continue combating poverty, eliminating those possible  causes that could give way to new discontent. Because in a  country....    [Gudiel, interrupting] This is what practically gave origin  to the problem....    [De Leon, interrupting] To some extent yes. At that time, it  was a mixed political-ideological situation. Currently the flag  could be merely economic. This is what must be avoided so that  this current effort, ending the conflict and attaining peace, is  for something. That is, that in our country all those dead, all  that blood that was shed, not be repeated. That it be a lasting  peace. This is why we must give macroeconomics a human face, a  social face. We must combat poverty, this is the core of our  government program. Take those small projects, which I mentioned  a while ago and commented on by some, those 12,000 almost 13,000  small projects we concluded in 12 months. Those projects have  not only supplied potable water, electricity, pedestrian  crossings, telephone service, and others, but they have given  back hope. This is the most important; the return of hope to a  people who had lost it. Before this hope was returned they were  probably easier prey to the guerrilla's language, to their  words. This no longer holds true. Currently a hamlet such as  [word indistinct] where potable water supply was taken, the  leaders themselves said: Here there is not a remote possibility  that someone will get involved in some [word indistinct]  movement, in some guerrilla movement.    We now realize that we can improve our standard of living;  we  can emerge from those situations of wantonness, if water is  supplied, if electricity is supplied, if there is honesty, if  there is social investment, such as we are currently doing.

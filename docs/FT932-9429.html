			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (10): Steelworks and paddyfields - The industrial revolution in East Java WHERE once there were paddy-fields, rice farmers and water buffalo, there are now shoe factories, international pharmaceutical companies and industrial workers. The province of East Java is in the throes of an economic boom. West Java and Jakarta have long been Indonesia's main destinations for investors, but traffic congestion and high land prices in the capital have persuaded a growing number of local and foreign manufacturers to go east. The economy of Surabaya, the East Java provincial capital of some 3m inhabitants, has been growing at more than 12 per cent a year. East Java's steel plants are churning out reinforcing bars to meet heavy demand for reinforced concrete from the construction industry. Property prices and the cost of labour are still relatively modest and the flat land of the rice-paddies is equally suitable for television plants and instant noodle factories. Today grey factory walls and bright green expanses of young rice alternate along the highways; the horse-drawn carts on the roads are outnumbered by cars and trucks. Investors from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and elsewhere - as well as ethnic Chinese businessmen from other parts of Indonesia - have joined old East Java companies such as Sampoerna, the cigarette maker established in 1913 by Liem Seeng Tee, in building their factories around Surabaya. Other big employers in the area include Kedaung, said to be the world's largest glass manufacturer, and Maspion, which makes cookers and other household items. Agricultural processing is another important local industry; shrimp from farms along the coast are exported to the US and Japan. Containers of cigarettes for export to Singapore and Poland can be seen being loaded outside Sampoerna's Surabaya plant. The tobacco industry, principally clove-flavoured 'kretek' cigarettes for domestic consumption, is the second largest employer in the country after the government and is prominent in East Java; Sampoerna alone employs 14,000 women to hand roll its kretek products. Employers say the stolid workers of East Java are often better suited to the monotony of manufacturing than the more entrepreneurial inhabitants of the west. Neither Surabaya nor the rest of East Java, however, have escaped the infrastructural and social strains common to other fast-developing parts of Asia. Road traffic is increasing in volume and its speed is falling; the supply of electricity cannot keep pace with demand; telephone lines to Jakarta are congested; prostitution is common; and there are occasional outbreaks of labour unrest and factory arson. Most of the problems are being tackled. East of Surabaya, a multi-billion dollar complex of coal-fired power stations is under construction at Paiton, and a Dollars 1bn, 1,500-megawatt plant to be supplied by gas pipeline from a field off Java is being commissioned at Gresik near Surabaya. Workers can be seen in the countryside assembling the pylons to carry the electricity westwards from Paiton. In the meantime, companies seem happy to use their own generators when they have to. 'East Java is going through phenomenal growth at the moment,' says a banker based in Surabaya. 'The margins are so good in most industries here that the extra marginal cost of producing your own power is easily containable.' The shortage of telephone lines can be frustrating, but international calls are now straightforward and the advent of cellular phones has made it easier to contact people in Surabaya and in other parts of Indonesia. One executive says he had no telephone at home three years ago; now he has two telephones in his house and a mobile device. A toll road to Gresik is being extended, and there is once again talk of building a bridge to nearby Madura island to promote its development as a manufacturing base. Surabaya has an international airport and the city's Tanjung Perak port was recently upgraded with the completion of a new container terminal. Not every project is a success. Surabaya's four-year-old stock exchange is regarded as moribund, and the magnificently-equipped new shipyard run by the state-owned PT Pal company under the auspices of the ebullient Mr BJ Habibie and his research and technology ministry is seen as something of a white elephant; in the past year it has been employing American welders to build turbines for power stations rather than ships. Such setbacks are unlikely to stop East Java's progress up the economic ladder. An international school catering for the children of the growing number of foreigners in Surabaya is thriving. Tourism is on the rise, and several new hotels run by Hilton and other international groups are due to open in Surabaya soon to provide some much-needed competition for the Hyatt. Perhaps the most telling sign of the times - apart from the sprouting of television satellite dishes - is Sampoerna's decision to branch out into property development with the purchase of a 598-hectare site in the hills outside Surabaya: the eventual aim of the project is to build luxury housing for locals and weekend cottages for the wealthy citizens of Jakarta.</p>

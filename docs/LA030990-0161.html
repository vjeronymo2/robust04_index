			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: REPORT EXPRESSES FEARS FOR TOLLWAY  </P> <P> The 15-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway to run from Newport Beach to San Juan  Capistrano and scheduled for construction next year, could run into trouble  without state funds or if construction costs rise too rapidly, a consultant  reported Thursday.  </P> <P> "The project is still financially viable -- though only marginally," Fieldman,  Rolapp &amp; Associates of Irvine states in a report to the Orange County  Transportation Corridor Agencies. "State funding, though minimal, is an  integral part of the financing plan which, even with that support, is only  marginally feasible."  </P> <P> Banks poised to help finance the project have insisted that the state come up  with $48.5 million previously committed in principle by the California  Transportation Commission. But that money is now in jeopardy.  </P> <P> The state is out of money for new highway construction, and a recent Los  Angeles Times Poll found that 49% of voters surveyed statewide oppose a ballot  measure that would increase the state gasoline tax and raise state spending  limits to finance a major transportation improvement program. About 36% of the  respondents favor the measure; 15% said they were undecided.  </P> <P> "Unless Prop. 111 passes, we'll have to rethink everything we're doing around  here," said William C. Woollett Jr., executive director of the corridor  agencies, which plan to build three tollways in eastern and southern areas of  the county.  </P> <P> The agencies' staff, however, said the Fieldman, Rolapp report is somewhat  misleading. The report, agency officials said, used on toll-revenue assumptions  based on 2-year-old traffic studies while taking into account a recent update  of cost estimates from $585 million to $601 million.  </P> <P> "It's not really marginal," corridor agencies spokeswoman Donna Stubbs said.  </P> <P> Walter Kreutzen, the agencies' financial chief, said that banks' refusal to  issue letters of credit would not doom the project. Kreutzen said other  financial arrangements such as bond anticipation notes can be made.  </P> <P> "We have to work out alternatives," he said. "It's not a make-or-break  situation."  </P> <P> Former Orange County Supervisor Bruce Nestande, vice chairman of the California  Transportation Commission, said he considers the Fieldman, Rolapp report an  update rather than the final word.  </P> <P> Nestande said it would be unfortunate if state funding now became the critical  factor for the project.  </P> <P> The San Joaquin Hills tollway will be an extension of the Corona del Mar  Freeway, running from Newport Beach through Laguna Hills to the San Diego  Freeway in San Juan Capistrano.

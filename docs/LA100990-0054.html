			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which gained 58 points last week, gained an  additional 13 points Monday on low volume, according to Irving Katz, director  of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> The gain was a "surprise because the budget resolution is still in disarray as  Congress works to come up with some form of a budget-cutting package and  government remains on hold," Katz said. "In addition, unemployment has risen,  the dollar is at new lows, war threatens in the Mideast and the deficit remains  unmanageable."  </P> <P> "To all of that, you add consumer confidence that remains low, retail sales  that evidently will make poor comparisons to last year and you have indications  that the economy is entering a recession," Katz said.  </P> <P> Most San Diego stocks remained near their year lows in recent days, Katz said.  Last week three stocks -- Medical Imaging Centers, Molecular Biosystems and  Xytronyx -- moved up more than a point.  </P> <P> Molecular Biosystems, the largest gainer, was up $1.125 as it reported  successful clinical studies for its Albunex ultrasound imaging agent.  </P> <P> Earnings reports for the third quarter, which will flood the market in coming  weeks, should cause some movement in San Diego stocks, Katz said.  </P> <P> Mission West Properties reported third-quarter earnings of $.26 and nine-month  earnings of $1.64 but still gained only $.375 for the week, Katz said, because  most of its earnings were driven by the sale of an office building.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc., which finalized its sale of 400,000 shares to United Parcel  Service at $25.25, remained unchanged at $22. The company also announced the  formation of an electronic tax-filing subsidiary.  </P> <P> Magma Power was down $2.50 to $27 where it still sports a price/earnings ratio  of 24.5 times trailing 12-month earnings.  </P> <P> Price Co. dropped $1.50 to $29.25 as an analyst removed his buy recommendation  and lowered his earnings estimate for Price during the current year. At its  current price, Price Co. is selling at its lowest P/E ratio ever, Katz said.  </P> <P> The San Diego County stock listings now includes National Health Laboratories,  which conducts medical laboratory testing, and SGI International, an  energy-technology company.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT ARRAIGNED IN SLAYING;  </P> <P> SIMI VALLEY: THE TRANSIENT PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO KILLING A BLUE CROSS EMPLOYEE  IN HIS CONDOMINIUM.  </P> <P> A 22-year-old transient pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder and robbery  charges in the shooting death of a Blue Cross insurance employee in Simi Valley  last week.  </P> <P> Oscar Rudolfo Barrascout was arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on  charges that he killed 37-year-old Gregory D. Minor last Friday at Minor's  condominium.  </P> <P> Judge Thomas J. Hutchins ordered Barrascout to be held in the county jail on  $1-million bond pending a preliminary hearing scheduled for June 7.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn said authorities still haven't determined a  motive in Minor's slaying.  </P> <P> "We wish we knew," Glynn said. "It looks like a robbery gone sour," because  police recovered some of Minor's belongings from Barrascout, Glynn said.  </P> <P> Besides murder and robbery, Barrascout is charged with burglary and using a  weapon. Glynn said the burglary and robbery charges are considered special  circumstances that would allow Barrascout to face the death penalty or life in  prison without parole if he is convicted.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Detective Sgt. Tony Harper said Barrascout saw a for-sale sign in  the window of Minor's white Corvette and visited Minor's home Friday afternoon  to talk to him about the car.  </P> <P> Minor's companion, Donna Richardson, returned home at 7:45 p.m. and searched  the home with a neighbor, finding Minor's body under the bed in the master  bedroom.  </P> <P> The county coroner's office later ruled that Minor had been shot twice in the  head with a .22-caliber gun between 4:30 and 7:45 p.m. on Friday.  </P> <P> Barrascout was arrested early Saturday morning at his van a mile from Minor's  condominium. Barrascout, a Hollywood native, had been sleeping in the van for  several nights before the shooting, Harper said.  </P></p>

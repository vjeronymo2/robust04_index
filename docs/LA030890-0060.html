			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ARCHIVE CORP., CIPHER MOVE CLOSER TO MERGER;  </P> <P> NEGOTIATIONS: THE COMPUTER TAPE-DRIVE COMPANIES HAVE AGREED TO DISCUSS CIPHER'S  ACQUISITION.  </P> <P> Archive Corp.'s effort to take over Cipher Data Products of San Diego took a  step forward Wednesday when the two companies announced an agreement to  negotiate an acquisition of Cipher by Archive at $8.25 per share.  </P> <P> Archive launched a $109-million, $7.50 per share hostile tender offer for all  Cipher shares last December, and since then the companies have been engaged in  on-again, off-again merger negotiations.  </P> <P> The companies, fierce competitors in the market for computer tape-drives, which  are used to make back-up copies of computer data, at one point agreed to  consider $8 a share. But those talks broke down.  </P> <P> Tag Merrick, an attorney for Archive, said the agreement to negotiate the deal  at a higher price is a positive step toward a merger. He would not comment  further and Cipher officials declined comment.  </P> <P> More than 85% of Cipher's outstanding shares have been tendered to Archive, but  a takeover has been blocked by Cipher's "poison pill" defense, which would  dilute the value of the acquired shares in the event of a takeover and make the  buyout prohibitively expensive.  </P> <P> The poison pill also blocks a takeover until outstanding patent litigation  between the two companies is resolved.  </P> <P> Archive sought a temporary restraining order to nullify the poison pill, but a  San Diego judge refused the request.  </P> <P> Archive has extended the tender offer several times and continued its efforts  to get Cipher to agree to a takeover. Cipher has said it was negotiating with  other possible buyers.  </P></p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Arts: Tablets of stone - Colin Amery visits the new Supreme Court in Jerusalem Historic moments are rare. It was a privilege to be in Jerusalem last week for an important moment in the history of Israel: the completion of the new Supreme Court. Trumpet, drum and harp sounded. A sea of notables filled the great hall to applaud and solemnise the inauguration of the seat of the law. Only Jerusalem could have provided the procession of president and patriarch, priest and rabbi, hooded Armenian and dusty robed Orthodox as well as the graciousness and glitter of the internationally committed group of supporters of Israel. In 1986 I was asked to be a member of the international jury to select an architect for a new Supreme Court. The project was to be entirely funded by the Rothschild family foundation in Israel, Yad Hanadiv. There is an appropriate symbolism in the opening of the courts for the Rothschild family: it marks the 100 years since Baron Edmond de Rothschild supported the first Jewish settlements in Eretz Yisrael. It also is a major landmark for the family foundation that has consistently given discreetly to innumerable projects in Israel. In 1957 the foundation gave Israel its Parliament buildings, the Knesset, the first major public building in what is now becoming the National Precinct in West Jerusalem. The new Supreme Court is located in the same area - that part of the new Jerusalem which lurks round the foot of the inelegant tower of the Hilton hotel. The whole area is gradually to be integrated with older Jerusalem by a new master plan. When judging the international competition to find an architect the jury had to tackle two problems. Firstly there were all the sensitivities of placing a new public building on an important site that is not yet anchored in the city. The second challenge was to find a design that could symbolise the enormous significance of the law in Israel and yet not be oppressive or overweening in its language. Not for Jerusalem the weight and pomposity of the courts in Brussels or the gothic mystery of England's House of Lords. The winning design was produced by two Israeli architects - the brother and sister team of Ada Karmi-Melamede and Ram Karmi from Tel Aviv. The fact that they came from a distinguished architectural family in Israel perhaps gave them the crucial edge in understanding both the landscape and architectural traditions of Jerusalem and the delicate question of the appropriate architectural symbolism for this commission. The architects have built before in Jerusalem, but this is their first joint project. Things change during building but I can say with a certain detachment that the final result is a triumph. My own reason for choosing these architects was that they seemed to have a wonderful understanding of the simple elements that make up the architectural context of Jerusalem. Two of these are light and history. As the architects have said, Jerusalem is 'possessed by light and obsessed by its past'. I would add that above all it is a city of stone. The challenge for any architect building a public building in Jerusalem must be - how to let the tide of history wash over your late 20th century drawings. To be asked to enshrine the law in Jerusalem is almost like being asked to design the Temple. The architects made one crucial decision that supports all the others: the building is seen as part of the land. It is long and low, rooted in the soil and introverted. As in the Old City, you are always aware of the walls. In the new Supreme Court the dignity of the outer walls extends inside with a long and powerful spine wall that runs through the centre of the building. It is a reminder of strength rooted in the land. On one side of the spine are the five courts and on the other are the giant, tall public foyer and the law library. The public entrance is at the knuckle joint of the plan between the judges offices and the courts. The entry is tight, presumably as a security funnel, but soon widens to a grand stone staircase with a sumptuous view of Jerusalem through a large curved window. Here you turn into the second 'gate' of the courts - a square hall beneath a soaring pyramid roof. The visitor is urged to look upwards at this point because here the architects' understanding of light is seen at its most concentrated. Four circular openings at the apex of the pyramid allow a column of light to move around the space in much the same way that light moves around Rome's domed Pantheon from a single occulus. This square hall and turning point in the plan is encircled by a curved library of unassailable elegance. To move from the geometric intensity of the pyramid to the grand and relaxed curved hall of the public foyer is to experience an expansive contrast. Of course the grand arcade of Le Corbusier's Chandigarh courts comes to mind - but here is marble, plaster and golden stone, not sad and stained concrete. The five courts open from this public space, each with its own stepped doorway cut and polished from the same roughly hewn stone of the great wall. Although the courts differ in size and detail, they share the language of concealed sources of natural light and all have inner walls that are separate from the outer stone shell. Judges will sit beneath smooth plaster apses contemplating the calm atmosphere of these five rooms. Above all it is the sensitive manipulation of light and the simplicity of the detail and furnishings that makes these rooms beautiful. When not in court the 12 Supreme Court judges will occupy a set of fine offices grouped around a stone cloistered courtyard. It is a place of silence interrupted only by the sound of a narrow rill of water moving gently as though in some Moghul garden. This courtyard is a brilliant example of an architecture suggestive of tradition and yet immaculately made in the late 20th century. The opening of the Supreme Court in Jerusalem was accompanied by a major international seminar on 'The Public Building - Form and Influence' that prompted lively international debate. But words do not make buildings. Jerusalem's Supreme Court shows in stone the power of strong architectural talent and judgment. It has a timeless and elemental strength that miraculously reflects the law itself.</p>

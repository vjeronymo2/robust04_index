			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "National Traitors Should Be </F> Removed"]    [Text] Because of the South Korean puppets' reckless war  maneuvers, an extremely grave unpredictable situation is created  on the Korean peninsula now. As has been reported, the Kim  Yong-sam ring, in a so-called security related-ministers meeting  held recently at Chongwadae [presidential residence], raved,  placing blame on us, that it would resume the Team Spirit joint  military exercise and that it would deploy Patriot missiles in  South Korea soon.    Based on this provocative step, the puppet Army troops  entered into an emergency alert posture, and Patriot missiles  are being moved from the United States to South Korea. These  extraordinary military moves are intentional acts aimed at  further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula in order to  lead the situation to an extreme phase of war. This is an  unpardonable crime.    As everyone knows, we have been consistently asserting that  all the pending issues, including the nuclear issue, be resolved  through dialogue and negotiation. However, the Kim Yong-sam  ring is not interested in national reconciliation and unity or  the country's peace and reunification, but is only scheming to  harm the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces.  Therefore, they intentionally broke down the working delegates'  contact for the presidential special envoys of the North and the  South, to which they had reluctantly responded, and are  resorting to open war maneuvers.    If the Team Spirit joint military exercise is resumed and  Patriot missiles deployed in South Korea, it is very clear what  adverse effect it will bring to the situation on the Korean  peninsula.    It is well known that traitor Kim Yong-sam, coming in power  under the mask of a civilian regime, raved about supremacy of  the nation over foreign forces and the improvement of relations  with the North from the starting point of regarding it as the  same nation. However, although he said that in words, in action  he resumed the Team Spirit joint military exercise, which was  suspended even during the Sixth Republic, last year, and is  planning to enforce it this year as well. He is bringing even  Patriot missiles, the deployment of which even his predecessor  military hooligans did not dare, into South Korea, further  aggravating tension.    The Kim Yong-sam ring is an extremely vicious war fanatic  far  worse than his predecessor military dictators, and a national  traitors ring of filthy flunkeyist nation-sellers and national  treachery which try to find a way for survival by harming the  fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. By resuming  the Team Spirit joint military exercise and bringing in Patriot  missiles, they themselves revealed that they are warmongers  under the guise of a civilian mask.    As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous group, which is more  intimate with outside forces than with the fellow countrymen and  seeks war and division rather than peace and reunification,  remains is power, we cannot hope for peace and reunification of  the country, nor can we avoid the catastrophe of a nuclear war  falling on the nation.    It is the shame of our nation that there exists a ring of  national treachery like the Kim Yong-sam ring in our country  which boasts a 5,000-year history. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous  clique, which deepens confrontation between fellow countrymen  and brings fire clouds of war, should be removed as soon as  possible.    If the Kim Yong-sam ring, a foolish ring which sustains its  doomed life clinging to the lower end of the U.S. master's  clothes, thinks it can harm someone by means of a war in  collusion with outside forces, it is grossly miscalculating.    Our people and People's Army who are well prepared for  either  dialogue or war will never just remain still and look on. If  they start a war despite our repeated warnings, we will  resolutely punish them.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique should squarely see that the  provocation of a war will be an act of suicide which brings a  total destruction of the civilian regime and act with  discretion, and stop immediately the very dangerous act of  leading the situation to the phase of a war.</p>

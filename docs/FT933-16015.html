			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / National Power in Dollars 160m US purchase NATIONAL Power, the UK's largest power generator, is to take its biggest step overseas to date with a Dollars 160m (Pounds 106m) acquisition in the US. The company has agreed to buy Transco Energy Ventures Company (Tevco) which has interests in seven power plants in operation or under construction, mainly in the south-eastern US. Tevco is a subsidiary of Transco Energy Company, a Texas-based gas pipeline company. Mr John Baker, National Power's chief executive, said yesterday: 'Tevco will provide us with an experienced US-based project development capability, and access to the buoyant US market for independent power generation with its opportunities for profitable investment.' Tevco develops, builds and owns shares in power plants. It has equity interests in the equivalent of 558MW of generating capacity, out of a total 1,750MW at the seven plants. It is also involved in plans for a further 2,000MW of capacity. Other energy-related businesses include a gas pipeline, natural gas vehicle fuelling services and energy consulting services. Last year, Tevco made net profits of Dollars 2.6m on revenues of Dollars 35.3m and its capital spending totalled Dollars 8.1m. Mr Baker said: 'This is an important strategic move, recognising National Power's reducing market share and limited opportunities for growth in the UK.' He said the company's long-term goal was to invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the decade. National Power also an-nounced yesterday that it was looking at the development of a Pounds 1.3bn coal-fired power station in India. It will undertake a feasibility study with Ashok Leyland on a 1,000MW station in Andra Pradesh, its second coal-fired station project in that country. The deregulation of the UK electricity market has weakened the domination of the market by National Power and its main rival PowerGen. Both companies now view overseas expansion as the main avenue for future growth. PowerGen recently announced that it was leading a consortium to buy an east German coal mine and related power generating plant.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: CLS for market with Pounds 110m tag CLS Holdings, the property company controlled by the Swedish Mortstedt family, is offering new shares at a 15 per cent discount to net asset value, reflecting growing competition and falling demand for property flotations. The company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds 110m when it floats later this month, compared with its adjusted net asset value of Pounds 129m. By comparison, the property sector is currently trading at around asset value, having held a 20 per cent premium earlier this year. CLS is competing with companies such as Argent and London Capital Holdings. Other property flotations this year have not fared well. CLS has responded to this. It is offering 45.04m new shares at 111p through a placing and intermediaries offer representing 46 per cent of the enlarged company. The shares offer a notional yield of 5.5 per cent, which is extremely high for the property sector. CLS was set up by brothers Sten and Bengt Mortstedt in 1983, when the family sold its property interests in Sweden and refocused on the UK. It sold close to half its portfolio around the peak of the market in 1989, and has been aggressively building it up since early 1993. About 97 per cent of CLS's properties are within the M25 area, the exception being a property in Dusseldorf. CLS will have net debt of some Pounds 155m after the flotation, bringing gearing back down to 120 per cent. The offer, sponsored by UBS and Apax Partners, closes at 12am on May 23. COMMENT In a sector stacked with new contenders fighting for investor attention, CLS has only one significant feature to make it stand out from the crowd: its price. At a 14 per cent discount to the sector, and a yield of 5.5 per cent, it seems cheap. The more complex issues like where does the company go from here, and why should the Mortstedt's float it at this price, remain unanswered. But the family are not selling a single share, and are taking half their dividend in scrip for the next three years. With that level of confidence from the backers, the shares look attractive.</p>

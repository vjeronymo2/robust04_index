			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter by Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino to National </F> Civil Renewal Party President Tomas Herrera and Miguel Antonio  Bernal in Panama City; date not given; passages within boldface  as published]    [Text] I am answering your letter of January 1994, in which  you convey to the Foreign Ministry your concerns and views  regarding a topic I deem of the utmost importance for the  electoral, pluralist, and democratic process we are going  through and for the future as well. I am referring to the  regulations on electoral matters issued by the U.S. Government  agencies that operate in our country, based on the Panama Canal  Treaties of 1977.    Well prior to receiving your esteemed letter, I took  particular interest in the case. Learning that Panamanian  citizens who work for the Panama Canal Commission [PCC], U.S.  military agencies, or any other U.S. Government agencies  operating in our country based on the 1977 treaties are barred  by a U.S. law that regulates their status as U.S. Government  federal employees from running for office in the upcoming 8  January elections was sufficient reason to conduct a necessary  and profound study of the topic, as well as to begin a series of  consultations with accredited diplomatic officials of that  country and the PCC, specifically, His Excellency Deane Hinton,  U.S. ambassador to Panama, and PCC Administrator Gilberto  Guardia, in addition to the consultations conducted by Deputy  Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero and Foreign Ministry legal  advisers who are knowledgeable of matters pertaining to the  Panama Canal Treaties.    By virtue of the 1977 treaties, the Republic of Panama, as a  sovereign territory, conferred on the United States the right to  manage, operate, and maintain the Panama Canal, its operations,  installations, and auxiliary equipment, and to provide what was  necessary for the fluid traffic of vessels through that Canal.  The United States accepted the concession of rights and pledged  to exercise them in conformity with the treaties and related  agreements. (See Article III, No. 1 of the Panama Canal Treaties  of 1977.)    In addition to the aforementioned and to carry out the  previously mentioned responsibilities, the treaty grants the  United States of America a long string of rights to fulfill the  treaty's goals. Among others, the right "to regulate relations  with United States of America employees" stands out. This point  does not differentiate the employees' nationalities.  Furthermore, the mentioned legal instrument stipulates that the  United States of America will fulfill its responsibilities  through a U.S. Government agency called the "Panama Canal  Commission." This commission is constituted in accordance and  adherence to the laws of the United States of America and is a  federal agency under the U.S. Executive Branch. As of 1 January  1990, the treaty states and as, in fact, has occurred, a  Panamanian citizen will be appointed to the post of  administrator. The Panamanian administrator is proposed by  Panama but appointed by the United States of America. (See  Article III, No.'s 2 (e), 3, and 3(c) of the 1977 Panama Canal  Treaty.)    In my opinion, the foregoing, which I am sure was already  known to you, sets the fundamental legal framework to  understanding the reason for the subject under study.    The importance to Panamanians of the current electoral  process and the holding of free and honest elections on 8 May,  is a well-known fact. They are the first elections to be held  in freedom and amid an undeniable political pluralism in the  country, after 21 years of a dictatorial government and the  unclear manner -- to say the least -- in which the electoral  processes were held prior to 1968. Furthermore, the current  transition period from the dictatorship which was in power until  1989 to the democratic system we have today, has had to confront  enormous problems and attempts were made to resolve them amid  very pressing circumstances from all sides. One of those  problems and the one that can serve as an example of the  military government's irresponsibility is the issue of the  Panama Canal and the areas and installations that reverted to  Panama based on the treaty. Undoubtedly, during the next five  years of government, regardless of who wins the elections, we  will have to continue establishing the bases to face the  transfer of the Canal to Panamanian hands in a responsible and  efficient manner.    Excuse me for this perhaps lengthy but necessary  introduction, because I think that the issue at hand is directly  related to that inevitable obligation that all Panamanians have,  without exception, to receive the Canal on 31 December 1999 and  to continue administering it in an autonomous and responsible  fashion, aside from party or electoral interests. From this  stems my interest in studying the history of the U.S.  legislation which governs, in general terms, all U.S. Government  agencies, including the Panama Canal Commission and the military  agencies of that country operating in Panama by virtue of the  treaties.    In my opinion, if Panamanian employees working for U.S.  Government agencies operating in Panama may or may not run for  office, causes me to distinguish the problem between one that is  strictly juridical and one that is juridical-political. The  first one, namely the juridical, outlines the simple analysis of  taking the instrument called the "Hatch Act" and its  modifications in 1993, and thus consider, in light of the same,  that the electoral participation is applicable to electoral  processes within the territory of the Republic of Panama, where  by virtue of the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty several U.S.  Government agencies operate. Without delving deeply into this  matter, I believe that in the strict juridical sense, this  provision is not applicable. Obviously, it is a federal law of  that country which was conceived in response to an aim strictly  in keeping with the United States and U.S. citizens' interests.  Legislative history, however, raises similar questions on  whether civil rights of U.S. public servants are restricted or  not.    The second one, the juridical-political question, is from  where I find the main basis for my opinion. It is important to  stress that by adopting this viewpoint, I relate the "political"  term with the interest and spirit of protecting, in this case,  the total independence of party and electoral politics of the  institutional life of our future Canal Authority, which will  come under our control within six years. The Authority's  absolute noninvolvement in politics must continue to be  considered a main pillar of the merit system that must prevail  in the rendering of services by the labor component.    Whether we like it or not, the labor relationship currently  in effect in the Panama Canal Commission responds to U.S.  interests and the Panamanian officials who work there operate  under that condition. This is established by the treaties,  despite our personal views on the matter. However, in an  attempt to be honest with myself and in light of the  responsibilities of my official position and the national  moment, I do not think it is prudent to separate the juridical  analysis from the great national interest that we must preserve,  which is to keep politics outside of the current Commission and  future Panama Canal Authority.    The certainly justified aspiration of a small group of  Panamanian PCC employees to run for elective office is worth a  review, taking into consideration the impact this may have on  the future on that entity's nonpolitical stance. If this  concept does not prevail, in view of the high regard with which  we must assess our national interest regarding the Panama Canal,  we may be sharing the responsibility for opening a door that may  mean the beginning of the end of the professional management  which based on merit governs that important institution.    Seeking a parallel situation with respect to Panamanian laws  that try to keep major institutions from becoming politicized, I  found several that partially or totally deal with the political  rights or participation in elective office of Panamanians. One  of those laws, and it is related to the Panama Canal, is Law No.  5 dated 25 February 1993 which creates the Interoceanic Region  Authority and adopts measures on reverted properties. When  referring to its board members, Article 8 of said law states:  "They may not run for elective office." One need not  go into the merit that such limitations on the exercise of the  rights of these citizens has within the context of the function  that said entity must perform in this final transition period.    On electoral matters, Article 25 of the Elections Code  partially limits the rights of a series of public officials that  have held certain posts or at any time are nominated to elective  office up to a period of six months before the elections or the  date in which they were nominated by a convention of the  respective parties, provided the conventions were held prior to  that six-month period. That is the case that currently governs  ministers, deputy ministers, managers and deputy managers,  directors and deputy directors of autonomous or semiautonomous  state entities, Supreme Court justices, Electoral Tribunal  magistrates, and others. One need not also mention or analyze  the national interest that this partial restriction seeks to  protect.    Regarding judicial officials, Article 49 of the Judicial  Code  does not allow Judicial Branch employees, even if  they are on leave or temporarily absent from their jobs for  whatever reason: "2. To participate in politics, except to vote  in official elections or referenda." On this matter, one need  not say what the nomination of the administration of justice has  meant in the recent past. [sentence as published]    With these three examples I have wanted to compare a  national  legal reality where the exercise of clear civilian and political  rights are prohibited as they are incompatible at a given time  with a given public post. I acknowledge that we are not dealing  with a national law -- in case that causes your concern -- but  with a general situation that is applied to Panamanian citizens  given their status as U.S. Government federal employees. This  is legally based on the rights agreed upon in favor of that  nation in the 1977 Panama Canal Treaty. Nevertheless, the  future national interest -- which I believe is important to  guard -- is to continue fostering the nonpoliticization of the  current PCC and of the future Canal Authority.    In light of the treaty, the interpretation given by the  Canal  Commission authorities and other U.S. Government agencies that  operate in Panama is correct. The only restriction applied, in  view of the aforementioned "Hatch Act," is that Panamanians who  work there cannot be candidates to public elected posts while  they are federal employees of those agencies. The other rights  to participate in politics and to actively participate in  political parties are not restricted, as long as this is not  exercised during work hours or with that government's official  resources.    I must confess that I have thought over this reply a great  deal and thought about the nonconformity it may produce in you  and in other citizens or political groups of our nation.  Nevertheless, my position as foreign relations minister, as a  lawyer, and as a Panamanian forced me to analyze the facts with  the care required under the circumstances. Above all, I hope  that the position I am currently adopting, which may be  criticized by many, will serve for reflection by the whole  nation on the vital importance to Panama of keeping the Panama  Canal removed from political party passions and decisions. This  was the main cause of the absolute collapse of our republican  institutionalization in the recent past, which we hope will  never return to our nation.</p>

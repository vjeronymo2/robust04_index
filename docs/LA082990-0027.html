Paul Anderson said.  </P> <P> Buttorff was appearing before Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III on two  warrants for possession of marijuana and one warrant for violation of probation  Tuesday when the escape occurred, Ventura County Sheriff's Lt. Michael Gullon  said.  </P> <P> Curtis remanded Buttorff to the custody of the Sheriff's Department, but rather  than taking a seat in the courtroom and waiting to be taken to jail, Buttorff  fled, Gullon said.  </P> <P> Buttorff was later seen running in the northeast parking lot of the Ventura  County Government Center. He got into a vehicle and left, Gullon said.  </P> <P> Curtis issued a bench warrant for Buttorff's arrest, Gullon said. CAROL WATSON  </P></p>

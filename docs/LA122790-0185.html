			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: COLLECTION OF STUBS IS FULLERTON MAN'S TICKET TO EVENTFUL HOBBY  </P> <P> After watching Nolan Ryan throw a no-hitter at Anaheim Stadium, Michael G.  Hess, thought to himself, "I better save the ticket stubs. You never know. They  might be worth something."  </P> <P> That was June 1, 1975.  </P> <P> From that first ticket, Hess has amassed a collection of 10,000 stubs from an  assortment of events.  </P> <P> At first Hess hoped to make money by collecting and selling the stubs but  decided that he would rather avoid the stresses of bartering, such as that  experienced by baseball card traders.  </P> <P> He has never sold any of the stubs.  </P> <P> "Now I'm just fascinated in learning about the people who bought the ticket in  the first place," said the Fullerton resident. "When I take a look at the  ticket stub I wonder about the guy who spent his last 10 bucks for it."  </P> <P> In fact, adds Hess, "I'm hoping to locate some of the people who owned the  stubs and meet and talk to them about the event they attended. That would be  the real kick of it all." Some of his ticket stubs include those from game  three of the 1989 World Series in San Francisco on the day of the earthquake,  the day Hank Aaron hit his 715th home run, a stub from a Bush vs. Dukakis  debate and one for the filming of a Pepsi commercial at which pop idol Michael  Jackson was burned in a freak accident.  </P> <P> The stubs, some catalogued in binders, but most stored in shoe boxes, are from  concerts, plays, travel, transportation, tourism, political events, pageants,  museums and amusement parks.  </P> <P> "Anything that requires a ticket,' said Hess, who estimates that he has  attended only a few hundred of the events for which he has ticket stubs. "Many  of those are from UCLA games," the Bruin fan said.  </P> <P> Hess has set up a network of helpers throughout the United States with whom he  trades stubs, including correspondents in Texas, Indiana and San Francisco.  </P> <P> "You have to be very selective sending ticket stubs to people you have never  met," he said. "For a while I was sending some really good ones, but I wasn't  getting good ones back."  </P> <P> The best have a history attached to them, such as a no-hitter in baseball,  according to Hess. He sometimes advertises in newspapers for stubs for  particular events.  </P> <P> Although he doesn't keep a written record, Hess contends that he can track all  his stubs in his mind.  </P> <P> "I may not be able to tell you what I had for dinner last week, but I can tell  you each stub I have," he said, adding that that includes what each stub looks  like.  </P> <P> "Tickets made years ago were all special, but the tickets of today are all  plain," he said. "They all started to look like that when you started buying  from the electronic booth like Ticketron."  </P> <P> He has established a "stub of the week contest" at his workplace at Hunt-Wesson  Foods in Fullerton, and at year's end throws a banquet and gives awards for the  best stubs contributed to his collection.  </P> <P> Hess considers himself a small-time collector. He said he is unaware of any  organization of ticket-stub collectors.  </P> <P> "I'm sure there is a market out there for them," said Hess, who does not know  how much his collection is worth.  </P> <P> "When you try to make money from your hobby you lose the worth of it," he said,  pointing out that the fun is in the collecting, not the selling. "Guys that try  to make money on it, ruin it."  </P> <P> While he has stubs from many events, "I still don't have one from a Beatles  concert," he said. "The collection will never be historically complete without  one of them."  </P></p>

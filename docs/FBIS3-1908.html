In a sharp exchange with Wu Yi, China's Foreign Trade  Minister, during a press conference in Beijing, Sir Leon said:  "Any action that discriminated against one member state on  political grounds would be a very serious matter -- not just for  that country, but for the European Union as a whole.    "I want to make quite clear that the foundation of the  relationship between the European Union as a whole and China is  one of non-discrimination."    When Wu jokingly suggested that Sir Leon had issued his  warning because he was a Briton, he replied this had "nothing to  do with it.    "I speak as the commissioner whose task it is to represent  the interests of the European Union as a whole. And if Madame  Wu doesn't fully appreciate that, I'm glad to make it clear now."    He did not say how Brussels might react to any  discrimination. But Community officials have hinted they could  take retaliatory action against China, which runs a big trade  surplus with Europe.    Sir Leon, visiting Beijing to discuss various trade issues,  was responding to remarks by Wu that suggested the row over  democratic reform plans in Hong Kong would inevitably affect  Sino-British trade. British businessmen have been concerned by  China's threats to exclude firms from lucrative contracts.</p>

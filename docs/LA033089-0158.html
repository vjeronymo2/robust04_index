			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PRIVATE ROCKET COMPLETES BRIEF SPACE MISSION  </P> <P> A small commercial rocket carrying six experiments soared into space for a  brief suborbital flight Wednesday in a successful mission for a fledgling  private space company.  </P> <P> Starfire 1, owned by Space Services Inc. of America, a Houston firm run by  developer David Hannah Jr. and former astronaut Donald (Deke) Slayton,  thundered into clear blue skies from this desolate Army rocket facility.  </P> <P> "The launch was picture perfect," said Don Montoya, a spokesman at the missile  range. "It went off . . . exactly when it was supposed to go."  </P> <P> The flight of Starfire 1 marked the first commercial launch involving a  privately financed payload, officials said. The $1.1-million flight was paid  for by the Consortium for Materials Development in Space at the University of  Alabama in Huntsville.  </P> <P> The payload parachuted back to White Sands, landing about 60 miles from the  launch pad. It remained intact during the fall back to Earth and was retrieved  for analysis by scientists.  </P> <P> Starfire 1 was designed to provide more than seven minutes of weightlessness  for the six on-board experiments. The experiments were devoted to materials  processing, including one using a small furnace to learn more about how alloys  are formed in weightlessness and another focused on studying how liquids mix in  the absence of gravity.  </P></p>

			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Upholstery side hits Airsprung Pre-tax profits at Airsprung Furniture Group dipped slightly from Pounds 5.96m to Pounds 5.91m in the year to March 31 after problems in its upholstery division including a large bad debt. The Wiltshire-based company, the second largest UK bed manufacturer after Silentnight, described the results 'as less than satisfactory'. Turnover rose by 11.4 per cent to Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 65.6m) generating operating profits of Pounds 5.77m (Pounds 5.76m). A month ago Airsprung warned that its pre-tax result would be below market expectations. The upholstery division increased turnover by 20 per cent but Bymacks, its main subsidiary, performed poorly and incurred the bad debt of about Pounds 250,000. An investigation revealed management weaknesses, the company said, and action had been taken. Airsprung said its bed division performed well with sales up 3.9 per cent in a very competitive market and a satisfactory increase in profits. 'The pressure on margins has been pretty acute but we've come out fairly unscathed,' said Mr John Pierce, chief executive. Its pine furniture division increased turnover by nearly 16 per cent and he saw much scope for expansion. Mr Pierce said there was little sign that the UK recovery had reached the furniture market. 'We've had to struggle for every increase in turnover with no help from the economy.' He added: 'However, we are confident that the group is in a position to take profitable advantage of any upturn in demand.' The company intended to increase capital expenditure this year to Pounds 2.1m. A proposed final dividend of 3.1p gives a total for the year of 4.8p (4.5p adjusted), covered 3.3 times by earnings per share of 16p (15.7p).</p>

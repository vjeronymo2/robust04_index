			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat by Marius Petrean </F> in Bucharest; date not given: "Where Is the Peace We Have Been  Talking About for the Past Seven Months?"]    [Text] [Petrean] More than seven months have passed since  the "historic shaking of hands" in Washington. Are you  disappointed with the way in which the peace process is evolving?    ['Arafat] Indeed, more than nine months have passed since  the meetings in Oslo and eight months since the signing of the  agreement in Washington, but I regret to have to say that  nothing has been accomplished so far.    [Petrean] How do you explain the delays in the initially  envisaged calender of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations?    ['Arafat] The reason for this is the policy of  procrastination and delay used by the Israeli Government,  something that jeopardizes the peace process and places it in a  dangerous situation. The Palestinian side has proven  flexibility and full responsibility by trying to reach a  so-called "peace of the brave men," despite the tough Israeli  practices in the field and the continuation of the Israeli  policy of killing and arresting Palestinian citizens, imposing  traffic restrictions, and maintaining a military encirclement  and economic isolation, something that makes the life of our  citizens in the occupied territories very difficult and does not  contribute in the least to the establishment of a favorable  atmosphere for making further progress along the road of peace.    The massacre at Ibrahim's Mosque in Hebron is a telling  example of the Israeli policy of colonialization and the Israeli  Government's responsibility for having brought these colonists  there and for having trained, armed, protected, and encouraged  them to set up colonies in the towns and inhabited areas of the  occupied territories. It is also a telling example of the  procrastinating and eschewing policy practiced by the Israeli  Government in the implementation of the accord and declaration  of principles signed in Washington last September.    [Petrean] The attacks and acts of violence continue  uninterrupted, particularly in the occupied territories. Do you  believe that the Israeli-Palestinian "rejection front" is on the  point of reaching its goal? How broad is, in your opinion, the  current opposition against the peace process?    ['Arafat] One must realize that the delay in the  implementation of the peace process will increase the number of  people in both camps who oppose this process. The general  feeling, which is increasingly growing day by day, particularly  among the Palestinians, is that the peace process is futile and  that it has failed because of the stubbornness and shunning of  the Israeli side. This feeling not only represents the personal  stand of several individuals, but is a pervading feeling  justified by the growing distrust in this peace process and its  usefulness. I have repeatedly warned that the delay in the  implementation of the peace process and in the achievement of  palpable results may turn the peace process against itself and  put it in a dangerous situation! Well, the present is just  proving this point, which cannot be ignored, since the acts of  violence are on the increase on both sides and the hopes that  the Israeli Government will favorably respond to the so-called  "peace of the brave men" offered by the PLO -- and successively  endorsed by the Palestinian National Council (parliament) in its  sessions -- are getting dashed. The Palestinian people are  fully engaged in the peace process and want peace. But more  than that, the Palestinian people want to live in peace and do  not want mere empty words uttered in a handsome way or brilliant  festivities and promises that are invalidated by the official  Israeli practice and by the actions carried out by the Israeli  colonists in the occupied territories. Now, I would also like  to ask a few questions. Where is the peace we have been talking  about for the past seven months? Where is the peace, when the  Israeli occupation against our people's freedom continues?  Where is the peace... when the Israeli prisons are full of  Palestinian citizens? Where is the peace... when the killing,  wounding, and humiliation of Palestinian citizens keep repeating  themselves day by day? Where is the peace... when the economic,  commercial, and financial isolation is practiced as a constant  policy? Where is the peace... when armed extremist colonists  are doing what they want in Palestinian towns and villages,  without having to answer to any laws? What shall I tell my  people? Shall I tell them that the peace process is useless,  since the Israelis are not serious and the cochairmen of the  peace process are making no effort to implement the provisions  of the peace accord? Shall I tell them that the other  international forces and the international community are also  doing nothing in this respect?    [Petrean] Is the PLO ready to ensure the rule of law and  order in Gaza and Jericho after the Israeli withdrawal? What  kind of social regime does the future Palestinian self-governing  authority plan to establish? Is democracy desired and possible?    ['Arafat] Palestinian democracy is no illusion or figment  of the people's imagination but a reality of the Palestinian  people within the PLO, a reality with a long-standing tradition.  Thanks to their originality, keen awareness, and feeling of full  responsibility, the Palestinian people have managed to preserve  and are still preserving this democracy, even during the  Palestinian revolution (known as the "Democracy of the Forest of  Guns"). Therefore, any future of the Palestinian people in a new  state of their own depends on the total and full application of  democracy and on its conscious and responsible practice, since  democracy is the citadel that protects the Palestinian people's  achievements. It is the citadel that preserves the order and  supervises the unity of the people and their parties and  institutions operating inside and outside the Palestinian  territories. All draft laws and the temporary Constitution  confirms, supports, and promotes this reality.    [Petrean] The PLO has estimated that at least $13 billion is  needed in the next 10 years to promote economic reconstruction  and meet basic social requirements. What are the financing  possibilities available to you? What overall economic strategy  do you envisage?    ['Arafat] I would like to emphasize the huge burden of  responsibility on the shoulders of the Palestinian National  authority for the future reconstruction of the occupied  territories, since we are obliged to start from zero and even  from below zero. The long years of the Israeli occupation have  brought the Palestinian territories, society, institutions,  governmental bodies, and national councils into a disastrous  state, something that has hurt the entire infrastructure;  consequently, we will have to rebuild this infrastructure basis  in its entirety.    Therefore, the PLO and the Palestinian National Authority --  fully aware of their huge responsibility in this respect -- are  doing everything possible to implement their economic program in  the financial and production sectors, so as to begin Palestine's  reconstruction as soon as possible. As you know, this requires  ensuring the necessary financial means for implementing these  projects and plans. We are now in the process of establishing  contacts with the relevant international financial institutions  and with the funds of the credit countries, which can grant  assistance and the necessary financial means. However, this is  a very difficult and slow process, which does not meet the  immediate requirements of beginning the reconstruction work.    [Petrean] Do you believe that Romania, which has always had  very good relations with the PLO, can participate in the  Palestinian reconstruction? What role can be played by Romanian  businessmen?    ['Arafat] We believe that a large part of the development  projects in Palestine should be done through bilateral  cooperation with friendly countries, countries that want to help  the Palestinian people and participate alongside them in the  development of Palestine. As you have said,  Romanian-Palestinian relations, at both the official or popular  level, have always been warm and sincere. We believe that the  friendship between the two peoples provides for a favorable  basis for increasing bilateral economic cooperation, and we hope  that Romania will play an important role, both at the  governmental and private sector levels, in the reconstruction of  the Palestinian infrastructure. We welcome this role.    [Petrean] Looking slightly ahead, how do you think the  problem of the Jewish settlements in the occupied territories  should be solved? What about Jerusalem?    ['Arafat] The problem of the colonies and Jerusalem should  be discussed as soon as possible after the implementation of the  agreements on Gaza and Jericho, within a period that should not  exceed the beginning of the third year after the implementation  of this accord. Let us not forget that these colonies are not  legal from a juridic point of view; nor are they legal from an  international viewpoint, particularly in view of the UN  decisions of the 4th Geneva Convention of 1949. Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin told me not long ago that he intends to liquidate  the colonies.    Regarding the holy Arab Jerusalem, it is subject to Decision  242 of the UN Security Council regarding the Arab and  Palestinian territories occupied after 1967. The problem of  Jerusalem is also covered by Decision 904 of the UN Security  Council, which considers Jerusalem as part of the territories  occupied at the respective time (1967).    Likewise, the Israeli United Workers Party sees the  possibility of creating two capitals in Jerusalem for the two  states, and we support this idea.</p>

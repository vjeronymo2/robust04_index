			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Management: Outsiders move in - Andrew Jack on the future for accountancy partnerships Peter Turnbull faces a daunting task this month as he settles into his new office on the edge of the City of London. He has become one of only a handful of outsiders to be hired in a senior position by an accountancy firm. His appointment as chief operating officer marks a renewed attempt by Robson Rhodes, the UK's 15th largest firm by fee income, to bring in external expertise from his roles as managing director of Lex Service and as an independent consultant, to help with the management of its professional practice. Two years ago the firm appointed Ray Pierce, a non-accountant, as chief executive, but he was subsequently headhunted by Guardian Direct, the telephone insurance company. The changes at Robson Rhodes reflect a broader trend among accountancy firms in the UK, the US and elsewhere, which are seeking new approaches to management as the traditional structure and operations of partnerships are increasingly seen as redundant. 'We have all spent ages trying to make it work, but the partnership model isn't sustainable. Genuine partnerships collapsed with size,' says Hugh Aldous, managing partner of Robson Rhodes. Deregulation by professional bodies in the early 1970s removed formal restrictions limiting the total number of partners in accountancy firms, at a time when they were already fast expanding in size, offices and the range of services. The days are now long gone - if they ever really existed - when all partners in the bigger firms could get round a single conference table, let alone meet regularly to control their practice by consensus. The role of the senior partner has consequently changed to focus more on management, with its occupant increasingly selected on merit. 'In the 1970s we were dominated by old men nearing retirement. You became senior partner at 60, and the place was full of nice old gentlemen,' says a partner in one firm. One of the first British firms to appoint a non-accountant to a top executive position was Casson Beckman, a London-based practice, which hired John Pearce, joint founder of Hoskyns Group, the consuntancy, as chief executive on a three-year contract in 1988. 'He structured us along tighter divisional lines,' says Geoff Barnes, the accountant who took over as chairman from within the firm. A small management committee reviews day-to-day operations, while all 25 partners meet each month to discuss topics such as hiring or removing partners. 'You cannot make every decision around a 25-seat table. Many partners want to be involved only in client work and are happy provided they are communicated with,' he says. The introduction of outsiders has been resisted by most firms, with the exception in many large US firms of general counsel, a senior lawyer appointed in a reflection of the country's litigious environment. Evidence of broader changes to internal management is more widespread. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's biggest firm, has for a number of years been headed by a chairman and an executive committee. Similar structures exist in all its big competitors. Most are based on hierarchical, traditional corporate-style approaches. 'I saw signs of this beginning in the early 1980s,' says Alan Hodgart of consultants Hodgart Temporal. 'There was enormous trauma and a tendency to centralise power.' In response, many partners within the bigger firms began to feel alienated, demotivated and isolated from decision-making. The consequence has been cynicism and a temptation to ignore or frustrate senior management's strategies. Hodgart says reformers at the time came to the wrong conclusion because they were often guilty of sophistry: they wrongly suggested that the partnership was the cause of management problems, and that the solution was to introduce alternative, corporate structures. The changes by accountants ironically have taken place at a time when many companies are trying to remove layers of hierarchy in their own organisations and to mimic the most powerful element of partnership - sense of ownership as a motivator. Hodgart says a number of the accountants also mistakenly believed they were following the lead taken by one of the world's biggest and most successful firms, Arthur Andersen. In fact, Andersen may have tight management but it continues to involve its partners actively in strategy discussions. 'Andersen, and other successful partnerships like McKinsey and Goldman Sachs, spend a fortune flying partners around the world to debate strategy,' says Hodgart. 'Because the partners know where they are going, they are willing to work within the strategy.' The structure also works because Andersen has grown organically rather than through merger, with partners around the world sharing a common culture, training and approach. The firm retains a strong element of democracy, with partners voting on the admission of their peers, and being consulted on the appointment and performance of their managing partners. Perhaps most important, partners are also receptive to the strategy adopted by the firm because it has manifestly worked, with Andersen widely perceived to have among the highest levels of profits and growth in the sector. However, David Maister, of Maister Associates, a US-based consultant to professional firms, argues that simply focusing on senior management structures and on the extension of participation in strategy is not enough. 'I have seen the strategic plans of all the major firms and they are identical,' he says. 'That is not a mistake. They are all stressing the right things. The race is about who can implement them best.' Maister argues that while firms may have altered their structures during the 1980s, they did not introduce management so much as ad-ministration by numbers. 'There was a sense that people will leave you alone as long as you meet your target,' he says. 'Very little changed until the last recession. For the last 20 years they were asked to be effective, not efficient. Now clients are realising that a lot of what the accountants provide is methodology-driven and not brain surgery.' While they have long made money selling management information systems to others, the firms are only now installing them internally. 'The real need is not for management at the top of the organisation but for better front-line coaches,' he says. For firms hoping to flourish in the late 1990s, learning the management lessons from their more progressive clients will be of vital importance.</p>

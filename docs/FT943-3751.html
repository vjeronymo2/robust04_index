			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Venezuela to raise petrol prices The Venezuelan government yesterday made public a two-year economic stabilisation and recovery programme that confirmed plans to raise domestic petrol prices next year. The low price of petrol - high-octane fuel is sold for the equivalent of 12 US cents (8p) a gallon - causes big losses for the state oil company PDVSA and a loss of potential tax revenues. But governments have feared social unrest that might stem from raised prices. The programme envisages government income from the sale of domestic petrol would increase to 2.1 per cent of GDP in 1995 from 0.7 per cent this year. This would be accompanied by fuel subsidies for public transport, and a conversion of the bus fleet to natural gas usage. Workers on the minimum wage would receive a bonus to cope with higher transport costs. The idea is to keep inflation at a maximum 65 per cent for 1994, and reduce it to 25 per cent in 1995. The government wants to maintain foreign exchange reserves at Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.5bn) this year - it said capital flight this year had cut reserves to a critical Dollars 8bn - and at Dollars 10.8bn in 1995. Growth is forecast next year at 0.5 per cent, after an expected negative 3.3 per cent this. The public sector deficit this year was projected at 3.5 per cent of GDP, down from 5 per cent last year, and is forecast to become a surplus of 1.1 per cent by next year. However, the so-called quasi-fiscal deficit - arising out of efforts to stem a deep financial crisis - is projected at 12.5 per cent of GDP. This would be covered by bond issues. The government said it would seek to raise overall tax revenues to 21.9 per cent of GDP next year, mainly by lifting returns from non-oil taxes from 8 per cent of GDP to 12.2 per cent.</p>

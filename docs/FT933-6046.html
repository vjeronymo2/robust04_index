			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Securities firms enjoy a year of living easily: Currencies, bonds and equities combine to give good profits This year has been so good for the securities industry that it has tested Mr Mark Houghton-Berry's faith in an old adage. 'There may be no such thing as a free lunch, but this one has at least been heavily-subsidised,' he says. Mr Houghton-Berry is head of bond trading at Goldman Sachs in London. For nearly a year, he has watched foreign exchange, equity and bond markets combine to provide international banks and securities houses with one of their most profitable and least risky trading environments for a decade. The results have become evident in Europe and the US over the past month, as banks have reported large rises in income despite subdued lending business. The US house Morgan Stanley is the latest beneficiary, disclosing record second-quarter profits of Dollars 224.2m (Pounds 151m), driven by a huge leap in trading. The US securities firms have not been alone. The European universal banks have offset large bad debt provisions and sluggish lending with dealing income. Swiss and German banks have benefited, while among UK banks Barclays made Pounds 234m on the Pounds 1.3bn in capital in its BZW securities business. 'It is unusual to have equities and bonds going strongly at once. Usually you expect one or other cylinder to be firing, but we've had both,' says Mr David Band, BZW chief executive. While much public attention has been on foreign exchange, securities trading has been at least as strong. The industry has benefited from a mix of short, medium and long-term trends. The near-collapse of the European exchange rate mechanism created currency volatility; falls in European interest rates led to a bonds and equity rally; and the shift towards lower inflation sparked a 'search for yield'. This has created a series of effects that have helped banks and securities houses: Re-rating of equities and rising bond prices have all led to large amounts of trading on behalf of customers. 'Volumes have been high in continental Europe and the UK, and a lot of US money has flowed this way,' says Mr Michael Sargent, head of equities at SG Warburg, the British investment bank. Mr Band says equities trading has been boosted by switches in asset allocation caused by political uncertainties and the shift in European interest rates. 'As long as political paths are not clear, institutions can change their big picture views of the world quite a lot, and quite rapidly,' he says. The breakdown of currency and interest-rate stability has led to demand for risk management services, as companies seek ways of hedging risks through derivatives. 'They are becoming aware that we can sell them insurance,' says Mr Michael Davis, a senior vice-president at Chase Manhattan in New York. As interest rates have fallen, companies have issued bonds and even equity to re-finance higher interest bank debt. This has been good for the 'bulge bracket' Wall Street firms that have picked up higher-margin equity origination business as well as the tighter-margin distribution of bonds. Integrated securities houses with the capacity to design and sell over-the counter derivatives have been able to stimulate business though what Mr Band calls 'reverse origination'. This means designing a product to suit investors, and using swaps to translate it into a form that attracts debt issuers. This has helped increase debt issues by companies which do not have a pressing need to re-finance, but are attracted by the chance to 'lock in' lower interest rates. Derivatives have given companies of all sizes more access to debt markets, so adding to the shift away from traditional bank finance. The size of the market for equity and debt has been raised by the shift towards privatisation of state assets both in west and east Europe. French bank privatisation this autumn follows Warburg's handling of the BT3 share offer, and the growing sale of assets from former communist countries. These trends have allowed large trading profits, which have been underpinned by the emergence of positive yield curves - higher yields for long-term than short-term bonds - in Europe. A positive yield curve in the US led to banks investing their short-term liabilities in longer-term government bonds. The shift towards similar conditions in Europe raises the question of how much risk banks and securities houses have taken on through proprietary trading in addition to handling customers' business. Most participants agree that market buoyancy has led to a rise in proprietary trading. Mr Houghton-Berry says that proprietary trading has been encouraged by the narrowing of margins on client business, and customers wanting to know whether a bank is confident in its own market view. 'Firms are increasingly being asked to put their own money where their mouth is,' he says. This in turn means that firms will be exposed to more risk when the exceptional market conditions turn down. The easiest profits have probably passed, since currency volatility is now easing. Yet a longer-term shift to lower interest rates would provide good trading conditions for bonds and equities. Mr Rod Barrett, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in London, says the market cannot carry on for ever, but may have some way to go yet. 'Maybe we will have another year of it, who knows?' he says, 'Eventually if rates settle down, the market will adjust to a trading range, and things will get quieter.' A gradual tailing-off of exceptional profits would be the best outcome for the industry. The alternative would be a sharp reversal of inflationary expectations or interest rate trends that would expose firms to losses on their proprietary trading positions in equities, bonds or derivatives. 'The easiest money has been made already. Sooner or later there will be a correction and someone could come unstuck. At the moment, people are still encouraged to go on,' says Mr Houghton-Berry. Even if he retains the subsidy on his own lunch, others could yet end up paying for theirs.</p>

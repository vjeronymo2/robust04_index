			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Hanson will net a reduced Dollars 175m from Beazer US issue The proceeds Hanson expects to receive from the flotation of Beazer Homes USA, its US housebuilding business, and an associated debt issue have been cut from about Dollars 200m to Dollars 175.2m (Pounds 120m). Beazer Homes USA will retain about Dollars 25m from the two issues. The reduction is understood not to have been caused by the rise in US interest rates or the turbulence on Wall Street in recent days. Beazer Homes USA had been due to buy some land in Hawaii, on which building work had begun, from a Hanson affiliate for Dollars 15.9m. However, Hanson has now sold this to a third party, thus reducing the projected earnings for Beazer Homes USA. This meant the indicated price range for the share sale has been reduced from Dollars 17 1/2 -Dollars 20 to Dollars 16 1/2 -Dollars 18 1/2 a share. The issue of senior notes has been cut from Dollars 125m to Dollars 115m. Hanson aims to sell 6m shares in Beazer Homes USA, which would reduce its stake to 33.3 per cent, with underwriters able to sell up to a further 900,000 shares, which would cut Hanson's stake to 25.8 per cent. The flotation is expected to be priced on February 22 or later that week. Hanson is also floating 100 per cent of Beazer Homes UK, its British housebuilding subsidiary, in March. That sale is expected to net some Pounds 450m for the conglomerate. Mr Ian Menzies-Gow, chairman of Hanson's building division, said Hanson would have liked to sell 100 per cent of Beazer Homes USA but its US advisers had said the flotation would fare better if Hanson retained a stake. Mr Brian Beazer, who was chairman and chief executive of Beazer when Hanson acquired it in December 1991, is to have a one year contract as non-executive chairman of Beazer Homes USA.</p>

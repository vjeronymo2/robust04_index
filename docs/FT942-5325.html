			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / People: Romano Prodi gets on his bike - Robert Graham reviews the achievements of the departing chairman of IRI Romano Prodi is demob happy, having plucked up the courage to announce his resignation from the chairmanship of IRI, Italy's huge debt-ridden state holding company. It was always questionable whether he would serve under the new Berlusconi government. In such a hot seat he would have guided the biggest chunk of the planned privatisations. But he took his time in reaching a decision. The moment he chose came last week when the IRI board approved the 1993 balance sheet with record losses of L10,320bn (Dollars 6.4bn). Today he begins a brief holiday to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary but will return in an interim role until the shareholders' meeting on June 28. 'There was no confrontation with Berlusconi,' insists the 54-year-old economics professor from Bologna. The two informally discussed his tenure at IRI last autumn when Berlusconi still ran his Fininvest media empire and had not declared an interest in politics. Even then, Prodi told the future premier he was not considering a long stay. 'To do this job properly now would require staying on for some five years.' Prodi wants to do other things like return to his native Bologna, ride his bicycle and look after his economic think-tank, Nomisma. He also wants to concentrate on one of his 'dreams' - the creation of an institute to export Italy's successful development of medium-sized companies to developing countries. Some colleagues say he is biding his time before entering politics, but he is coy about admitting this. Several times during the past two years of transitional politics, Prodi, who is close to the former Christian Democrats, has been mentioned as a possible premier. Since the election, several of his colleagues in that party have tried in vain to enlist him as a figure around which to build a new centre party to oppose Forza Italia. He is smart enough to realise that Berlusconi and his right-wing coalition government cannot be challenged in the short term. Asked how long Berlusconi's honeymoon will last, he chuckles: 'His popularity depends on whether or not Italy wins the Football World Cup.' IRI for him is already in the past tense: 'Mine was an emergency administration, brought in a year ago at the request of the Ciampi government . . .I was given a completely free-hand and had Ciampi's full support. It is the right moment to change.' Unsaid but obvious is the fact that Prodi would have to work with a government whose mindset he does not know and whose various components may be pulling in different directions. He would have risked being caught between those who want to privatise and wind up the state holding as quickly as possible and others, like the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, who are nostalgic about retaining a strong state presence in the economy - IRI was after all founded in the 1930s by their hero Mussolini. Prodi was previously chairman of IRI from 1982 to 1989. But his role this past year has been very different from what it was then. He found himself frustratingly fettered at every turn by politicians who invariably placed political criteria above business sense. 'It's been a very creative year,' he says with a hint of self-congratulation. He feels he has laid down the the essential strategic lines for IRI's future - 'progressive break-up through privatisation'. Prodi is not without his critics, but few would deny his skill in tackling the dismemberment of what was until recently considered an untouchable institution. In Italy it is one thing to talk about slimming down the public sector - quite another to translate this into action and tackle the vested interests. This time last year the turnover of companies under the IRI umbrella was equivalent to 5 per cent of Italy's GDP. By the end of this year, especially with the privatisation of Stet, its telecommunications arm, the proportion will have been halved. Privatisation revenues over the past 12 months have been L5,000bn. 'It is easy now to forget the tremendous scepticism only a year ago surrounding our plans for privatisation. Many said privatisation wouldn't work. They said people won't come forward and buy shares; others said the operations won't be transparent. No one believed we would sell off our entire stake in the banks.' Despite such scepticism, he claims a new share-owning culture has been created. 'Milan has been turned into a modern stock exchange,' he says, relishing the idea of days when recent turnover has exceeded that of any other European bourse. 'You had to begin privatisation of banking and finance. No other European countries allowed over 85 per cent of the banking and financial system to be held directly and indirectly by the state. You have to begin here if you want a more pluralistic system.' The banking privatisations he conducted - Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) - are a sore topic. He cannot conceal a certain bitterness about the way he failed to persuade the previous industry and treasury ministers to agree to introduce legislation which would have produced genuine public companies that protected the role of small shareholders. This left the way open for Mediobanca, the powerful and secretive Milan merchant bank, to establish a dominant position in the privatised Credito and BCI using its traditional foreign and Italian allies. The battle had been well signalled in advance. Prodi had already rejected a closed offer from Enrico Cuccia, the octogenarian honorary chairman, to take over at least one. 'At least through privatisation, we got more money than Mediobanca offered us,' he says in consolation. And adds defensively: 'The present situation with Mediobanca exercising such control can only be an intermediate one.' He believes other merchant banks can be formed by recruiting internationally to rival Mediobanca's near-monopoly position. The disposal of SME, the foodstuffs group, which he inherited, has also been messy. Part of the group, the canned foods side, was sold to a heavily under-capitalised consortium which has since been obliged to call in a white knight in the form of controversial financier Sergio Cragnotti, Raul Gardini's the former right-hand man. 'We got a good offer and the initial tranche of the payment was backed by bank guarantees. How could we refuse?' Prodi says of the original consortium which has now effectively been disbanded. On the disposal of industrial assets, he has managed to accelerate the reorganisation of Ilva, the loss-making state steel group, and hopes during the current month to be able to settle the disposal of the special steels arm. Here Krupp has emerged as a front runner in a consortium with the local group, Riva. 'I have nothing against foreign groups taking advantage of privatisation - although I think here as elsewhere in Europe, governments are anxious to safeguard against foreign ownership of utilities . . . Nevertheless, here one has to be careful of a backlash against foreign ownership. In particular there are problems at a local/regional level in Italy; and the trade unions remain suspect of foreign ownership.' He feels the most important signal the Berlusconi government can give is to respect the existing timetable for privatisations - notably for Stet and, outside IRI's empire, INA, the state insurance group. At the same time he says this means introducing early legislation to allow the Rome Airports Authority and the company running the Autostrada toll roads to be fully privatised. But an equally important signal will be the person selected to replace him. He observes dryly: 'I don't think Berlusconi has made up his mind about my successor.'</p>

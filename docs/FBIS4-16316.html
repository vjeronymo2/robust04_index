			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [S. Shcherbal report from Sochi; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] It looks as though Dzhokhar Dudayev has decided to  begin building ties with Russia by first making contacts with  the regions. Recently he visited the Russian agricultural fair  in Sochi and had an interview with your correspondent.    [Shcherbal] Do you intend to broaden economic cooperation  with Russia?    [Dudayev] We never intended to break it up.    [Shcherbal] I meant -- broadening it.    [Dudayev] Of course, we intend to broaden it, and only with  the CIS, with Russia. [sentence as heard]    [Shcherbal] Are you planning to meet with President Yeltsin  and discuss the prospects of establishing formal political  relations between Russia and Chechnya?    [Dudayev] We have never refused to do this, never. We were  never against interaction, meetings, political decisions,  cooperation. But the situation in Russia is very complicated at  the moment. And it is getting even more difficult. President  Yeltsin is being deprived from working on his own. In fact,  Russia has no firm foreign or domestic policy. One does not  know with whom one should negotiate. There are dozens of  delegations, representations from all sorts of parties and  factions, and everyone tries to grab a piece of the action. And  this presents the main difficulty. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A Normal Heights man was released Wednesday from County Jail downtown, where he  was being held on suspicion of raping a slightly retarded 22-year-old woman who  was reported missing Feb. 26, police said. Detective Robert Hilliker said  charges of raping an incompetent were dropped against 26-year-old Richard  Wallington, because the alleged victim, Lisa Louise Butler, did not want to  prosecute.  </P> <P> "She told us that she wasn't missing, and that it was her choice to go with  (Wallington) because she was doing her own thing," Hilliker said.  </P> <P> Butler, who police were told has the mental capacity of a 9-year-old, met  Wallington at a downtown bus stop and went to his home in the 3000 block of  Suncrest Drive, where she stayed all last week, said police spokesman Bill  Robinson.  </P> <P> An official at a supervised home in Southeast San Diego, where Butler lives,  reported her disappearance to police, who alerted the local media. Her picture  appeared in some newspapers and television news programs.  </P> <P> Hilliker said police interviewed Butler and determined she was capable of  making her own decision about staying with Wallington. He said there was  insufficient evidence of Butler's retarded mental condition.  </P> <P> Butler was found Monday in a Burger King restaurant at Fashion Valley, Robinson  said. He said that a man who had worked with Butler in a Special Olympics event  recognized her from media reports and told an employee to call police.  </P> <P> Wallington is employed at the fast-food restaurant and Butler was waiting for  him to finish work.  </P></p>

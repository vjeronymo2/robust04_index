			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Rail union backs talks but calls new strikes The three-month rail dispute edged closer to a settlement last night when the RMT transport union executive endorsed the call for negotiations made at the weekend by the union's signal workers' conference. But it also announced further days for disruption. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, said he was contacting the conciliation service Acas to prepare for talks with Railtrack on a restructuring package and on the union's claim for past efficiency gains. 'These will be conducted in parallel,' he added. 'We shall be talking to Acas about the most practical way of making progress'. The move followed the unanimous weekend decision by signal workers to call for talks on future restructuring for the first time in the dispute, while continuing to press their pay claim for past efficiency. Railtrack, the state-owned company which runs the rail infrastructure, said it was 'keen to resume talks on restructuring to resolve this damaging dispute as soon as possible'. The negotiations are likely to start immediately. Sir Bob Reid, chairman of British Rail, which operates rail services, welcomed the RMT executive's decision last night. 'It is a very hopeful sign,' he said. 'This is obviously a delicate stage and it is important each side enters this with a desire to reach agreement.' He added: 'The strikes have gone on too long and have caused a lot of damage. Many jobs are involved and many customers have been seriously inconvenienced.' However, the RMT executive also announced that Friday's planned one-day strike by signal workers would go ahead, and called for a further stoppage by signalmen from midnight on Wednesday September 28 to midnight on Friday September 30. 'At this stage it would be premature to consider lifting industrial action,' said Mr Knapp. Railtrack said it was 'extremely disappointed' that the union had 'chosen to further threaten the public with two further days of unnecessary action'. The RMT executive committee plans to step up the industrial conflict if no progress is made in the parallel negotiations. The final package will be presented to the signal workers for their approval in a postal ballot. In a related development last night the union executive announced a 24-hour stoppage on the London Underground for September 30 after a postal ballot of union members rejected a 2.5 per cent pay offer and voted for strike action by 2,072 with 809 against.

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 3.3m rights and 11% rise at Porvair PORVAIR, the maker of microporous plastics for footwear, textiles and industrial products, yesterday launched a Pounds 3.3m rights issue alongside announcements of a profits increase and a move to the main market. The 1-for-4 issue of 3.1m shares at 115p apiece is the group's first since it returned to the USM in 1988 after a six-year absence. The share price yesterday fell 5p to 136p. Mr John Morgan - chairman and chief executive, who was part of the buy-out team 10 years ago - said proceeds would be used for joint ventures in the Far East involving the textile product Porelle. The money would also be used for acquisitions to expand the industrial products division. Pre-tax profit increased by 11 per cent to Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.51m) on turnover of Pounds 16.7m (Pounds 15.5m) in the year to November 30. Protection from the UK recession was derived from the 89 per cent of sales exported, although sales to engineering companies and equipment makers were adversely affected. Earnings per share fell to 10.9p (11.6p) as the tax rate went up from 7 per cent to 21 per cent. Mr Morgan said it would be nearer 30 per cent this year. The final dividend is 2.2p for a total of 3.3p (3p). Gearing rose slightly to about 35 per cent of Pounds 9.9m shareholders' funds. Cash of nearly Pounds 400,000 was absorbed after Pounds 1.5m of capital spending. Of the move to the main market he said: 'We might look like schoolboys wanting to play in the World Cup, but it's providing a foundation for growth.' Dealings should start tomorrow.</p>

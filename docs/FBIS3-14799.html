The move threatens all Russia since "it can undermine  political stability and disturb peace in Russia," says a  statement released by the movement in Moscow on Saturday.    The movement regards the decision as legally misleading  since  amnesty as pardon presupposes reference to concrete criminal  code clauses. However, there are no such references in the  ruling, which need to be reexamined by the Prosecutor General  from the angle of its compliance with the law.    Those Duma members and factions that voted for the amnesty,  as democrats believe, cannot expect popular trust today, nor can  they hope for respect by posterity. "This applies most of all  to those of them who just recently disguised themselves as  democrats, above all Sergey Shakhray and Sergey Stankevich, the  Russian Unity and Concord Party leaders. On February 23, 1994,  they deserved the name "traitor," the document says.    The democrats are convinced that at a time of rampant crime  and political instability, putting the Duma's amnesty into  effect "threatens the rights, life, and property of the people  of Russia and the constitutional system in the country; it will  untie the hands of both those who once rebelled against the  legitimate government and of a significant number of criminals."</p>

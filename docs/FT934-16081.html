			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Minister steps up dole fraud attack MR DAVID HUNT yesterday made a thinly disguised call for people to shop dole cheats as he pledged to continue to resist European Community plans for mandatory workers' consultation in the decisions of multinational companies. The employment secretary told a Blackpool press conference he was determined that the government's fight against dole cheats - which has already netted some 65,000 false claimants - should be intensified. 'Everyone who is a dole cheat is taking money away from the unemployed,' he said. 'We cannot afford when resources are scarce . . . to allow that to happen.' Asked whether people should be encouraged to inform on fraudsters, Mr Hunt said: 'I don't want to talk about informers but I think everyone in the community wants to see law and order restored. 'There is a real determination among government and community in partnership to weed out people who do not respect the rule of the law. People are becoming more and more intolerant of people abusing the system.' In a rabble-rousing speech under the watchful gaze of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, Mr Hunt promised to veto compulsory works councils at next week's meeting of the EC's social affairs council in Luxembourg. The EC served notice last month of its intention to sidestep the British government's resistance and press ahead with the directive establishing the councils as soon as the Maastricht treaty was ratified. Britain would not be directly affected, as it has opted out of Maastricht's social chapter. But about 100 UK multinationals would be drawn in through their European subsidiaries. Offering plenty of red meat for the party's ascendant right wing to chew on, Mr Hunt, one of the most left-leaning cabinet ministers, called for all EC directives to be weighed against a new charter for competitiveness. 'If they seem to damage the competitiveness of our businesses without good reason, they should be booted right out,' he said. in a strong appeal for unity, he had some stiff words for Tory MPs who voted for Maastricht's social chapter earlier this year as part of their tactical manoeuvring to try and scupper the treaty. That was, he said: 'one sight I hope never to see again'.</p>

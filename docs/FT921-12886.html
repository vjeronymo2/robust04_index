			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Park Food forecasts substantial upturn PARK FOOD GROUP reported record sales of food and drinks hampers for 1991 and forecast substantially higher pre-tax profits for the full year to March 31. The statement accompanied interim results for the seasonally unfavourable six months to September 30 which showed a loss of Pounds 4.39m, against a loss of Pounds 4.51m for the same period in 1990. Turnover was Pounds 15.7m, against Pounds 20.3m last time. An interim deficit is usual for the group due to the seasonality of its Christmas hamper business. Turnover for the last full year, to March 31 1991, was Pounds 119.6m with pre-tax profits amounting to Pounds 3.99m. The interim dividend is lifted to 5p (2.3p); directors anticipate a final distribution of not less than 8p. Mr Peter Johnson, chairman, attri-buted the company's success to the fact that 'we have increased the number of our agents, average mem-ber spend has increased substantially, and we are buying far more effi-ciently.' He added that orders for next Christ-mas were already 'showing significant increases over last year', and he be-lieved that results for March 1993 would show a further significant improvement. The group has recently returned to its original core business of hampers, sold through a nationwide network of of more than 64,000 agents, following the disposal last June of its loss-making drinks division and of its frozen food distribution branch in December.</p>

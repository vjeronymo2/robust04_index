			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil One day Rentokil will certainly regret its stated target of 20 per cent compound growth a year. Indeed the 20 per cent fall in its shares since early March suggests the market already has its doubts. It is thus natural to look with suspicion on last week's bid for Securiguard. The argument is beguiling. Rentokil needs a new source of growth, not least to offset the impact of the recession in Europe. Last year's profits were flattered, not only by currency gains, but also because Rentokil took the last available opportunity under the old accounting standards to make an extraordinary provision of Pounds 7.8m to cover the cost of meeting US environmental standards. Its accumulation of net cash inhibits growth, while the company is now large enough to need more than bolt-on acquisitions. Hence the interest in Securiguard, whose operating margin of 5 per cent compares with 25 per cent at Rentokil. Assuming the bid eventually succeeds, Rentokil would have to raise Securiguard's margins significantly to justify its move. That is quite a challenge. Securiguard's cleaning focuses on the local authority market which is price rather than quality sensitive. Nor is there any certainty that companies will pay, as Rentokil believes, a premium for a quality security package. It would not do to write Rentokil's chances off too soon. At constant exchange rates earnings grew 20 per cent last year: turnover in the recession-bound UK was up 7 per cent, operating profit up a commendable 12. Still, on a historic multiple of 23, the company cannot afford to falter.</p>

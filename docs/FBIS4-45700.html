			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Environment: `Northern' Front </F> Against Dangerous Substances"; as released by Brussels  MULTINATIONAL SERVICE in English]    [Text] Things have reached the point where these days the  positions taken on the environment by national representatives  to the Council of Ministers have lost the capacity to surprise.  Now, once again, Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands are  making a common cause to ban the sale of hazardous products - in  this particular case creosote and chlorine-based solvents -  while the other EU Member States are trying to find a compromise  which will maintain the right of free movement for these  products within the Union. Meanwhile, the ruling which the  Court of Justice is expected to hand down in the next few weeks  on the German ban on PCP [pentachlorophenol] is awaited with  growing anxiety.    In March, the European Commission put forward its amended  proposal for a Directive "amending for the 13th time Directive  76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and  administrative provisions of the Member States relating to  restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous  substances and preparations." The new draft Directive basically  aims to restrict sale and use of three types of substance which  represent a health hazard to consumers: carcinogenic, mutagenic  and toxic substances, creosote and its derivatives and lastly  solvents with a chlorine base.    A first meeting of national experts within the Council of  Ministers on the proposals has already taken place, but did not  manage to settle all the problems, especially as regards  creosote and its derivatives. These wood treatment products  have a detrimental effect on human health and the environment,  mainly due to the toxic ingredient BAP  [benzyl-para-aminophenol]. The Commission has proposed limiting  BAP in wood treatment in industrial installations to 500 ppm  [parts per million], that is, about 0.05 percent.    Denmark, however, wants nothing to do with setting limits on  BAP. It simply wants to see a ban on sale and use of creosote.  The stance of Germany and the Netherlands is rather less  extreme: these two Member States are calling for a ban on  creosote sales to the public at large. For treating wood within  industrial installations, they are prepared to go along with a  ceiling on BAP, but much lower than the Commission's proposal,  at 50ppm, or 0.005 percent, and are demanding an even lower  ceiling, at 5ppm BAP, for wood treatment in general. Whatever  the case, Germany is calling for a total ban on BAP in tar-oil.  The Dutch have given to understand that they see a reduction in  BAP limits as a vital issue, given that their country makes  massive use of treated wood in its canal and inland waterway  installations. The Dutch are set to vote against the Directive  if the ceiling is not brought down to the lower levels they  recommend, and in any case have made it clear that if their  concerns are not heeded they will invoke Article 100a 4 of the  Maastricht Treaty, following the example set by Germany for PCP,  which allows for derogations to the principle of free movement  set in Article 100a on the grounds of environmental protection.    This question, which is of prime importance for the future  of  free movement, and environmental protection within the European  Union, is currently before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg.  The Advocate-General has already given his Opinion, in January,  on the individual case where the Commission authorised Germany  to impose a ban on PCP, following notification procedures laid  down in Article 100a4. He did not, however, pronounce on the  underlying legal principle. Meanwhile, industrial circles  waiting to see how much weight the European Court will give to  environmental protection, which has the status of a mere  ancillary policy area, as against the principle of free  movement, which is one of the basic principles of the European  Union.    On the other side of the fence, the Greeks, French and  Spanish, together with the UK and the Commission, are against  any restrictions on free movement, and are taking up a stance  diametrically opposed to that of the "Northern" bloc.    As regards chlorine-based solvents (which have carcinogenic  properties), the Commission is proposing a ban, except in the  case of three substances for which substitutes are not readily  available - methyl chlorate, perchlorethylene and  trichloroethylene. But the same scenario presents itself here,  with Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands calling for an  outright ban, while the other Member States are prepared to go  along with the Commission, which has undertaken to table  proposals on these three substances within three years.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Bayer tumbles 28% in first period BAYER yesterday became the second of Germany's 'big three' chemicals companies to report a sharp downturn in profits for the first three months of the year. Bayer reported group pre-tax profits down by 21.2 per cent to DM640m (Dollars 400m). It blamed a host of problems, including dire conditions in industrial chemicals markets and the adverse effect of currency movements. The results came a day after Hoechst reported a 28 per cent drop in first-quarter profits. BASF reports today and is likely to show a similarly depressed picture. The fall in profits reflected difficult conditions in the domestic German market and in Europe as a whole, in the chemicals business and the pharmaceuticals sector which accounts for a larger proportion of profits than at its big German competitors. Bayer's group turnover fell by 8 per cent to DM10.3bn over the three-month period. It said half the decline was due to lower volume sales, while the other half reflected pricing difficulties and currency movements. Turnover in the polymers business fell 12 per cent, in industrial chemicals it fell by 11 per cent, and by 5 per cent in the organic chemicals sector. Sales of agricultural products were 9 per cent down. In the pharmaceuticals sector, which accounts for 22 per cent of total turnover but more than half total profits in recent years, sales dropped 3 per cent in the quarter. 'Weak demand lead to an unsatisfactory level of capacity utilisation,' Bayer said of the main chemicals business. Overcapacity in world markets combined with fierce competition to make it impossible to implement price increases. In Germany, group sales dropped by 15 per cent, to DM3.85bn from DM4.53bn. Outside Germany, sales fell 2.6 per cent to DM6.49bn. The biggest fall in turnover came in Italy, where sales dropped 22 per cent. The results come after a year in which the group's total profits fell 16 per cent to DM2.7bn. Looking ahead for the current year, Bayer said there were no signs of any improvement in the economic situation in the second quarter, concluding surprisingly that full-year profits would be down on 1992. Bayer blamed the drop in pharmaceutical sales - which comes after several years of unbroken growth in the sector - on the German government's healthcare reforms which set price cuts and controls on prescriptions. Separately yesterday, Federal Association of the Pharmaceutical Industry (BPI) said that half the companies questioned in a recent poll had seen sales fall by 30 to 50 per cent in the first quarter of the year.</p>

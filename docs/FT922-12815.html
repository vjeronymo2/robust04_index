			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Workers at Caterpillar 'agree to call off strike' THE United Auto Workers union has agreed to end its strike against Caterpillar, the world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment, according to the federal mediator assigned to talks, Reuter reports from Chicago. The UAW will continue to meet company officials to negotiate a new labour contract. After two days of meetings in Chicago, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service said in a statement that Caterpillar agreed not to replace those UAW workers who had been on strike against the company. Mr Bernard DeLury, the mediator, said he had made various recommendations to representatives of Caterpillar and the UAW to end the strike and that the union had agreed to return to work without condition. There was no immediate indication of when about 12,000 striking union members would return to their jobs at Caterpillar plants in several Illinois communities. Last week Caterpillar unilaterally imposed its final contract offer and asked strikers to return to their jobs. It claims that more than 750 have crossed the picket line. The UAW went on strike in November when the company refused to accept a new three-year labour agreement patterned after the union's contract with Deere &amp; Co, the tractor manufacturer. The dispute is regarded as the most serious US labour-management confrontation in a decade. Separately, Caterpillar said in a statement that an Illinois circuit court judge would ask the UAW to show why it was not in contempt of court for allegedly violating an injunction restricting picket-line activities. Caterpillar said 18 strikers blocked plant gates and threatened returning workers with bodily harm. A contempt hearing will be held on May 18.</p>

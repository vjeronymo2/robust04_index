			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Arts: Back to brushstrokes at the galleries - Art After the event, the result of the Turner Prize has a certain inevitability, and even logic. Looking back, I now realise that Sean Scully, the one artist actually to put paint on canvas by means of a brush - a sort of stick-thing with bristles at one end - was no more than a token entry. In a fixed field of conventional conceptualists, he had no chance at all. The pity of it is that we have plenty of painters of just his sort - minimalist, or at least highly-simplified abstraction - who might have given him and us a run for the money. Such artists as Alan Green, Alan Charlton, Edwina Leapman, Marc Vaux and Peter Joseph have records that are no less long and distinguished than his. Set against them on equal terms, Scully might well have won, but he would have done so against his peers. But rules are rules, and any such race was just not on. Such rueful ruminations were brought on not so much by Scully's failure to come home the winner, as by Edwina Leapman's current exhibition at Annely Juda, altogether quieter and more properly modest an affair. Miss Leapman has been working to much the same programme for about 25 years, during which she has been principally concerned, she tells us, with 'close tonalities and vibrating light'. As for her colour, 'it is to do with space and the vastness of space: with the limited space of the picture and the endless space beyond its edge'. What she actually does is to lay a thin but resonant colour-field, these days usually fairly dark, a rich blue or green perhaps, over the entire surface of the canvas. She then lays another near-complementary colour, fairly close in tone, in regular, careful, albeit free-hand horizontal stripes across the canvas, leaving the ground-colour visible at the margins and through the abutments between the stripes. Some little variation, of size and format, is admitted in this process but most particularly in the actual working of the stripes themselves, according to the choice as to the thickness of the paint, stiff or flowing, the gauge of the brush and the load of paint it should carry. She fills the brush, moves it across the surface until it requires refilling, and so continues until the stripes fill the canvas. Nothing could be simpler, indeed quite worthy, some might feel, of the unregenerate Turner Prize. Quite why these paintings should be so beautiful and satisfying is probably beyond the sceptical, yet beautiful they are, and monumental, and profound in their teasing of the visual imagination. For the simple truth is that to set one mark upon another, one tone against another, is to propose an infinity of possibility of space and substance that only the imagination can explore. Just how close within its pictorial space is that delicate lattice of horizontal bars, and quite how deep the firmament beyond? The work of Mary Potter, who died in her eighties 10 years ago, has much of this same quality of apparent simplicity married to imaginative complexity. Here again the range of colour and tone is closely limited and controlled, in this case to the earth colours, ochres and umbers touched up with faded blues, greens and pinks. And again, in the characteristically dry impasto of the paint itself, we are made immediately and quite physically aware of the fact of the surface and the stroke of the brush. Such is the act of painting itself. Nominally figurative, these paintings withdraw from their subjects of landscape or still-life to the point of abstraction, teasing us on the very point of association and recognition, wryly fugitive and elusive. And they too are unexpectedly, subtly, irresistibly seductive. This exhibition, sadly, is to be the last at the New Art Centre in its present incarnation, for the gallery in Sloane Street, its home for 30 years, is to be bulldozed for redevelopment. Business in the meantime is to continue at Roche Court in Wiltshire, off the A30 just short of Salisbury, until new premises are found. Here in London we see too little of current French painting, for which both sides are equally at fault. The admirable Galerie Matisse of the Institut Francais, from its tiny space at South Kensington, does whatever it can on limited resources to supply the deficiency. Its current show of the work of four painters is perhaps too constricted physically to do either itself or its subjects full justice, especially given the size of some of the canvases. The great bonus is to see for the first time the work of the youngest of the quartet, Helene Delprat. She draws upon some obvious references and influences within the currency of international painting - from Picasso and Dubuffet to Paladino and Basquiat, with a generous helping of tribal art, and graffiti too - but she works it all with commendable vigour and confidence, and makes of the confection something quite her own. She seems to be a real painter, someone adventurous and ambitious and yet at ease with her medium on a large scale. Without the fashionable preoccupations, she could be better still. Edwina Leapman - recent paintings: Annely Juda Fine Art, 23 Dering Street W1, until December 22. Mary Potter - An Unique Vision: New Art Centre, 41 Sloane Street SW1, until December 24. Four Artists from France: Galerie Matisse, Institut Francais, 17 Queensberry Place SW7, until December 16, then on to the Institut Francais, Edinburgh.</p>

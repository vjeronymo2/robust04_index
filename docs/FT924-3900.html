			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Survey of Thailand (11): Beware of pitfalls for the uninitiated - A look at modern Thai capitalism THE experience of arriving at Don Muang, Bangkok's international airport, typifies modern Thailand and some of the pitfalls that await the uninitiated. The international terminal was modernised in the late 1980s and some construction is still going on. Because of the rapid expansion of tourist and business traffic, Don Muang is already becoming congested and a new airport is being considered at Nong Ngoo Hao, south-east of Bangkok. Nevertheless, arrival can be a pleasant experience in comparison to other airports in the region. There are dozens of immigration counters and officials vigilantly watch the queues. Whenever lines start to lengthen, extra officers swiftly appear and more counters are opened. Luggage arrives on the carousels with refreshing speed, and passengers can pass through customs within minutes. Signposts point to the counters of the two limousine companies operating shuttle services between the airport and the city centre. Just in case jet-lagged passengers miss the signposts, uniformed staff offer a helping hand, sometimes a little too aggressively. Private sector competition, friendly Thai service and a desire to make life comfortable for foreign visitors all help to convey the customer swiftly out of the terminal and onto the Vibhavadi Rangsit Highway. Only then do Bangkok's infamous traffic jams, worsened by the construction of a second-storey toll-way, bring the passenger rapidly down to earth. What the first-time passenger to Bangkok probably does not know is that there is a third taxi service into the city. There are no signposts and no official guides. You should neither head straight out of the building, nor turn right along with the tour groups, nor go to one of the limousine counters. Instead, you have to turn left outside the customs hall, walk through the friends and relatives waiting to greet arriving passengers, and report to an official counter. You can then board a regular taxi, now more and more frequently a brand-new, comfortable cab, and travel into Bangkok without the luxury of the limousines but at half the cost. This, too, is the result of modernisation. A closer look at its background reveals much more about the nature of Thai capitalism and the complexity of doing business in a country where enterprise is not always as free as it seems. Don Muang airport is also the site of the Royal Thai Air Force headquarters. Between the runways, officers and their friends can be seen playing the greens and fairways of the air force's golf course. The head of the Airports Authority of Thailand, officially a separate state enterprise, is traditionally an air force officer. 'We'll always need the assistance of the air force,' executives of the authority assert frequently, even after the anti-military protests in May and such reforms as the reshuffle at the top of Thai Airways International. The third taxi service used to be a totally illegal racket, apparently controlled by middle-level air force officers and military police. The drivers were often moonlighting junior officers who paid bribes to the controllers. Proper taxis were not allowed into the airport, but some managed to gain entry also by paying bribes. The limousines at that time were a monopoly of Thai Airways International, also dominated by the air force. Locals, unwilling to pay either the illegal operators or the exorbitant limousine fares, used to drag their luggage to the Vibhavadi Rangsit Highway in order to hail a regular cab. Public opposition to this set-up and its association with crime forced the authorities to install a more open system that would conflict less with such tourism promotions as Visit Thailand Year in 1987. Vested interests prevail, however. Thai Airways' limousine monopoly was broken with the introduction of the second service but the new concession was awarded to a company run by politicians with close connections to some air force officers, a fact that aroused considerable press criticism. The total absence of any information in the arrivals hall about the regular taxi counter is an indication of the protection the Airports Authority is willing to offer the two limousine services. Modern Thai capitalism consists of competition, openness and a more streamlined bureaucracy in some agencies, blended with influence, personal connections, corruption and red-tape. Public opinion and the desire to attract foreign investors and tourists have led to more modern practices. The Board of Investment offers faster, one-stop processing for new companies. Telephones are becoming easier to obtain without the customer always having to pay a hefty bribe. The new taxis really do operate with their meters running, at least part of the time. But the Customs Department remains one of the most corrupt in the Thai bureaucracy and the Immigration Department is a headache for many foreigners. An archaic aliens' business law reserves for Thais (and Americans under a special treaty) such occupations as hairdressing, alongside professions such as accounting. Changes of government or cabinet reshuffles tend to swing the fortunes of government projects back and forth with equal frequency. Foreign investors are therefore usually advised to form joint ventures with local partners who know the terrain well. Participants in trade missions are advised to give themselves enough time to learn about Thailand so that they are not misled into thinking this is another Malaysia, Taiwan or Italy. A typical battle is being waged by Lavalin International Group of Montreal. Since 1988, Lavalin has been trying to persuade the Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority (ETA), a state enterprise under the Interior Ministry, that its light rail system with an advanced linear-induction motor technology is ideal for an elevated railway in congested Bangkok. Lavalin's fortunes rose and fell as successive administrations - including successive shifts of power in the ETA - first favoured then cast doubt on Lavalin's bid. The technical side was not straightforward. Lavalin was offering technology and construction specifications that in some circumstances were radically different from the more traditional heavy rail technology of its rivals. At the same time, technical specifications were only part of the story. The battle between Lavalin and its competitors - which included Germans, Australians and Japanese - hinged on individuals both in the Interior Ministry and in the Cabinet. Some favoured Lavalin. Some favoured the others. While Thai governments came and went, Lavalin itself was taken over by another Canadian company, UTDC. At the critical moment of the final decision, power was in Lavalin's favour. It led to the signing on February 7, 1992, of an agreement for Lavalin to build what has become known as 'Skytrain'. In July, the government declared the agreement null and void because the Canadians had failed to keep a commitment on raising capital for the project. The Canadians say the problem is a technical misunderstanding arising because another partner in the project was also taken over. The details are convoluted, but the upshot was that the government, at that time under the premiership of Mr Anand Panyarachun, scrapped the project. Instead, a new state enterprise was set up to handle the capital's rail projects directly. The consortiums that bid against Lavalin have long given up the fight. But Lavalin's Thai representatives have tenaciously kept up the pressure. If Lavalin were not going to build and operate the new railway, at least it could sell the technology - and some trains - to the new state enterprise. Two recent developments seem to have improved Lavalin's chances. The September 13 general election brought a new government to power and with it new Interior and Transport ministers. The Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority has also seen another reshuffle which some observers say will swing the balance back in Lavalin's favour. A smooth ride can never be guaranteed, however. Two other rail projects for Bangkok are also being built and a German company recently proposed building an underground railway, something few ever thought possible for a city that is essentially built on delta swampland. The Lavalin story is a repeat of countless others. Leyland of Britain and Van Hool of Belgium spent years trying to sell buses to the Bangkok Mass Transit Authority, yet another state enterprise supposed to look after the welfare of the city's commuters. Neither made a single sale - the Japanese and South Koreans waited quietly while the Europeans battled and then shared out the lower-priced spoils when a decision was eventually reached to replace almost the entire fleet of buses. And yet the booming and congested Thai economy has created both the purchasing power and the need for infrastructure investment. The accompanying social changes are slowly forcing changes in the way business is conducted and in the way the bureaucracy works. And companies such as Lavalin show that tenacity, suitable products and skilled partners do allow non-Asian companies a chance in a country that often seems distant and mysterious.</p>

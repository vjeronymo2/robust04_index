			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Hanke: "Between Hope and Anxiety"] </F>   [Text] Is Rudolf Scharping, Social Democratic Party of  Germany (SPD) candidate for chancellor, secretly dreaming of an  election victory in the style of Bill Clinton? Citizens,  battered by crisis and disappointed, turn their backs on the  incumbent whom they no longer credit with any competency at all  in economic matters and bet on the younger challenger--and he  not only inherits the office, but also an economic upturn that  no one had clearly seen coming prior to the election.    Possibly nothing will come of it. Granted, according to the  polls, the German citizenry still credits the Social Democrat  with greater ability to solve economic and social problems, but  since the majority of economic research institutes now expect a  definite revival of the economy, the mood could certainly  change. The end of the recession confronts the Social Democrats  with a political problem: If they point out the risks that still  exist, they will be accused of aborting the recovery with their  pessimistic talk; if they go over to the optimists' camp, they  will be campaigning for Helmut Kohl.    The Federal Government, on the other hand, is no longer  racking its brains: It is proceeding full steam ahead with  optimism. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Minister for Economics  Guenter Rexrodt are already cheerfully talking about the  recovery. It does not bother them that both the research  institutes and their own experts in the ministries are prudently  avoiding this notion. Weak economic growth of 1 percent in  western Germany--which is what the institutes are  expecting--makes up for just one-half of the economic slump that  the old federal laender suffered last year, and an upturn that  produces new capacity and jobs is not in sight this year.    Nonetheless, even Minister of Finance Theo Waigel was trying  to spread nothing but sunshine at the spring meeting of the IMF  and the World Bank in Washington. The IMF's prognosis--0.9  percent growth in Germany--was supposedly too pessimistic.  Waigel's optimism, motivated by the election campaign, certainly  did not catch on with the Americans. U.S. Secretary of the  Treasury Lloyd Bentsen sees only a gradual recovery in the most  important industrial countries that, moreover, is still very  uncertain in some regions. Bentsen is convinced that more must  be done to ensure a long-term recovery. His undersecretary [for  international affairs], Larry Summers, is calling upon the  Germans as well as the Japanese to do more for the recovery: The  economy should be stimulated by interest rate reductions. And  the IMF grouses that German banks are not passing declining  interest rates on to their customers.    Not only abroad, but in this country as well there are  admonitions to prudence in evaluating the economic situation. In  that vein, Herbert Hax, chairman of the Council of Experts,  opines: "Granted, predicting a certain upward trend for the  German economy in the last half of the year is justified; how  strong it will be, however, is still completely up in the air."  Hax reminds that thus far, only foreign orders and popular mood  indicators have improved: "Data for the first quarter of 1994  still do not reveal an increase in production--something that no  one expected."    The coalition parties, however, are not being held back by  realism. Count Otto Lambsdorff, Free Democratic Party (FDP)  economic policy specialist, is damaging his own credibility with  the comment, "the recovery in Germany is picking up tempo." His  Christian Democratic Union (CDU) colleague Rainer Haungs is  already talking about "the leading role of the German economy."  It does not bother the coalition members that they are becoming  entangled in their own glaring contradictions: Just a few weeks  ago, Germany as a place for business and industry was allegedly  threatening to plunge into third-rate status; if economic  shortcomings were not piling up, then first-rate structural  problems were: the cost crisis, the innovation crisis, and the  employment crisis. But that is all old hat now.    In its euphoria, the Federal Government runs the risk of  talking at cross-purposes with the citizenry, for this much is  certain: Workers will be perceptibly worse off this year. If the  citizens make judgments based on their wallets, Kohl will  continue to be in a difficult position: Because of modest wage  settlements and tax increases, disposable income has shrunk a  total of 1.5 percent--and total income has even declined by 3  percent. "That is the steepest decline in the history of the  Federal Republic," emphasizes Heiner Flassbeck of the German  Institute for Economic Research.    The six institutes disagree only as to whether private  consumption will decline by 0.5 or 1.5 percent as a consequence  of this slump. Nor will there be any substantial improvement in  the coming year: The institutes expect that private consumption  will probably only stabilize in the foreseeable future. To be  sure, the research economists are counting on growth of more  than 9 percent in incomes from business activity, yet whether  that is a cause for celebration on the part of the broad mass of  voters may be doubtful indeed, for the rising profits are having  no effect on the most serious problem: unemployment. It  continues to increase this year and, according to the  institutes, a turnaround in the trend will not occur until 1995.  On this score, they are more optimistic than the president of  the Federal Association of German Industry, Tyll Necker: He is  not expecting growth in jobs before 1996 at the earliest; next  year the slide will only be halted. What the entrepreneurs,  labor unions, and economists have been preaching for months  remains true: Unemployment will not go away by itself. After the  brutal down-sizing and efficiency cure that industry has been  undergoing, production can be increased with a reduced labor  force.    The Federal Republic, like the European countries as whole,  cannot survive in the long run solely on the life support  provided by American demand. They themselves must provide for a  more stable domestic economic situation. More robust domestic  demand as well as markedly fewer jobless will not occur  automatically, however, and it would therefore be disastrous if  the economic policymakers were to lie back now and celebrate  their putative successes. Klaus-Werner Schatz of the Kiel  Institute for Global Economy warns: "Our biggest worry is: How  can we again achieve a higher rate of employment? To do so, the  tax burden must be reduced, but fiscal policy is not yet  undertaking the efforts that are necessary for us to achieve a  strong upturn with growth in employment."    While the institutes are calling for tax reductions, the  Federal Government is doing the opposite: The solidarity surtax  [to assist in financing the reconstruction of eastern Germany]  will once again be increased at the beginning of next year and  capital and insurance taxes will be raised. Moreover, there will  be another increase in oil taxes or other taxes to finance the  reform of the railroad system. Even an increase in the  value-added tax cannot be excluded any longer since the Federal  Government is negotiating with local governments on granting  permission to the latter to share in this revenue  source--something that, should it come about, will hardly be  feasible without an increased tax rate.    Thus, the Federal Government talks about the necessity for  the tax burden to be reduced again but does the exact opposite.  In so doing, it not only mortgages the national economy, it also  does nothing short of forcing the labor unions to adopt a more  aggressive wage policy that would threaten the unit labor cost  reductions that have just been achieved. In violation of all its  promises, the government is staking everything on further tax  increases because it is plagued by debt. In spite of constantly  increased taxes, the debt burden continues to grow and early  next year the 2-trillion-mark level--equating to 60 percent of  the GNP--will be surpassed. Driven by the avalanche of debt in  fiscal policy matters, the Federal Government's economic policy  is currently exhausting itself in a battle over the repeal of  the Rebate Act.    Nonetheless, the struggle for power is becoming more  difficult for Scharping: If Kohl can point to an economic bright  spot on the horizon, it would be frivolous to continue to hew to  the same line that holds that the chancellor will do himself in.  Scharping can no longer restrict himself to the message that he  agrees with the Federal Government on many fundamental  issues--it is just that his policy would be somewhat better in  the area of social welfare. Should he, in fact, have better  prescriptions for freeing the German economy from its state of  paralysis between recession and recovery, he must explain them  now as quickly as possible. Remaining silent and trusting that  the Federal Government will make itself an unacceptable choice,  is likely to be the surest way to put himself out of the race.</p>

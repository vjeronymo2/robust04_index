			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Law for an Illegal Owner"] </F>   [Text] The law on land has long been awaited by everyone.  The problem of transferring or exchanging land, which is being  resolved with such difficulty today, may not have existed, if  this law had been adopted alongside the laws on land reform and  "On the Procedure and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to  Preserved Real Estate." The latter may have been simpler and  shorter, because the current land law could have regulated many  issues. If the nation decided to restore the former preserved  property to everyone, it should have done so without such delay,  and immediately adopted this law on land which regulates land  ownership and grants its owners the right to sell, lease,  mortgage, or exchange it. Owners themselves would have  regulated this issue much faster than the state. The latter  began to move land from the owners' former place of residence to  their current one. The state transferred the land for some  owners, but did not have the chance to do so for others.  Protectionism emerged: Those who were smarter managed to get  their land from the bureaucrats, while those who did not have  access to them remained behind. People were set against each  other, and those who believed in the return of justice became  disillusioned. The further we go, the more injustice we have.  The state has decided to buy land from those owners to whom it  allegedly has no possibility of returning it. The area of land  that cannot be returned is increasing each year, while the state  is promising to buy it at market prices. What market? Who  knows the price, if the land market did not exist then?  Finally, it is clear even to a child that a market is possible  only between two sides that make a deal. Did any former owners  ask the state to buy their land of their free will? They are  placed in such a situation because otherwise they would not  regain their land all the same. Even compulsory leasing has  emerged.    Amendments to this land reform and the law "On the Procedure  and Terms for Restoring the Citizens' Right to Preserved Real  Estate" have been sitting at the Constitutional Court for a long  time. Are they covered with dust? It may make no sense to  annul these amendments later, because the new law on land  adopted by the Seimas will make that injustice even more  profound.    Yes, the land law itself does not seem so bad -- the sale of  land exists throughout the world and is regulated by the law.  However, who is this owner possessing those rights? Apart from  real owners, the state also owns land. Article 4 of this law  indicates what land belongs to the state. The law seems to be  correct because it states that land under state ownership is  that which is necessary for common interests: Land for roads,  railways, national parks, recreation areas, and land containing  waters of state importance, cultural and historical  monuments.... However, the law further details the sale of  state land for private ownership. What land will the state  sell? The land indicated in Article 4 which cannot be sold to  private persons? The goal is stated in the third part of the  law: Land that has not been returned to owners also belongs to  the state. Why was it not returned? Why can the state have it  while the owner cannot? Moreover, the law also recognizes as  owners such people who bought or acquired land free of charge  from the state. It follows that without restoring land to some  owners (the previously adopted laws grant such a right), the  state will sell it to others. This law allows state  institutions and their employees to do so. That is why owners  are against this law, and the opposition is urging the president  not to sign it, threatening to appeal to the Constitutional  Court. What can the Constitutional Court do? Does the law on  land create this injustice? It only follows the tail of its  predecessors.    Meanwhile, the "good" opposition had better keep silent now.  Who prevented it from adopting the land law on time? During  its former rule, the opposition also transferred the procedure  of land restoration to state institutions rather than owners  themselves. It is said that the time for adopting the law on  land was not right. Land would have allegedly fallen into the  hands of a few rich people who had acquired their wealth in a  slightly dishonest manner. Do we have fewer rich people today?  Did they earn their wealth in a more honest way?    Neither the current opposition nor the ruling force cared  much about this justice, as well as about real land owners and  users. Some of them wanted to make exceptions to a small group  of owners. This is exactly what happened. Who regained land  successfully and without any problems during the rule of the  current opposition? Others, however, are concerned with a  handful of officials. If the latter were short of state assets  they could distribute, redistribute, or "carve off" a few bits  for themselves, now they will have them. These assets have been  legalized.</p>

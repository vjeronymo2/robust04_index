			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Delegates cautious as rubber pact talks open Negotiations between rubber-producing and consuming nations opened here yesterday with no immediate movement toward a new price stabilisation pact, trade officials said, reports Reuter from Geneva. Delegates at the 10-day meeting, held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, are aiming to replace the 1987 International Natural Rubber Agreement, which is due to expire in December having already been extended for 12 months. They elected Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia as conference president, but neither consumers nor producers made official statements at the opening plenary session. 'No paper was tabled,' one official said. Rubber growers are expected to press for a buffer stock buying and selling range at a higher level than in the expiring accord. But consumers are certain to resist this, as they did repeatedly last year.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Letter: 'Stagflation' is a real possibility Sir, It appears that the fundamental shortcoming in the argument by the 'MIT Six' (Personal View, July 29) has not yet been pointed out. The European Community is suffering high and permanent unemployment primarily due to large increases over the past two decades in social benefits and the minimum wage. This has put an above-market floor under wages, causing a labour surplus. Reflation accompanied by devaluation can reduce such unemployment if it raises the level of prices and nominal incomes while the level of social benefits and the minimum wage remains more or less fixed. But almost all such benefits are now indexed to rise automatically with wages or prices, or provided in kind. Therefore, reflation can reduce permanent unemployment only if minimum wage and benefit formulae are cut or de-indexed at the same time. Reflation without such changes is merely a formula for 1970s-style 'stagflation' - simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment.

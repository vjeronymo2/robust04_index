			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Out in the cold: Europe's reaction to deepening unrest In the absence of political dialogue and economic reform in Algeria, the European Union is increasingly leaving the country out in the cold. Yesterday the EU Council of Ministers gave the Brussels Commission a mandate to negotiate an eventual free trade accord with Tunisia, as the Council had earlier this month decided to do for Morocco. No such new relationship with Europe is in prospect for Algeria, until the latter's government can find some way of ending its incipient civil war with Islamic dissidents and returning to the path of economic reform. Much turns on Algeria's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a reform and credit package; an IMF team has just visited the country and will return for further negotiations next month. 'We hope that the Algerians will get into bed with the IMF and produce a nice baby in the form of an economic reform programme,' said a Brussels official yesterday. And indeed Mr Rehda Malek, the prime minister, was last week promising 'an acceleration of economic reform and speedy moves to re-establish security' to reassure Algeria's foreign partners. But until this happens, the second, Ecu150m tranche of a 1991 EU credit to Algeria will remain frozen, though Brussels has this year given the country Ecu100m for low-cost housing and food imports. These amounts are small, given Algeria's crushing debt-servicing burden, which at present eats up almost the entirety of its oil and gas export earnings. But the Algiers government refuses to seek a full rescheduling of its debt, as Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, and a number of EU governments have urged it to do. Mr Malek only talks of a partial 'reshaping' of the debt. This refusal to countenance a full rescheduling stems in large part from the Algerians' feeling that they would lose face and sovereignty in submitting themselves to the closer creditor scrutiny which accompanies such debt relief, but also because Japan, one of Algeria's biggest creditors, is set against any rescheduling. Unlike distant Japan, France feels exposed to the impact of social and political upheaval in Algeria. The French government has been quietly urging its European partners to follow its lead in renewing credit to the country. Earlier this year France gave Algeria a FFr6bn export credit to enable it buy French goods, especially food, pharmaceuticals and car parts. 'But we are a bit alone in this,' said a French official yesterday, though he claimed Italy and Spain shared French concern about stability in Algeria. At the same time, in response to the Islamic fundamentalists' killings of foreigners, the French government is discreetly reducing the size of the French community in Algeria. There are, or were, 25,000 French nationals registered with the three French consulates, with more than 50,000 unregistered French citizens in the country, mostly with dual nationality. In addition to pulling out some of its own diplomats and employees in Algeria, the French government has been advising its citizens to take advantage of the autumn school break and now the Christmas holidays to come to France and not to return. Some 5,000 French, mainly wives and children, have taken this advice since mid-October. The remaining French community in Algeria has been told to exercise 'extreme vigilance', and has been given radio telephones to stay in contact with French consulates. From Paris has come a steady stream of public calls for the Algerian authorities to talk to its opponents and to do a deal with the IMF. In doing so, France has tried to keep a certain distance from the Algerian regime. But this effort was somewhat undermined by the French interior ministry's recent action in rounding up some 88 suspected Islamic fundamentalists in France for questioning about their links with the FIS and other organisations. France's overriding interest is in stability in Algeria, whoever rules the country. In the end, Paris reckons that the Algerian government has a far better chance of providing the democratic and economic conditions for stability than its opponents.</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL '90 PREVIEW;  </P> <P> CHILI DAVIS PROVES HE'S WORTH HIS HIGH PRODUCTION VALUES;  </P> <P> DEPENDABLE: OUTFIELDER COMES THROUGH IN CLUTCH, AND DOESN'T SEEM TO MIND THAT  HIS REPUTATION FAILS TO MATCH HIS ACHIEVEMENTS.  </P> <P> Let's talk run production.  </P> <P> Chili Davis led the Angels in runs batted in again last year, becoming only the  fourth player in club history to lead that category for two consecutive seasons  with 90 or more each year.  </P> <P> How about clutch hitting?  </P> <P> More than one-third of Davis' RBIs either tied the game or put the Angels  ahead. Seven of his team-high 22 home runs were three-run shots.  </P> <P> Recognition? Fame? Glory?  </P> <P> Call Don Mattingly.  </P> <P> Claudell Washington says of Davis: "My brother does not get his due." General  Manager Mike Port, with a bent for elocution, feels pretty much the same.  </P> <P> "Other fellows, for whatever reason, are more frequently acknowledged as being  tough in the clutch or get more notoriety given similar RBI production," Port  said. "But this is a guy who enjoys playing and gives you a lot of effort and  time out on the field, very productive time at that.  </P> <P> "He very quietly drives in 90 runs a year. It's also the manner of the man,  though. You're not going to find Chili soliciting a lot of attention."  </P> <P> Davis is in the second year of a three-year contract that pays him $1.375  million for this season and $1.45 in 1991, so it's obvious Port isn't one of  those who have overlooked Davis' contributions. And that, Davis says smiling,  is the kind of notability he values most.  </P> <P> "I'm not looking for recognition . . . just money," he says with a laugh.  "Anyway, I don't think I've done anything all that great to be plastered on the  cover of Sports Illustrated every week.  </P> <P> "Ever since I came into this game, I've been in that slot where you're going to  come up to bat a lot with runners on base. And you're supposed to drive those  runs in because that's what you're being paid for. Some guys are paid to get on  base and score a lot of runs. Some guys are paid for defense. Pitchers are paid  to get guys out. I'm paid to drive in runs."  </P> <P> But don't let Davis' a-day's-work-for-a-day's-pay spiel fool you. He may  project a cavalier image, but he's not the type to take the money and run. Or  even take the money and jog out a ground ball, for that matter.  </P> <P> Davis' determination to win surfaces when he least expects it, such as when he  dismisses his run production with another "just-doing-my-job" routine.  </P> <P> "Anyway, it's not the runs that you drive in that you think about," he said.  "It's the ones you miss. If you finish a year with 150 RBIs, you'd still think  about the 50 you missed."  </P> <P> That attitude was an important factor in the Angels' decision to shell out $4.1  million and give Davis a three-year contract. They like the way he bats, but  they admire the way he battles even more.  </P> <P> "The single most important thing for Chili is winning," Port said. "He will  call me several times over the course of the winter, wanting to know what's on  tap to improve the club. And every time he sees me, he flicks his fingers. He  wants a World Series ring. That's his No. 1 priority."  </P> <P> Actually, that's his No. 1 dream. His top priority is to maintain his  self-esteem and enjoy the game . . . while it lasts.  </P> <P> "As long as I'm playing and I'm not cheating myself, not dogging it, I'm  happy," Davis said. "What disappoints people is if you're not giving the 100%  you owe yourself, the organization and the fans every time you go out there. If  you goof up giving 100%, well, it's going to happen. But if you goof up giving  50%, then people aren't going to accept it. And you shouldn't accept it."  </P> <P> Chili knows goofing up. In 1988, he set the team record for errors by an  outfielder with 19. Port says that season of defensive discontent was an  aberration. After being switched from right field to left field last year,  Davis made just six errors.  </P> <P> But the images of that infamous, early-1988 string of miscues -- often the  highlights of the evening news sports segments -- don't easily fade from  memory. And Port thinks the defensive lapse is still robbing Davis of deserved  renown.  </P> <P> "The only rationale that I can offer is that maybe some of what Chili Davis is  as a man and what he means to this club is a tad overshadowed by what people  recall from two years ago, when he was in right field, when he struggled  defensively and was off to a slow start with the bat.  </P> <P> "Perhaps, as is human nature, people formulated opinions then and have  overlooked the fact that he has meant a lot to this club."  </P> <P> Davis seems genuinely unaffected, however, and he's certainly not going to  waste any time pouting over a lack of attention.  </P> <P> "I'm only going to play so long and when it's over, it's over. I started out in  center field, moved to right and then moved to left. Probably, a couple of  years down the line, I'll DH. And before you know it, I'll be riding around the  field in a golf cart."  </P> <P> By that time, the Angels hope their Davis has more rings than Sammy Davis Jr.  And, considering the apparent strength of the American League West again this  season, they'll need another healthy dash of Chili power if they hope to cook  up a trip to the World Series.  </P> <P> Last year, the Angels were 16-4 in the games in which Davis homered. They came  up eight games short of tying for the division title. Davis, 30, figures he can  chip in another eight homers and match his age. So, if all else remains equal .  . .  </P> <P> "Joe Morgan once told me that he hit his peak at 30 years old," Davis said. "So  I've gauged myself for 30. I'm expecting a real big year, not just for me but  for the team.  </P> <P> "I think 30 homers is a very reachable goal. It's just a matter of starting off  the season well, getting some balls and driving them. I need to start off with  a couple of months of hitting .350 and poppin' some balls. You'd like to have  maybe 15 at the break and carry on after that."  </P> <P> The Angels had the fifth-best record in baseball last year. From June 23 to  Sept. 1, they never were more than three games out of first and they even had a  2 1/2-game lead in late July. But the bubble burst in September, when they went  2-8 against Cleveland, Kansas City and Texas.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of guys who hadn't played together, but we blended well and we  were a good team in a tough division," Davis said. "We won a lot of games but  it just wasn't enough. It's obvious we're going to have to go out and really  bust our butts."  </P> <P> Davis showed up in Mesa, Ariz., after the lockout looking quite trim, probably  close to the 210 pounds he's listed at in the media guide. Last year, he showed  up for spring training looking, well, to use his own word, "fat."  </P> <P> He worked hard this off-season, thanks in part to a suggestion by a certain  interested party who has been known to ask his players to step outside when he  felt it necessary.  </P> <P> "I had a guy tell me and a few other players at end of the season last year,  'You guys are all going to be 30 next year, so come to camp in shape.'  </P> <P> "He once said that he'd take any of us on and I didn't feel like fighting him.  So I came to camp in shape."  </P> <P> But when you ask Davis to identify the party in question, he laughs and says,  "Gene Autry."  </P> <P> Doug Rader loves having Davis in his lineup. The Angel manager likes all those  line drives and the rare luxury of a having a switch-hitter with bona fide  power from both sides of the plate.  </P> <P> He also thinks Davis sets a great example. He says Davis is a team leader.  </P> <P> Don't tell Chili, though.  </P> <P> "This team doesn't need leaders," Davis says. "We've got a manager who's been  around. Everybody here is the type of player who takes care of himself.  </P> <P> "I hate that tag. You do something for a few years and all of a sudden, boom,  you've got to be a leader. What the hell are you going to lead? People are  going to be people. I'm not Moses or somebody."  </P> <P> When appraised of Davis' rather forceful feelings on the subject, Rader smiles  and politely disagrees.  </P> <P> "He's wrong. You do need leaders. You need people to set examples.  Unfortunately, most people perceive a leader as a rah-rah guy and that's  ridiculous. The leaders are the people who govern themselves properly and set  good examples. In that respect, Chili Davis meets my criteria for being a  leader."  </P> <P> As much as he shuns the role, Davis isn't so humble as to refuse to give a tip  to the younger players who want to learn how to swing a big stick in the big  leagues. His advice: "Don't listen to anyone's advice."  </P> <P> "Hitting is just a matter of experimenting, constant experimenting, to find out  what works best for you. And when something works, you stick with it. And once  you start catching up to pitches you couldn't hit before, the pitchers will  change and you'll have to go through the whole routine all over again.  </P> <P> "Why do you think Wally Joyner hit 34 home runs one year and 13 the next? Can  you say Wally is no longer a home-run hitter? With that swing and the power and  the contact he makes?  </P> <P> "Eventually, you hope to find an approach that will enable you to hit the pitch  inside and the pitch out over the plate and hit the fastball and the curveball.  But you've got to find it for you. Nobody's going to find it for you."  </P> <P> Davis, who believes he will have a banner year if he can raise his average as a  right-handed hitter to .270 (he hit .245 from that side in '89), did seek some  help during the off-season, however. He spent some time with former Angel Rod  Carew, refining his approach against left-handed pitchers.  </P> <P> "We adjusted a few things," Davis said. "I have to take charge of home plate  this year and be more aggressive. I'm not the kind of hitter who'll go up there  and pick a pitch. If I see something close enough to hit, I'm going to swing at  it."  </P> <P> But Davis also knows that you could sell your soul to the devil for Ted  Williams' swing and it wouldn't do you any good without the right mental  approach.  </P> <P> "When you're confident, you know you're going to get a hit and when you get a  ball to drive, you don't ever miss it," he said. "But as soon as you start  wondering when it's going to end, that's when you lose it.  </P> <P> "A lot of guys start out having great years, but they don't really believe it.  When you're swinging the bat that well, you've got to remember it is you doing  it. It's not a dream."  </P> <P> A large portion of hot Chili could be the key to a dream season for the Angels,  and if Port can work a trade for another run-producer to bolster the lineup,  Davis may see more pitches to his liking in 1990.  </P> <P> "I've always been an aggressive swinger, but over the years I've learned which  pitches I can hit hard and which pitches I can't," he said. "Pitches that I can  hit hard, I really go after. The ones I can't, I just try to place and take  whatever they're giving."  </P> <P> It he takes enough of what they're giving, he might get what's coming to him: a  little respect.  </P> <P> CHILI

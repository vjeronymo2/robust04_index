			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] Karadzic's terrorists continued attacks on the  Bihac district in the last 24 hours. The defenders on the Bihac  section of the front, the Grmusko-Srbljanski plateau, and the  Bosanska Krupa and Buzim areas are constantly being attacked  with anti-aircraft weapons and heavy machine guns. They shelled  indiscriminately the front lines of defense and civilian targets  with 82-mm and 120-mm mortars several times during the night.    Members of the Kladusa paramilitary army did not keep still  either. Their artillery in Golubovici was particularly active.  They shelled farmers working in the fields. They inflicted  substantial damage and killed a large number of cattle in the  villages around Todorovo and Varoska Rijeka.    They also carried out mortar and gun attacks and tried to  provoke infantry attacks on other lines of separation. The  increasing rift in Abdic's private army is illustrated by the  fact that they have recently been carrying out mobilizations in  Velika Kladusa, particularly for the police force. Out of 800  people invited to join the force, only two reported.</p>

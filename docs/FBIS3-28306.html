			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Akira Onishi, chairman, Soka University </F> Engineering Department]    [Text] How would Japan's economy actually be affected  if the Hosokawa administration were to embark on a decrease in  income taxes and an increase in the consumption tax? The author,  who specializes in using computers for evaluations of future  events, did a simulation.    Japan in a Global Context    Estimates concerning the future of Japan's economy are being  done using various techniques, but it is thought that the global  modeling which the author is researching is particularly  worthwhile.    Global modeling is not a specialized knowledge that relates  only to the specific field of economics, but has its greatest  distinction in the fact that it is a super interdisciplinary  field of study. For the purpose of taking countermeasures on and  solving global problems that human society is confronted with,  it is essential to supply information by future forecast  simulations using global modeling.    The FUGI (Futures of Global Interdependence) global model  introduced here classifies the world into 80 countries or  regions. It is a global model in which each country or regional  group model is mutually dependent on a global scale.    At present, the computer being used to calculate this model  is the IBM-RISC 6000 workstation and the software used is the  FGM/FUGI-GEMS, developed independently.    Using this model, the results of a forecast based on  reductions in income tax and increases in the consumption tax in  the Japanese economy from 1993 to 2000 have been shown in the  table.    In making this forecast, a standard forecast was first  performed. A standard forecast is one in which past data and  structural parameters of a model inferred from that data is  based on the assumption that there will not be drastic changes  in the future. Herein, the economic countermeasures executed up  to now by the Japanese Government have already been interwoven,  and gradual removal of nontariff barriers due to loosening of  import restrictions is also taken into consideration. Also, it  anticipates that oil prices which were $17.3 per barrel in 1992  will be $21 per barrel in 2000.

The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate is the actual calendar year  growth rate at 1985 constant prices. 2. Income tax cuts will start one year from now in  1994, and the current 3 percent consumption tax rate will be raised in 1995. 3. This  simulation is a policy scenario in which only tax rates are changed and the consumption  tax system remains the same.      Scenario A: 5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax  Reduction and an Increase in the Consumption Tax to 5  Percent    This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on  a policy scenario in which the government, grappling with  economic countermeasures and modifications of indirect tax  rates, decreases personal income taxes 5 trillion yen, aiming to  reduce the ratio of indirect tax starting in fiscal year 1994.  At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import  restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike  in consumption taxes, it raises the consumption tax from 3  percent to 5 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995.    According to this forecast simulation, the growth rate of  Japan's economy will increase 0.30 percentage points (rounded to  the nearest hundredth) in 1994 compared to the standard  forecast, but by raising the consumption tax 2 percent there  would be a 0.00 percentage point decline in 1995 and, further, a  0.20 percentage point decline in 1996. Beginning in 1997 until  2000 the growth rate would recover and an increase with respect  to the standard forecast of an increase of 0.07 percent to 0.01  percent could be expected. The rate of increase in consumer  prices would rise 1.10 percentage points in 1995 when the  consumption tax is implemented compared to the standard  forecast, and rise to between 1.8 percent and 2.9 percent, but  after that it will converge with the 2-percent growth track of  the standard forecast on into the year 2000.    In 1995, due to the 2-percent increase in the consumption  tax  rate, 4.8 trillion yen in increased revenue from the consumption  tax would be anticipated. Since the amount of expected revenue  increase in 1996 would be 5.1 trillion yen; in 1997, 5.4  trillion yen; 1998, 5.7 trillion yen; 1999, 6.1 trillion yen;  2000, 6.6 trillion yen, the amount of increased consumption tax  revenues would exceed the amount of reduction in income tax, and  in 1999 the national finance would achieve a sound condition.    Scenario B: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax  Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 6 Percent    This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on  a policy in which the government attempts to reduce the ratio of  indirect taxes by a reduction of the individual income tax of  7.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At the same  time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import restrictions to  prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike in consumption  taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3 percent to 6  percent beginning in fiscal year 1995.    According to this forecast simulation, although the growth  rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.45 percentage  points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent  increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01  percentage point decrease in 1995 and a 0.30 percentage point  decrease in 1996. It is expected that there would be increases  from 1997 until 2000 of 0.11 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.02  percent, and 0.01 percent. The consumer price rate would appear  to increase 1.58 percentage points in 1995 when the consumption  tax rate is hiked compared to the standard forecast, and would  increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4 percent, but later it  would converge with a growth course of the standard forecast of  about 2 percent.    It is expected that there would be increased revenue of 7.2  trillion yen from consumption taxes due to the hike in the  consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that the  increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen; in 1997,  8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999, 9.2  trillion yen; and in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen, the increased  revenue from the consumption tax would exceed the amount of  increased revenue from the income tax, so national finances  would be converted to a sound condition in 1998.    Scenario C: 10 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax  Reduction and a Consumption Tax Increase to 7 Percent    This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on  a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the  ratio of indirect taxes by performing a reduction in individual  income tax of 10 trillion yen beginning in fiscal year 1994. At  the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing import  restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to a hike  in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax from 3  percent to 7 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995.    According to this forecast simulation, although the growth  rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.61 percentage  points in 1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 4-percent  increase in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01  percent decrease in 1995 and a 0.40 percent decrease in 1996. It  is expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 2000  of 0.14 percent, 0.02 percent, 0.03 percent, and 0.02 percent.  The rate of increase in consumer prices would appear to increase  2.10 percent in 1995 when the consumption tax rate is hiked in  1995 compared to the standard forecast, and would increase to  between 1.8 percent to 3.9 percent, but later it would converge  with the growth track of the standard forecast of about 2  percent.    It is expected that there would be increased revenue from  consumption taxes of 9.7 trillion yen due to the 4-percent hike  in the consumption tax in 1995. Since it could be expected that  the amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 10.3 trillion  yen; in 1997, 10.9 trillion yen; in 1998, 11.6 trillion yen; in  1999, 12.3 trillion yen; and in 2000, 13.3 trillion yen, the  increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount  of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance  would achieve a sound condition.    Scenario D: 7.5 Trillion Yen Individual Income Tax  Reduction (5 Trillion Yen Cut in Individual Income Tax + 2.5  Trillion Yen Cut in Corporate Income Tax) and a Consumption Tax  Increase to 6 Percent    This forecast simulation of the Japanese economy is based on  a policy scenario in which the government attempts to reduce the  ratio of indirect taxes by implementing a reduction in  individual income tax of 5 trillion yen and a reduction in  corporate income tax of 2.5 trillion yen beginning in fiscal  year 1994. At the same time, utilizing the strong yen and easing  import restrictions to prevent a drop in economic growth due to  a hike in consumption taxes, it would raise the consumption tax  from 3 percent to 6 percent beginning in fiscal year 1995.    According to this forecast simulation, although the growth  rate of the Japanese economy will probably rise 0.46 percent in  1994 compared to the standard forecast, the 3-percent increase  in the consumption tax rate will likely lead to a 0.01 percent  decrease in 1995 and a 0.18 percent decrease in 1996. It is  expected that there would be increases from 1997 until 1999 of  0.15 percent, 0.02 percent, and 0.00 percent, but a 0.02 percent  decline in 2000. The rate of increase in consumer prices would  appear to increase 1.57 percentage points in 1995 when the  consumption tax rate is hiked in 1995 compared to the standard  forecast, and would increase to between 1.8 percent to 3.4  percent, but later it would converge with a growth course of the  standard forecast of about 2 percent.    It is expected that there would be increased revenue from  consumption taxes of 7.2 trillion yen due to the 3-percent hike  in the consumption tax in 1995. It could be expected that the  amount of increased revenue in 1996 would be 7.7 trillion yen;  in 1997, 8.1 trillion yen; in 1998, 8.7 trillion yen; in 1999,  9.3 trillion yen; in 2000, 9.9 trillion yen; therefore, the  increased revenue from consumption tax would exceed the amount  of reduction in income tax, and in 1999 the national finance  would achieve a sound condition.    When one compares scenario B and scenario D, even though  they  both have the same 7.5 trillion yen decrease in income tax, one  sees that scenario D's combination tax reduction of 5 trillion  yen in individual income tax and 2.5 trillion yen in corporate  income tax is preferable.    The Optimum Combination Zone for Policy    Numerous scenarios besides A, B, C, and D described above  have been tried, and as a consequence it has been found that  there exists an optimum zone among increases of the income tax  reduction amount and the consumption tax rate. For instance, in  scenario C if the consumption tax rate is increased from 7  percent to 8 or 10 percent, the economic growth rate drops,  rendering useless the effects of an economic countermeasure  consisting of a 10 trillion yen in income tax cuts. As an  economic countermeasure, it is most effective to make income tax  cuts as large as possible while keeping the consumption tax rate  low. However, for instance, in scenario A the consumption tax  rate is lowered from 5 percent to 4 percent, which would give  rise to a situation of collecting insufficient revenue.    Future simulations will be predicated on the current  consumption tax exemption mechanism and structure remaining  unchanged, so if this premise changes, the relationship between  income tax cuts and consumption tax rate increases will also  change. In particular, if they were to be based on the abolition  of the limited exemption system that excludes a set amount of  tax for businesses whose taxable sales amount to less than 50  million yen, the contraction of the applicable range for a  simplified taxation system, the abolition of tax exemption  measures for businesses whose taxable sales are 30 million yen  or less, among others, it could be expected that the same  consumption tax rate increase would yield further tax revenue.    In this simulation of economic countermeasures we tried to  keep the problem simple. We did not simulate taxation measures  to control the global environment, tax cut measures for research  and development (R&amp;D) in science and technology, or domestic  expansion measures via futuristic urban planning. Some of these  would include expansion of park space, improvement of high-speed  traffic and information and communication networks, construction  of super high-rise residential buildings to let people be closer  to their workplace due to easing of land and building  restrictions in the metropolitan centers, etc., as development  strategies for Japan's economy from a long-term range into the  21st century. Rather, I wanted to focus on pointing out the  importance of the problem.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Pension scheme gain helps Sherwood treble SHERWOOD Computer Services reported a 26 per cent gain in operating profits, from Pounds 974,000 to Pounds 1.23m, in the six months to June 30. However, a Pounds 522,000 exceptional credit from the reorganisation of the pension scheme, against a charge of Pounds 280,000 relating to difficulties in the Lloyd's insurance market, together with sharply lower interest charges of Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 119,000), enabled the group to more than treble pre-tax profit to Pounds 1.75m (Pounds 575,000). Turnover fell to Pounds 10.7m (Pounds 12.1m), mainly reflecting the transfer of the disaster recovery business into a joint venture with ICL in April 1991. The joint venture contributed Pounds 132,000 to operating profits. Fully diluted earnings per share grew to 16.7p (6.6p); the interim dividend is 1.75p (1.5p). Mr Richard Guy, chief executive, said the results reflected 'the high levels of new orders being achieved,' particularly in the Lloyd's insurance market for the Sceptre underwriting system. Among these the group announced a new order, worth more than Pounds 1m, from Lloyd Roberts &amp; Gilkes. The group also serves the retail financial service, local government and housing association markets with specialist systems. Mr Guy said all market sectors made a positive contribution to the results.</p>

			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABSENTEE OWNERS, NEGLECTED HOMES  </P> <P> A sad change is rapidly spreading throughout my hometown of Arcadia, a "City of  Homes."  </P> <P> I'm not referring to the ostentatious, overbuilt, $1 million-plus houses that  have been popping up here like giant, gaudy mushrooms, but to the increasing  number of vacant, uncared-for homes that have evidently been bought for  speculation by absentee owners.  </P> <P> Some of these are obviously cared for: plants watered, lawns mowed and papers  picked up. Many others are left to decay, month after month, while papers pile  up, lawns and even trees die, and waist-high weeds take over otherwise withered  yards. These eyesores can be found on street after street, looking worse and  worse as the months pass and the weeds grow.  </P> <P> Is our city alone with this blight? Why aren't these absentee owners made to  tidy up . . . and keep up?  </P> <P> Seems we've gone from being a gracious "City of Homes" to a growing "Ghetto of  Vacant Houses."  </P> <P> SHARON SAYEGH  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani, Presidential  Council member and chairman of the Higher Committee for  Receiving Donations, has attended a meeting at the Chamber of  Industry and Commerce in Sanaa. The meeting was attended by  members of the committee and a host of major businessmen and  heads of public, mixed and private commercial and industrial  institutions. The meeting was aimed at discussing the issue of  supporting the war effort and organizing the process of  receiving donations and public support for the effort to defend  unity and constitutional legitimacy and to ease the damages  resulting from the battles being waged by the forces defending  constitutional legitimacy, unity, and democracy.    Speaking at the meeting, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani  explained that the battle being waged by the Armed Forces--the  forces defending legitimacy and unity against the forces that  are misled by the gang of apostasy and secession under war  criminal 'Ali Salim al-Bid--is a battle that emphasizes  adherence to Yemeni unity and rejection of partition. [passage  omitted]    Addressing attendees, Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani said:  This meeting is the first step toward public participation and  beginning of supporting the war effort. He added: Today, you  will set a good example for the people, who know how able you  are. If they see that you have made substantial donations, they  will undoubtedly follow your example and offer whatever they can.    Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid al-Zandani stressed that the committee  is determined to reach every Yemeni in every governorate,  district, subdistrict, and village to tell them: The door for  donations is open. Donate whatever you can for the unity of  your country. Al-Zandani indicated that the committee will  control methods for disbursing collected donations. It will  also work to spend donations appropriately. Civilian and  military war casualties will be supported. Families of martyrs  will be helped. Those who suffered losses will be compensated  so as to stress the principle of joint liability. He indicated  that there will be women's committees to collect donations from  women. [passage omitted]    The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that the  donations  declared at the meeting amounted to 63.325 million riyals.  [passage omitted]</p>

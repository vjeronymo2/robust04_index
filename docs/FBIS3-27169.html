			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 21 Feb (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of  the National People's Congress [NPC] Standing Committee, met  with Sakhat Nepesovich Muradov, chairman of the Turkmen Grand  National Assembly, and his delegation at the Great Hall of the  People this afternoon.    Muradov and his delegation arrived in Beijing on 20 February  for a six-day visit to China at the invitation of the NPC  Standing Committee. This is the first Turkmen parliamentary  delegation to visit China since Turkmenistan became independent.    Qiao Shi extended his warm welcome to the delegation. He  said: China and Turkmenistan are near neighbors. China hopes to  establish good-neighborly and friendly relations with  Turkmenistan on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence, and to increase friendly relations and cooperation  in various fields -- political, economic, scientific and  technological, cultural, and educational. He expressed his  belief that the delegation's visit would enhance friendship and  understanding between the two peoples.    Qiao Shi said: China has undergone tremendous changes during  the past 15 years of reform and opening up. Its cooperation  with other countries also has increased significantly, achieving  world-renowned results in introducing foreign funds and  technology. In briefing the guests on China's people's congress  system, he said: China's NPC has played an important role in  promoting the country's democracy and legal system.    Qiao Shi said: China has to draw on foreign experience,  whether in developing democratic politics or the economy. It  cannot, however, indiscriminately copy foreign models and must  proceed according to its own national conditions.    Muradov said: Turkmenistan attaches importance to developing  relations with China and is closely following China's economic  development. This is because China's experience can serve as a  reference for Turkmenistan's economic development.    During the meeting, the two sides expressed hopes for  further  strengthening exchanges between the two parliaments in the  future.    Other than Beijing, the delegation also will tour Tianjin  and  other areas. Tomur Dawamat, vice chairman of the NPC Standing  Committee, and others were present at the meeting.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Loyalists step up their fightback TORY loyalists and Euro-enthusiasts intensified their fightback against the Euro-sceptics yesterday as they sensed that the tide of opinion at Westminster was turning their way. The campaign gained momentum, both behind the scenes and in front of the cameras, as loyalists insisted that colleagues who had been prepared to vote against the government were being won over by the argument that to do so would reduce Mr John Major's chances of securing a successful outcome to the Edinburgh summit in December. As part of the rallying behind the government, 32 Tory MPs have put their signatures to a letter in today's Times newspaper. It expresses fierce opposition to the anti-Maastricht stance of some of their colleagues who represent only 10 per cent of the party they say, but whose stance is 'undermining the position and policy of the Government and the standing of the Prime Minister. This plays directly into the hands of the Opposition and does Great Britain considerable damage'. Further loyalist letters are being prepared for publication, and parliamentary motions in support of Maastricht are likely to be tabled. Ministers themselves have intensified their efforts to persuade. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, yesterday saw three groups of 'soft Euro-phobe' MPs, to bring them round behind the government, and to encourage them to be more vocal in highlighting the benefits of the agreement. Leading loyalists have now begun queueing up to enter the broadcasting studios and contest the assertions of the Euro-sceptics. Sir Michael Grylls, the chairman of the Tory backbench trade and industry committee, said that the prime minister's stance on Maastricht 'has been vindicated by the Danish decision to press towards ratification. It fulfils John Major's pledge in July to bring the Bill back to the Commons when the Danes had clarified their intentions. 'No one, from whatever party, can now argue that there is any reason for further indefinite postponement.' He went on to emphasise the importance of the single market for the prospects of British economic recovery, a line reinforced by Sir Michael Angus, president of the CBI. He warned a meeting of Tory backbenchers that failure to ratify the treaty could cost inward investment and jobs.</p>

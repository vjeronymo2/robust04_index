			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: JCI climbs 12% as gold production hits high Record gold output and better gold prices gave combined after-tax income from the gold mines in the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group a 12 per cent boost to R114.6m (Dollars 33.5m) in the December quarter. The mines turned in R102.8m in the previous three months and R62.6m in the December quarter of 1992. Group gold production reached its highest level since 1978 at 13,373kg against 13,229kg in the September quarter, with the average gold price secured climbing to R39,066 a kg from R37,744 a kg. Mr Kennedy Maxwell, chairman of JCI's gold division, said the mines' success in keeping average working costs almost unchanged at R28,700 a kg during 1993 was a 'very satisfactory' achievement in a climate of near double-digit inflation. Western Areas achieved an increase in grade for the sixth quarter in a row which at 7.34 grammes a tonne was the highest recorded since 1972 and likely to be maintained in the current quarter. After-tax profit jumped 20 per cent to R50.2m from R41.8m although capital spending rose as the mine upgraded its electrical supply and pumping facilities. Mr Maxwell said despite progress in talks about merging Western Areas with the neighbouring South Deep mine, in the early stages of development from Western Areas workings, a rights issue to finance full-scale development of the multi-million rand project was a long way off. A good quarter at Randfontein Estates, which turned in after-tax profit of R65m against R57.2m, contrasted with a disappointing performance from the Joel mine. Joel suffered a R637,000 after-tax loss, against after-tax income of R3.81m, before capital spending of R8.03m.</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / US plans new move on Haiti The US is planning to shift its policy on Haiti so as to put more pressure on the military leaders who took over the Caribbean country two and a half years ago, according to a report in the New York Times, George Graham writes from Washington. The report said Vice-President Al Gore had briefed Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted Haitian president, on a new plan calling for three steps on the same day: the military leaders would step down, the Haitian parliament would confirm a new prime minister named by Fr Aristide, and an amnesty for the coup leaders would be enacted. The US administration's policy on Haiti has come in for stern criticism in the last few weeks from Democratic members of the US Congress, there having been a particularly fierce attack last week from the black caucus in Congress.</p>

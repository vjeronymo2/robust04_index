			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] Beginning today, bank secrecy will be rescinded in  cases involving officials under investigation by the Attorney  General's Office. An agreement signed by the Banking  Association and the Attorney General's Office is designed to cut  investigation time by more than half.    This agreement will allow authorities to expose current and  former corrupt officials who grew rich illegally by taking  advantage of their positions. Until now, the release of banking  information on customer transactions was banned.    [Begin Attorney General Carlos Gustavo Arrieta recording] By  way of this agreement, they will not only provide us with  information in a timely manner, but they also will participate  in its analysis to help us understand the flow of assets  [evolucion patrimonial] and the origins of an individual's  resources. [end recording]    From now on, every bank, savings institution, and other  financial institution must, as soon as possible, provide all  information the Attorney General's Office needs to uncover  illegal enrichment. Meanwhile, the financial institutions think  this measure is nothing new and that the document is merely a  commitment to expedite procedures already in place.    [Begin Banking Association President Cesar Gonzalez Munoz  recording] I must stress that this is nothing new. Bank secrecy  is not being lifted, because this was done years ago in cases  involving investigations by the Attorney General's Office. [end  recording]    In 1993 and so far in 1994, the Attorney General's Office  has  conducted more than 72 investigations into illegal enrichment  cases involving some 5 billion pesos. The subjects of these  inquiries are officials working in customs, mayoral and  gubernatorial offices, aeronautics, police services, and the  Army.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second of two-part unattributed report: "Jerusalem Is the </F> Capital of Palestine" -- numbers of all articles as published]    [Text] Yitzhaq Rabin has opted to take an ironic stance  toward Yasir 'Arafat's recent statements regarding the holy war  and the possibility that the Palestinians could infringe the  Cairo agreement. The Israeli prime minister called the PLO  leader a "big talker." For his part, the Israeli minister of  police announced that 'Arafat would not be authorized to go to  Jerusalem during his visit to Gaza and Jericho from 12 to 14  June. The fundamentalist group Hamas said that it was rejecting  'Arafat's offer to participate in the Palestinian National  Authority, of which 19 out of 24 members have recently been  appointed. Lastly, the Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for  yesterday's attack in Rafah which killed two Israeli soldiers  and wounded one. The Jihad said it wanted to punish the Israeli  army, which captured Shi'ite leader Mustapha Dirani on Saturday  [21 May] in Lebanon.    Today we will finish publishing the extracts of the  preliminary draft of the Constitution of Palestine that Yasir  'Arafat recently submitted to lawyer Jean-Marc Varaut. This  document, which aims to define what will be the basic law of  Gaza and Jericho during the transitional period agreed with the  government in Jerusalem, will soon be submitted to the  Palestinian National Council. As we said in our edition of 26  May, this text is still subject to amendment, especially since  the Israelis have a veto right.  <H8>  Sovereignty of the Law </H8> <H5>  Article 36 </H5>   The sovereignty of the law shall be the foundation of any  political system in Palestine.  <H5>  Article 37 </H5>   All Palestinian authorities and institutions, as well as  individuals, shall be duty-bound to respect the law.

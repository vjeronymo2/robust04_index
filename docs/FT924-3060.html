			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Pace of upturn worries Clinton PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton yesterday expressed doubts about the strength of the US recovery and said he would press ahead with the economic programme he outlined during the presidential campaign. 'There is no evidence that we are really coming out of this in a traditional sense,' he said, holding up a chart showing that jobs and output had grown more slowly in this recovery than in previous economic upturns. Speaking on Capitol Hill, he indicated he had not yet decided whether a fiscal stimulus would be needed next year. He said he intended to focus on measures to strengthen the economy's long-term performance. 'I based my whole campaign on my absolute conviction that the fundamental economic problems of this country are long-term problems that have been 20 years in the making.' The issue of whether to provide a short-term stimulus was of minor importance compared with long-run challenges, which included controlling health care costs, reducing budget deficits and improving education and training. Mr Clinton was responding to speculation in financial markets and in Washington that signs of faster growth had made campaign promises to revitalise the economy redundant. He said everything he had advocated as a short-term stimulus for the economy was consistent with what was needed in the longer run. He hinted there would be little, if any, net stimulus in terms of a larger deficit. 'If you go back to my plan, I paid for everything in the first year. I believe there's a difference between consumption and investment. So I always thought I was stimulating the economy by changing the nature of spending from consumption to investment, because I think that creates a lot more jobs.'</p>

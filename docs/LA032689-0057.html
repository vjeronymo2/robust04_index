			<p><P> March 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. DEUKMEJIAN ON STATE BUDGET AND TIMES RESPONSE  </P> <P> I read Deukmejian's letter with great interest. I'm wondering why our governor,  who's generally a nice, compassionate and understanding guy is so cruel and  tight-fisted with our money, which really belongs to the people?  </P> <P> Well, I believe that the answer lies in the recent political history. President  Ronald Reagan cut taxes, decreased spending on social services, and all this  has influenced many conservative politicians. Never mind that United States  deficit has increased to horrible proportions, never mind the homeless, the  mentally ill, the toxic dumps, the worn-out cities, the drugs, the street gangs  and crime. Those politicians don't see that. They are hypnotized by the words  of the Great Communicator, even though now we have different times, different  problems.  </P> <P> And that's the case with our governor. He's hypnotized. How will he get out of  this state of hypnosis? I respectfully suggest that he take walks around Los  Angeles slums, drive our freeways during rush hour, visit emergency services of  county hospitals, visit our overcrowded schools and, perhaps, even visit our  state hospitals and jails. He will learn something. At least, he will slip out  of his state of blindness and rejection of facts.  </P> <P> ADOLPH DONINS  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

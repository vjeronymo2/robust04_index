			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Amersham speeds up US acquisition Amersham International, the UK health science group, announced yesterday it was speeding up its acquisition of United States Biochemical, the privately-owned supplier of pharmaceutical and biotechnology reagents. Last March Amersham paid Dollars 52m (Pounds 35m) for the Cleveland-based company and agreed to pay a further Dollars 17.25m over three years, depending on sales of USB products. Since then the UK group has realised that it could make considerable cost savings by integrating USB's North American business with its own life science operations. Mr Kirk Stephenson, finance director, said yesterday: 'We have decided to streamline our North American operations. The tidying up can be done now rather than later.' Amersham staff in Chicago will oversee a combined sales, orders and distribution department for the two companies, while USB's existing manufacturing and research workforce are to remain with the subsidiary. Rather than pay Dollars 17.25m over three years, the company said it would satisfy the deferred instalments with an immediate Dollars 10m fixed payment. The transaction involves a Dollars 5.72m cash payment and the issue of 286,557 Amersham ordinary shares to USB's owners. As part of the deal, which will be completed tomorrow, the owners of USB have agreed to retain their Amersham shares until April 1996.</p>

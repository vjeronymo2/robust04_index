			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Markets: Upbeat news for Reuters - The Bottom Line Reuters Holdings, the international financial information and news group, is one of the small group of UK-based companies that is indisputably world class. The leap in the group's share price to a new high this week reflected not just the market's welcome of a 4-for-1 share spilt and strong annual results. It also demonstrated relief that doubts over growth prospects had been allayed by the group's bullish revenue forecast and upbeat view of its prospects for developing new products. Although best known to the public as an international news agency, 90 per cent of Reuters' revenue comes from financial information and transaction products. The group's dominant position in the dealing rooms of the world's financial centres has made it the UK's biggest media group, with a market capitalisation in excess of Pounds 8.5bn. Reuters enjoyed rapid growth in the 1980s but its share price fell sharply in 1990, when the onset of recession caused banks and brokers to retrench. Shares have more than trebled since, and this week the group said it was confident that it would enjoy double-digit revenue growth this year, even although it would hold prices for the third year running. Investors have also been encouraged by the aggressiveness with which Reuters has hit the acquisition trail, buying both to strengthen its core financial expertise and also to test the waters in other areas. Last month's agreement to buy Quotron, the US data services business, from Citicorp gave Reuters a 20 per cent share of the North American equity market - fulfilling a long-held strategic aim of the group. Last year's Pounds 350m repurchase scheme at Pounds 14 per share was welcomed by shareholders, but some were concerned that it betrayed a lack of expansionary opportunities. A flurry of smaller acquisitions has shown that the group is determined to benefit from the next generation of so-called multimedia products, which combine computer data, images and text. This year Reuters will launch a television service for the foreign exchange market, with live pictures being delivered digitally to the screens of traders alongside existing currency data. In spite of handing back Pounds 350m to shareholders last year through the buy-back, Reuters still ended last year with net cash of Pounds 450m. It is this combination of good market position, advanced products and strong cash generation that makes Reuters look one of the best British bets to prosper in a multimedia world, if that is indeed where we are heading. Such qualities do not come cheaply and Reuters shares are currently trading on a multiple of 24 times prospective earnings. Yet, as the chart shows, the group's shares have for most of the last year underperformed both the FT All-Share index as a whole and the media sector. Reuters cannot look forward to the cyclical bounce in demand that many smaller companies hope for, and the media sector has been driven by both the hopes of a quick recovery in advertising volumes and hype over the relaxation in television ownership rules. It is also true that the group faces continuing pressure on prices and fierce competition from other groups, such as Telerate and Bloomberg, which have targeted its blue-chip customer base and high margins. However, Reuters continues to roll out new products with impressive regularity. Dealing 2000-2, its automated foreign exchange dealing system, continues to grow steadily and the Equity Focus information service has won a considerable share of the London market. Globex, its automated futures trading product, is being held up by disagreements with the Chicago exchanges, but the Instinet equity trading system is showing strong growth in both volumes and profits. Reuters' shares may be due for a period of consolidation. They attract a strong US following and can be volatile when markets are unstable, so buying at this price is not for the faint-hearted. But the group will continue to attract long-term investors. In what looks like an over-hyped sector, Reuters' qualities stand out.</p>

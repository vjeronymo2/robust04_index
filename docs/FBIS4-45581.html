			<p>BFN     [Text] Peshawar -- After a break of three weeks, local  people have again started holding protest demonstrations in the  Tirah area of Khyber Agency. The demonstrations are being held  against the presence of militia forces which have been stationed  in the area for the last two years. A large protest rally was  held yesterday with hundreds of tribals holding black flags and  chanting slogans against the government and the administration.  The demonstrators say that the presence of the militia has  affected their lives and, therefore, they should leave the area.  The demonstrators warned that the situation might become worse  if the militia is not called off from the area within two  months. The demonstrators claimed that the government promised  to give them attractive incentives for alternative crops to  poppy cultivation. But it has failed to fulfill that promise so  far they claimed and threatened to resume poppy cultivation on a  large-scale if incentives are not offered by September 1994.</p>

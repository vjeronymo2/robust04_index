			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / International Press Review: Politician's pet spills the beans - Japan Mainstream political journalism in Japan has come under fire over its close relationship with politicians. The debate has been fanned by a recent article by Mr Shiro Tazaki, a political reporter with the Jiji Press news wire service, and based on off-the-record conversations with Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the backroom strategist of Japanese politics. Japanese journalists have excellent access to the inside stories and political machinations behind the news. However, very little of this finds its way into print due to reporters' overriding interest in maintaining a favourable relationship with the news source. Mr Tazaki's account, which appeared in last month's Bungei Shunju, a highly regarded cultural and business monthly, reveals an affiliation which went too far. Mr Tazaki disclosed that on the eve of Mr Toshiki Kaifu's appointment as prime minister, Mr Ozawa asked him to 'take his reporter's badge off' and help mastermind a question and answer manual for a press conference given by Mr Kaifu. Mr Tazaki, nicknamed 'Ozawa's bodyguard' by colleagues until he was unexpectedly ousted from Mr Ozawa's clique two years ago, goes on to say that if the relationship had remained on favourable footing, he would have spent the summer in Mr Ozawa's country retreat playing golf during the day and discussing politics over dinner. For the ordinary reader, the expose has entertaining passages containing Mr Ozawa's comments on his fellow politicians revealed to Mr Tazaki in private. The piece illustrates Mr Ozawa's Machiavellian qualities. It quotes Mr Ozawa denouncing Mr Kaifu, a former prime minister, as intellectually inferior to his predecessor Mr Sosuke Uno. Mr Noboru Takeshita, Mr Ozawa's former mentor of the Liberal Democratic Party and now arch rival, is referred to in less than flattering terms. Most mainstream Japanese journalists know Mr Tazaki is not alone in developing an intimate relationship with politicians. In an industry where a journalist's ability is judged on how far he or she can follow a politician into his living room or bedroom, Mr Tazaki was considered an ace reporter. Now fellow journalists have been angered by his revelations, and many question the ethics of breaking an off-the-record agreement with a news source. The high-minded dailies have not even covered the issue. But their initial response, initiated by the Shukan Gendai, a weekly magazine read by office workers, was to complain that politicians would not talk freely to the press as a result. Ethics were brushed aside by the down market Focus magazine, which offers readers a range of political, show business and sports gossip. It applauded the piece as 'unveiling an influential politician's real thoughts'. The pictorial weekly also poked fun at the panic among politicians caused by the article, quoting an MP who sympathised that 'Mr Ozawa must feel like he's been bitten by his pet dog'. Yet many Japanese journalists recognise such unhealthy proximity between reporters and their sources as a weakness preventing the press from taking on the role of critic. They fear that the lack of analytical skills among reporters could eventually lead to a complete loss of what remains of their credibility. In Diamond, a business weekly, Ms Yoshiko Sakurai, a column writer, approves of Mr Tazaki's attempt to reveal Mr Ozawa's 'real personality' to the public. However, she questions why the public were not acquainted with politicians' true characteristics in the first place. Was it because reporters like Mr Tazaki had suppressed their role as journalists and resorted to work for politicians, she asked. In this month's Bungei Shunju, Mr Yasuhiro Tase, a senior reporter at Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading business daily, and Mr Takashi Tachibana, a freelance journalist who uncovered politicians' links to the Lockheed bribery scandal in the 1970s, also questioned the future of Japanese journalism. Mr Tachibana points out the involvement of journalists in politics is not only behind the scenes. Media executives are often on government advisory committees and lose their objectivity towards controversial issues, he says. The two reporters agree that breaking a rule is undesirable, but claim that reporters should not let the relationship with a news source overcome the need to report an important matter. 'Whenever there is a conflict between a journalist and a politician, the Japanese media seems to side with politics,' says Mr Tase, an author of a controversial book on Japan's political journalism. They cite the need for more journalists who do not take the current system of political reporting for granted. 'If more reporters refuse to take their notes to their graves, the relationship between politicians and journalists could become more mature,' says Mr Tachibana.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK Company News: No change of control for Mt Charlotte BRIERLEY Investments, the New Zealand investment group, confirmed yesterday that it had no plans to sell its majority stake in Mount Charlotte Investments, the UK's second largest hotel group with properties ranging from the Royal Horseguards hotel to the Selfridge hotel, writes David Churchill. Mr Jeremy Kemsley-Pein, a director of BIL in London, said yesterday that BIL was 'absolutely committed' to ownership of Mount Charlotte. He acknowledged, however, that BIL might sell further shares in the hotel chain while retaining a 51 per cent majority stake. 'We have had a number of approaches from investors in Mount Charlotte and it is something we are looking at,' he said. Mr Kemsley-Pein's confirmation of BIL's continuing control of Mount Charlotte follows Monday's sale of 30 per cent of its stake in the hotel group to the overseas investment arm of the Singapore government for Pounds 227.5m. The deal had been on the cards for some time, partly to reduce BIL's debt levels, but also because BIL did not want to retain 100 per cent control of the hotel group. After holding a stake of just under 30 per cent in Mount Charlotte for some years, it was forced to launch a full-scale bid last September when it acquired a 10 per cent block of Mount Charlotte shares for 73p per share from the Kuwaiti Investment Office. The success of BIL's opportunistic bid surprised the City, but some institutional investors evidently had decided that the recession and worsening Gulf Crisis meant they should pull out of hotel stocks. The acquisition price of 73p a share was considerably less than the 85p a share deal struck with the Singapore government. City analysts last night suggested that the share price premium reflected a major coup for BIL as it came after the worst trading period for hotels. Speculation now centred on what deal BIL might do next. 'There is nothing in the pipeline at the moment,' said Mr Kemsley-Pein. 'But we are constantly looking for opportunities.' He confirmed that these opportunities might come from Australia. Mr Robert Peel, chief executive of Mount Charlotte, said yesterday that the share sale had been anticipated and was a welcome move. 'It means that there will be a secure base for our further development over the next few years,' he said. But Mr Peel acknowledged that the sale had come after 'some very tough trading in the past few months' and a slow recovery in tourists and business travellers. Mount Charlotte has been particularly hit by the downturn in travel to London, since it is the largest hotel chain in the capital. In Singapore yesterday the deal was seen as a long-term strategic move. Mr Ng Kok-Song, deputy managing director of the Singapore Government Investment Corporation (GIC), described Mount Charlotte as a well-managed company with a portfolio of well-located hotels in London. This was seen as a growth tourist and commercial destination, he added.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / France offers talks with UK on nuclear weapons FRANCE is ready to start talks with Britain on 'a European deterrence doctrine' covering the future wider role of nuclear weapons held by the two states, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said yesterday. This is the most explicit statement of the new shift in French strategy, first hinted at by President Francois Mitterrand in January and repeated this week by Mr Pierre Joxe, the defence minister. Paris appears to have abandoned the Gaullist-era rationale that French atomic arms were for the defence of France alone. It has conceded its European neighbours might have a legitimate interest in how France develops its nuclear weapons strategy, and even appears to be quietly vaunting an eventual nuclear dimension to a common European defence policy, as foreshadowed in the Maastricht treaty. Winding up a three-day European defence seminar, Mr Beregovoy said discussions between France and the UK would be 'a useful first step'. But he cautioned that development of anything as sensitive as a new nuclear doctrine would take even longer than those under way on the planned 'Euro-corps' of French and German troops. The French government does not appear to have in mind any joint control, operation or targeting of French and UK nuclear weaponry. But one aim might be the creation of a nuclear consultative group in the Western European Union (WEU) to discuss the general role of European-held nuclear weapons, their relationship to conventional defence and their use in a crisis. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the UK defence secretary, told the same Paris seminar on Wednesday that he welcomed the idea of discussions on a European nuclear doctrine. But he did not see as much scope for a European 'division of labour' with the US on nuclear policy as in conventional defence. It was not realistic to think that 'there could be a major conflict in Europe in which the question of nuclear use arose which did not involve the vital interests of all the allies, including the US', he cautioned. However, he believed there should be 'more explicit emphasis on the progressive merging of interests between the Western European nuclear powers and their non-nuclear partners and allies'.</p>

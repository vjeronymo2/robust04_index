			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Ewald Stein: "The Security of Europe Is </F> Indivisible"]    [Text] One can argue whether or not Russia's final entry  into a partnership agreement with NATO deserves to be described  as "historic," as U.S. Secretary of State Christopher described  it.    But there is no doubt that both within NATO and in Moscow it  has finally been recognized that there can be no lasting  guarantees for European security unless all the parties  responsible cooperate closely in implementing it.    Against this background, it does not matter what kinds of  words and sentences have been used to set this partnership down  on paper. What counts is a common desire, and this desire cannot  be blotted out by political vanity on both sides. To this  extent, the Partnership for Peace and the additional dialogue  agreed upon with Moscow, which also calls for a mutual exchange  of information on planned security-political decisions, must  naturally be orchestrated as a whole.    Now it is necessary to explain this to certain East European  countries which, for obvious reasons, have been skeptical and to  some extent are still skeptical about having Moscow as a  partner. Under no circumstances must these countries receive the  impression that their membership in NATO is less important than  Russia's. It is necessary in this regard to resolve all the  present misunderstandings, for which NATO itself is not quite  free of blame. At a early stage in the development of the  Partnership for Peace concept, NATO should have explained more  clearly to the East European countries that neither the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council nor the Partnership for Peace can  be viewed as a signpost pointing to the east. The point is not  to create various different security zones in Europe, but a  single one.    The fact that the specific interests of a major power must  be  considered in these agreements is a question of political  reality. As a superpower, the United States has always played a  special part in NATO, and NATO was able to live with that for  better or for worse. Therefore, a similar part has to be  offered to Russia, which is still by far the largest country in  Europe. The fact that all Europeans can live with that was  confirmed by Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev at the signing of  the agreement in Brussels. The Russian foreign and security  policies will now have to measure themselves against this gauge.    It may sound naive to say this, but it is the great powers  that have the final say on decisive matters. One can only  undertake activity with them, not against them. The fact that  the U.S. chief of diplomacy was the only NATO foreign minister  to watch Kozyrev sign the agreement is a fact that speaks for  itself.    This special role of the great powers also in the  Partnership  for Peace program will receive a positive confirmation if one  looks beyond the narrow confines of Europe and is willing to  assume extra responsibility. A political and military consensus  regarding peaceforming or peacekeeping missions, or on the  subject of such hot topics as North Korea, would be very helpful  for the whole of society. The Partnership for Peace offers an  opportunity for this.</p>

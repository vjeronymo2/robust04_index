			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> A Dry Run: An avant-garde theater company was ordered to stop performing "The  Cardinal Detoxes" or face eviction by the landlord: the Roman Catholic  Archdiocese of New York. The play by Thomas M. Disch, drama critic of The  Nation, is a 35-minute monologue about an archbishop who has been placed in a  church-run detoxification center because he has killed a pregnant woman in an  auto accident while driving drunk.  </P> <P> According to the church, the RAPP Theater Co. agreed in its lease not to  present such works in the building, a former parochial school. But R. Jeffrey  Cohen, the theater company's founder and artistic director, called the  archdiocese's threat an attempt at censorship and promised to fight it in  court. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

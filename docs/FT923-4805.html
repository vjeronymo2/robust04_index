			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Letter: The twenty pence that divides Inland Revenue from real world Sir, I have received a carefully crafted 'Computation of interest and notice to pay' from the Inland Revenue explaining why I owed it 20 pence - yes 20 - on tax overdue for the period July 1 to July 3 1992. Now, I appreciate the tax man has got me bang to rights and I have no option but to pay up, but doesn't the Revenue work for the same government that has consistently refused to introduce legislation to allow traders a statutory right to levy interest on the monies they are owed? In the commercial world we can count ourselves lucky to be paid within 60 days. As for charging interest on late payments, forget it - the only way many businesses can ensure prompt payment is to offer their customers a discount on the price. All of which prompts me to ask: do the government and the Inland Revenue live on the same planet as the rest of us? Charles Christian, Ferndale House, North Lopham, Diss, Norfolk 1P22 2NQ</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Private funding for NHS is boosted THE FINANCIAL freedom of hospitals and health authorities to use private finance is to be considerably widened, Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said yesterday. NHS trusts and health authorities now need Treasury approval for all contracts involving private finance in excess of Pounds 250,000. At a seminar yesterday organised by the Social Market Foundation, an independent think tank, Mr Sackville announced a 'very substantial increase in delegation' by lifting the limit from Pounds 250,000 to Pounds 10m. 'Up to now, our delegated limits have been so low that almost all private finance schemes had to come to Whitehall,' he said. The Pounds 250,000 was so low that it had 'quite simply put people off' seeking collaborative projects between the public and private sectors. Some potential schemes had foundered because of the real and psychological barriers of having to obtain approval. Mr Sackville's announcement adds substance to a policy that has been developing in the Department of Health since the Autumn Statement, when the chancellor outlined proposals to ease the use of private finance in the public sector. There are some long-standing examples of private-sector investment in NHS hospitals, from the shared use of expensive technology to privately managed shopping malls. Before last year's general election ministers were anxious to avoid extending a policy that might inflame opposition allegations that they intended to privatise the NHS. Similar charges were renewed yesterday, with Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accusing the government of trying to 'fudge the difference between private and public health care'. Ms Liz Lynne, for the Liberal Democrats, described the proposals as the 'slippery slope towards privatisation'. However, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is confident that the government has succeeded in demonstrating that its 1991 health reforms were not the first step to privatisation. She believes the public will regard appropriate private-sector investment as a sensible way of expanding the NHS's Pounds 2bn annual capital expenditure. Mrs Bottomley has a further incentive - public spending pressures are severely limiting the scope for extra public finance, and hers will be one of the first Whitehall departments scrutinised for savings under the government's forthcoming public-spending review. Ministers see scope for private-sector involvement in a wide range of NHS activities including waste incineration, energy conservation and the provision of hospital accommodation used by both public and private patients. Some private-sector managers would like the government to go further, and take account of private hospitals in overall health planning. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

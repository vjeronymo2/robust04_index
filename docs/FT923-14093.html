			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Winterton anger at committee move A FIERCE row over government interference in MPs' rights to scrutinise its activities exploded last night after the controversial Conservative chairman of the health select committee claimed Tory whips had blocked his re-appointment. Mr Nicholas Winterton, the Macclesfield MP who has often criticised the government, said the move was 'blatant interference' by business managers in the supposedly neutral work of the selection committee which names each body's members. Despite Mr John Major's pledge to open government, he said, 'the politics of dissent' were being crushed by the imposition of 'obedience, obedience, obedience.' Mr Frank Field, the Labour MP restored to the social services committee in 1987 after Mr Winterton interceded for him in similar circumstances, is now to return the favour. He will table an amendment to the committee selections, substituting Mr Winterton for another Tory MP. However, neither man was confident last night that the amendment would be carried after a clearly intentional demonstration by government business managers of their muscle. Labour is expected to take the chairmanship of six committees, including the social security committee, which is poised to revive its investigation into the Maxwell affair. Mr John Watts, Conservative MP for Slough, was last night emerging as favourite to become chairman of the Treasury select committee, replacing Mr Terence Higgins. However, Tory MPs on the trade and industry committee are threatening to rebel against the Conservative whips' decision to give the chairmanship to Labour - probably either Mr Doug Hoyle, MP for Warrington North, or Stan Orme, MP for Salford East. A possible Tory candidate would be Sir Anthony Grant, MP for Cambridgeshire South West. The selection committee's decisions, based on the nominations of party whips, will be announced today and debated on Monday.</p>

Practically every day brings new instances of Russian border  posts and detachments being fired upon and attempted armed  breakthroughs from the Afghan to the Tajik side of the river.  In January and February Russian troop stationing locations came  under rocket fire more than 60 times.    "This is a protracted guerrilla war," the military are  saying.    The Tajik authorities insist, on the contrary, that the  civil  war in the republic is now over. After yet another border  skirmish, the republic's Foreign Ministry is sending Kabul a  protest note. Kabul rejects Dushanbe's protests, dismissing as  groundless all accusations that "subversive activity against  Tajikistan is being initiated from Afghan territory."    Kabul is of the opinion that Tajikistan should resolve its  internal conflict independently, without enlisting any outside  military force, and through political dialogue with the Tajik  opposition. Kabul is uneasy about the Russian military presence  near its borders.    Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the  group  of Russian Border Guards in Tajikistan, has stated that if  border troops come under fire from Afghanistan, they are to  return fire with all weapons at their disposal.    This extreme measure is justified by the Afghan leadership's  powerlessness to control the situation in the border regions and  avert audacious strikes by the Islamic opposition and Afghan  mojahedin.    It is apparently implied that the targets are the  uncontrollable opposition groupings. But how are they to be  distinguished?    The gunmen do not stay in the same place; they prefer  guerrilla methods of warfare: They arrive in an Afghan village,  shell a border post, and go away again. Or small groups cross  the border and strike from the rear.    General Chechulin does not share the opinion that armed  confrontation between Russian servicemen and the government  subunits supporting them on the one hand, and the Islamic  opposition on the other, could lead to the outbreak of a new  war. The opposition is not strong enough for this, he believes.    However, there is no doubt that the development of events in  such a scenario will only lead to an escalation of hostilities.    Moscow faces a choice: Either condemn its small military  contingent in Tajikistan to further casualties, or increase its  military presence, which risks inevitable embroilment in another  war.    Moscow is therefore forcing a start to political dialogue  between the Tajik authorities and the Islamic opposition. To  this end Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian first deputy foreign  minister, has paid a lightning visit to Dushanbe.    It has taken Moscow just over a year of effort for a Russian  diplomat finally to be able to declare: The Tajik leadership  has displayed its goodwill and expressed its readiness to embark  on talks with the opposition.    This is apparently a reference to the most moderate section  of the representatives of the Islamic movement. It is planned  to hold talks under the auspices of the United Nations. These  talks could be held in Moscow. In which case the Russian side  would be prepared to undertake to resolve organizational  problems. If the talks break down, the blame, according to  Adamishin, would lie not with Russia or Tajikistan but with the  opposition, which, in the diplomat's words, "could turn nasty."    In a year that has seen no political dialogue whatsoever,  the  demands of the opponents of the Dushanbe authorities have grown  much more exacting. It is symptomatic that the Islamic  opposition leaders are inclining toward Tehran as the most  acceptable place for them to hold talks. They are clearly  hoping for Iranian support and consequently the support of  orthodox Muslims in their upcoming dialogue with Moscow and  Dushanbe.</p>

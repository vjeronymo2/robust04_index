			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, May 18, BNS -- The chairman of the  Independents faction in the Estonian parliament, Jaanus Raidal,  in an interview with BNS today said it was high time for Prime  Minister Mart Laar to resign.    "It's absolutely clear that if the government's affairs are  not going well, the prime minister himself would resign. A  political government coalition is strong only if it finds a new  suitable person from among its members for the prime minister's  office," Raidal said.    The parliament faction of the governing coalition's senior  party, Pro Patria, at a meeting today voted in favor of a  proposal by Prime Minister Mart Laar to dismiss Defense Minister  Indrek Kannik. Laar has said that Kannik's activity fails to  fall in line with the government's majority.    Kannik at a meeting of the Cabinet later in the day is  expected to propose the resignation of Laar's Cabinet as a  whole. Kannik received considerable support for his proposal at  a meeting of the Pro Patria party council today.    Raidal, and independent MP, called the prime minister's move  to dismiss Kannik "unethical."    He predicted that Laar will have to leave his office as  prime  minister at least by September.    "Even if today brings no solution for the issue, it will  happen in the near future," Raidal said.</p>

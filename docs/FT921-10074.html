			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Tokyo cleared in mercury poison case A COURT yesterday cleared the Japanese government of responsibility for a notorious outbreak of mercury poisoning, which became a symbol of the price Japan paid for its rapid industrialisation. About 1,200 have died since the poisoning was first detected in the 1950s in villages around Minamata Bay in southern Japan. More than 100,000 are believed to have been affected through eating fish poisoned by mercury pumped into the bay by Chisso, a chemicals company. The victims have pressed various law suits against Chisso, the government and the prefectural authorities alleging negligence. They claim the authorities should have controlled the discharge of effluent from the Chisso plant and the sale of fish. Yesterday, the Tokyo district court, hearing a claim by a group of 64 victims, confirmed a 1987 lower court ruling that Chisso was responsible for the poisoning. But it overturned a judgment against the government and the prefecture. The court ordered Chisso to pay compensation of Y4m (Pounds 18,000) to 42 plaintiffs. The judge ruled that the remaining 22 had not necessarily suffered from the poisoning, called 'Minamata disease'. Mr Shinji Arai, the judge, urged the government and the prefecture to settle out of court with the victims, since they bore 'political responsibility'. Lawyers for the victims immediately said they would appeal to the Supreme Court, a process which could take several years. The victims held protest meetings outside Chisso's headquarters in Tokyo and the offices of the government's environmental agency. With the suit likely to go to appeal and other cases involving 2,000 more plaintiffs still outstanding, the victims have a long fight ahead. They scored their first success 20 years ago when Chisso agreed to start paying compensation (without admitting full legal responsibility.) A major argument concerns government procedures for identifying those entitled to compensation. By the end of last year 15,838 Minamata victims had either applied or were applying for compensation. Of these only 2,942 were formally approved and 7,405 had been rejected. The 64 whose case was heard yesterday were among those who had not been approved - the fact that 42 of them were judged by the court to qualify for compensation raises questions about the government's tests. Minamata victims shocked the world and embarrassed Japan when they attended a world environment conference in Stockholm in 1972. A group plans to go to Rio de Janiero for this year's United Nations Earth Summit to show that their case is not yet closed.</p>

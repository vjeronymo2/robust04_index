			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: For richer, but surely not for poorer (1) Sir, Michael Prowse makes a cogent defence of Thatcherism ('What was right with the 1980s', April 5), but one does not have to be an egalitarian to disapprove of the growth of inequality. Even if there is no objection to the rich getting richer, who can approve of the poor getting poorer? Michael Goldman, 1 Lyndale Close, Blackheath, London SE3 7RG</p>

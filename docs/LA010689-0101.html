			<p><P> January 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: REYNOLDS WIRED ON SIDELINE  </P> <P> Jerry Reynolds, coach of the Sacramento Kings, is back on the sidelines wearing  a heart monitor after he collapsed on the court Dec. 27 during a game against  the Portland Trail Blazers.  </P> <P> The Kings made things a little easier on Reynolds the other night in his first  game back when they ran away from the Dallas Mavericks, 123-96.  </P> <P> "Once the game started, I didn't think about my heart," Reynolds said. "I was  more concerned with Mark Aguirre than whether my heart was pumping. If it  stops, I figure I'll find out about it soon enough."  </P> <P> Add Reynolds: He was unconscious for about a minute after collapsing face-first  during the fourth quarter of a close game against the Trail Blazers.  </P> <P> Reynolds remained motionless for six minutes before being removed from the  arena on a stretcher. He spent two days in a hospital, where doctors determined  that stress and a poor diet, not a heart attack, caused the collapse.  </P> <P> "I thought I fell backward," Reynolds said after viewing a tape of his  collapse. "I didn't know I was lying there like a drunk."  </P> <P> Reynolds is so excitable on the court that players, fans, a radio announcer and  referee Blaine Reichelt thought the collapse was just another one of his  antics.  </P> <P> "At first, I thought it was one of his regular tantrums," Sacramento guard  Kenny Smith said. "Then I realized it was serious."  </P> <P> Reichelt was so convinced Reynolds was putting on a show that he called a  technical foul on the coach but later rescinded it.  </P> <P> Last Add Reynolds: He said he had a nightmare in the hospital in which he was  "lying there like a beached whale and Jack Nicholson comes along and says, 'NBA  action, it's fantastic.' "  </P> <P> When Coach Spike Dykes of Texas Tech was told that the Red Raiders'  regular-season finale against Oklahoma State in Japan had no way of making the  papers in the United States, he said, "Why do you think we scheduled it?"  </P> <P> Texas Tech lost to Barry Sanders, Hart Lee Dykes and friends, 45-42.  </P> <P> John Reid, a member of the Holiday Bowl selection committee, says there are  some disadvantages to wearing the committee's flaming red blazer.  </P> <P> "I try not to wear it in hotel lobbies," Reid said. "People keep trying to give  me their luggage."  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> NBC football commentator Joe Namath, with Syracuse holding a 10-7 lead over LSU  at halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl on New Year's Day: "I think this game is  definitely going to be decided in the second half."  </P></p>

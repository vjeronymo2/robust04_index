			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / People: Electronic switches Tadpole Technology, the high technology group which gained a full listing last December and promptly saw its shares shoot up from 65p to 300p, has appointed Geoffrey Burr to head its US subsidiary. Tadpole, a specialist in printed circuit boards, says Burr would bring skills at exploiting 'fast time-to-market opportunities' to its growing US business. Burr has spent 20 years in the IT industry, the last seven with Digital Equipment Corporation. Tadpole's deputy chief executive Jeremy Woan is leaving the post but remains on the board as a non-executive director because of demands on his time from 'other companies'.</p>

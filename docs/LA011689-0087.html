			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: EVERYONE LIKES SAM . . . FOR NOW  </P> <P> There's a new sign near the Cincinnati Bengals' training facility which reads:  "Super Team, Super Sam, Super Bowl."  </P> <P> A year ago, Cincinnati fans were making other signs in reference to Coach Sam  Wyche when the Bengals went 4-11 and lost several close games in the final  minutes.  </P> <P> Quarterback Boomer Esiason, not always a Wyche booster himself, knows things  could change if things don't go right in the Super Bowl Sunday against the San  Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> "Last year they wanted him fired," Esiason said. "This year everybody wants to  hire him. Last year he was 'Wicky Wacky,' and this year he's a genius.  </P> <P> "If we can win this one and do the no-huddle offense, he'll be the greatest of  all time. He'll be better than Vince Lombardi. If we lose it, it's 'Well, they  did too many gimmicks again.' "  </P> <P> Buddy Bob: Wrote Norman Chad of The Washington Post about Bud Bowl I:  </P> <P> "Bob Costas once was a budding sportscaster; now he is a sporting Budcaster.  </P> <P> "NBC-TV Budcaster Bob Costas. Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? And Costas, by  gladly joining in Anheuser-Busch's megalomaniacal, mind-numbing Bud Bowl I  promotion, not only cheapens his journalistic reputation but also risks being a  handmaiden to the most cynical instincts of corporate America.  </P> <P> "Bob, for all you do for Anheuser-Busch, this Bud's for you."  </P> <P> Secondhand dimension: Before anybody thinks some Coca-Cola executive came up  with a sudden brainstorm to have the Super Bowl halftime show televised in 3-D,  Vito Stellino of the Baltimore Sun reports that the 3-D glasses were originally  scheduled for a "Moonlighting" episode that was canceled by the writers' strike  and were recycled for the Super Bowl.  </P> <P> Cats: The Columbus (Ga.) Astros, Houston's double-A Southern League farm team,  have changed their name to the Columbus Mudcats.  </P> <P> The baseball team's new ownership, under principal owner Steve Bryant of  Raleigh, N.C., thought the club needed a name "more in keeping with the area."  </P> <P> A mudcat is a catfish that lives in muddy water -- such as the Chattahoochee  River, which flows past Columbus.  </P> <P> Cats II: Some teams use a 2-3 zone to contain an opponent's big men, but Jess  Hutson of the Thiel College Tomcats may be the only coach in college basketball  whose playbook contains the 2-2 defense.  </P> <P> Injuries, fouls and academic problems have forced the Tomcats (1-9) to finish  their last two games with four players.  </P> <P> "We've been dressing seven players, but five of them were injured," Hutson  said. "Our kids get clearance from the doctor to play a game, then go back on  their crutches until we have another game."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Center Brian Skrudland after the Montreal Canadiens defeated Boston to open up  a 21-point lead over the second-place Bruins in the Adams Division: "When  someone is down in this league, you've got to kick him."  </P></p>

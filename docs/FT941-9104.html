			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Mersey Docks improves 38% to Pounds 21m Mersey Docks and Harbour, which last September acquired the Medway ports of Chatham and Sheerness to become the UK's second-largest port group, made profits of Pounds 20.9m before tax in 1993, a rise of 38 per cent. Medway's profits contribution was Pounds 1.27m for November and December only. This means Port of Liverpool profits were still a record Pounds 19.6m, against Pounds 15.2m in the previous year, restated from Pounds 16.4m under FRS 3. Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive, said Medway's operating profits last year were Pounds 10.6m, compared with Pounds 10.1m forecast at the time of the takeover. Growth in trade is continuing in both the Medway and the Mersey. Total turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 98.4m (Pounds 86.4m), with Port of Liverpool cargo up 5 per cent to 29.3m tonnes. This, the best throughput for three decades, was achieved with only 400 dockers. Throughput broke the 10m tonnes barrier in 1987 and passed 20m tonnes in 1989. Break-bulk general cargo was up 21 per cent, grain ahead 16 per cent, and containers up 3 per cent, despite tight competition on North Atlantic routes. Scrap metal cargoes were 1.4m tonnes, making Liverpool the second-largest in Europe after Rotterdam. Liverpool's assault on Irish Sea markets continued. Mr Furlong now claims a third of total cargoes and 60 per cent of unitised or container traffic between Dublin and the UK. He believes Liverpool's position near the centre of Britain's motorway network gives it an edge over the more remote ports of Stranraer and Holyhead because of tachograph restrictions on truck drivers. With its own terminals at Dublin and Belfast, the group plans faster turnround of Irish Sea roll-on-roll-off ships by building a Pounds 10m floating berth at Birkenhead to save locking in and out of port. The project is stalled because Merseyside Development Corporation, a government agency, wants a mixed retail, commercial and residential property complex where the group wants the floating berth's container terminal. Last year's 2-for-5 rights issue, which was used to largely fund the Medway purchase, raised Pounds 79m, compared with a budgeted Pounds 75.6m. The group has invested in a Pounds 500,000 extension to Sheerness's quayside storage facilities. With earnings per share up 33 per cent from an adjusted 15.05p to 19.96p, a proposed final dividend of 6.15p lifts the total 20 per cent to 9p (7.5p). Mr Furlong said the group would continue to search for suitable, complementary acquisitions. The government, which still owns a 20 per cent stake from the financial rescue of the defaulting Mersey Docks and Harbour Board in 1970, has said it has no intention to sell in the current financial year.</p>

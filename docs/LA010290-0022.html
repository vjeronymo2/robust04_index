			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> CULT: PAINFUL SINCERITY AMID THE RIFFS  </P> <P> After opening with the "one day a rain's gonna come and wash all the scum off  the streets" rap popularized by a certain former taxi driver, the Cult  kerranng! in the New Year before a capacity crowd at the Long Beach Arena.  Balloons cascaded from the ceiling as the Cult tossed off a  learned-it-at-soundcheck version of "Auld Lang Syne" that was distinguishable  from the rest of the set by virtue of its once having had a memorable melody.  </P> <P> Cheap joke. After all, the British hard-rock quartet has at least 30 minutes of  solid material, as demonstrated throughout the course of its 90-minute set.  </P> <P> Having devolved from gloom-doom boomers to college radio faves for the usual  three days to the ele-metal rock band with two gold LPs, these big-noise boys  can now truck around a big-time stage set-up, complete with a light truss that  rotates at big moments to reveal a big red Maltese cross, but they really don't  need the spectacle. The energy they expend running around striking poses alone  could've lit up the whole city of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, guitarist Billy Duffy played nothin' but racket. Bassist Jamie  Stewart -- another minimalist -- and this year's tour drummer were as tight as  the space between the blocks of the pyramids and about as solid, and vocalist  Ian Astbury carried on as if he were Jim Morrison's baby brother, the  Salamander Prince himself.  </P> <P> Speaking of rock offspring, Bonham -- the British quartet led by drummer Jason  Bonham, son o' late Led Zeppelin drummer John -- preceded the Cult with a  50-minute set that sounded alternately like his father and Foreigner-type radio  fodder (the hit "Wait for You"). These Led Clones might have a (birth)right to  the sound, but the shameless "my dad was blah-blah-blah and I'm gonna do this  one for him" rap before the rendition of the Zep's magnificent "Black Dog"  (lowlighted by the guitarist's leaving about half the solo's notes in the  dressing room) must've had dad rockin' -- but mostly rollin' over -- in his  grave. That is, if the rip-off of "Kashmir" hadn't already flipped pop's top.  </P> <P> The Cult, of course, has its own rip-off of "Kashmir." Laying on the '60s  imagery with a hod full of soul, it's also got a song about deceased Warhol  scenemaker Edie Sedgwick, written as a cautionary drug tale. It's that crazy  combination of flagrant riff-lifting and painful sincerity that makes the Cult  the closest thing pop music has to the Troggs nowadays. Can't wait for the  bootlegs of the studio bickering to surface. DON WALLER  </P></p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: London The key event of the week will be Wednesday's Pounds 2bn auction of stock yielding 8 1/2 per cent and maturing in 2005. Both Mr Nigel Richardson of Yamaichi International (Europe) and Mr Simon Briscoe of SG Warburg Securities expect the auction to go well, since the stock is likely to become a benchmark issue. Furthermore, Mr Briscoe thinks the Bank of England will be able to launch a further tranche of the stock at one of the later auctions this year. A successful auction would come as a great boost to a market battered by the recent rise in US Treasury bond yields and some poorish UK inflation statistics. Ten-year yields have been trading around 9 per cent but Mr Briscoe thinks gilts could now be due for a rebound. The monthly meeting between Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has been brought forward to today because of the latter's commitments to the IMF meeting in Madrid later this week. Few expect a further base rate rise so soon after September 12's half point increase. In the absence of much in the way of UK economic statistics, international markets will have a substantial influence, with traders watching closely for the outcomes of meetings of the Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank this week.</p>

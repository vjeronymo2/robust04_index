			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Murat Karayalcin, leader of the Social Democratic  Populist Party [SDPP], state minister, and deputy prime  minister, has declared that the election results indicate the  emergence of a political formation towards rightist parties.    In reply to a reporter's question whether the coalition is  in  danger, after the SDPP Central Administrative Council meeting,  Karayalcin retorted: The arithmetic of the results do not  indicate this.    Karayalcin announced that his party's Central Administrative  Council will convene again tomorrow and following the joint  meeting of the SDPP Turkish Grand National Assembly group and  ministers, the SDPP Party Council will also probably meet on the  weekend. Karayalcin said:    [Begin recording] [Karayalcin] Undoubtedly, the Party  Council will assess the matter in all its aspects. It will also  appraise the achievements of the coalition government. All your  questions will be answered after those deliberations.    As you know, we are also engaged in work on economic  matters.  Moreover, we have not yet received all the data that will allow  us to make statistical evaluations.    [Unidentified reporter] Will the government introduce a  package of price increases?    [Karayalcin] Statements concerning this subject will be  issued later; not by me, probably by the relevant minister.    [Unidentified reporter] What did you discuss during today's  Central Administrative Council meeting?    [Karayalcin] We assessed the elections.    [Unidentified reporter] What is the general trend? What are  the assessments?    [Karayalcin] In actual fact, we have not yet received all  the input to enable our colleagues to make detailed evaluations.  Nevertheless, the members of the council observed that there is  a general shift in political preference in Turkey. A political  formation leaning towards rightist parties, especially extreme  rightist parties, has emerged in recent elections. The  indications were noticeable in previous elections as well.  There were signs in 1993. In the 1994 local elections, this  trend emerged very clearly. Given the impressions of party  members and citizens, our council members expressed concern over  the possibility that our citizens could change their preference  for a Western-style democracy. [end recording]    Answering another question, Karayalcin remarked that his  party and the leftists failed to receive the desired results in  the elections and that the total votes decreased by 25 percent.</p>

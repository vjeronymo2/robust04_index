			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAILURE TO HEAR CASE AFFECTS CARE  </P> <P> Almost every day of the week, doctors of Orange County face a Catch-22 dilemma  in trying to ensure that the public is well and diligently served. On the one  hand, they are constantly accused of failing to police themselves, and on the  other, they are constantly thwarted in any attempt to protect the public by  accusation of self-interest and ever-increasing judicial restraints.  </P> <P> The action of Superior Court Commissioner Ronald Bauer in stopping the attempt  of the California State Board of Medical Quality Assurance, appointed by the  governor to maintain professional standards of practice, to restrict the highly  questionable activities of an Orange County physician is very frustrating.  According to The Times report (Nov. 15), in spite of accusations that the  physician prescribes massive doses of hormones for almost any ailment and  despite a statement by the BMQA that no scientific evidence for his treatment  exists, and notwithstanding the fact that the physician had been previously  cited by the board, the jurist not only failed to restrain the physician from  this practice but, again, according to The Times and for reasons which are not  clear, refused even to hear the state's case.  </P> <P> The Orange County Medical Assn. and every hospital in the county maintain  credentials committees and other formal boards to attempt to ensure that the  public receives ethical and appropriate treatment.  </P> <P> From personal hours and hours of effort spent to find out what ethical, honest  doctors can do to limit or eliminate spurious treatments prescribed by doctors  of doubtful ability and motivation, I know that the best of professional intent  is almost always stymied by the admonition of legal advisers that doctors can't  act to protect the public without exposing themselves to the real and  ever-growing threat of punitive legal action, including large fines and even  prison in the name of restraint of trade.  </P> <P> This latest mysterious action by a prominent Orange County jurist tends to  support the "Oh, what's the use" despair that more and more of us are feeling.  </P> <P> If doctors and their professional organizations are prevented from effective  self-policing, there will be nobody left to do it but the politicians -- those  same wonderful folks who brought you the $900 hammer and the $300 screw.  </P> <P> ARTHUR D.

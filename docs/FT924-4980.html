			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Arts: Before and after Munch - William Packer reviews the Scandinavian exhibition at the Baribcan IT IS dangerous but irresistible to generalise on national, even pan-national character and sensibility. We tell ourselves how unreasonable it is to expect two people, let alone millions, to act and think and feel alike, and yet we happily go on as though Latin volatility, British phlegm, or Gallic charm were established, concrete, verifiable facts. And here we have Border Crossings at the Barbican doing just such a thing, bringing together the work of 14 artists from the five Nordic countries, from the late 19th century to the present, to see what, if anything, they have in common. Tender is the North, the umbrella title of the current festival in London of the arts in Scandinavia, addresses by direct contradiction the similarly generalised assumption that the far North is dark and dreary, its peoples gloomy and angst-ridden. And here within it, Border Crossings oddly sets out to prove the opposite, that the prejudice might well be truth. The show does not start with Munch, but it presents him in strength, and what with the fine exhibition of his work of the 1890s, 'The Frieze of Life', running at the National Gallery, which I reviewed last Tuesday week, it is a prejudice hard to gainsay. Whatever we might have to say about his work, Munch was, to say the least, emotionally unstable, most especially through the 1890s and 1900s, ending up in a sanatorium. And he used his work in this period as the direct expression of his problems, if not their therapeutic resolution, taking on the universal subjects of love and sexuality, death and despair. The difficulty is that, in the arbitrary way of international reputation, Munch has been celebrated not merely as Norway's, indeed Scandinavia's greatest artist in the modern period, but virtually its only one. What a model by which to set a general character. He did not spring fully-formed from nowhere, and the northern schools of the 19th and early 20th centuries remain grossly neglected by the world at large. Within Norway alone, Christian Krogh especially, who was Munch's teacher, and such artists as Munthe and Thaulow and Harriet Backer, deserve far wider recognition. Krogh, indeed, directly and splendidly anticipated Munch by some 15 years in the subject of the sick girl. But even so, that working context was one broadly of social-realism and domestic genre painting, with the sophistication of a romantic impressionism creeping in. Munch, in the directness and freedom of his technique, and the psychological intensity he brought to his treatment of his subject-matter, was certainly far more radically advanced. Yet even in this respect, he was never entirely on his own, which is the premise of this small but intriguing show. Its subject is effectively the emergence and continuation even to the present day, of an expressionist tradition in the northern schools, more particularly a romantic expressionism as much founded in a response to landscape as to any human drama, and inclining ever more towards abstraction. The first of the artists is Carl Fredrik Hill, a Swede, with a series of surreal and symbolist drawings of dubious beasts and figures, and some exquisitely rich yet simple landscapes, romantic in their desolation. Then comes Munch's friend, the writer, August Strindberg, whose wild sea and sky-scapes come as close to an emotional and expressionist abstraction as anything of so early a date. So the show continues, more or less chronologically, by way of Munch, then Kjarval (Iceland), Weie (Denmark), Sallinen (Finland), Jorn (Denmark), Lundquist (Sweden) and others, and so on to the present generation with Per Kirkeby (Denmark), Jenssen (Norway) and Marika Makela (Finland). These last are all abstract painters, but their work is fraught with landscape or organic associations. Here Sigudur Gudmunsson (Iceland), is technically an odd-man-out, though not in spirit, working playfully in the landscape, with the photograph at once record and resolution of his intervention. Iceland is strongly represented in this exhibition, as in the festival at large, to an extent remarkable for a national population no larger than that of Plymouth. That presence is further confirmed by a programme of exhibitions and events elsewhere in London, that continues until December 15, under the title of Art from Above, notably an extensive group show of painting, craft and sculpture at Butler's Wharf, SE1, just downstream from Tower Bridge.

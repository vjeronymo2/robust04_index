			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Establish Procedures to Verify That the HACCP System Is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This process involves: (1) Verifying that the critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limits are adequate to control the hazards; (2) ensuring that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plan is working properly, e.g., that it is being followed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that appropriate decisions are being made about corrective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions; and (3) ensuring that there is documented, periodic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revalidation of the plan to make sure that it is still relevant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to raw materials as well as to conditions and processes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant. Government regulatory activities also help ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HACCP system is working.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Specific Applications to Seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As NAS has pointed out, most health risks associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seafood originate in the environment (Ref. 7, p. 1). Many of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these risks are the subject of research by FDA, the National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Commerce, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others. This research is designed both to produce information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will provide a better understanding of the toxins, bacteria,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical contaminants, and other phenomena and to provide a basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for developing more advanced types of controls for them. Within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the limits of existing scientific knowledge, however, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry can and should use HACCP to control the source and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of raw materials based on an understanding of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely hazards that need to be prevented.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pillsbury team that first applied HACCP to food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production began with a systematic review of raw materials to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that they were not bringing hazards into the plant. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bauman pointed out:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This required the development of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> familiarity with the raw materials that was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not a normal process in food product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development *&blank;*&blank;*. The areas of concern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ranged from the potential presence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathogens, heavy metals, toxins, physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards and chemicals, to the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatments the ingredients might have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received such as pesticide applications or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pasteurization step. (Ref. 33, pp. 2 and 3.)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While all these areas that were of concern to Pillsbury are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> germane to all seafoods, they certainly cover the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards to which seafoods are susceptible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the three most frequently reported seafood-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illnesses, two are environmentally related: ciguatera in warm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water reef fish, as described previously, and water-borne viruses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in molluscan shellfish consumed raw and partially cooked. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a rapid test to detect ciguatoxin in fish continues to be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target of research at FDA and elsewhere, processors and importers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can exercise control by ensuring that they are obtaining fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from responsible sources that are not harvesting from waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where ciguatoxin is being found.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ciguatera has been associated with recreational fishing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Processors and importers should address through HACCP any safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considerations that might exist with the commercial sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recreational catch generally, depending upon species and locale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For viruses from molluscan shellfish to be controlled, HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures must be in place to ensure that molluscan shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harvested from polluted waters are not entering commerce. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> key safety controls relate to proper refrigeration to keep  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially harmful microbes from reaching dangerous levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third seafood-related illness, scombroid poisoning, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused by a toxin created as part of the process of decomposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after a fish has died. The formation of scombrotoxin can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triggered by time/temperature abuse anywhere in the commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system and beyond, including as early as on the harvesting vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if good handling controls are not followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is considering whether to develop good handling practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements (not necessarily HACCP) specific to fishing vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and invites comment on this matter. FDA has traditionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrained from directly regulating fishing vessels, largely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the huge number of such vessels in the U.S. fleet,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even though it has authority to do so. FDA invites comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether those boats that harvest scombrotoxin-forming species, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any other specific component of the fleet, should be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandatory HACCP controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

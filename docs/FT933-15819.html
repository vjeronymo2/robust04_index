			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Managment: The shake-up of Big Blue's army - In what could be a model for the group, IBM UK is pioneering a new regime Jacques Maisonrouge, president of IBM's operations outside the US in the 1970s, once provoked enthusiastic applause during a conference by misreading the phrase 'IBM teams' as 'IBM troops'. His slip accurately conveyed the flavour of the traditional IBM marketing machine; a well-drilled army of blue-suited, white-shirted technocrats rigidly controlled from the centre with power in the hands of a tiny elite. Then IBM was the largest and most successful computer manufacturer in the world; today, hampered by an overweight bureaucracy which has dragged the company into two years of losses as new technology forces down hardware prices, 'Big Blue' is seeking new ways to restore vigour and agility. Its command structure is being dismembered, its foot soldiers 'empowered' to decide which wars to fight and which weapons to use. The battleground for some of the most important of these changes is IBM UK. There are two main reasons. First, recession struck the UK earlier than other European countries and the UK company has been particularly hard hit over the past two years; in 1992 it lost Pounds 616m on sales of Pounds 3.75m. Second, competition in the UK computer market is the world's fiercest. If a solution works in the UK, the argument goes, there is a good chance it can be exported elsewhere. The latest move, announced last week, is the division of the UK home sales operation into a federation of some 30 separate businesses, each with the power to fix its prices and settle its costs. It is a microcosm of the grander plan, devised by IBM's former chief executive John Akers, to split IBM globally into a loose network of separate business units. There will be three kinds of businesses in the UK: vertical industries such as banking or retailing; product sectors including enterprise (mainframe) systems or personal systems; and the computing services businesses, management consultancy and hardware maintenance. Some will employ only 50 people, others 500 or more. What practical difference will the new structure make? In the past, business managers were responsible for their revenues and their share of corporate costs. If a customer was unhappy with a product or service, the manager had to go elsewhere in the company to find a solution. There were endless arguments as salesmen fought their customers' corner against the bureaucracy. In the new regime, business managers alone will be responsible for their profits, costs and their customers' satisfaction. They will be measured by five criteria: customer satisfaction, employee morale (both measured by opinion surveys) profits, market share and cash generation. The vertical industry businesses can buy hardware and software from the IBM product businesses or from elsewhere if they believe a competitor's equipment can do the job better. There will be no monthly reviews. The centre will operate little, if any, control unless a business starts to go off the rails. According to IBM: 'The creation of a business federation will give more ownership and accountability to business managers, enabling the company to return to profit more quickly.' It will allow a variety of market approaches each with its own cost structure. A mainframe sale to the banking sector could be made, for example, by the banking business unit, by the enterprise systems business unit or by a specialised sales team within enterprise systems. The move, codenamed Galaxy, is the latest phase of the so-called Temple Plan, a blueprint for recovery announced in the middle of 1991 by Nick Temple, chief executive of IBM UK. The first phases of the plan have been implemented over the past two years. The structure of the company has been changed radically. Eight layers of management have been stripped down to four. A series of early retirement and voluntary redundancy programmes will have reduced staff numbers from 18,600 in 1985 to just over 11,000 by the end of the summer. Some 80 per cent of the workforce now come face to face with customers, compared with only 45 per cent two years ago. Galaxy, however, which will put astonishing power and authority in the hands of managers more used to taking orders than giving them, will give the Temple Plan its stiffest test. It will give business managers control over, first, prices. Javaid Aziz, IBM UK's general manager, marketing, explains: 'When 10 years ago you sold a mainframe computer to a banker, an insurer or a retailer, it took the same amount of resource to make the sale, to install the machine and get it working. You could list your prices. 'Now the environment has changed. The hardware is secondary to the requirement that the overall system does the job properly and the people on the ground understand best how to pull together and price the necessary hardware, software and services. If you try to price deals like that centrally, you will have a disaster because the people there do not have sufficient judgment of the market to be able to price accurately'. Second, business managers will have control over their costs. Aziz says: 'You cannot have a truly customer-responsive organisation where the cost structure is determined centrally. If you want your business managers to own their place in the market, to own their resources and deliver you a profit, you have to move cost control from the centre to the businesses. 'In March this year only 20 per cent of costs were determined by our business managers. We intend to move to a situation where they determine 95 per cent of their costs. In this way, you get rid of the final vestiges of a command and control structure and culture.' Because only 5 per cent of costs will be determined centrally, there is no need for a large central bureaucracy. The 2,500 headquarters' staff employed two years ago are being cut to 100 people who will manage the central holding company. Headquarters departments such as finance, personnel, distribution and corporate affairs are being spun out as service units. The businesses are empowered to buy their services if they wish but are not required to do so; they could, for example, buy a pension plan from an outside supplier. Service units which fail to attract adequate business, however, will have no reason to exist. Plans like Galaxy are fine in theory but the significant change, as Aziz accepts, will have to be in Big Blue's corporate mind. It remains to be seen if the leopard can change its spots. The plan, needless to say, has the approval of IBM's new chairman and chief executive, Louis Gerstner. Temple and Aziz presented the details to him during his visit to the UK in April. He will undoubtedly be watching the UK experiment with keen interest. He is still enjoying his 'honeymoon' as chief executive, but analysts are already beginning to ask when he will be ready to present his recovery plan for the company as a whole. Aziz claims that the UK company has already gained several points in market share in mainframes and that business expenses fell 50 per cent between 1991 and 1993 - roughly in line with a decline in staff from 10,500 to 6,500 over the same period. This year he hopes to keep revenues in line with last year, despite the declining cost of hardware. He also hopes to return to profit: 'You have to get the management systems right, the business measurements right and there has to be trust and teamwork. These are the pillars on which you build changes like these,' he says.</p>

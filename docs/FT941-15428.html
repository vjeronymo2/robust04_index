			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Georgia and Abkhazia sign pact The Georgian government and the breakaway region of Abkhazia yesterday signed an accord calling for the rapid deployment of international peacekeeping forces to police their four-month-old ceasefire, and paving the way for a phased return to Abkhazia of more than 200,000 refugees, writes Frances Williams from Geneva. Mr Edouard Brunner, the UN mediator, said it would be up to the UN Security Council to decide the size of the force and where the troops should be deployed.</p>

To date, Ye Kelin, one of the two men, has become a  successful entrepreneur. His hometown, Qiaotou Town in Yongjia  County has grown into China's biggest button market, with some  200 button processing factories and 50,000 people engaging in  the field.    Thanks to these small buttons, the town, once a poor and  remote place, has taken on a new look, with high buildings  cropping up and roads leading to over 20 provinces in the  country.    The rise of Qiaotou Town and the success of the two young  men  is far from extraordinary in the province, which has set up  4,127 markets of various kinds, with 1993's turnover amounting  to 65.1 billion yuan.    Among them, some national markets, such as the Yiwu-based  "small commodities town", the Wenlin-based aquatic products  market and the pearl market at Zhiji, lead the country.    Ye said, "It is the markets that have lifted us out of  poverty."    Stories about business success are heard everywhere in the  province.    A shoemaker has become the boss of a sewing-machine factory,  the output value of which surpasses 100 million yuan.    A young man has launched a company offering chartered  airplane service to passengers on six domestic airlines.    A "beggar village" has achieved an average per capita income  exceeding that of Hong Kong.    And a township enterprise has contracted with the police and  military in the United States to supply badges. Every month it  supplies 20,000 badges to the country.    Township enterprises grossed nearly 260 billion yuan in  1993,  accounting for two-thirds of the province's industrial total.  Each farmer's yearly income has reached around 1,600 yuan,  leading the country for eight years running.    Some attribute the success to the natives' innate business  sense.    Famous township entrepreneur Lu Guanqiu, president of the  Wanxiang Group in Hangzhou, said that without the reform  campaign he and his countrymen would be nothing.    He said, "The market economy is an opportunity for  Zhejiang's  invigoration."    Located on east China's coast, the province has long  suffered  from violent typhoons and storms, forcing many local residents  to leave home to make their living in other places before  liberation.    As a result, Zhejiang natives seem more outgoing, active,  enterprising and easily adapt to new environments, compared to  people from other parts of China.    After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949  Zhejiang narrowed the gap with other provinces in economically  strong east China. But a lack of raw materials and natural  resources still hindered its development of modern industry.    When the government lifted some restrictions on central  planning in the late 1970s and China's higher-learning  institutions restored enrollment, some 10,000 farmers from  Wenzhou City, which took the lead in experimenting with the  market economy, went to colleges and universities to get orders  for school badges.    All of them made their fortunes, encouraging others to  follow  suit.    Shaoxing County, in the forefront of China's 100  economically  powerful counties, saw over 100 farmers set up stalls along a  street, buying textile raw materials from the north and selling  the final products.    With turnover and profits snowballing, "a textile and light  industry city" emerged there. It has now become the largest  cloth distributing center in Asia. Last year the center  registered a business volume of 3.5 billion yuan-worth.    Ji Gengli, secretary of the county's party committee, said  that due to this center the output value of township and private  enterprises here accounts for 90 percent of the county's  industrial total.    So far, the province has 290 production materials markets,  registering an annual business volume of 18.6 billion  yuan-worth. Its over 50,000 township enterprises get over 60  percent of their materials from these markets rather than  through allocations from state planning.    So far, there are 29 such markets whose turnover surpasses a  total of 100 million yuan each.    In recent years more and more Zhejiang natives have turned  their sights to the labor and production factor markets.    Around 160,000 people in the province are engaged in fields  such as information and the transfer of research findings. Each  year, nearly 10,000 fruits from over 2,000 collective or private  research institutes are turned into production through the  markets.    More than 60,000 enterprises have connected farmers with the  market, resulting in a big increase in farmers' incomes.    And people breeding aquatic products and involved in  horticulture seem to earn more than others.    Zhang Aiping and his three partners, all farmers in Yuhuan  County, invested over three million yuan, which they had made by  planting fruit trees, into a river eel pond in 1993 and reaped  more than one million yuan in profits that year.    To introduce advanced techniques, farmers in Cixi and Yuyao  invited horticulturists from Japan and Taiwan.    According to preliminary statistics, the annual export  volume  of farm by-products has reached nearly 20 billion yuan-worth,  earning over two billion U.S. dollars.    A new proverb has gained popularity in the province: "People  who want to get rich should learn to swim in the market first."    Now, the second round of reform, featuring a shift to the  shareholding system, is sweeping through the province. It has  870 joint-stock companies.</p>

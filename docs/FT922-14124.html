			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Ireland announces abortion referendum THE IRISH government last night announced it intends to hold a new referendum on abortion, focusing on women's right to travel abroad for an abortion and to receive abortion information within Ireland. The move follows the refusal by most of Ireland's EC partners just hours earlier to amend a protocol to the Maastricht Treaty which protects Ireland's constitutional ban on abortion. EC officials said Ireland's request would 'open a Pandora's box' with other states also seeking changes to the treaty. No date has been fixed for the vote - Ireland's second abortion referendum in nine years. The issue is rapidly becoming a legal and political nightmare for the Irish government. Two months ago, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, said such a referendum was unnecessary and would be considered only 'as a last resort'. Mr Reynolds has come under increasing pressure from right-to-life campaigners within his Fianna Fail party, to hold an abortion referendum, following a Supreme Court ruling last month allowing a 14-year-old rape victim to travel to Britain to terminate her pregnancy. A High Court injunction had earlier prevented her from doing so, on the basis of a 1983 constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to life. The Supreme Court ruling has effectively established the right to abortion in Ireland for women who face a threat to their lives, including the threat of suicide, but the judges also concluded that where such a threat to the life of the mother does not exist, pregnant women seeking an abortion abroad can legally be prevented from doing so. Mr Alan Shatter, the justice spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael party said he welcomed the government decision. Mr Dick Spring, Labour leader, said the referendum should be held before the vote on Maastricht, set for June.</p>

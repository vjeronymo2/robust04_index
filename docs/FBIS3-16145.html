			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cristian Nita from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] The Central Electoral Commission today confirmed  [as heard] the results of the 27 February parliamentary  elections as follows:    The Agrarian Democratic Party of Moldova [PDAM] obtained  43.13 percent of the votes, which amounts to 57 seats in the new  parliament;    The Bloc of the Socialist Party and the Edinstvo Unity  Movement obtained 22.0 percent of the votes, which equals 28  seats;    The Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals obtained 9.21 percent  of the votes, which equals 11 seats;    The Christian-Democratic Popular Front Alliance obtained  7.53  percent of the votes, which means nine seats in parliament.    The other parties and independent candidates did not obtain  the necessary number of votes needed to be represented in  parliament.    The Central Electoral Commission will prepare an official  report containing all violations of the [electoral] law found  during the ballot. The report will then be sent to the Supreme  Court of Justice, which will confirm the legality of the ballot  within the following 10 days.    Commenting on the results of the parliamentary elections and  the [6 March] public opinion poll titled "Consulting With the  People" [actually a referendum in which the majority rejected  the idea of Moldova's unification with Romania], Dumitru Motpan,  the leader of the PDAM -- the party that obtained the most seats  in parliament -- stated to ITAR-TASS that the absolute majority  of the people has reasserted its belief in the independence and  territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. The PDAM will  not act to halt reform, but rather it will act to further  reform, the PDAM leader said. According to Motpan, the first  task is to implement privatization, which will begin by giving  land to the peasants. However, generally speaking, the solution  to the economic problems depends on whether the state manages to  increase labor productivity in Moldova's economy. To that  purpose, Moldova will deepen and extend its relations both with  the countries belonging to the CIS and with the West, Motpan  stated.    According to the MOLDOVA-PRES agency, the PDAM leader also  announced that the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova will  alter the national anthem, which, said Motpan, is identical with  neighboring Romania.</p>

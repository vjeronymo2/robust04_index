			<p>Bolivian   Drug Trafficker   <F P=102> PA0804150394 Mexico City NOTIMEX in Spanish 2229 GMT 5 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> PA0804150394 </F> <F P=104>  Mexico City NOTIMEX </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN     [Text] San Jose, 5 Mar [date as received] (NOTIMEX) -- Luis  Fishman, the Costa Rican government and public security  minister, said today that the DEA had brought alleged Bolivian  drug kingpin Edgar Fernandez Lazcano into the country .    DEA officials brought Fernandez Lazcano into the country,  without consulting local authorities, on a private flight on 16  March, Minister Fishman said at a joint news conference with  Rafael Angel Guillen, director of the Judicial Investigation  Agency (OIJ).    Fishman and Guillen ended 12 days of silence when Attorney  General Jose Maria Tijerino announced that he was initiating an  investigation on "the mysterious conditions under which the  South American citizen entered" the country.    Bolivian drug officials believe Fernandez Lazcano to be the  right-hand man of Isaac "Oso" Chavarria's--Bolivia's most  prominent drug trafficker--who is charged with bribing important  politicians in that South American country.    Fishman said the Bolivian drug trafficker "arrived in Costa  Rica aboard a U.S. Government plane with registration number  N55949."    The authorities explained that Bolivians do not require a  visa to enter Costa Rican territory but they asserted that "we  do not know why (the Costa Rican Government) was not informed of  this matter."    According to the Costa Rican officials, the drug kingpin  stayed at the luxurious San Jose Palace Hotel accompanied by DEA  officials and three unidentified Bolivian police officers.    Fishman said that "the DEA's actions are a blatant abuse by  this organization" because they did not report Fernandez  Lazcano's arrival to Costa Rican authorities.    Fishman said that Roberto Mendez, director of the Drug  Investigation and Control Center, has requested an explanation  of DEA activities from the DEA head in this country. The  minister also warned that "we will not allow any more of their  arbitrary actions."    Fishman revealed that Fernandez Lazcano had left for the  United States, escorted by DEA officials, on TACA Airlines  flight 40 last Sunday.    The Costa Rican officials said DEA officials had taken  Fernandez from Bolivia to Panama, where local authorities denied  him entry because he did not have a visa. They thus decided to  bring him to Costa Rica, where Bolivians do not need a visa.    The minister justified his office's previous silence on the  case by saying that "Fernandez is a great witness who apparently  knows a lot about the ties between drug traffickers and  politicians in his country. That is why we could not reveal the  details of his stay in Costa Rica."</p>

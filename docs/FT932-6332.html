			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / International Company News: Weak domestic demand hits Mitsubishi Materials MITSUBISHI Materials, a leading Japanese metal and ceramics company, suffered a 51.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y9.8bn (Dollars 90m) last year because of waning domestic demand for fabricated metal products and appreciation of the yen against the dollar. Net profits plunged by about 90 per cent to Y3bn on sales of Y743.2bn, down 5.6 per cent. The company's earnings were hit last year by lower prices of some metals in spite of efforts to cut costs and restructure operations. Its shares, which trade on the first section of the Tokyo stock exchange, retreated Y17 to Y511 yesterday. The company predicts pre-tax profits of Y8bn for the current financial year ending March 1994 on sales of Y730bn.</p>

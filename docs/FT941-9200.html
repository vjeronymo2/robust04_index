			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Teaching science is unpopular career A shortage of good science and technology teachers is predicted today by the the independent National Commission on Education. In a survey to be published next month the commission found that only 10 per cent of students expecting to earn a first-class honours degree had applied for jobs in teaching, compared with 27 per cent of those in line for third-class honours. Teaching was least popular among science students, with only 5 per cent of engineering and technology students opting for education as a career. Mr Josh Hillman, the report's author, said: ''Teaching is not popular among those for whom there is the greatest need within the profession.' He said the survey, which contacted 1,400 final-year students, raised serious concerns about the types of students choosing to go into teaching, although it did not yet indicate a crisis in overall numbers. Although vacancies for teachers are at an all-time low, educationalists believe there could be a teacher shortage when the economy emerges from recession. Insights into Education and Training will be published on March 2 by the National Commission on Education.</p>

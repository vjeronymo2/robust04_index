			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bond Reports Massive Loss: Alan Bond's beleaguered flagship, Bond Corp.  Holdings, announced the third-biggest loss in Australian corporate history.  </P> <P> The company reported a loss of $580 million ($758.15 million Australian) for  the second half of 1989. The loss was surpassed only by Bond Corp's own  full-year loss of $623 million (A$814.1 million) to June 30, 1989, and a  six-month loss of $660 million (A$862.5 million) by its 58%-owned subsidiary,  Bell Resources, reported in March. But Bond Corp. Director Peter Lucas said the  company was confident it could not only survive but rebuild.  </P></p>

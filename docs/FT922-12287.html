			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Letter: Malta and the EC Sir, Part of the report, 'Delors signals more powers for Brussels' (April 8), in which David Buchan described a statement purportedly made by Malta's foreign minister, is not correct. Dr de Marco, in reply to a question, had pointed out that Luxembourg, a founder-member of the European Community, was comparable in size to Malta, but this had not caused any difficulty to the Community. On the contrary, Luxembourg's performance had been exemplary. Malta's role in a future enlarged Community likewise should pose no problems. Dr de Marco added that, if any changes were to prove necessary as a result of an enlargement, including the question of the number of commissioners, Malta would co-operate, for Malta's membership application was founded principally on the fact that it shared the objectives and ideals of the Community, and desired to see them secured in the most efficient manner possible. C Vella, ambassador, permanent delegate to the EC, Brussels</p>

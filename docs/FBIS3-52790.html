A delegation member said that  "during last night's meeting, the delegation submitted seven  written specific reform points and asked the Executive Committee  members to take a stand on them."    The "reform delegation," which is headed by Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi and includes seven other members, represents 120  Palestinian figures from inside and outside the occupied  territory who signed a document delivered to the PLO leadership  last month calling on it to modernize the PLO's institutions and  promote a democratic leadership that would end the  decisionmaking monopoly. The member revealed that, upon  returning to Amman, the delegation intends to invite the  signatories of the reform document to a meeting in the Jordanian  capital within the next few days to report to them on the talks.  The member, who was talking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from Tunis,  specified these points as follows:    1. Formation of a planning and consultative committee to  include qualified Palestinians from all fields, especially those  needed for building the national authority.    2. Formation of a committee for comprehensive national  dialogue (to include Palestinian factions, figures,  establishments, and other bodies) consisting of independent  elements enjoying the respect of the Palestinian people with the  aim of strengthening democracy.    3. Creation of a department for the development of  manpower. Its task will be to identify the Palestinian people's  manpower qualifications in all fields and to retrain and  rehabilitate the present cadres of the PLO.    4. Creation of a national authority reference body in  Gaza and Jericho from elements inside the occupied territory to  fill the vacuum before and after the Israeli withdrawal until  the emergence of the national authority.    5. Submission of the proposed constitution for discussion  at popular level.    6. Submission of a "modern" electoral law for discussion  at popular level.    7. Revival of the negotiation steering committees which  supervised the negotiations.    The delegation member said that "Palestinian President Yasir  'Arafat expressed reservations regarding the first point,  pointing out that a planning council already exists and could be  rejuvenated with the qualifications we propose." According to  the member, 'Arafat is trying to find a compromise solution on  that point.    On the second point, the delegation member said, 'Arafat  agreed in principle to the formation of a dialogue committee,  giving responsibility for it to Dr. Haydar 'Abd-al-Shafi. The  member added: "It can be said that 'Arafat did not agree to the  formation of the kind of committee that we are calling for, one  that would initiate a comprehensive dialogue with all the  establishments and bodies inside and outside the occupied  territory, not just a dialogue committee with only the  opposition factions, to create an atmosphere of popular unity  and of opposition to infighting, and to discuss points of  agreement and come up with binding decisions."    In reply to a question about the positions of 'Arafat and  the  other PLO Executive Committee members on the other points, he  said that "they were not seriously discussed in the earlier  meetings. Discussion was deferred until the final session which  continued until dawn today." Asked about guarantees for the  implementation of these demands, the member said: "To ensure  implementation, we submitted a mechanism for the implementation  of each proposal that would indicate the leadership's  seriousness about its promises and would enable us to request  implementation once the proposal is approved."    On the positions of the Executive Committee members, the  delegation member said that seven Executive Committee members,  including 'Arafat, attended the meetings and that their  positions can be summed up as follows:    1. 'Ali Ishaq (Palestine Liberation Front) (Abu-al-'Abbas):  He did not comment but he did show some kind of displeasure.    2. Samir Ghawshah (Popular Struggle Front): Expressed  reservations about the creation of new institutions. He called  instead for the reactivation of the existing institutions.    3. Mahmud 'Abbas (Abu Mazin) (Fatah): He supported the  demands.    4. Faruq Qaddumi (Abu-al-Lutf) (Fatah): He did not  attend the last two meetings because he was in Amman but he  insisted on giving his opinion of all the points. His position  was positive.    5. Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh (Fida): His position was positive.    6. Sulayman al-Najjab (People's Party): He accepted all  the demands.</p>

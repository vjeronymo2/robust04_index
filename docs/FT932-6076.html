			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales at highest since Crash of '87 - At a glance Unit trust sales in April reached their highest level since the 1987 stock market crash. Net sales were Pounds 955m, compared with Pounds 769m in March, and Pounds 649m for the whole of 1992. Lower interest rates appear to be persuading investors to opt for equity-based products, where yields are roughly similar and there is the prospect of capital growth. A further encouraging sign for the industry is that the number of unitholder accounts has risen to 4.51m, from 4.35m at the end of 1992.</p>

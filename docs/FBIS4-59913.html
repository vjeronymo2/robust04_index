			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa by Baudouin Loos </F> in Brussels; date not given: "Concerning Some Problems in the  Middle East"]    [Text] [Loos] In Brussels, you have just met your European  counterparts as well as the Belgian authorities. The Middle  East peacemaking process, which Egypt actively supports, was one  of the issues which you addressed. Do you believe it was the  Palestinians who had to make the greatest concessions?    [Musa] I would not speak of "concessions," but I would  rather  highlight the fact that this was the first step in a long  process leading to self-determination for Palestinians. They  have now obtained certain territories. We do not think the  issue now is to discuss the importance of these territories.  The very fact that the Israelis have withdrawn from the  territories and that power has been restored directly to the  Palestinians, rather than to the Egyptians or the Jordanians, is  itself a major political, psychological, and territorial step  forward. True, there are limitations and conditions imposed on  the Palestinians, because this is only the first step.    [Loos] When PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat refused to sign a  document as part of the conclusion of the Israeli-Palestinan  agreement, 15 days ago in Cairo, it seems your president, Husni  Mubarak, became very angry...    [Musa] I can only say that a last-minute problem did in fact  arise. However, 'Arafat had a just claim to put forward at that  time, and this point was solved immediately, when (Israeli Prime  Minister) Rabin's letter, which had to be attached to the  documents, was indeed annexed to the latter. All this can  undoubtedly be explained by the long night spent in discussions,  just before the agreement was signed. In Cairo, you saw the tip  of the iceberg of the kind of problems encountered at every step  by the parties engaged in the negotiations.  <H5>  Jewish Settlements Are Dangerous. </H5>   [Loos] Many Palestinians criticize the fact that the  agreement does not contemplate putting a stop to Jewish  settlements in the territories.    [Musa] This is a very serious issue which must be tackled  immediately, and Israel should be advised not to continue to  expand the settlements, because such a policy is essentially  very dangerous and is harmful to the peace process. I believe  this makes sense, and that Israel is aware of it.    [Loos] What is you assessment of the problems encounterd by  the PLO in its relations with the World Bank, which is acting as  an intermediary between Palestinian autonomy and the donor  countries?    [Musa] The problem lies in 'Arafat leading the PLO,  considering there is now a territory, and citizens. The  objective is to transform a resistance organization into an  administration, and it has taken some time to assess the  situation. I believe the problems have now been largely  overcome.    [Loos] What is your message to the numerous Israelis who  reproach Egypt for agreeing only to a "cold peace?"    [Musa] This sort of reproach is the language of the past. We  do not understand the term "cold peace." Peace is peace. We  have peaceful, normal relations with Israel, which are following  their course and developing.    [Loos] Egypt is considered the U.S.' best Arab ally in the  region. On the other hand, does your country not view a number  of issues rather differently?    [Musa] We do in fact have excellent relations with the  United  States. However, we do not share the same views on certain  problems such as Somalia, Libya, and regional disarmament.  <H5>  Sanctions: It is up to the Iraqi Leadership </H5>   [Loos] What about Iraq?    [Musa] Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions, which it  seems to be doing. Also, in order to enter a new era, it must  formally renounce any claims on Kuwait and recognize the latter  as an independent country, one which cannot live for ever  exposed to such a threat.    [Loos] You have said that the sanctions were penalizing the  Iraqi people excessively...    [Musa] Everybody knows that, including Iraq's leaders. It is  up to them to diminish the suffering, and they know what must be  done for this to happen. But it would be a mistake to believe  that the world can forget their adventure in Kuwait without a  political and legal change taking place. Having said this, I  must add that we are prepared to contribute to helping the Iraqi  people, as members of the United Nations and the Arab League.    [Loos] What can Egypt do to help extinguish the conflict in  Yemen?    [Musa] We asked for a meeting of the Arab League, but things  have rapidly developed out of control. We believe the solution  must include three aspects: a cease-fire, a withdrawal of  troops, and resuming negotiations immediately on the basis of  the Amman agreement, which was signed between the two sides on  20 February but never implemented. We are in touch with both  sides, but some are hoping for a military victory in the field.  It must become clear that war leads nowhere, that the country  must remain united, but without resorting to arms, because this  would mean long-term instability.</p>

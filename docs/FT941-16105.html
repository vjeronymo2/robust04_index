			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Police force to be offered protection Northumbria police officers are to be supplied with bullet-proof and knife-proof vests. The force, the first in the country to supply protective vests routinely to any officers wishing to wear them, said yesterday it was to buy 600 vests at a cost of Pounds 145,000, provided by the police authority. Mr David Mellish, deputy chief constable, said it had taken two years to find a vest offering protection against both knives and bullets. They have been developed for the Northumbria force by Highmark, a Belfast company. Last year a Northumbria officer, Sergeant Bill Forth, died from knife wounds while on duty in Gateshead. Force members were seriously assaulted on 668 occasions resulting in 4,400 days' sick leave and 508 days lost through stress. The force has already introduced - at a cost of Pounds 218,000 - longer truncheons, snap-on handcuffs, regular self-defence sessions and reinforced windscreens.</p>

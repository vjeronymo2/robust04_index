			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / To leave, or not to leave / Examining the debate over ERM and sterling Has the lifebelt turned into a straitjacket? The question is being asked of the European exchange rate mechanism, in the increasingly emotion-tinged debate about whether Britain should engineer a sterling devaluation to promote economic recovery. The combination of high Bundesbank-induced interest rates and apparently never-ending recession have prompted discussion about whether the UK's interests would best be served by a decision to cut the pound loose from the D-Mark and leave the ERM only 20 months after joining it. Talk about a possible sterling devaluation has affected the financial markets, which have marked the pound down heavily in recent weeks. From about DM2.94 at the end of May, it closed last night in London nearly 1 pfennig down on the day at DM2.8475. The leaders in the argument about a devaluation are not just those economists who have consistently opposed ERM entry for Britain.  When Britain joined the mechanism, after years of agonising, most economists supported the move on purely practical grounds. It was thought that by locking Britain into a long-term link with Europe's most stable currency, ERM entry opened up the possibility of lasting decline in inflation and steady long-term growth. There were, however, substantial pockets of resistance. For example, monetarist economists such as Professor Patrick Minford of Liverpool University, have consistently argued that locking the pound into a fixed link with the D-Mark reduces the UK's flexibility over domestic interest rates. Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University has been another leading dissident. But in recent weeks, those taking up the cudgels in favour of an exit from the ERM are economists who previously supported Britain's entry. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the Swiss bank, is one of them. He says that because of the unique circumstances of German reunification and the consequent high level of German rates, Germany is no longer acting as the anchor of the system in the way intended when the mechanism was designed in the late 1970s. This was not apparent in October 1990 on Britain's ERM entry, he says. 'What is more I thought that German monetary policy would have been relaxed by now; and that there would have been some UK recovery. On purely practical grounds, it is time for a rethink,' he says. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at the London office of Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, says: 'The discussion (about a devaluation linked to ERM exit) is becoming more explicit. More people are listening to arguments that if Britain does not devalue then we won't see much growth over the next two years.' Mr John Shepperd, an economist at S G Warburg Securities, the London investment house, adds: 'Devaluation would be a policy of desperation. But at some stage it may be the only avenue available to the government.' Leaving the ERM would be a leap into the unknown. Nobody knows what would happen to sterling or interest rates. But as the implications of membership of the ERM are becoming increasingly well-known, so its unpopularity rises. Whether they like it or not, and particularly if further increases in interest rates are forced upon them, Mr Major and Mr Lamont may have to examine the alternatives.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Time to interfere THE TRAGEDY in Somalia raises a fundamental question, as pertinent to the plight of countries such as Zaire or Angola as it is to the fate of 7m Somalis. What responsibility does the west have for erstwhile client states in Africa, once courted for strategic reasons, but abandoned when the end of superpower rivalry made those considerations redundant? And when these regimes collapse, should humanitarian imperatives override national sovereignty and justify the intervention of the outside world, providing aid where and when it sees fit? The moral responsibility is clear. Africa's cold war legacy is the joint creation of the west and the former Soviet Union, whose rivalry many of the continent's leaders skilfully exploited. But the Soviet Union is no more. Only the west has the capacity to help Africa cope with the legacy, assisted by a United Nations now capable of playing a constructive role in world affairs. In the era when the Horn of Africa was one of the cockpits of superpower rivalry, Somalia was courted by both Moscow and Washington. A shared border with Ethiopia, itself a cold war battleground, and the need for access to the Somali port of Berbera, strategically located on the Red Sea, made Somalia's friendship worth buying with aid and arms. Those assets are worthless in the new world order. Past rivalry over Somalia has been replaced by near indifference. In the seven months since General Siad Barre abandoned the capital to competing factions, the country has descended into a state of anarchy from which recovery will be a forbidding task. Some 30,000 people have died. More than 1m Somalis have been displaced from their homes or have taken refuge in neighbouring countries. Aid officials estimate that more than two-thirds of the 7m population are threatened with starvation. while hundreds of children are dying daily. The arrival in Mogadishu last week of a 50-strong United Nations force to help monitor Somalia's fragile ceasefire is a welcome development. But it comes too late to avert catastrophe, and is too little to ensure a lasting peace. What more can be done? A good deal, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN's hard-pressed secretary-general. He accuses the western nations that dominate the Security Council of double standards in dwelling on 'the rich man's war' in the former Yugoslavia while largely ignoring the plight of Africa, and has proposed a significant extension of UN humanitarian and peacemaking efforts in Somalia. Nobody should underestimate the difficulties. Mr Boutros Ghali would be the first to admit that, with paymasters such as the US refusing to pay their share of the budget, the UN is impossibly overstretched by its existing commitments. What is more, intervention in Somalia is highly risky, with aid shipments vulnerable to violent interference from rival warlords in the capital. Yet there comes a point at which humanitarian needs eclipse other considerations. There are recent precedents, most obviously the UN's role in opening up Sarajevo airport as a conduit for relief supplies. A relatively modest operation in Mogadishu, properly guarded and backed with air cover, would probably save hundreds of thousands of lives. Better still, in the case of the other Somalias waiting to happen in Africa, would be timely diplomatic intervention to avert disaster.</p>

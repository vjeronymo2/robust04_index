			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / International Company News: Boardroom coup ousts president of ailing Sanyo MR SATOSHI Iue, president of Sanyo, the ailing Japanese electronics company and the closest Japanese business acquaintance of US President-elect Bill Clinton, yesterday fell victim to a rare boardroom coup. Mr Iue is to become the group's chairman responsible for supervising the group's overall business, while his successor as president, Mr Yasuaki Takano, will concentrate on implementing a wide-ranging restructuring programme at its main electronics businesses. Mr Iue formed a close relationship with the incoming US president after Sanyo became the first Japanese company to invest in Mr Clinton's state of Arkansas. The Clintons have stayed at Mr Iue's home when visiting Japan. On their most recent visit, Mr Iue guided them on a late-night tour of karaoke bars in Osaka. One measure of the scale of the crisis gripping Sanyo is the speed with which the senior management changes are taking place. Mr Iue will step down from the presidency on December 1. While Sanyo said he would act as a chief executive supervising all the group's businesses, the chairman's role is regarded as largely honorific in most companies. Sanyo said it would launch a restructuring programme next month to give more responsibility to each of its business sectors. The group has been hit by the downturn in consumer demand and a slump in its industrial equipment business. Analysts expect Sanyo to incur an operating loss of Y10bn (Dollars 81.3m) in the year to November, against operating profits of Y11.2bn a year earlier. It has introduced pay cuts of up to 20 per cent for executives and reduced bonuses for other staff. About 350 staff are being transferred from its Osaka head office to sales and marketing departments. Mr Iue is being replaced by Mr Yasuaki Takano, 61, Sanyo's vice president since 1986.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Except for a borrower's loan obligation discharged by the Secretary under the false certification discharge provision of paragraphs (e)(1)(ii) of this section, a loan qualifies for payment under this section only to the extent that the loan is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally enforceable under applicable law by the holder of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For purposes of this section_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The legal enforceability of a loan is conclusively determined on the basis of a ruling by a court or administrative tribunal of competent jurisdiction with respect to that loan, or a ruling with respect to another loan in a judgment that collaterally estops the holder from contesting the enforceability of the loan;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A loan is conclusively determined to be legally unenforceable to the extent that the guarantor determines, pursuant to an objection presented in a proceeding conducted in connection with credit bureau reporting, tax refund offset, wage garnishment, or in any other administrative proceeding, that the loan is not legally enforceable; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) If an objection has been raised by the borrower or another party about the legal enforceability of the loan and no determination has been made under paragraph (a)(4) (i) or (ii) of this section, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a claim under this section under conditions the Secretary considers appropriate. If the Secretary determines in that or any other case that a claim was paid under this section with respect to a loan that was not a legally enforceable obligation of the borrower, the recipient of that payment must refund that amount of the payment to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Death.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) If an individual borrower dies, or, on or after July 23, 1992 the student for whom a parent received a PLUS loan dies, the obligation of the borrower and any endorser to make any further payments on the loan is discharged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In determining that a borrower (or student) has died, the lender may rely on a death certificate or other proof of death that is acceptable under applicable state law. If a death certificate or other acceptable proof of death is not available, the borrower's obligation on the loan can be discharged only if the guaranty agency determines that other evidence establishes that the borrower (or student) has died.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) After receiving information indicating that the borrower (or student) has died, the lender, if it believes the information to be reliable, shall suspend any collection activity against the borrower and promptly request that the borrower's representative (or the student's parent in the case of a PLUS loan) provide the documentation described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. During the suspension of collection activity, which may not exceed 60 days, the lender shall diligently attempt to obtain documentation verifying the borrower's (or student's) death. If, despite diligent attempts, the lender is not able to confirm the borrower's (or student's) death within 60 days, the lender shall resume collection activity from the point that it had been discontinued and is deemed to have exercised forbearance as to repayment of the loan during the period when collection activity was suspended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, in </F> Bucharest, by Hayim Zissowitz -- live]    [Text] [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, we just spoke with a Gaza  Strip settler about the issue of jurisdiction, namely: Where  will Israelis who break the law in the autonomous areas be  tried? Can you tell us what, if anything, was concluded with  'Arafat on this issue?    [Peres] No, I am unable to tell you, because I would not  like to issue forecasts before we have seen the written and  signed documents.    [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position on this issue? Will  it insist that Israelis who violate the law in the autonomous  areas be tried in Israeli courts?    [Peres] The issue is more complicated than that. It depends  on where the crime is committed and on its nature. It is more  complicated than it sounds.    [Zissowitz] So it is not inconceivable that under certain  circumstances, an Israeli who breaks the law could be tried by a  Palestinian court?    [Peres] I do not want to get into this. I do not want to  comment on issues that have not yet been finalized in writing.    [Zissowitz] What about Arabs who carry out attacks...?    [Peres, interrupting] Look, I do not want to get into the  issue of jurisdiction, because at this very moment it is being  discussed, and any rash comment could harm the negotiations.    [Zissowitz] Before your departure, you said that the POW and  MIA issue will be at the top of your agenda. Did you discuss  this issue with 'Arafat yesterday?    [Peres] Certainly. It was the first issue discussed.  'Arafat reiterated what he termed his word of honor to Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. He reiterated his commitment to this  promise. To his and to our great regret, since that time he has  learned nothing new but rather encountered great difficulties.  He will indeed continue to deal with this issue.    [Zissowitz] Zekharya Baumel's father Yona, who is known to  be a cautious man, said 'Arafat knows more about the MIA's than  he is willing to divulge in public. Is this your impression,  too?    [Peres] No, I am not sure this is true. I am not sure he  knows much more than he told the prime minister.    [Zissowitz] Will Israel be willing to consider the demand of  the MIA's parents to delay the release of the Palestinian  prisoners until more is known about the fate of the Israeli  MIA's?    [Peres] Look, if we knew it was a matter of exerting  pressure to obtain more information, we would not have hesitated  to do so. We would have to be convinced, however, that such  information can indeed be obtained only by exerting pressure. I  am not convinced this is the case.    [Zissowitz] I assume that Yasir 'Arafat raised the demand to  continue with the release of Palestinian prisoners, including  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] prisoners. Is this true?    [Peres] The issue was not presented in such a firm way. The  Palestinians claim that Yasir 'Arafat is the leader of the  entire Palestinian people and, as such, cannot discriminate  between prisoners. I told him that we, too, are the  representatives of all the Israelis, but an Israeli who is in  prison is in prison. The fact that we are the representatives  of all the Israelis does not mean that those who are in prison  should be released.    [Zissowitz] What is Israel's position regarding the release  of Hamas members? Will Israel insist...?    [Peres, interrupting] Our position is that people who say  that they oppose the agreement and intend to continue carrying  out terror acts should not be released. This is a very clear  position.    [Zissowitz] Are there any circumstances under which Israel  would agree to release Hamas members?    [Peres] Look, I do not want to get into the negotiations  over the radio. These are issues that must be examined. Our  basic position, however, is that people who are committed to the  path of terrorism will not be released.    [Zissowitz] Are you implying that some kind of Hamas  commitment to end terrorism could change Israel's position?    [Peres] Not a commitment, but if they actually change their  behavior, this would be a different matter. Should Hamas  declare that it no longer deals in terrorism and that it  supports the agreement, this would constitute a new situation,  but I do not believe we have reached this. I think the report  that came from Jordan is aimed at creating a political  smokescreen.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 21 April  carries  a recorded telephone interview with Foreign Minister Peres by  Ya'el Dan, conducted on 21 April. Asked about reports on future  cooperation between the PLO and Hamas, Peres answers: "To the  best of my knowledge, such cooperation is not on the agenda.  Apparently a dialogue is being maintained on a local basis, but  there is no talk of formal and comprehensive cooperation between  the two organizations."]    [Zissowitz] Is there any basis to Nabil Sha'th's statement  yesterday regarding progress on the prisoners issue? Sha'th  also said Major General Shahaq returned to Cairo with  encouraging news from the Palestinians' point of view.    [Peres] I think there is a basis to this statement, but I  must say that the mood in Bucharest is more reserved. I sat  with 'Arafat for many hours, until late into the night. We had  to overcome quite a few unjustifiable misunderstandings and  doubts. There is still some gap between the mood in Cairo and  that in Bucharest, and we still have to check why this is so. I  sincerely hope this stems from not being updated on the latest  news, or perhaps from an incorrect interpretation of this news.    [Zissowitz] You said you found 'Arafat troubled. What is he  worried about?    [Peres] He is concerned about what he terms the slow  progress in the negotiations. I emphasized that Israel is not  the side responsible for slowing down the rate of progress. I  told him that even if we conclude the negotiations at the  beginning of May, the overall delay in the negotiations will not  amount to more than 20 days.    [Zissowitz] Did he ask for any Israeli gestures to  strengthen his position?    [Peres] He did not ask for gestures, but he does have more  demands.    [Zissowitz] Such as?    [Peres] I do not want to go into this, because I am in the  midst of the talks and am unwilling to hold public negotiations.    [Zissowitz] Mr. Peres, are there any difficulties that were  not overcome in the meeting with 'Arafat and which could delay  the completion of the negotiations?    [Peres] There are difficulties that still have to be  overcome, but I believe this can be done.    [Zissowitz] Can you tell us what these difficulties are?    [Peres] We have still not finalized the issues of airspace  and territorial waters. The issue of jurisdiction has still not  been wrapped up and signed. There is still the issue of the  council and its powers and the registration of Gaza Strip  residents. As you know, the residents of Judaea and Samaria, as  opposed to those of the Gaza Strip, possess Jordanian passports.  These are issues that still must be dealt with seriously.    [Zissowitz] Nabil Sha'th said that the Cairo talks will be  concluded next week and that after that, all that will remain is  to prepare for the signing ceremony. Do you share his optimism?    [Peres] I share his hope, and I think it is possible. It is  still only a hope, however, and I am convinced that we, for our  part, and I believe the Palestinians, too, will exert supreme  efforts to reach the stage of an honorable conclusion, which  will actually be a new beginning.    [Zissowitz] Are you scheduled to hold more meetings today,  other than with 'Arafat?    [Peres] Yes, this morning we will meet with 'Arafat again.  We will also meet with the president of Romania, and another  three or four meetings are planned as well.</p>

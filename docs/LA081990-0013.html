			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: DOGFIGHT?  </P> <P> Though George Lucas recently staked his claim to the story of the Tuskegee  Airmen -- a much-decorated World War II black fighter squadron -- he may have  some competition.  </P> <P> Bob Williams, a veteran of both show business and the corporate world who flew  50 missions for the Tuskegee group, has been working since 1952 to bring the  story to the screen. His version is now in development at Columbia Pictures.  Like Lucas' "Red Tails," it is budgeted in the $25-$30 million range and  expects to have a shooting script within two weeks.  </P> <P> Columbia chairman Frank Price has been personally involved with the Tuskegee  project since the mid-'80s, when he headed Universal. Though he has yet to  greenlight the picture, he said through a spokesman that Lucas' announcement  will have no impact on his plans.  </P> <P> Lucas has enlisted the support of the Tuskegee Airmen Inc., whose scholarship  fund stands to benefit from the film. Williams said he bypassed the group  because he has no interest in "making a film by committee." Moreover, claims  Williams, his project has several things in its favor: the involvement of Price  (whom he calls "one of the best story and business minds in the industry"); the  fact that it was written "by someone who was there," and his approach, which  will be more "socially significant" than the action-adventure angle Lucas has  described.  </P> <P> Bill Melton, historian for the Tuskegee Airmen, has doubts that there's room  for two such films in the marketplace. But, he adds, no one in his camp is  losing any sleep. "George Lucas' stature is so enormous that no one else has a  chance," he says. "If anyone tried to take him on, it would be like fighting a  battleship with a wooden sword." Lucas was out of town and unavailable for  comment. Elaine Dutka  </P></p>

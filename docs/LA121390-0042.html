			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 2 FOES OF SCHOOL TEXTS RUN FOR REDONDO BEACH BOARD  </P> <P> Two members of a conservative Christian group that tried unsuccessfully to ban  a series of textbooks in Redondo Beach have launched campaigns for open seats  on the city's elementary school board.  </P> <P> Pat Safani and Melinda Stone, two homemakers making their first bid for public  office, will join local chiropractor Donna Carrico and incumbent Trustees  Sylvia Zellers, Valerie Dombrowski and Bart Swanson in a six-way race for the  three contested seats in the March 5 election.  </P> <P> "I think we need at least a mixture of thought on the board," said Stone, a  36-year-old mother of two who tried earlier this year to persuade the board to  shelve the Impressions series of grade school readers. "I felt the school board  would not listen to us."  </P> <P> School board members said this week that they are not surprised at the  challenge, but said the job, especially now, during merger talks among the  beach city schools, requires trustees with a broad perspective on school and  community issues.  </P> <P> At the time of the protest early this year, Stone, Safani and other members of  the Coalition of Concerned Parents -- a group of about 100 mostly conservative  Christian residents -- had pointed to stories and poems about monsters and  witches to buttress their arguments that the Impressions readers were  frightening and anti-Christian and should be shelved.  </P> <P> The school board rejected their demands in February, noting that any parent who  wanted to could choose an alternative text as a matter of district policy.  Moreover, the trustees added, the readers had been chosen after an exhaustive  review process and had been the board's unanimous choice because of their  emphasis on cultural diversity, imagination and literature.  </P> <P> Angry members of the group vowed at the time to unseat the board incumbents,  but as late as a week before the filing deadline, no challengers had emerged.  </P> <P> Safani, 37, a parent and volunteer classroom aide, said she jumped into the  race at the last minute at the behest of Stan Groman, another coalition member.  </P> <P> "I personally was interested in seeing somebody run," Groman said, adding that  he called Safani after he learned that the board incumbents might run  unopposed. Although he did not know Safani personally, he said, he remembered  her as one of several parents who had talked about mounting a political  challenge to the board in the wake of the Impressions defeat.  </P> <P> Safani said that after Groman's call, "I asked myself, 'Why not?' "  </P> <P> Two-term incumbent Zellers said she was not surprised that the Impressions  incident prompted a political challenge.  </P> <P> "But I have a problem with any person running on a single issue for school  board, no matter what the issue is," she said. "There are so many areas you  have to be concerned with as a school board member."  </P> <P> Zellers and other board members said trustees need to be familiar with, among  other things, state funding mechanisms and bureaucracy, and labor relations, as  well as with what goes on in the classroom.  </P> <P> Safani and Stone said, however, that their concerns go beyond textbooks.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned, for instance, about the way they teach AIDS," Stone said. "I'm  of the opinion there should be a strong push toward abstinence, and (classroom  discussions on the epidemic) should start at the middle school level, not in  elementary school."  </P> <P> Safani added that, as an aide, she is concerned about class sizes.  </P> <P> "The teachers seem very frustrated and burned out," she said.  </P> <P> Carrico, 40, a chiropractor who moved to the district from Manhattan Beach in  April, said she decided to run for school board as a means of "getting more  involved in the community."  </P> <P> Although she has two school-age children, neither of them has ever attended  public school in Redondo Beach, she said. Her elder daughter attended private  schools and was taught at home by Carrico until she was ready to attend Redondo  Union High School, and her first-grader is enrolled at Riviera Hall, a private  Lutheran School in Redondo Beach, she said.  </P> <P> But, Carrico added, she has long been interested in education, and once  considered a teaching career.  </P> <P> "I see what's going on in the education system, and I see a lot of problems,"  she said. "This is just something I've always had on my agenda."  </P> <P> None of the challengers felt ready to comment on the unification issue, a  complex debate over whether the beach city schools should consolidate, to save  money and improve efficiency.  </P> <P> All of the incumbents, however, said unification is a primary reason why they  chose to run again.  </P> <P> "I'd really like to see this unification thing through," said Swanson, the  president of the elementary board. "We're right in the middle of it now, and  it's going to take some time to get all the districts together."  </P> <P> Dombrowski, a board member since 1979, said: "I've been through three of these  (unification debates) now."  </P></p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Lautro may limit penalties for early ending of policies LIFE assurance companies could face limits on the charges they pass on to customers who terminate policies before maturity, under measures proposed by a consultant to Lautro, the industry's self-regulatory body. The proposals could require companies to make significant changes to the system of paying sales agents. The current system allows commissions to be paid 'up-front' as soon as the policy is signed. It could also address one of the most persistent complaints about the life assurance industry - the small percentage of premiums which are refunded to those who cancel policies early. Those who cancel within the first two years of the policy may lose up to 100 per cent of premiums paid. A recent study by the Securities and Investments Board found that between a quarter and a third of all policies are cancelled within the first two years. The proposals are contained in an expository paper written by Mr Marshall Field, a consulting actuary for Bacon and Woodrow, who has been asked by Lautro to review the industry's commissions structure. Lautro will decide later this year whether new regulations on commisssions are necessary. In the paper, Mr Field argues that the industry practice of charging all the sales commission to the cancelling policyholder may be unfair and unwise. Companies would have more incentive to prevent mis-selling - the sale of policies to those for whom they are inappropriate - if they had to bear more of the costs themselves. The case against charging sales costs to those who end their policies early becomes even greater in the case of those who were mis-sold policies and are being charged for the mischance. He proposes that sales costs be passed on in the product design. Thus, the life fund might be charged with a fixed - and publicly disclosed - amount each month to cover the sales costs both for policies which last until maturity and those which do not. Should more policyholders maintain their contracts until maturity, the life fund would earn additional profits.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Japan Yesterday's 8 per cent fall in the price of NTT was only the latest chapter in a sorry tale. From a high of more than Y3m, the shares in Japan's domestic telephone company have fallen to just over Y500,000, leaving institutions and individuals stranded. With NTT the most widely held share in Japan, further declines are bound to have an impact in confidence and delay the return of investors to the market. However, the reasons for the latest fall are largely technical. Speculators had earlier bought stock hoping that foreigners would follow when ownership restrictions were eased this week. That did not happen, and the traders were forced to sell. Institutions have also been discreetly realising losses in NTT while they can be offset against gains in the government bond market. Where NTT has fallen, the rest of the market need not follow. That said, there are still reasons for concern. As the Nikkei falls towards 15,000, the health of the financial system is once again in question. Particular attention is focused on real estate companies and trust and credit banks. The ministry of finance is resisting arguments which would help the banks that the government should support land prices by acting as a buyer of last resort. By contrast, manufacturing earnings may be approaching their nadir, and further share price falls among these companies should be limited. If that gives succour to investors, the danger to the banks should not be forgotten. It is still too soon to call the bottom.</p>

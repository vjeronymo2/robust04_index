			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Zhdankin under the heading "Weapons": </F> "Mustard Gas Bubbles"]    [Text] ROSSIYA (No 50, 1993) previously published an  article by scientist Lev Fedorov entitled "The Chemical Death  Complex." Last week the Duma held special hearings devoted to  the problem of chemical weapons destruction.    In Paris on 13 January 1993 Russia signed a convention  banning the development, production, stockpiling and use of  chemical weapons, and requiring their destruction. Now our  legislators must approve a program in keeping with these aims  and ratify the convention. According to the document, we (along  with everyone else) must destroy our chemical weapons stockpiles  by the year 2005.    By Russian presidential decree the Russian Federation  Presidential Committee on Convention-Related Chemical and  Biological Weapons Issues was established in 1992 to oversee all  efforts on these issues. It is headed by an academician, Lt.  Gen. A. Kuntsevich, who has spent his whole professional life  forging our Motherland's "chemical shield." The committee  prepared a program and submitted it for consideration by the  prematurely dissolved Supreme Soviet. The parliament cut the  program to shreds.    The negative aspects of that program have been carried over  virtually unchanged to the "revised" program. Just two examples.  Firstly, no provision is made for environmental impact  assessment by the Ministry of Environmental Protection and  Natural Resources (even though the most horrible toxins are  involved). Secondly, there is clear testimony to the motives and  priorities of those who designed the program: 90 percent of all  hard currency funding ($494 million) are requested for "measures  to provide national and international monitoring," i.e. they  will be used for trips by official experts, including honoraria,  per diems and other customary expenses. The level of  compensation is the same as in the U.N.: $400 per person per day.    There are a million problems involved in the laudable goal  of  bidding farewell to our chemical military past. What quantity of  chemical weapons have we actually accumulated, if we count not  just those that are stockpiled, but also those that have been  dumped at sea or buried? Where are they located? How much  concealed contamination threatens the health of human beings and  the environment in those places? Is the technology for  destroying these weapons safe enough? Every general question  raises tens and hundreds of more specific ones.    Convention committee chairman A. Kuntsevich and the deputy  chief of chemical weapons forces, Maj. Gen. Yu. Tarasevich,  familiarized the deputies with the official program for chemical  weapons destruction. The generals reported that we have  stockpiles of 40,000 metric tons (net weight) of chemical agents  safely stored at seven sites. The destruction technology is  wonderful and safe. The program is fine in every way and should  be approved with only one amendment -- making its funding a  separate budget item.    All apparently outstanding, but what is one to make of  published reports that our "wealth" in this area is many times  larger than the official figures? What about chemical weapons  that were dumped at sea? According to doctor of chemical  sciences L. Fedorov (see the aforementioned article) large-scale  dumping was carried out in at least 12 major areas of the Baltic  Sea, White Sea, Barents Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. The generals  claim not to be aware of any such thing, and even if they had  heard something no documents pertaining to the matter have been  found. A. Kuntsevich went so far as to report: "The Baltic  states are not interested in the issue of chemical weapons  dumped in the Baltic Sea." The general/academician termed other  similar issues "soap bubbles."    Much was said about public monitoring. Yet the Ministry of  Environmental Protection's representative, a doctor of sciences  with highest-level access, was not admitted to a theoretical and  applied conference on chemical agent destruction held in  long-suffering Chapayevsk. On two occasions the ministry  proposed that the committee add a section on environmental  safety to the conference, but all in vain.    Generally speaking, hearings were held, and they went quite  smoothly. Except for the speech by Vil Mirzayanov. That  scientist's questions went unanswered. According to his data, we  have manufactured approximately 400,000 metric tons of chemical  weapons. What happened to the rest? How much will it actually  cost to destroy even 40,000 metric tons? For example, the  Americans' "known" stockpile is 35,000 tons (a credible figure).  Getting rid of these weapons will cost approximately $15  billion. Our picture of military chemical "socialist realism" is  far from complete. We do not even have a technical or financial  assessment of chemical agent destruction yet.    The chemical branch of the military-industrial complex  clearly should cease to exist due to the fact that it is no  longer necessary. But no one wants to give up their positions,  titles or easy living, and therefore they must now replace  chemical agent production with chemical agent destruction,  thereby safeguarding their own interests. That is why the  adoption of an unfinished program is being promoted so actively.  The pressure is tremendous. Parliament is one of the last  obstacles between the military chemical lobby and its access to  a bright future of U.N. comfort standards. But what about the  safety of our fellow citizens and the fouled forests and rivers?  These have never been taken into consideration.    Judging by the hearings, parliament is not a very difficult  obstacle, and it will soon be overcome. But I would very much  like to be proved wrong.</p>

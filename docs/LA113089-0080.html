			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> PEREZ DASHES TO STATE TITLE  </P> <P> It took Oscar Perez three journeys to Fresno, but he finally got the state  cross-country championship he longed for since his sophomore year at Pater  Noster High.  </P> <P> Perez, a senior who finished second in the state in 1988, held off a final  surge by El Cajon Christian junior David Soto to win the Division III  individual state title last weekend at Woodward Park in Fresno.  </P> <P> Perez led Pater Noster to a seventh-place finish in the Division III race.  </P> <P> Hanging in: Franklin High, the only Glendale-area team still competing in the  football playoffs, will meet Gardena in a City Section Northern Conference  quarterfinal game Friday night at Wilson High.  </P> <P> The key to victory for Franklin?  </P> <P> "Our quarterback has to play," Coach Armando Gonzalez said.  </P> <P> Panther quarterback Santiago Alvarez completed 20 of 30 attempts for 208 yards  and a touchdown during Franklin's 27-3 victory over Huntington Park last week.  </P> <P> Alvarez, however, left the game in the third quarter with a hyper-extended  knee.  </P> <P> Alvarez has passed for 3,260 yards and 46 touchdowns this season.  </P> <P> Franklin defeated Gardena, 34-6, earlier this season in what Gonzales described  as his team's best game of the year.  </P> <P> Over and out: Marshall High's football season came to an end with a 28-6 loss  to unbeaten Venice in a City Section Northern Conference playoff game at  Venice.  </P> <P> The Barristers finished 5-6 in a season highlighted by outstanding performances  by quarterback Carlos Gutierrez and wide receiver Miguel Osorio.  </P> <P> Gutierrez, a senior, had the unenviable task of replacing Sid Oxford, last  season's City Section passing leader. Gutierrez, however, surpassed Oxford  (1,470 yards) with 1,635 yards and 22 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Osorio, also a senior, had 42 receptions for 748 yards and 13 touchdowns.  </P></p>

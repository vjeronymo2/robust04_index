			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Brazilian unions threaten strikes Union leaders in Brazil's biggest industrial state, Sao Paulo, are threatening one-day strikes in protest against economic measures announced on Monday by Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the finance minister. Unions claim the measures, designed to pave the way for adoption of a new currency, will reduce workers' spending power. Metalworkers in Sao Paulo are due to strike today and union leaders are expected to meet next week to consider further action. They are worried that under Mr Cardoso's plan salaries are being compulsorily switched into a new accounting unit, the URV (real unit of value), while prices remain free to increase in the local currency, the cruzeiro real. Business leaders say the strikes are unlikely to be widespread, especially once workers realise the new unit will lead to stable salaries. 'There is no atmosphere for a strike in the country at the moment,' according to Mr Wilson Brumer, president of Acesita, a specialist steel company. Reaction to Mr Cardoso's announcement was generally positive, although several analysts foresee considerable political pressure to increase spending ahead of October's elections. Inflation is not expected to fall significantly before the package's next stage, the full adoption of a new currency, likely in May. Mr Pierre-Alain de Smedt, president of Autolatina, the holding company for Volkswagen and Ford's combined operations, said it remained too early to assess the plan in detail. 'But what is very positive is that the government has been extremely consistent and transparent in putting it forward,' he said. Autolatina plans to start pricing its cars in URVs. The government hopes the private sector will all switch to the new unit. It is partly designed to replace a number of different indices already in use which measure price rises, thus fuelling inflationary expectations.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / S Korean cabinet in firing line South Korean President Kim Young-sam will decide this week whether to carry out a cabinet reshuffle following the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Lee Hoi-chang on Friday. Mr Lee Yung-dug, minister for unification, is expected to receive parliamentary approval today as the new prime minister in spite of being rejected by the main opposition Democratic party. Prime Minister Lee, who had earlier led the government's anti-corruption campaign, resigned after only four months in office in a dispute over his authority under Korea's presidential system. The search for a new unification minister could trigger a general reshuffle of the government's senior foreign affairs officials, who have been criticised for pursuing an inconsistent policy on the North Korean nuclear issue. The wavering on North Korea reflects disagreement over whether Seoul should adopt a conciliatory policy toward Pyongyang or pursue a hardline stance. The president of the state-controlled Korea Exchange Bank, listed on the Seoul bourse early this month, resigned at the weekend after the bank was accused of tampering with its bidding price for shares in Korea Telecom that were auctioned last week.</p>

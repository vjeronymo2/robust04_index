			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H8>   Defense Minister's Actions -- The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL  &amp;  GUARDIAN in English uses its editorial on page 30 of its 17-23  June issue to draw conclusions from Defense Minister Joe  Modise's recent attempts to interdict a WEEKLY MAIL report. The  first conclusion is that military intelligence "is riddled with  some of the country's most unsavoury characters" and that change  in the military must start with "the exposure of their past so  that these operations can be cleaned up and put on a new  footing." A second conclusion is that Modise "is going to have  to assert his civilian authority and end his reliance on advice  and information from the defence force chiefs." The editorial  also notes that the episode shows the danger that some  politicians and members of the new government may be subject to  pressure from the military, which has been collecting "dirt" on  them for many years. "This provides a strong argument for a  Truth Commission that forces into the open any information which  may compromise individuals and institutions." The editorial  concludes with the argument that "these events should make us  less complacent about allowing old censorship laws to remain on  the statute books.... Reform of these laws is a matter of  urgency."  <H8>  NEW NATION </H8>   Steyn Report on Intelligence Activities -- "An intriguing  and  worrying web of secrecy is being spun around the investigation  conducted by General Pierre Steyn into the activities of the  SADF's [South African Defense Force] military intelligence arm,  the Directorate of Covert Collection." So begins an editorial  on page 8 of Johannesburg NEW NATION in English on 17 June. The  editorial says it does not understand why the whereabouts of the  report should be kept secret. "This week it was almost  impossible to establish for sure whether in fact a written  report exists at all. Former president FW de Klerk's office  tells us it certainly does not exist. It was an internal  investigation that did not warrant a written report, he said."  The editorial goes on to note that "it is almost 18 months  since General Steyn completed his investigations. And there has  yet been no finding one way or another on the contents of the  report. Neither the police nor the Attorney-General has  commented on its contents -- whether it contained baseless  allegations or whether it added weight to suspicions about third  force violence....It is about time we are told where  investigations are -- whether they have ceased or whether they  are still continuing. Without openness and transparency in  matters such as these, there can be no basis for reconciliation."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   New Homeland Council -- An editorial in the Johannesburg  BUSINESS DAY in English on page 10 on 17 May considers the  establishment of a homeland council: "The establishment of a  Volksstaatraad [homeland council] and the presence of First  Deputy President Thabo Mbeki as a speaker at its inauguration in  Pretoria's Ou Radsaal yesterday were an encouraging sign that  South Africans are beginning to come to terms with their  diversity....The ANC, in going along with the Volkstaat council  idea, might be stalling for time in the hope that fears and  prejudices will abate as the country prospers. Mbeki played his  part yesterday in a generous acknowledgement of Afrikaners'  patriotism. Such conciliatory gestures could bear fruit while  the council searches for a formula to provide some sort of  Afrikaner autonomy that would not compromise the integrity of  the South African state."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   16 June Holiday -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English in an  editorial on page 10 on 17 June argues that "June 16, 1976,  taking everything into account, should be a public  holiday....The sad truth is that whether you were the oppressor  or the oppressed, this day affected all of us in the same  drama-filled fashion. Its effects will also not disappear  because they are part of South Africa's history." The editorial  concludes by saying that although the current period of  transition may not be the right one in which to declare the day  a holiday, "any incumbent regime must be convinced that June 16,  1976, was a turning point in the history of South Africa"    Fuel Price Increase -- "The remarkable thing about this  week's petrol price increase is the equanimity with which it has  been accepted by all," begins another editorial on the same page  of the SOWETAN. "The question remains: Who is taking up the  cudgels on behalf of the working people and consumers who will  bear the brunt of the increase?"  <H8>  BEELD </H8>   Mandela's OAU Speech Praised -- A "new voice...on behalf of  Africa" is how the editorial on page 8 of Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 15 June sums up President Mandela's recent speech  at the Organization of African Unity summit in Tunis. "It is a  voice that puts forward Africa's case to the world, but also one  that castigates and speaks candidly about the continent's  glaring offenses and shortcomings." It is a long time, says  BEELD, since someone directed such a frank address to the  continent as when Mandela said there is nothing wrong with the  people of Africa, but with its their leaders. "In Mr. Mandela,  Africa has a leader with stature, one who is governing the  country with a potential for success. This new situation could  indeed become the catalyst to reverse Africa's image as a  marginalized continent which risks being written off." South  Africa, therefore, will have to prove that it will not end up  the same way as so many African countries have. "To set that  example to Africa presents an exceptional opportunity to every  South African."    Right-Wing Politics -- Another editorial on the same page of  the paper notes: "The latest dispute between the Freedom Front  and the Conservative Party [CP] over the manner of negotiations  for an Afrikaner homeland [volkstaat] comes as no surprise.  The agreement before the election on establishing a volkstaat  council -- entrenched in the Constitution -- has been one of the  most significant breakthroughs which made the participation of  the Freedom Front in the election and in the constituent  assembly possible. On that basis the majority of right wingers  rejected the CP and voted for the Freedom Front, giving General  Constand Viljoen a mandate to bargain for a volkstaat through a  volkstaat council. Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg and the non-democratic  diehards again want to hijack the negotiation process -- spurred  on by the unfortunate kiss of life given to them by President  Nelson Mandela....The rejected CP leaders should not be allowed  to hijack the negotiation process for their own racist,  political gain."    PWV Premier Praised -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans  publishes an editorial on page on 14 June that says: "Since  becoming premier of the Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging  [PWV] province six weeks ago, Mr. Tokyo Sexwale has not made one  wrong step. He has not been put off by the fact that his  government has no budget and fundamental executive powers.  Especially impressive was his action last week at Modderbee  Prison when he went in alone to negotiate with the rioting  prisoners.... During the past weekend Mr. Sexwale, in shirt  sleeves and no tie, paid a second visit to the violence ravaged  East Rand residential area. He is on the right track; he must  keep it up."</p>

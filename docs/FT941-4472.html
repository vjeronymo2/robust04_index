			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / EU compensation 'unfair' Compensation awards for similar types of personal injury typically vary by 600 per cent across Europe, according to a report by Davies Arnold Cooper, a leading firm of City solicitors. A review of award levels in 13 EU countries (including Scotland) and seven EFTA countries showed anomalies which were 'hugely unfair to European citizens and businesses', said Mr David McIntosh, a senior partner at the firm. Irish courts generally made the biggest awards, while courts in Greece, Portugal, Spain, Norway and Denmark were less generous. Non-economic awards - for bereavement or pain and suffering - varied from nothing to Pounds 250,000, with the higher rates awarded in predominantly Catholic countries, the report said. Mr McIntosh urged Brussels to launch a formal inquiry into the problem and urged the introduction of Europe-wide guidelines on compensation levels.</p>

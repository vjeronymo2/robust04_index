The president said this in reference to the existence in  Honduras of the U.S. military base at Palmerola in the central  Department of Comayagua, approximately 80 km from Tegucigalpa.    The air force base was installed at the beginning of the  eighties and was used by the United States to support the  Nicaraguan contras who were fighting against the Sandinist  government and the Salvadoran Government which was fighting  against the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.    At present the U.S. Government is still conducting  operations  at the base with 1,200 troops, and the base also houses the  Honduran Military Aviation Academy.    Reina Idiaquez said he is examining the existence of the  Palmerola base from "another context" and hinted that he would  like the antinarcotics forces to be more active.    Honduras has proposed to Washington that it convert  Palmerola  into the Central American headquarters of the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Agency (DEA). The United States already has two  radars with which it monitors the flights and boats of South  American drug traffickers who take advantage of the extensive  aerial and maritime space of the Honduran Atlantic.    The Honduran president made the comment after a meeting  today  at the Government House with activists from the ruling Liberal  Party when one of the participants asked him why he does not  charge for the presence of foreign troops and use the money to  amortize Honduras' foreign debt.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Gas wary ahead of meeting There was a sudden rush of nervous covering in British Gas shares, which delivered one of the best performances of the FT-SE 100 constituents ahead of today's crucial strategy meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre at Westminster. Analysts described today's meeting, which runs from 8.30am to noon and will be attended by analysts and fund managers from across the globe, as possibly the most important since the group was privatised in 1986. Dealers said British Gas shares have risen strongly in recent sessions and especially yesterday as some institutions underweight in the stock moved into the market to try to reach level weightings ahead of the meeting. 'It has been quite clear for some time that Gas will set out a progressive dividend policy at the meeting, as well as outline the way ahead for the company after break-up forced on it by the authorities,' commented one specialist. At the close British Gas was 9 1/2 higher at 299 1/2 p after turnover of 5.8m shares.</p>

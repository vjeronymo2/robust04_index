			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Row over cereal prices threatens CAP reforms SHARP differences between the European Commission and the current Portuguese presidency of the European Community last night cast a new shadow over Brussels' well-advanced plans to reform the Common Agricultural Policy. The presidency, in its fourth attempt to to reach a compromise on the reform, wants to limit the cut in subsidised cereals prices to 27 per cent over three years. This compares with the 35 per cent reduction called for in the original proposals of Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, and the 30 per cent compromise suggested by Portugal last month. Further slippage in planned cuts on cereals subsidies increases the risks of failure of the Uruguay Round of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. EC wheat exports are the main obstacle to a Gatt agreement, which would liberalise large new sectors of world trade. The US will not move from its demand that the EC not only cut farm subsidies by 36 per cent over five years, but cut the volume of subsidised produce it exports by 24 per cent. The community is prepared to offer a 20 per cent cut in volume - a difference of about 3m tonnes of wheat, the most politically volatile commodity left to stabilise. However, the cereals chapter is the centrepiece of the CAP reform, and Brussels believes too much fiddling with it could unravel the package as a whole, and nullify its effects in the arable sector, where high productivity growth would create new EC budgetary problems and trade frictions. 'The reduction in the price of cereals (proposed by the EC presidency) is not near what we regard as necessary,' a senior commission official said yesterday. 'We have to distance ourselves from the commission's original proposals in order to get a consensus among the member states,' a spokesman for the presidency countered. The failure of last week's EC-US summit to achieve a breakthrough on the Uruguay Round also means that some EC member states will try to slow-pedal on CAP reform, arguing that the commission's plans risk going beyond what Gatt will require of the EC farm sector. As a three-day farm council began in Brussels yesterday, these uncertainties made it most unlikely that any agreement would be possible before June at the earliest.</p>

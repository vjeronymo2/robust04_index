			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Buying shares can save you money - Third in a series on the true costs of investing The fledgling investor might find some stockbrokers' charges a bit on the high side. In practice, though, direct investment in shares can be cheaper than putting your money into a pension plan or endowment policy. The bad news, however, is that changes in the way the stock exchange does business could push up those costs. Rolling settlement starts in July, after which all deals must be settled within 10 working days. This is due to be followed next year by a five-day settlement timetable. And, at some indeterminate date, comes the new Crest electronic settlement system. But City brains are still trying to work out how these changes can be brought in without scaring off that hero of the 1980s, the popular capitalist. Dealing costs The first thing for which you should look out when using a share-dealing service is a joining fee. This could be Pounds 5 or Pounds 10 or more and is generally a one-off charge. The next, and more significant, charge is the actual cost of buying and selling. In most cases, this is based on a percentage of the value of the deal, usually on a sliding scale - for example, 1.5 per cent on the first Pounds 2,500, 0.75 per cent on the next Pounds 2,500, and 0.1 per cent on anything else. These percentage rates can vary significantly from one broker to another and the best-value broker for a Pounds 2,000 deal might not be so competitive on Pounds 10,000. A recent survey among readers of Investors Chronicle magazine revealed that they were likely to use several different brokers, depending on the size of the transaction. But there is a snag with very small deals: the minimum charge. This can make selling small parcels of, say, privatisation shares very expensive: a minimum charge of Pounds 40 on a deal of Pounds 1,000 works out at a hefty 4 per cent. Fortunately, there are services which have a minimum as low as Pounds 9. As a general rule, cheaper dealing costs can be found from the new generation of dealing-only (or execution-only) brokers. With these, however, you get no advice on which shares to buy and sell. That is left to you. Extra charges There are two costs which cannot be avoided wherever you go. First is stamp duty of 0.5 per cent on purchases. Second, there is the PTM (Panel on Takeovers and Mergers) levy, a flat Pounds 2 on deals of Pounds 10,000 or more. Assume brokerage is 1.5 per cent on both purchases and sales, and the spread (see below) is around 1 per cent. The total cost of your investment, including the stamp duty, is around 4.5 per cent - without any extras. (Note, though, that there is no stamp duty or buying commission on newly-issued shares.) Some brokers add extra fees for each deal, ranging from Pounds 1 to Pounds 20 or more. No matter what they are called - whether compliance charges, contract charges or administration charges - it is money you must pay. The spread If there is one vaguely hidden cost of share dealing, it is the spread - the difference between the buying and selling price of shares. Basically, this is the charge you pay to the market-maker through whom your broker buys or sells your shares. If the price quoted in the FT when you sell shares is the same as when you bought them, you would actually make a loss. This figure is the mid-market price: buyers pay more, sellers get less. The key point to remember is that some shares are more expensive than others. The highly-traded shares of big FT-SE companies have much narrower spreads than their smaller brethren. The best way to measure the spread is to look at the 'touch' - the difference between the lowest buying price and highest selling price from different market-makers. Last Monday, British Telecommunications was trading at 385p-387p - a difference of a little over 0.5 per cent. Marks and Spencer, on 425p-427p, was a shade under 0.5 per cent. But Who's Who publisher A. &amp; S. Black, on 320p-340p, had a difference of 6 per cent. And convenience food store Cullens traded at 12p-13.5p, a difference of 12 per cent. Some brokers point out that they negotiate prices with the market-maker, whereas cheaper execution brokers may simply deal at the prices they see on their computer screens. Management costs People who want their broker to act as investment manager will, inevitably, have to pay for the service. Typically, there will be an annual fee, based on the value of your portfolio, in the region of 0.5 per cent to 1.5 per cent. There might be a sliding percentage scale, with the rate falling on the top tiers of the portfolio. There could also be minimum and maximum charges. Alternatively, there may be fixed fees. The broker might have two fee scales, depending on whether he has total discretion to buy and sell or whether you must be consulted first. Anyone considering a portfolio management service should get a breakdown of all the fees and find out if these are in addition to normal dealing charges. The future Rolling settlement and Crest are the main developments aimed at streamlining the way the stock exchange does business. But what could make the system more efficient for institutional investors might be less attractive to private ones. Crest is likely to eliminate most share certificates, although private investors can have these if they want. Even before Crest, though, five-day rolling settlement could make it difficult for certificate holders to settle in time, so investors will be offered the chance of a longer settlement period. Thus, a two-tier market is likely to develop. If you want share certificates and a longer settlement time, you are likely to pay more for the privilege. There is a fear, though, that even those who join fully in the new system could be faced with a higher bill. This is because investors are, almost certainly, going to have to hold shares in a nominee account. The nominee system is well established and cuts down delays in settling. There is no need to send certificates and stock transfer forms through the post. Some brokers make no charge for a nominee account; others may levy Pounds 10 or Pounds 20 a year for each holding, or perhaps a flat annual fee of Pounds 100. Nominee costs will become a new factor in deciding which broker's charges are most suited to how you invest in shares. Another will be the increased use of deposit accounts, to which a broker has access, to pay for deals. But investors will need to make sure such an account pays a competitive rate of interest. An uncompetitive rate would, effectively, be a hidden cost of using the broker.  ----------------------------------- COST CHECK  ----------------------------------- Service charge                  Cost  ----------------------------------- Joining fee                      ...

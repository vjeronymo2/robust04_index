			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Speculation an inevitable result of ERM Sir, Your editorial, 'An entente that remains elusive' (August 12), concludes that the French and Anglo-Saxon views about currency speculation are in sharp contrast with each another. The French treat speculative activity as immoral whereas Anglo-Saxon countries consider it a legitimate and integral part of the free-market process. The ink had not yet dried on your editorial before Mr Edouard Balladur, France's prime minister, confirmed your thesis. Indeed, on the evening of August 12 Mr Balladur castigated speculators and called for reforms to clamp down on them President Francois Mitterrand joined the French chorus the next day when he said: 'I find it insane and immoral that speculation, using billions of dollars, can have its way against states representing their people's interests and upset the daily life of millions of people' ('Mitterrand lashes out at speculators', August 16). That French attitude is nothing new. In the good old tradition of the 'terror', Mr Michel Sapin, France's finance minister in the most recent socialist government, reacted to the events of September 1992 with remarks that were destined to gain him a prominent place in the foreign exchange annals. He said: 'I will fight, we will fight, France and Germany will fight this speculation, which is based on no economic fundamentals. During the French Revolution such speculators were known as 'agioteurs' and then were beheaded.' Alas, whenever their currencies are weak, politicians on the Continent embrace primitive ideas about speculation and concomitant conspiracy theories. This is an old and venerable tradition. For example, towards the end of the 16th century the Hanseatic League, the association of merchant towns in northern Germany, then on the decline, accused the Merchant Adventurers, English businessmen specialising in imports, of immoral speculation against the league's currency. Using speculators as scapegoats is just a pathetic ruse to cover up bad government policies. If politicians were consistent they would not only criticise speculators when currencies were weak but would also sing their praises when currencies were strong. That, of course, would be absurd. Government policies, not speculators, cause currency values to fluctuate. Speculators are just the messengers who deliver the news. In the interest of elevating understanding about exchange rate regimes the French politicians should eat some humble pie, eschew their planned summer reading and delve into serious economic literature. A recommended point of departure is 'Achilles heels in monetary standards', in the American Economic Review, March 1940. That classic article by Professor Frank D Graham describes why pegged but adjustable exchange rate regimes, such as the exchange rate mechanism, open the floodgates of disruptive, almost riskless, speculation because 'sure things never lack enthusiastic takers. . . including banks that are shrewdly administered'. Until the ERM is abandoned to the proverbial dustbin of history we will see the same scenario repeated over and over again.

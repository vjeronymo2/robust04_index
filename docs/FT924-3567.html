			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Hindu militants push India towards crisis: Curfew imposed after mosque is demolished INDIA faced a political and constitutional crisis last night after Hindu militants stormed and demolished an ancient mosque in Ayodhya, prompting widespread fears of communal violence across the country. Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, appealed for calm, even as regulatory police orders were imposed and the army alerted in many Indian states. Addressing the nation on television, Mr Rao said his government would go to any length to promote secularism and appealed to every citizen to co-operate with it. Tension escalated in several communally-sensitive states as news spread that the disputed mosque had been demolished by hordes of Hindu militants, who had converged on Ayodhya over the past week to protest against the government's failure to resolve the issue. Some 200 para-military police were inside the barricades at the time they were stormed. But within minutes they had retreated to a nearby building and played no further part, as a section of the 200,000 Hindus stormed the barricades and clambered on top of the mosque's three dilapidated domes. The religious chants of holy men were drowned in a violent melee as Hindu fanatics ignored their leaders and demolished the mosque's weak structure with tridents, daggers and even bare hands. Within three hours, all three domes had been reduced to rubble, which was carried away as souvenirs by a jubilant crowd that had accomplished what the courts and successive governments at the centre had been trying to prevent. The few hundred paramilitary police standing guard within the mosque did little to hide their sympathy for the militants. The 16th century Babri mosque, which was built on a temple site claimed by Hindus to be the birthplace of the god, Ram, has come to symbolise India as a secular state, guaranteed by the Constitution. The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has, over the past three years, become the largest opposition party by politicising a dispute that dates back to independence. Government direct rule was imposed in Uttar Pradesh, India's largest and most politically crucial state, where Ayodhya is located. Mr Kalyan Singh, the chief minister, who won power in an election 18 months ago on a promise to build a Hindu temple on the site where the mosque now stands, resigned late last evening. Hours later, his government, supported by the Bharatiya Janata Party, was dismissed by Mr Rao for its inability to abide by the Supreme court order to protect the disputed structure. A special hearing of India's highest court was convened to assess the 'grave constitutional crisis' caused by a constitutionally elected government not being able to uphold the court's orders. 'This is the first time that an assurance by the state government that it will protect the structure and carry out the court orders has been violated,' the bench said. 'Innocent lives have been put to danger all over the country.' The Hindu militants, dressed in saffron robes and chanting religious slogans, defied court orders and disobeyed the same Hindu political leaders who had used the temple issue to muster support for a Hindu nation. The BJP and some leaders of its more militant allies, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Rashtriya Swayam Sewak Sangh, termed the Ayodhya incident 'unfortunate', but said it was 'an indication of the depth of popular feeling about the construction of a Hindu temple' where the mosque now stands. The leaders reiterated their commitment to construct the temple as thousands continued to mill around the disputed site. The army was alerted in six Indian states, and an indefinite curfew imposed in Uttar Pradesh.</p>

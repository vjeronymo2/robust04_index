			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Broad range of borrowers tap wide variety of currencies A BROAD range of borrowers flocked to the international bond market yesterday, tapping a wide variety of currencies. The World Bank, which launched its Y225bn global deal on Tuesday, yesterday priced the seven-year bonds to yield 12 basis points over the No 129 JGB (the indicated range had been 11 to 13 basis points over the Japanese government bond). Goldman Sachs, which is joint lead-manager with Daiwa Europe and IBJ International, said the bonds traded up from the issue price of 99.983 to 100.07 - 100.10 by mid-afternoon, while the yield spread tightened to 11.5 basis points. 'The deal was distributed all over the major geographical centres,' according to one of the lead managers. Japan Airlines also tapped the yen sector yesterday for a total of Y50bn, choosing to spread its borrowing burden across three separate bond issues, lead-managed by three different Japanese houses. The bond issues, which are for aircraft financing purposes, have quite similar maturities, falling due in October 2002, July 2003 and October 2003. 'They (Japan Airlines) did it in three issues because they have a varied maturity requirement which makes it easier this way - however, it also helps relationships with the Japanese houses,' said one Japanese lead manager. Another said: 'It's very political - by doing three issues through three different houses, it gives everyone a slice of the pie.' The deals were mainly aimed at Japanese investors. In the lira sector of the market, Credit Local De France launched a L500bn zero-coupon bond with a 10-year maturity. Mr Flavio Fabbrizi, head of new issues at IMI Bank Luxembourg, which was the lead manager for the deal, said there was good demand in the Benelux countries, Germany and Switzerland, from both institutional and retail investors, given that with a zero-coupon bond investors do not have to worry about reinvesting interest payments. The bonds were priced at 39.72, giving 38.47 after fees and providing a gross redemption yield of 10.027 per cent. The bonds later traded at 38.625  -38.65. The US dollar sector saw a wave of new issues, with a straight bond from the Development Bank of the Philippines and a handful of floating-rate notes. The Development Bank of the Philippines upped its five-year issue from Dollars 100m to Dollars 175m, citing strong investor demand for the paper. The deal is the first five-year issue by a Philippines borrower, and extends the maturity benchmark set by the Republic of the Philippines Eurobond issue launched earlier this year. The bond issue does not carry a national government guarantee, but was brought at a yield spread of 310 basis points over the US Treasury bond, representing an improvement over the spread obtained by the republic. Citicorp was lead-manager for the deal.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cost categories. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Cost categories applicable to PY 1992 and earlier funds will be subject to prior regulations either until the funds have been exhausted or program activity has been completed. In order to assist the orderly transition to and implementation of the new requirements of the 1992 JTPA amendments, an increase is allowed in the administrative cost limitation for PY 1992 funds from 15 percent to 20 percent, with a corresponding adjustment to cost limitations for training and participant support. Specifically, not less than 80 percent of the title II&hyph;A funds shall be expended for training and participant support, and not less than 65 percent shall be expended for training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any prior year's carryover funds made available for use in PY 1993 will be subject to the reporting requirements and cost categories applicable to PY 1993 funds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In determining compliance with the JTPA cost limitations for PY 1992, Governors may either: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Determine cost limitation compliance separately for funds expended in accordance with paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Determine compliance for each cost category against the total PY 1992 funds, whether expended in accordance with the Act and regulations in effect prior to the 1992 amendments to JTPA or in accordance with the amended Act and these regulations. Using this option, the total combined funds expended for training and direct training should be at least 65 percent of PY 1992 SDA allocations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) In addition to the institutions specified in &sect;627.440(d)(1)(vi)(B), the costs of tuition and entrance fees of a postsecondary vocational institution specified at section 481(c) of the Higher Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1088(c)) may be charged to direct training services through June 30, 1995, when such tuition charges or entrance fees are not more than the educational institution's catalog price, are necessary to receive specific training, are charged to the general public to receive such training, and are for the training of participants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Financial reporting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Notwithstanding reprogramming, expenditures must be recorded separately by year of appropriation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Private Industry Council. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The private industry councils shall be certified pursuant to &sect;628.410 of this chapter, Private Industry Council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Grievances, investigations, and hearings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Generally, all grievances, investigations and hearings pending on or before June 30, 1993 should be resolved and settled under prior rules and procedures. Grievances, investigations, and hearings occurring on or after July 1, 1993 will be governed by the procedures described in subparts E, F, and H of this part 627. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (k)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summer program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) The Title II&hyph;B Summer Youth Employment Program for 1993 shall be governed by the Act and regulations in effect prior to the Amendments (prior to September 7, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Up to 10 percent of the 1993 title II&hyph;B funds available may be transferred to the title II&hyph;C program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (l)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> SDA designation <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . At the Governor's discretion, SDA's designated prior to July 1, 1992 need not be subject to the provisions of &sect;628.405, Service delivery areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (m)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Program implementation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The implementation by the States and SDA's of certain new program design requirements, particularly objective assessment and development of individual service strategies (ISS), may require additional time to fully implement beyond July 1, 1993. Reasonable efforts to implement the provisions of &sect;&sect;628.515, 628.520, and 628.530. as soon as possible after July 1, 1993, are expected to be made. However, it is not expected that every new participant will initially receive objective assessment, ISS, and referral to non-title II services for a period of 6 months, or until January 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Out-of-school youth ratio. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The 50-percent out-of-school participants requirement for title II&hyph;C will be phased in during PY 1993 and will not be the subject of compliance review until PY 1994, beginning July 1, 1994. During PY 1993, however, SDA's must show significant improvement in the proportion of out-of-school youth being served and performance in increasing the service ratio will be monitored by the States and DOL during this implementation period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (o)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative issuances. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Other implementation issues may be handled by administrative issuance. ETA will transmit such guidance directly to all Governors via a Training and Employment Guidance Letter (TEGL). Such TEGL's will be published as Notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (section 701(i)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;627.905  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Guidance on contracts and other agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department does not intend for contracts, agreements, inter-agency agreements, retainers, and similar arrangements to be negotiated and/or entered into for the sole purpose of applying previously existing rules and regulations. The 1992 JTPA amendments were effective July 1, 1993. The Department intends that contracts, awards and agreements entered into on or before June 30, 1993 are to be used to serve and/or train participants enrolled on or before June 30, 1993, unless the contracts and agreements are modified to comply with the new amendments and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;627.906  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Determinations on State and SDA implementation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Department expects that the States and SDA's will fully implement the provisions of the Act and these regulations regarding procurement, cost principles, cost categories, cost limitations, participant service requirements and eligibility beginning July 1, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Department expects that the implementation by the States and SDA's of the program design features in these regulations, particularly objective assessment and development of the ISS, may require additional time beyond July 1, 1993 to fully implement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In deciding to allow or disallow questioned costs related to the implementation of the provisions described in paragraph (b) of this section, the Grant Officer will consider the extent to which the State's and SDA's have made good faith efforts in properly implementing such provisions in the period July 1, 1993 through June 30, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

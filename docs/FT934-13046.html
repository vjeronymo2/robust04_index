			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / China's puff for the west: Marlboro man's new horizons Michael Chang hardly fits the image of Marlboro man, whose rough-hewn visage has been employed to sell cigarettes worldwide; but this week, wittingly or unwittingly, the tennis player who is ranked seventh in the world might be said to be helping to promote cigarette sales throughout Asia, and in China in particular. As the top seed at the Salem 1993 Open Tennis Championships in Beijing, Chang, a Chinese-American, is the tournament's main draw card and a favourite with the crowd, that cheers him on in his contests with the Europeans and Australians. For the manufacturers of Salem, Chang's presence in the first open tennis tournament in the Chinese capital is the fulfilment of a marketing dream in the world's biggest market for cigarettes - one in which foreign tobacco companies are taking an increasing interest as sales slide in the west. A small survey this week on Beijing's streets, and in several of the larger emporiums, showed that Western-style worries about the health hazards of cigarette-smoking are making little impact in China, where growing affluence and the impact of advertising are bringing with them a boom in the sale of foreign brands. Typical of smokers' reactions was that of a woman driver for a Beijing company. 'The media like to tell you that smoking is harmful to your health, but that's mostly just propaganda,' she declared. At the Yaohan department store, a smart Japanese-owned emporium on the city's main boulevard, a salesgirl at the cigarette counter said foreign brands, at about USDollars 2 per pack, were outselling local products among status-conscious smokers by a factor of two to one. 'By offering a Marlboro to a friend or business associate you're flattering the other party,' she said. Interest among foreign companies in the potential of the China market is entirely understandable given the numbers involved. According to a survey conducted earlier this year by the State Statistical Bureau, 298m people over the age of 15, or nearly 35 per cent of the total population, are smokers. Put another way, the number of people who smoke in China, exceeds the population of continental Europe, or that of the US. For foreign tobacco companies intent on penetrating the China market, however, life has not been easy. The Chinese have been reluctant to expose their lucrative state tobacco monopoly to foreign competition. Besides Philip Morris' agreement with China's state cigarette manufacturer, only two other well-known foreign manufacturers - R J Reynolds and Rothmans - have been permitted to establish a manufacturing foothold in the China market through joint ventures. Philip Morris has not started production yet. By and large the western cigarette conglomerates have seen their products gain access to China by less conventional means. It has been estimated informally that less than 1 per cent of foreign cigarettes on the market in China have passed through customs. Legal imports are restrained by high tariffs. In 1990, the the Worker's Daily estimated that smugglers had brought 175m cartons into China. That figure is almost certainly much higher now, as trade across China's porous borders has grown rapidly. Marlboro and other brands, such as Kent, Dunhill, Winston, 555 and Camel, are leaving little to chance in their efforts to gain market share in China. From the 555 Hong Kong-Beijing motor rally later this month to Marlboro's advertising blitz across the country, the tobacco giants are fighting hard for the loyalty of China's legions of smokers. They have been enticed not only by the size of the existing market but by expectations that pressures for trade liberalisation will create further opportunities.</p>

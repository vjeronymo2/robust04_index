			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Dishing the dirt on cleaning for the spooks Three cleaners working for the MI6 intelligence service were yesterday hidden from the media in order to publicise their case. The cleaners, all women, were forced to tell their tale of employment woe from behind a screen - because they have been threatened with dismissal under the Official Secrets Act. At a press conference the women's trade union said they were three of 47 cleaners forced to sign a 'gagging order' promising not to speak to the press about their complaints against the Foreign Office which is threatening to make them redundant for refusing to accept a pay cut. They might have been out of sight but they were not afraid to be outspoken - attacking Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, over the loss of their jobs. Mr Jack Dromey, of the TGWU general union - which organised the press conference - claimed they would face instant dismissal under the Official Secrets Act if identified, and lose their redundancy payments. Many of the women, who have been positively vetted, have worked for MI6 for 30 years. Their jobs were subjected to market-testing to see if they could be done more cheaply by contractors. Mr Hurd, in a letter to two Labour MPs, said the cleaners had 'rates of pay and allowances above the market rate'. Strand Cleaners has won the contract to clean the MI6 offices when the organisation moves this summer to a new building at Vauxhall Cross, south London. The hourly rate for cleaners is to be cut from Pounds 4 to Pounds 3.50, with a reduction in holiday entitlement and sick pay. One woman who has worked for MI6 for 19 years said she stood to lose as much as Pounds 1,200 if she complained about her treatment and was identified. Another said the cleaners had been 'victimised just to save money'. All said that they were patriotic, law-abiding women who had been unfairly treated. Mr Dromey said he was prepared to take the case to the European Court of Justice. The Foreign Office said that the government had acted within both UK and European law over the market-testing.</p>

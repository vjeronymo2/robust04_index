			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bousted makes Pounds 593,000 at nine months Boustead, the industrial products and technical services group acquired last year by Jack Chia-MPH, the Singapore-based trading company, yesterday reported sharply lower operating profits from continuing operations for the nine months to September 30. However, after various costs and profits mainly associated with the sale and closure of businesses, and reduced interest costs of Pounds 193,000 (Pounds 690,000), profits at the pre-tax level improved from Pounds 117,000 to Pounds 593,000. The group, which has undergone a substantial restructuring under its new management, announced at its interim stage in September that it planned to move its year-end to March 31 in order to conform with Jack Chia-MPH's accounting year. Operating profits from continuing operations for the nine-month period fell from Pounds 1.43m to Pounds 73,000 on turnover from continuing businesses of Pounds 43.9m (Pounds 44.3m). Discontinued and closed operations added Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 16.1m) to turnover but reduced operating profits by Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 992,000.) Boustead warned in September that its results for the third quarter would show a downturn because of seasonal factors. However, Mr Geoffrey Hall, chief executive, said that the sharp fall in European automotive sales had substantially exacerbated that trend this year through its effect on Boustead's component and plastic moulding businesses. Earnings per share of 0.1p compared with previous losses of 0.4p. The interim dividend is maintained at 0.35p. Earlier this month Boustead announced plans to sell its 65.4 per cent holding in Bousteadco, its Singapore-based subsidiary, to Jack Chia-MPH, for Pounds 12.8m subject to shareholder approval. Following the proposed sale, Boustead would have net cash balances of about Pounds 10m.</p>

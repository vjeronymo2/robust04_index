			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government is concerned about the  announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce that it will not  change the United States' patent system to a first-to-file  system. A Patent Office official said: "There is now a  possibility that the global move toward the patent system  harmonization will slow down." Member nations of the World  Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) want to enact a  "Treaty for Harmonization of Patent Systems," which will unify  patent systems into a first-to-file system. The Japanese  Government in the Japan-U.S. framework talks intends to call on  the U.S. Government to reconsider its stand.    The U.S. Government's patent system is the first-to-invent  system, under which those who invent products first are given  patent rights, instead of the first-to-file system under which  those who apply first get the patent right.    During the Bush administration, a U.S. Department of  Commerce  advisory council recommended changing to the "first-to-file  system." Given the circumstance, Patent Office officials  complained: "It is regrettable that the recommendation was  rejected."</p>

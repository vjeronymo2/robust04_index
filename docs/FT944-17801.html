			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Hogg pays Pounds 13m for Inchcape operations Hogg Robinson, the travel, transport and financial services group, has paid Pounds 13m for the whole of the UK and 50 per cent of the Hong Kong-based financial services operations of Bain Hogg Group, the insurance broking arm of Inchcape. Inchcape bought the Hogg Group, an insurance broker, for Pounds 176.6m in April and merged it with its own insurance broking subsidiary, Bain Clarkson, renaming the enlarged company Bain Hogg. The Bain Hogg activities being acquired are almost identical to those of Hogg Robinson Financial Services: employee benefits, pensions advice and financial counselling. Last year the UK businesses made pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.2m on sales of Pounds 17m, while the Hong Kong business made a negligible trading loss in its start-up year. Net assets of the businesses are Pounds 500,000.</p>

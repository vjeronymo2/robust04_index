			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / UK Company News: APV chief gets restructure under way with Pounds 56m sale MR CLIVE Strowger, the new chief executive of APV, has launched his own programme to restructure the food processing equipment maker with the sale of a ventilation company to Smiths Industries for Pounds 55.8m in cash. Mr Strowger, who was appointed in June, said the sale of Vent-Axia, a manufacturer of hand drier and ventilation equipment, would 'unlock a lot of value. With this headroom I can attack our business in a positive way.' The company also announced a refinancing of its Dollars 250m multi-option facility (Mof), which was originally due to expire in May, 1993. Mr Strowger said the refinancing not only strengthened the balance sheet - with debt maturing at between three and 10 years - but the loans were now more flexible. The need for a refinancing was partly due to the raft of acquisitions made in the 1980s which had an adverse affect on the balance sheet by 1990. APV had launched a restructuring programme that year, but Mr Strowger said considerable work remained to be done. Further non-core disposals or closures, representing less than 10 per cent of APV's Pounds 874.4m turnover, were planned. Proceeds would be invested in core businesses, with particular emphasis on the cash generative operations such as components. The sale to Smiths Industries represented an 'extremely attractive' price, significantly above book value, Mr Strowger said. Last year Vent-Axia contributed Pounds 5m in profits, and had Pounds 16.5m in net assets. APV was likely to take an exceptional credit for the book value premium in the year to end-December, although restructuring costs would be offset against it. Mr Russell Plumley, of Smiths Industries, said the acquisition of Vent-Axia fitted into the company's plan to build up the industrial side of its business. Smiths planned to increase Vent-Axia's share of the export market, particularly the US and Germany. In the last two years, Smiths has spent Pounds 200m on acquisitions, with the majority in the lower technology industrial and medical systems businesses.</p>

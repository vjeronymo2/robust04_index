			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, March 7 (AFP) -- France is considering  sending a new battalion of 800 troops to Sarajevo to reinforce  its 2,300 peacekeepers in the Bosnian capital, military sources  said here Monday [7 March].    France already has more than 6,000 troops under the United  Nations flag in former Yugoslavia.    The battalion would consist of career soldiers, infantry and  engineers, but the decision to send them is not yet formal, the  sources said.    The decision would be taken in close coordination with  Britain. A British Government source said London could also send  significant reinforcements to Bosnia.    The reinforcements would enable the UN to put into force  Security Council Resolution 900 providing for restoration of  essential public services in Sarajevo, the sources said.    Meanwhile Prime Minister Edouard Balladur held a meeting  Monday with General Betrand de Lapresle, who will replace  General Jean Cot as commander of UN forces in mid-March.    Cot is being relieved at the request of UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali for publicly demanding authority to order  air strikes against the Serbs.</p>

			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a banker with that hat Sir, Your article, 'Not yet the death knell' (December 10/11) impels me to challenge the photo caption, 'Gentlemen bankers in Throgmorton Street near the Bank of England, 1967'. My father, in top hat, was at the time gilt-edged partner at Cazenove. He would be turning in his grave at being described as a 'banker'. Susan Blackwood, St Andrew's Farm House, Great Durnford, Salisbury, Wiltshire SP4 6AZ</p>

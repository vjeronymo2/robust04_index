			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Sanctions force Belgrade to tighten its belt 'PEOPLE complain about the prices of green peppers. But after paying for fertilisers and fuel, I have no choice - we earn a pittance,' says Mrs Dusanka Mladenovic, a peasant selling vegetables at Kalenic Pijaca, one of Belgrade's green markets. The effects of United Nations sanctions, including an oil embargo, imposed on Yugoslavia for its backing of Serb fighters in Bosnia, are hitting the inhabitants of the Serbian capital. Mrs Mladenovic says she has barely enough petrol to travel from her nearby village to Belgrade. Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, introduced a monthly ration in June of 20 litres for private car owners. Even that is likely to be cut next month to 15 litres, according to Serbian newspapers. Queues of cars snake around the handful of petrol stations still open in Belgrade. Crowds of people wait for hours to pack into buses after city authorities halved the number running each day and closed many routes. Mr Ivan Obradovic, a Belgrade university professor, had difficulty even getting hold of his ration coupons. Five municipal offices told him they had run out. Mr Obradovic dismissed as 'useless' an offer of diesel coupons. One clerk recommended he buy them on the black market. The flourishing black market sells hard currency and petrol coupons but the price of DM1 for a 10 litre coupon is steep for people whose average monthly wage has plummeted to DM65. 'It is catastrophic,' says Mr Obradovic. 'The government has shown it is incapable of effectively rationing patrol. If this is any sign of how - if necessary - they will ration flour and cooking oil, then we will starve.' Tired of war and uncertainty, people appear to blame Yugoslav and foreign politicians for their economic woes. An attendant at one Belgrade filling station told foreign journalists in search of petrol to ask 'Bush and Genscher'. The former German foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher has been much maligned by the Serbian media for his support of Croatian independence. Other people pointed the finger at Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic and Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman. 'If you listen to television the politicians are always right. But while they argue, people are dying in Bosnia. Milosevic and Tudjman should be blamed, not ordinary people.' says Mrs Mladenovic, sitting on a wooden crate at the market. Zeljko, a warehouse manager from Zemun, a city across the River Sava from Belgrade, says: 'We are are all guilty for the situation - but it is mostly Serbia's ruling politicians. Meanwhile, I live from one day to the next trying to make ends meet. 'I cannot feed my family on a monthly wage of DM100, so I have to sell goods on the black market.'</p>

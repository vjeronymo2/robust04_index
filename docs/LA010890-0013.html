			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE POOR, SCHOOL CHOICE IS NEXT TO NO CHOICE AT ALL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: A SYSTEM THAT CREATES 'MULTITIERED AND UNEQUAL OPPORTUNITIES' IS NOT  AN OPTION THE LATINO COMMUNITY CAN AFFORD.  </P> <P> Why has the national Latino education leadership been so quiet on the subject  of school choice?  </P> <P> To answer that question, place yourself in a typical classroom in almost any  school where Latino children are the majority. Now imagine yourself answering a  set of true/false questions:  </P> <P> 1) My class is small; 2) My classroom has enough desks for everybody; 3) My  classmates all have their own textbooks; 4) My school environment is safe; 5)  My instructors are regular, fully credentialed teachers; 6) My teachers think  I'm smart and encourage me; 7) My classes are interesting and demanding; 8) My  school has excellent instructional resources; 9) My school has a strong  academic reputation.  </P> <P> If you answered true to more than three of these questions you are the  exception.  </P> <P> California's 1974 Seranno vs. Priest decision, which mandated equal spending  limits per pupil, did not alter the pattern of inequitable distribution of  educational resources, nor did the education-reform movement of the past decade  result in significant improvements in the conditions of schooling and the  achievement levels of Latino students.  </P> <P> Latinos did not become politically empowered during the past decade, and  therefore have not been able to make education policy and influence the  delivery of educational services.  </P> <P> In the past, Latinos were not significant participants in the national  education agenda. The debate over school choice offers us an opportunity to  change this.  </P> <P> Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos has proclaimed that "choice empowers  people by bringing them into the decision-making process. It encourages  teachers and principals to become entrepreneurs and structure their curriculum  and standards; students are encouraged to become learners with options that  direct and capture their interest, and parents become involved as  decision-makers."  </P> <P> Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota, in whose state open enrollment made its debut,  declares that "Families can make a choice about where to send their kids to  school. School boards will have to respond to the market forces, whereas before  they didn't have to."  </P> <P> But Ann Bastian, of the New World Foundation, argues that "choice . . . is not  a quick fix for school improvement. There is nothing in the choice concept that  makes it automatically achieve such goals as quality, diversity and democracy."  </P> <P> Donald Moore, author of a study on school choice ("The New Improved Sorting  Machine"), states: "In many instances, public-school choice is becoming a new  form of segregation, creating multitiered and unequal educational  opportunities."  </P> <P> Who and what to believe?  </P> <P> In its principal manifestation (magnet schools), school choice does not provide  better educational opportunities for all students. Rather, it reinforces  inequities and stratification. In Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor tells us, all  the children are above average. One would assume that all the schools of that  imaginary community are, too. But what meaning does choice have if the schools  in one's community are bad or mediocre? If above-average schools are  geographically inaccessible? Or if choice is restricted to above-average  students?  </P> <P> Moreover, the analogy linking commerce and school choice, however appealing, is  flawed. Latino purchasing power, for example, has not resulted in high-quality  goods and services at lower prices in Latino neighborhoods.  </P> <P> School choice would be a significant option if Latinos were both economically  and politically empowered. Until we are empowered, however, we must not allow  the marketing efforts of school-choice proponents to distract us from the real  and substantive tools that we must have to improve the education of all our  children: small teacher-student ratios; good facilities; safe learning  environments; substantive curricula; good instructional resources, and  teachers, counselors and administrators with appropriate preparation and high  expectations for their students. These can and should be provided to all  children in all of America's schools.  </P></p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bleak picture painted of Canadian fishery prospects SCIENTISTS HAVE painted a bleak picture of Canada's east coast fishery, warning that a substantial and permanent cut in the catch is required to rebuild stocks of cod and other fish species. The scientists, employed by Canada's department of fisheries, presented a detailed report in Halifax, Nova Scotia, yesterday at the first public meeting of the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council, a joint government, industry and scientific group with a mandate to advise the government on annual fishing quotas and fishery practices. The FRCC's work is expected to play a crucial part in drawing up Canada's case to the North Atlantic Fishing Organisation, which sets an annual quota each autumn for the area outside Canada's territorial waters. The east coast fishery has been devastated in recent years by the virtual disappearance of northern cod stocks. The Canadian government imposed a two-year moratorium off the coast of Newfoundland last July, putting about 20,000 fishermen and plant employees out of work. Government officials have indicated recently that the moratorium may be extended beyond 1994 and to other parts of the Atlantic coast. Mr Herbert Clarke, the FRCC's chairman, said yesterday that 'the state of the stocks has worsened dramatically in the last few years. Many are in decline and a number of stocks are at historical low levels'. The scientific report noted that past assessments had generally over-estimated potential catches. It warned that 'immediate and medium-term prospects (for rebuilding stocks) are poor', adding that 'the necessary drastic reductions in fishing mortalities can only be achieved by substantially decreasing fishing effort and these reductions need to be permanent.'</p>

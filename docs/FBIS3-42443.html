Shakin, doctor of technical  sciences and docent]    [Text] The methods are intended for operational calculation  of the volumes of obstacles in a large unit's zone of advance,  the required number of lanes, and the necessary amount of forces  to cross them.    To make the calculations, the chief of the engineer service  will require the following initial data:    --the enemy grouping in the zone of advance;    --the battle formation of the large unit (unit) of our  troops;    --the offensive front;    --the length of armor terrain;    --the available forces and assets for clearing lanes in  obstacles.  <H3>  3.1. Determining the Volumes of Obstacles and Rubble Placed  by the Enemy in the Zone of Advance </H3>   The opposing enemy grouping is determined in percentages of  a  division and is adjusted using the coefficient of accounting of  the enemy (Table 3.1). Depending on the reinforcement of the  enemy division with engineer units, the volumes of obstacles in  the zone of advance are determined according to Table 3.2.    The distribution of obstacles by lines is determined by  multiplying the obtained values by the coefficient of obstacle  distribution (Table 3.3).    Formula 3.1. is used to determine the density of minefields  (conventional and remotely installed) being erected by the enemy  to the depth of defense of the first-echelon division depending  on the day the engagement is conducted (Table II.3.4).  D[.sup]mflddef[/]-(L[.sup]mfld[/]+0.5xL[.sup]rmfld[/])  xK[.sup]cap[/]/L[.sup]acc[/]. (3.1)    The density of the minefields on the lines of the enemy  defense is determined by formula 3.1 by multiplying by the  corresponding coefficient of distribution of obstacles by lines  (Table II.3.3).  D[.sup]i[/]-(L[.sup]mfld[/]xK[.sup]i[/][.sup]mfld[/]+0.5x  L[.sup]rmfld[/]xK[.sup]i[/][.sup]rmfld[/])xK[.sup]cap[/]/  L[.sup]acc[/]. (3.2)    In expressions 3.1 and 3.2:    L[.sup]mfld[/] and L[.sup]rmfld[/] are the length of  conventional and remotely installed minefields, respectively, in  km;    K[.sup]cap[/] is the coefficient of the decrease in enemy  capabilities for erecting obstacles depending on the day the  engagement is conducted;    K[.sup]i[/][.sup]mfld[/] and  K[.sup]i[/][.sup]rmfld[/] are the coefficients of  distribution of obstacles by lines;    L[.sup]acc[/] is the length of the zone of advance  accessible for troop operations.  <H3>  3.2. Determining the Required Number of Lanes in the  Minefields </H3>   Depending on the density of the obstacles erected by the  enemy and the battle formation used by the large unit, tables  3.5 and 3.6 are used to determine the required number of lanes  in minefields in front of the forward edge and in the depth of  the enemy defense.  <H3>  3.3. Determining the Required Amount of Forces for Clearing  Lanes in Minefields and Rubble </H3>   The number of combat engineer platoons (mineclearing  platoon)  necessary for clearing lanes in minefields in front of the  forward edge of the defense and in the depth of the enemy  defense is determined from the calculation that one platoon  simultaneously makes 2-3 lanes and 6-8 lanes in a day.    The number of combat engineer platoons (mineclearing  platoons, obstacle-clearing platoons) for assignment to the  obstacle-clearing team (obstacle-clearing detachment) is  determined according to the number of battalions (regiments) in  the first echelon at the rate of up to a platoon for one  obstacle-clearing team and one to two platoons for one  obstacle-clearing detachment.  <H5>  Assessing the Effectiveness of Crossing Obstacles </H5>   To assess the effectiveness of crossing obstacles, it is  necessary to determine the coefficient of supply with engineer  subunits, equal to the ratio of the number of available platoons  (N[.sup]ep[/]) to the required number (N[.sup]er[/]:    K[.sup]supp[/]=N[.sup]ep[/]/N[.sup]er[/]. (3.3)    Table 3.7. is used to determine the coefficient of the  decrease in the rate of advance, the relative losses of armored  equipment on the obstacles, and the time for accomplishing the  day's mission.  <H5>  Attachment: Tables for Calculation of Overcoming Obstacles </H5>  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 3.1.

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Granada/LWT Until this week Granada appeared to be strolling through its bid with LWT. But following LWT's strong profits showing, it now appears to have a real fight on its hands. LWT's latest broadside included the customarily extravagant bid rhetoric - but it hardly smacked of a company going through the motions before capitulating. Moreover, LWT's shareholders will be reluctant to sell a management that has delivered more than a six-fold increase in their shares since 1989. A bigger premium may well be needed to seduce them. Granada would surely sweeten its terms if that secured a recommendation from LWT's board. But LWT has stressed its case so passionately that only a very much higher offer might suffice. That, though, would have dangers for Granada. An overly-generous bid would damage perceptions of Granada's earnings prospects, lessening the appeal of its shares which are the bid's chief currency. However, if Granada won a hostile bid with no increase, or only a token improvement, it may irretrievably antagonise LWT's board. LWT's millionaire managers would have few financial qualms about quitting, threatening a disruptive hand-over period. Besides, much of LWT's appeal lies in its creative skills. LWT still has worries of its own. Its arguments for independence will be discredited if it encourages a frustrating deal with any other party. Thomas Cook helped scupper Airtours' hostile bid for Owners Abroad by launching a rival tender offer. But Owners' subsequent traumas hardly represent a happy precedent for LWT.</p>

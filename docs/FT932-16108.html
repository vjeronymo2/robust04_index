			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / UK Company News: Coats offers higher share alternative Coats Viyella is offering an enhanced share dividend alternative, enabling shareholders to receive new shares with a value 50 per cent higher than the cash dividend. Previously the share value had been equal to the level of the dividend. As a result, the value of the revised share alternative will be 6.375p, compared with the final cash dividend of 4.25p announced last month. To provide shareholders with an assured cash return from the enhanced dividend, Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities will make a separate cash offer at a value equivalent to 6.05p to purchase the new shares arising under the scheme.

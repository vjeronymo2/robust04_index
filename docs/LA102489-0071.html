			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS HAVEN'T SIGNED BENJAMIN  </P> <P> Benoit Benjamin's expected return to the National Basketball Assn. was delayed  at least a day when the free-agent center did not sign a contract with the  Clippers Monday.  </P> <P> Alan Rothenberg, the Clippers' general counsel, said there is a "decent chance"  the fifth-year center could rejoin the team today. The sides met Monday but  could not resolve the details that are preventing Benjamin from returning to  the Clippers after his aborted move to the Italian League.  </P> <P> No one would comment on the results of Benjamin's physical. Clipper physician  Tony Daly said not all the information would be available until today. However,  it is known that Benjamin, who played his best at 250 pounds late last season,  weighed in at 283. Benjamin, who claims he can be effective at 260 or 265  pounds after off-season workouts, did show stamina in a 75-minute workout with  Todd Person, the Clippers' strength and conditioning coach.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Coach Don Casey announced that guard Fred Cofield and forward  Derrick Gervin had been cut. That puts the roster at 14, not including Benjamin  and injured Danny Manning. The opening-day limit is 12. The Clippers are  considering putting rookie guard Jay Edwards, who has yet to play because of  tendinitis in the knee, on the injured list. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER  </P></p>

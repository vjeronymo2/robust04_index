As direct  investment to North Korea is difficult due to the nuclear  inspection issue, domestic firms are vigorously pressing ahead  with processing-on-commission trade -- a form of indirect  investment -- according to the businesses concerned.    Samsong Product Company has decided to increase by 30  percent  the amount of products manufactured by processing-on-commission,  which reached $2.5 million last year. In addition, it has  decided to expand orders for export to third countries,  including Japan, under this form of trade.    Preparing for the ROK Government's possible authorization of  a visit to North Korea within this year, Samsong has set up  plans to send technicians to instruct North Korean workers on  the advanced technology necessary for processing-on-commission  trade for high-quality goods and to increase goods manufactured  by processing-on-commission.    In 1993 Daewoo purchased 100,000 man's suits made by Sinsong  Trade Company using processing-on-commission and has mapped out  plans to expand processing-on-commission trade to higher quality  clothes.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER TERESA'S ILLNESS CASTS PALL OVER FOLLOWERS;  </P> <P> IN CALCUTTA, PRAYERS -- AND GLOOM  </P> <P> For the last two weeks, the Sisters of Charity have been praying in shifts on  the second floor of the House for the Dying and Destitute, chanting the rosary  and singing "Ave Maria" into the night.  </P> <P> On the floor below, other nuns, clad in simple white saris, have continued  their work alongside volunteers from the United States, Europe and Asia, going  from cot to cot tending to dozens of living skeletons, as they have for  decades.  </P> <P> But there is a sadness in the air these days in the decaying old building in  the heart of Calcutta's slums, a fear that the woman who started what many  believe is the most selfless crusade in modern history may soon be gone.  </P> <P> Her portrait hangs in a corner of the room where Calcutta's poorest can now die  with dignity, near a sign that spells out her life's dream: "The greatest aim  of human life is to die in peace with God."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Failing Health  </P> <P> The message is signed by Mother Teresa, and although none of the nuns will even  discuss it, it is the failing health of their Mother Superior that has brought  such gloom to the city where she began her Missionaries of Charity movement  nearly 40 years ago.  </P> <P> The vigil has not been confined to Mother Teresa's mission, or to her modern  headquarters building. Since the 79-year-old Yugoslav-born nun was admitted to  a nursing home with heart problems Sept. 5, her seesaw struggle to live has  spread concern throughout the city, touching everyone from the street people to  whom she has dedicated her life to the most senior government officials.  </P> <P> Bulletins on the state of her health are flashed on state television and  carried in all the national newspapers. Last week, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi  flew to Calcutta with his wife to pay a 10-minute visit to the woman whom many  regard as a living saint.  </P> <P> So strong is the concern that a state official held a news conference Sunday to  criticize the officials who have been visiting Mother Teresa in the  intensive-care unit of Woodland's Nursing Home, situated in Calcutta's most  affluent neighborhood.  </P> <P> "Who knows what infections even these officials may be carrying with them,"  said H. A. Halim, Speaker of the state legislature of West Bengal state.  </P> <P> There have been conflicting reports about Mother Teresa's condition, and this  has contributed to the uncertainty about her.  </P> <P> On Sunday and Monday, the bulletins seemed favorable. "Mother's fever is nearly  gone," the Monday bulletin said, suggesting that her condition had improved.  But a morning newspaper carried a headline saying, "Mother Teresa Not Out of  Danger."  </P> <P> One bulletin, reported by telephone, indicated that her condition had  deteriorated because she was receiving what was recorded as "heart massage." In  fact, the bulletin had said "cardiac message," and it referred to the impulses  from a pacemaker that had been installed days before.  </P> <P> The absence of clear medical information has spawned rumors, including death  scares, reports of a power struggle within the Missionaries of Charity and  often-reported but unconfirmed criticism that the nursing home was responsible  for Mother Teresa's persistent fever because the pacemaker installed by its  doctors was infected.  </P> <P> The rumors have endured in part because Mother Teresa is not strong enough to  meet with the press. Sister Priscilla, who has been designated the order's  spokeswoman on the subject, has grown weary of the constant demand for news.  </P> <P> "Not more newsmen," she said with a sigh Sunday night as three Western  journalists paid a call on the mission's headquarters during evening prayers.  Nevertheless, she said she had visited Mother Teresa that afternoon and that  "she hopes to come home soon."  </P> <P> Asked if she believed that Mother Teresa would actually return soon, Sister  Priscilla said: "I don't know, but we all pray that she may come back as soon  as possible. We all miss her."  </P> <P> She appeared to be on the verge of tears.  </P> <P> Halfway across town, at Mother Teresa's hospice for the destitute, there seemed  to be little time for rumors or speculation.  </P> <P> It was here that Mother Teresa opened her home in 1948, 19 years after she came  to Calcutta as a convent teacher with the Loreto order of Ireland. And it was  here that she built an international organization that now includes 335  orphanages, hospices, refugee centers, clinics, AIDS centers and homes for the  destitute in 66 countries on five continents.  </P> <P> At the entrance to the Calcutta hospice is a sign that says, "Welcome to  Mother's First Love, Home for the Destitute and Dying."  </P> <P> One of the nuns, who agreed to talk with a reporter Monday on the condition  that her name not be used, said Mother Teresa came to the hospice often when  she was well, even though she maintains 151 other homes in India.  </P> <P> She conceded that the mood has changed here since the Mother Superior was  hospitalized.  </P> <P> "Everyone here is very sad," she said. "Yes, we are worried, and always there  is someone upstairs, praying for Mother's recovery."  </P> <P> In the huge hospice room, moving constantly among the green cots occupied by  "pavement dwellers" waiting for death or a miracle, were a dozen of the foreign  volunteers who are always here. Two years ago, former California Gov. Edmund G.  Brown Jr. worked here for several weeks. Tourists and other travelers often  stop for a few days or weeks to lend a hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attracts Everyone  </P> <P> Andy Wimmer, a former West German banker, is one of many repeat visitors.  Wimmer, who has spent a total of a year and a half at the home since 1985, is  closer than most to the home and its creator.  </P> <P> "The great power of Mother Teresa," he said, "is that she is not only the  mother of the poor -- even the rich are attracted by her ideas."  </P> <P> It is in this universal attraction, Wimmer said, that he senses the greatest  potential impact if Mother Teresa does not recover.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, I think that less money would come into the mission if Mother is  not around," he said. "She is a very charismatic figure, and probably none of  the other sisters could match that."  </P> <P> But otherwise, he said, little would change in the Missionaries of Charity if  its founder were gone.  </P> <P> "The order is well-established now," he said. "The life and the work will not  be disrupted."  </P></p>

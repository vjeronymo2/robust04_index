			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WHITE CHRISTMAS, FINE; WHITE CATALOGUES, NO  </P> <P> As the holidays draw closer this year, the crush of catalogues in my mailbox  grows ever larger. No need to check the calendar, just weigh the mail. I'm a  law student with little spare time in the midst of finals, so I appreciate  these glossy samplers as a quick and convenient way to do my gift shopping. But  several catalogues left a bad taste in my mouth when I saw their version of a  white Christmas.  </P> <P> Lily-white, to be exact. Many catalogues demonstrated the racial diversity of a  South African country club or, for that matter, the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors. Most notable were the offerings from Victoria's Secret, a  well-known purveyor of slinky underthings, and Tweeds, which offers handsome  clothes in colors such as "oxblood," "mortar," "mongoose" and "thunder."  </P> <P> I received two catalogues from Victoria's Secret last week. The "Christmas Gift  Treasury" has 66 pages, roughly 150 photographs, and not a single black, Latino  or Asian woman. Nor do women of color appear in Victoria's even heftier  "Holiday Collection 1990" catalogue. A slimmer Christmas catalogue from Laura  Ashley also provided a window into an all-white, even all-blonde, world of  landed gentry.  </P> <P> The 160-odd photographs in Tweeds "Winter No. 1" were similarly barren of  racial diversity, though on closer scrutiny I spotted a black woman in the  "clearance" insert. Tweeds "Winter No. 2" might have been entirely white were  it not for the "Egypt" section, in which a Eurasian model provides a suitably  "exotic" flavor and occasional Arab men serve as background. I saw a black  woman on Page 66, but it turned out that Tweeds was selling the clothes worn by  the model standing next to her.  </P> <P> These catalogues are aimed at young professionals and students like myself. Who  else would send away for sanguine-colored weathered pique tees and foret  fine-wale corduroy jodhpurs? But what disturbs me is that Victoria's Secret,  Tweeds and others have apparently decided that an image of wealthy white  society where minorities play a peripheral, subservient or nonexistent role  will sell clothes to my age group.  </P> <P> In our society, white consumers do control the biggest share of disposable  income, and therefore are prime targets for merchandisers. But these all-white  images are harmful because they reinforce attitudes of white exclusivity.  </P> <P> White students may acquire the same mind-set when they attend expensive private  universities with low and declining minority admissions -- the attitude  expressed by a USC student wearing a T-shirt boasting, "My maid went to UCLA."  Similarly, young professionals are sure to note the lack of adequate minority  representation in high-paying fields such as law or business.  </P> <P> The message is that the exclusive control of wealth and power by whites is the  natural and desirable state of affairs. Instead of challenging these  reactionary attitudes, too many catalogues pander to them.  </P> <P> As a white law student from a well-off family, I imagine that I'm just the  target who Tweeds and Victoria's Secret are hoping to reach. But this holiday  season I'll place my orders with companies that foster racial diversity in  their advertising.  </P> <P> The catalogue I recently received from J. Crew displays a fair degree of racial  diversity -- as they have in the past. Smythe &amp; Co.'s "Holiday Sale"  catalogue prominently features several black models. Benetton's clothes are a  little far-out for me, but their exhilarating, high-profile, multiracial  advertising sends a vibrant message of integration and equality. These  companies demonstrate that racially diverse fashion advertising is both  attractive and profitable.  </P> <P> I realize that greater problems face us than mail-order catalogue racism. But  if the problem is small, the solution is correspondingly simple -- and every  step against racism is a step worth taking. If mail-order retailers can offer  garments in colors like "shallot," "driftwood," "elderberry" and "seafoam,"  then there should be room for simple black and brown. It sure seems a waste to  go through the expense of printing a full-color catalogue with a one-color  message.  </P></p>

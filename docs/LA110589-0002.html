			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> In Trading Places (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), that hilarious variation on  "The Prince and the Pauper," Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy decide to see if  streetwise con man Eddie Murphy can run their Philadelphia commodities  brokerage as well as insufferable WASP Dan Akyroyd has.  </P> <P> Taken Away (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring Valerie Bertinelli  as a single working mother fighting to regain custody of her child.  </P> <P> John Heard and Mel Harris star in the new two-part Cross of Fire (NBC Sunday  and Monday, 9-11 p.m.) which is based on the true story of the Ku Klux Klan's  rise and fall in Indianapolis in the '20s.  </P> <P> Crocodile Dundee (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), one of the most popular movies of the  decades, stars Paul Hogan in the title role as a resourceful tour guide in the  Australian outback, who winds up in adventure and romance in New York.  </P> <P> Randal Kleiser's fine 1980 remake of The Blue Lagoon (Channel 5 Monday at 8  p.m.) succeeds in involving us with a couple of kids (Brooke Shields,  Christopher Atkins) stranded on a tropical isle and presents their coming of  age with tenderness and honesty.  </P> <P> The Gate (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is sub-Spielberg stuff, a bit of  horror-whimsy about wholesome, lovable all-American kids battling the Forces of  Darkness; Stephen Dorff stars.  </P> <P> When He's Not a Stranger (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring  Annabeth Gish as a college freshman seeking justice after being raped by a man  she knows.  </P> <P> Dick Tracy, Detective is the first of four Dick Tracy movies from the '40s  airing on Channel 28 this week at 11 p.m. Morgan Conway stars in the first  (Monday) and in Dick Tracy Vs. Cueball (Tuesday); Ralph Byrd, the definitive  Tracy, stars in Dick Tracy's Dilemma (Wednesday) and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome  (Thursday).  </P> <P> John Hughes' 1985 The Breakfast Club (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) finds five  radically different kids (Anthony Michael Hall, Emilio Estevez, Ally Sheedy,  Molly Ringwald and Judd Nelson) who get to know each other in the course of an  all-day detention at their suburban Illinois high school. It's engaging but  finally too schematic for its own good.  </P> <P> Set in the forbidding wasteland of the future, George Miller's The Road Warrior  (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is slam-bang entertainment envisioning a  gas-starved postwar world in which scavengers prowl a shimmering strip of  highway, ready to kill for a tank of fuel. Mel Gibson is once again Mad Max, a  Shane-like loner drawn to helping a group of idealistic, bewildered survivors.  </P> <P> The Secret of My Success (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1987 misfired comic  fantasy on business success in in the Reagan era, stars Michael J. Fox who  brings a welcome low-key winsome chutzpah to a Kansas college graduate  determined to conquer the corporate world of Manhattan.  </P> <P> Alan Parker's Angel Heart (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a visually lush,  determinedly lurid thriller of the supernatural that overreaches yet is  captivating all the same. Mickey Rourke, in his usual ferocious low-life guise,  stars, and Robert De Niro has a witty turn as Satan.  </P> <P> Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood aren't the most convincing casting as a Puerto  Rican Romeo and Juliet, but Robert Wise's Oscar-laden, razzle-dazzle film of  West Side Story (Channel 13 Thursday at 7:30 p.m.) is nonetheless a terrific  entertainment.  </P> <P> Blake Edwards' unfunny Blind Date (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) features a  beautiful woman (Kim Basinger) with no tolerance whatever for alcohol who goes  out on a blind date with a yuppie executive (Bruce Willis) who, although warned  about her problem, feeds her quantities of champagne and then watches in  outraged dismay as she lurches out of control.  </P> <P> WarGames (Channel 5 Friday at 7:30 p.m.) is a taut, ingenious winner in which  high school computer whiz Matthew Broderick blunders into a game, Global  Thermonuclear War, with the Defense Department's computer which keeps ticking  away after Broderick quits.  </P> <P> The 1966 Batman (Channel 11 Friday at 8 p.m.), with Adam West, is just awful,  hopelessly dated.  </P> <P> In An American Werewolf in London (Channel 9 Saturday at 8 p.m.) director John  Landis juxtaposes humor and gore with such outrageousness that from one moment  to the next you can't tell whether you're going to laugh or cringe. Not for the  very young but a delirious treat that develops surprising poignance. David  Naughton and Griffin Dunne star.  </P></p>

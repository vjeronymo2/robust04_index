			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> NO SIMPLE SOLUTION WILL FIX RAMS  </P> <P> The Rams are stuck in the muck of one of those  if-it's-not-one-thing-it's-another seasons. During the first few games, the  defense performed as if it were playing in quicksand. Then the defense got out  of the mire, and an ineffective offense started pulling the team under.  </P> <P> So now everyone wants to know: Where's the O?  </P> <P> It seems to be quite a mystery for the players.  </P> <P> After Sunday's 31-7 loss to the Giants, tailback Cleveland Gary said he thought  the Rams were "doing everything well." Then he added a familiar refrain in  Ramland these days: "It's just a matter of a couple plays here and there."  </P> <P> Quarterback Jim Everett is admittedly perplexed. "We just aren't making the  plays that we're used to making," he says. "Somehow, we've got to do that."  </P> <P> But how?  </P> <P> Here's some theories on Where the O Went:  </P> <P>  -- The Rams' finesse, pass-oriented approach, with precision timing a  prerequisite, is bound to be less consistent than a more simple style.  </P> <P> Sunday's game against the Giants shed some light on recent woes. The teams  played even football for more than a half, but somewhere in the third quarter,  the Rams' finely tuned offense began to misfire. The Rams passed for 74 yards  in the second half. New York's blood-and-guts attack kept plowing away, and the  result was a rout.  </P> <P> All of which points out one of the drawbacks of the Ram offense. Like any  complicated, high-tech machine, there are a lot of little things that can go  wrong. And that pretty much sums up the offensive troubles to date. No major  breakdowns. Lots of minor glitches.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of balls that were almost in our hands, or just ticked off us, or  we dropped," Coach John Robinson said. "We couldn't sustain anything. We're  just not making the plays we have in the past."  </P> <P>  -- Opponents are more familiar with these kinds of offenses now and defending  them better.  </P> <P>  "I think that's an ongoing cycle," Robinson said. "This offense will be a good  offense in 1997, I think. It's the execution of it that determines success."  </P> <P>  -- Preseason injuries to wide receivers knocked the passing game out of whack,  and the Rams still haven't found their rhythm.  </P> <P> Because of injuries to Henry Ellard, Flipper Anderson and Aaron Cox, Everett  spent the preseason refining his timing with backup receivers. Ellard led the  three in exhibitions with one catch. But all three played in the season opener  at Green Bay, and the Rams figured all would be well with the passing game in a  couple of weeks.  </P> <P> And, at times, the Rams have flashed back to '89. Everett threw for 372 yards  against Cincinnati and 302 against Atlanta, but he has also fallen short of 200  in three of the past five games.  </P> <P>  -- Maybe it's really all the fault of the defense.  </P> <P> Robinson is quick to point out that the Rams have been facing some pretty steep  deficits recently. After all, there's only so much an offense can do when  facing a two- or three-touchdown disadvantage.  </P> <P> "We're way out of balance in terms of running and passing," he said. "You need  a combination of play that includes the ability to stay even in the football  game and not get pushed on the edges by the scoreboard."  </P> <P> Sure, it's too early to panic -- the Rams are fifth in the league in offense --  but maybe Robinson should be thinking about getting a punishing tailback and  big, dominant offensive line and . . .  </P> <P> "When we were running the football all the time, people said, 'You're never  gonna win without a pass offense,' " Robinson said, managing a smile. "Now we  have a pass offense, and it doesn't click. You tend to think, 'Gosh, if you ran  the football, you probably would (win).' "  </P> <P> Robinson insists he's a long way from altering, much less abandoning, offensive  coordinator Ernie Zampese's system.  </P> <P> "I don't think we want to say, 'Gee, why don't we do what the Giants do and be  the Giants. Or be the Kansas City Chiefs,' " Robinson said. "I don't think we  want to do anything other than our scheme.  </P> <P> "When evaluating styles, you have to remember that a system like the Giants' is  built on the premise that they have as good a defense as there is in the  league. What we have to do is do what we do better than we've been doing it."  </P> <P> So how often does Robinson remind himself that his team could break out of the  offensive doldrums and spend the rest of the season racing up and down the  field?  </P> <P> "Every night when I lay me down to sleep," he says.  </P></p>

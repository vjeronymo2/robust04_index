			<p>Police   Officers   <F P=102> PA0806161094 Panama City LA PRENSA in Spanish 8 Jun 94 p 2A </F> <F P=103> PA0806161094 </F> <F P=104>  Panama City LA PRENSA </F> <F P=105>  Spanish </F> BFN   <F P=106> [By Orlando Mendieta] </F>   [Text] The Government of Panama has protested to the U.S.  Embassy because DEA agents held a meeting--without prior  Panamanian authorization--at the border area of Puerto Obaldia  with Colombian and Panamanian police officers to gather  information on subversion and narcotics trafficking.    A Foreign Ministry document that contains a protest note  from  the Panamanian Government to the U.S. Government says that the  meeting was held in the area of Puerto Obaldia, San Blas Indian  territory. The note points out that the meeting was held on 15  and 16 November 1992 when DEA agents Luis Mercado and Isaac  Gallegos went to Puerto Obaldia and met with Colombian and  Panamanian police officers.    During this meeting, which was not authorized by Panama, the  DEA agents covered subjects such as narcotics trafficking,  subversion, communications, weapons, police coordination between  Panama and Colombia, and public health problems. According to  the note, agents Mercado and Gallegos also visited several  government offices in Puerto Obaldia, without receiving  authorization from Panamanian officials or from the officials  responsible for the various areas.    The Panamanian Foreign Ministry note advises the United  States that all meetings of U.S. officials in Panama must be  authorized first by Panamanian officials. The note adds that  such actions could lead to an incident, inasmuch as the national  authorities have orders not to allow foreign officials from  holding meetings in national territory or gathering information  without the prior authorization of the officials in charge.</p>

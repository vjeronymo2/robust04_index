			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Stamp-collector turns to world of business: A look at one of a vital new breed of entrepreneurs IN THE old days of Soviet power, Mr Anatoly Kiryushkin, a trained geologist who earned his living as a graphic artist, channelled his talents into stamp-collecting. But nowadays he has no time for stamps. He has joined a pioneering class of small entrepreneurs, on whom the success of market reforms in the former Soviet Union largely depends. Ten years ago Mr Kiryushkin was predicting a rapid end to the dictatorial communist system under which he and his compatriots were still living. Still cautious, however, after five years of perestroika, he decided to set up a small business only last spring. 'It was then I decided that the changes were irreversible,' he says - though his wife Ira still mocks his business activities because she fears the Communists could still 'come back and take everything away'. Mr Kiryushkin, 40, does not share his wife's fears of a political cataclysm. But given the collapsing distribution system and the prospect of hyperinflation as real market reforms begin, he is glad that his Minsk typesetting bureau, which also produces fonts for desktop publishing, relies on few inputs. 'All we need are our computers, electricity and our brains,' he says. Having increased turnover 10 times to Rbs150,000 for last month, he still sees the greatest threat to his business as high inflation and the fact that his fledgling business is still dependent on a few large customers. When the cost of computers was tripled in November, he was locked into keeping his fees at the same level, but was almost bankrupted when one customer delayed payment for a particularly big contract by five weeks. The company, registered as a small business under Soviet legislation which gave him a two-year tax holiday, is housed in two rooms of a student hostel. He pays a modest rent of Rbs177 a month per room but is looking for better premises 'now that we have more money'. The new office will also have a telephone, Mr Kiryushkin hopes. The local authorities told him he could only have a telephone connected at the hostel if he gave them a brand-new refrigerator, which, when they can be found at all, would cost Rbs5,000, double the official price of installing a telephone. The authorities in newly-independent Belorussia are also proving unpredictable. They are cancelling all tax concessions awarded by the old Soviet authorities to new businesses, says Mr Kiryushkin, but they have not yet published the rates for the taxes they intend to charge for 1992. 'Even the tax authorities say they do not know what they will be asking us for,' he complains. The company, Nestor, employs eight full-time staff and 15 freelances. Basic salaries are relatively low for the new business sector at Rbs600 a month, but thanks to a piece-work system - which he devised to make people work harder than at their old state enterprises - staff take home between three and six times as much. Asked where he learned to run a business at a time when foreign technical assistance is designed to help people learn how to operate a market economy, Mr Kiryushkin says he is indebted to his stamp-collecting - the only form of entrepreneurial activity allowed 10 years ago. The success of his business would also have been unthinkable without the personal contacts which have oiled the heavy machinery of Soviet life for decades. Mr Kiryushkin was able for instance to buy his first computer without a bank loan because a friend ran a computer import enterprise and agreed to let him pay by instalments. Thus, Nestor was started up with Rbs5,000 in personal savings ploughed in by Mr Kiryushkin the chairman with a 55 per cent stake, and Mr Vladimir Kotov, a journalist who is the managing director, with 45 per cent. Mr Kiryushkin is determined to avoid having to borrow money from the bank, because he does not want to be dependent on a bank manager and says he can borrow money more cheaply from other businesses. But despite his firm belief in the success of a market economy, Mr Kiryushkin agrees with his wife that some aspects of the new order are still fragile - in particular the transformation of Belorussia into an independent state now officially called Belarus. A Russian, Mr Kiryushkin is upset that he is now officially a foreigner living in a foreign country, but he also believes that it will not be long before Belarus, an artificially created independent state, rejoins Russia in some form or another.</p>

Some of these were even executed by the guards'  intelligence organ, our sources in Baghdad said.    The families of the executed officers were notified by the  authorities. However, the bodies were not handed over to them.  Meanwhile, the authorities warned the families against  publicizing the issue or holding memorial ceremonies for the  deceased.    Panic prevailed among the Republican Guards as a result of  this campaign. Many officers and soldiers escaped for fear of  liquidation.</p>

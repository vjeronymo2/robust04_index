			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / A snapshot of history: The aims and scope of the FT's new indices There is nothing that so perfectly captures a sense of time or place as the purely ephemeral. A long-forgotten bus ticket or a few phrases of a once-popular song can evoke a reverie of instant nostalgia. For those who care about a country's commercial history, stock market indices produce the same effect. Just reading through the list of companies in the original Financial News Industrial Ordinary Share index catches the flavour of UK industry, circa 1935: Bolsover Collieries, Austin Motor, Dunlop Rubber, Fine Spinners and Doublers, Murex, United Steel, Harrods . . . companies which long ago lost their independence or importance. The Financial News itself, of course, has become part of the Financial Times, which still publishes the index. Some of the companies in that 1935 list still flourish independently today: Bass, Courtaulds (now in two halves), GEC, Guest Keen and Nettlefolds (now GKN), Imperial Chemical Industries, Turner &amp; Newall (now T&amp;N), Vickers, and so on. Several present-day companies contain more than one member of the original list: thus Hanson owns both London Brick and Imperial Tobacco; British Steel is the heir to Dorman Long and United Steel; Coats Viyella owns J&amp;P Coats and Patons &amp; Baldwins; and BTR owns Hawker Siddeley and Dunlop Rubber. The index itself has been overtaken by time. Surpassed in thoroughness by the FT-Actuaries All-Share index of 1962, outflanked in method of calculation by the FT-SE 100 of 1984, it is no longer the central yardstick of the London share market. Its history illustrates how much sentiment can attach to a simple daily number. The index's all-time low was reached on June 26 1940, when it touched 49.4, half its initial value. That day - the low point of British fortunes during the second world war, with the remnants of the British Expeditionary Force just back from Dunkirk and the Luftwaffe appearing daily in the skies about southern England - is thus commemorated in each day's newspaper, in a modest footnote recording the index's highs and lows. One can only hope that the new FT-SE indices, to be launched on Monday, attract no such momentous footnotes. Their aims are, in some respects, more modest than those of the original 30-share index. It was conceived as a way of casting light on the speed of the economy's recovery from the slump of the early 1930s. The new indices are aimed, more modestly, at shedding light on the inner workings of stock market trading: allowing investors to tell whether mid-sized companies are doing better or worse than their larger rivals; and giving them a minute-by-minute guide to which groups of stocks are doing best and worst. The first of those roles will be filled by the new FT-SE Mid 250 index, which covers the 250 companies that rank below the FT-SE 100 in market capitalisation, from roughly Pounds 150m to Pounds 1bn. In some years there is a big difference between the stock market performance of mid-sized companies and that of their bigger rivals. This will now be clearer, day by day. The second role is filled by the minute-by-minute calculation of industry baskets based on the new FT-SE Actuaries 350, shares in the top 350 UK companies (that is, the FT-SE 100 plus the FT-SE Mid 250). Shares are allocated to industry baskets using the sector classification devised for the FT-Actuaries All-Share index. The new indices reflect important changes in the way stock market indices are viewed by professional investors. For many years, the FT collected individual share prices on the floor of the stock exchange, and calculated its indices manually. Much has changed since then. First, the success of the All-Share has led to a general consensus about what is the proper way to construct indices. In the UK, at least, there is now a well-understood set of mathematical principles on which most investors agree indices should be based. Second, indices themselves have come to play a central role in investment management. Despairing of beating the index, an increasing proportion of pensions funds have settled for joining it: that is, investing in every share in a broad-based index, in an effort to match its performance exactly. This style of passive investing, index-matching, has made the indices' hitherto arcane rules on which shares are eligible and which are not a matter of intense concern to the companies concerned. A share excluded from a broad-based index will find itself excluded from the holdings of the index-matchers, and thus deprived of at least one possible source of support. Third, individual share prices are now delivered in real time to anybody prepared to pay the relatively modest fees required by the London Stock Exchange and commercial quote vendors. And fourth, personal computers and spreadsheet technology allow the rapid construction of indices - even real-time ones. The drudgery of calculation has been removed. Over time, this will lead to the development of lots of new indices. Some will meet a real market need and survive; others will prove to have only a limited interest. Some will be deliberately intended to have only a short life-span, such as the FT Election Share Index, constructed during the last election campaign to show day-to-day movements in politically sensitive stocks. Taken together, all these developments change the role of the index provider. The emphasis shifts from the sheer wonder of calculating the index at all to the need to design and manage the index in a way that best meets the needs of investors. In the light of these trends, a working party set up by the London Stock Exchange, in conjunction with the FT and the actuarial profession, has examined the way indices cover the UK market. It was chaired by Mr Gordon Bagot, of the WM Company (a firm that specialises in measuring the stock market performance of pension funds). The new indices are one result of the working party's recommendations. But in a sense they are only the tip of the iceberg. Just as important is the way the FT-SE, the new indices, and the All-Share will now form part of a coherent set of indices, with common rules for eligibility, and a common structure of management and supervision. That is the dull stuff of committees and sub-clauses. Fifty years from now, however, someone will come across the companies in the FT-SE Mid 250 printed in yesterday's paper, and they will marvel at the nostalgia evoked by some of those names: Laura Ashley, Body Shop, Eurotunnel, Iceland Frozen Foods, Lonrho, Queens Moat Houses, Scottish Television, Trafalgar House . . . Wasn't the 1990s a wonderfully romantic period?</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Increased sales help push EdF to FFr2.5bn ELECTRICITE de France (EdF), the state-controlled utility group, achieved a 32 per cent increase in net profits to FFr2.5bn (Dollars 452.3m) in 1992, from FFr1.9bn in 1991. Mr Gilles Menage, chairman, said the rise was due to increased sales of electricity (both in France and other countries), to lower primary prices and to debt reduction. EdF, which has made significant productivity improvements in recent years, promised earlier this month to start cutting its prices in France by 1.25 per cent a year. Sales rose to FFr177.5bn last year from FFr171.4bn in 1991 while gross operating profits climbed to FFr77. from FFr71.5bn. In France, which accounts for 86 per cent of turnover, sales grew by 3.6 per cent to FFr159.7bn last year, in spite of despite the unusually mild climate. International sales rose by 3 per cent to FFr12bn. Although EdF suffered a reduction in demand in some markets, such as Germany, it managed to compensated through price increases. The group plans to continue its international expansion outside France but has opted to do so through joint ventures, notably in Spain and eastern Germany rather than by selling electricity directly as it does in its UK operation. Mr Menage said that EdF, which will have to invest heavily at the start of the next century to renew its nuclear power plants, had held investment expenditure at FFr32.4bn in 1992, compared with FFr32.3bn in 1991. This helped it to reduce debt to FFr194.8bn last year from FFr214bn in 1991.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAL LUTHERAN FALLS SHORT AGAINST SONOMA STATE, 17-9  </P> <P> It was a sparkling afternoon in wine country, but Cal Lutheran died on the vine  Saturday in a nonconference football opener at Sonoma State.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen lost, 17-9, after failing on a fourth-quarter two-point conversion  and then coming up short on two last-ditch attempts to score.  </P> <P> Sonoma State overcame seven turnovers and 16 penalties in front of a Campus  Field gathering of 1,374 fans. It was Sonoma State's first victory in the  schools' eight-game series.  </P> <P> "It hurt when we lost the conversion," Cal Lutheran Coach Bob Shoup said. "Then  you're playing for the tie instead of the win."  </P> <P> With 4:54 remaining, Cal Lutheran scored on a 15-yard pass from Dan Nagelmann  to Tony Leogrande on fourth and 10.  </P> <P> The Kingsmen lined up to kick the extra point but a Sonoma State defender  rushed offside so quickly that he, and not Cal Lutheran kicker Greg Maw, kicked  the ball. The resultant penalty cut the distance to the goal line in half, so  Cal Lutheran opted to go for two points.  </P> <P> But Nagelmann's pass for Shane Hawkins was intercepted.  </P> <P> "I just read it wrong," said Nagelmann, who relieved starter Tim Zeddies late  in the third quarter. "He was going straight for the corner and I thought he  was going to go inside."  </P> <P> With CLU trailing, 17-9, the defense held, and the Kingsmen got the ball on  their 20 with more than two minutes remaining.  </P> <P> Another Nagelmann-to-Leogrande pass moved the Kingsmen to their 41, but Cal  Lutheran surrendered the ball on downs.  </P> <P> Again the defense held, but Nagelmann was sacked as the last seconds ticked off  the clock.  </P> <P> In the first half, Cal Lutheran had many scoring opportunities but the Kingsmen  could generate only three points on five Sonoma State turnovers -- three  interceptions and two fumbles.  </P> <P> Midway through the second quarter, Cal Lutheran safety Nicko Rising made a  diving interception at the Kingsmen 14. The offense capitalized with its only  sustained drive of the first half, a 16-play march that culminated in a 25-yard  field goal by Maw.  </P> <P> "We played pretty good defense in the first half," Shoup said. "I felt our  defense was very opportunistic, but the offense didn't take advantage. Then we  let them slip away in the third quarter."  </P> <P> Sonoma State's leading returning rusher, Chris Vogler, strained his left  quadriceps in the first quarter and the Cossack offense struggled.  </P> <P> Sonoma State switched quarterbacks to begin the second half, Danny Calcagno  replacing starter Steve Mytinger.  </P> <P> Mytinger, a drop-back passer, had been largely ineffective, but Calcagno  (5-feet-10, 175 pounds) sparked a 17-point third-quarter rally.  </P> <P> "They just rolled out and were dragging the tight end, and we didn't do the  job," said inside linebacker Cary Caulfield, who intercepted a pass and  recovered a fumble.  </P> <P> Caulfield also punted, and he kicked more often than the Radio City Rockettes,  although he didn't look quite as good doing it.  </P> <P> He averaged 22 yards on eight punts, had two blocked and saw another returned  for a touchdown.  </P> <P> "One of the things we want to improve this year is special teams," said Tim  Walsh, who is in his first season as Sonoma State's coach.  </P> <P> Shoup began his 28th season at Cal Lutheran on a down note and will now point  his team toward a 2 p.m. home game Saturday against St. Mary's.  </P></p>

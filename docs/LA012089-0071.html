			<p><P> January 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MEAT PUPPETS AIM FOR THE MAJOR LEAGUES  </P> <P> In front of a Roxy crowd conspicuous for the number of major-label talent  scouts on hand Wednesday, the Meat Puppets was on its best behavior -- little  of the indulgent spaceyness and carelessness that had plagued some past  appearances and plenty of the glistening, compact, left-of-center rock that put  the band at the top of the underground a couple years ago.  </P> <P> Good thing, too. After spending those couple years unable to make good on its  major-league potential, this could be the Phoenix trio's last chance for a shot  at the big time. Given those circumstances, you could almost hear the label  reps ticking off the band's pluses and minuses in their heads during the first  of two sets Wednesday:  </P> <P>  -- A plus for good vibes; the Puppets evoke the sunny desert mind-set as well  as the Beach Boys do the sand 'n' surf scene.  </P> <P>  -- Another plus for musicianship; Curt Kirkwood is a phenomenally nimble  guitar player, and the interplay he creates with his bassist brother Chris and  drummer Derrick Bostrom is often complex, and yet still sloppily (in a good  way) spontaneous. This is true throughout the band's range, from shimmering  ditties to head-banging crunchers.  </P> <P>  -- One more plus for intangibles; there's a certain endearing quality to these  three long-haired ragamuffins.  </P> <P> But on the other hand:  </P> <P>  -- A minus for singing; Curt Kirkwood doesn't just strain for the high notes,  he strains for every note.  </P> <P>  -- A minus for depth; the most prominent -- and sometimes sole -- emotion  evident in the Puppets' songs is whimsy, though some new material at least felt  (words were hard to pick out) like the band was exploring new territories.  </P> <P> Added up, the Meat Puppets landed in the plus column Wednesday, a band that  still deserves a shot at the majors.

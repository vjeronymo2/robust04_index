			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MUSIC  </P> <P> Expecting to hear the opening of Brahms' Violin Concerto, Music Director Andre  Previn raised his arms Thursday to begin his morning rehearsal with the Los  Angeles Philharmonic. What did he hear? The familiar strains of "Happy Birthday  to You," as played by 100-plus members of the orchestra. Thursday was Previn's  60th birthday -- he was born in Berlin, April 6, 1929 -- and the date was not  overlooked by his Philharmonic colleagues. At the break following the Brahms  rehearsal, Previn, violin soloist Joshua Bell and the orchestra enjoyed  birthday cake. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

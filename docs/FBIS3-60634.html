			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yi Kang-tok] </F>   [Text] It is the ROK Government's first assessment that the  North Korean position expressed at the 3 December U.S.-North  Korean working-level contact had a positive side but was  unsatisfactory. The government said it would be able to announce  its official position on the North Korean response early next  week after fully reviewing which part of it is positive and  which part is unsatisfactory.    Accordingly, the government will likely hold a policy  meeting  with the United States in the near future in order to decide a  position of the ROK and the United States on the North Korean  proposal.    Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said today that the North  Korean response was not fully satisfactory [chungbun hajinun  anchiman] but it is necessary to review it.    In his supplementary explanation on the North Korean  position, Nuclear Ambassador Kim Sam-hun said that North Korea's  position was insufficient to meet preconditions [chonje chogon],  thus hinting that North Korea did not fully accepted our side's  demands as preconditions -- North Korea's acceptance of ordinary  inspections [tongsang sachal] and the South-North envoy exchange.    Ambassador Kim said, however, that the ROK and the United  States aim at continuing to make efforts to resolve the North  Korean nuclear issue through dialogue and that they will take  countermeasures [teaung pangan] after modulating [choyul] both  sides' positions. By saying so, he implied that several more  contacts between the United States and North Korea may be held  in the future.</p>

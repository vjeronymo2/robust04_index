			<p>BFN     [Text] The 29 Ukrainian Army armored personnel carriers  that arrived in Simferopol have been distributed around various  parts of the city, a RIA correspondent learned this morning from  (Petr Chernyekhevich), the Crimean president's advisor on  military affairs. He said that a group from the Ukrainian  Internal Affairs Ministry made yet another attempt to enter the  Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry premises. Their minister  issued an instruction appointing them to various top posts in  place of their Crimean counterparts. Guards at the building  prevented this, however. Law enforcement staff report from the  grassroots that they intend to fulfill only the instructions of  Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's internal affairs minister.    It also became known today that Major-General Stepanov,  deputy commander of the Odessa District, accompanied by 50 staff  officers, is arriving in Crimea. They will inspect the  Ukrainian 52d Army Corps, which is garrisoned on the peninsula.    A delegation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council is expected to  arrive in Crimea.    Petr Chernyekhevich confirmed that all vital facilities in  Simferopol are under reinforced guard. Crimean Cossacks are  carrying out guard duties alongside militiamen, on a voluntary  basis.</p>

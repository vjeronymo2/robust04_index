			<p>BFN     [Text] The leader of Russia's Liberal Democratic Party  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy intends to demand that the Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev resign for signing the Partnership for  Peace accord. He said in an exclusive interview with Interfax  on Thursday that "Kozyrev had no right to sign this program  since the Duma spoke unequivocally against it."    Kozyrev signed the paper at NATO's Headquarters in Brussels,  thereby making Russia a party to the NATO initiative.    Zhirinovskiy threatened to abrogate the treaty since it was  not legally binding. The signature of one person "when  parliament spoke against is meaningless", he maintained.    He also argued that "no state will take the document  seriously since the legislature objects to it." Without  agreement with it, any signing is absurd, Zhirinovskiy declared.    He also announced that the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party]  faction has a nominee to the foreign minister's office.</p>

			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> LINDA BLAIR SEES NEW DEMONS  </P> <P> Actress Linda Blair is back and she says the country needs to exorcise a few  demons. "What irks me is the street gangs who roam around beating up on  people," she told the New York Daily News.  </P> <P> "I would put them all in a box and ship them off to one of the Eastern European  countries, where they would learn how good it is to be an American," said  Blair, who starred as the poor, possessed waif in the 1973 movie "The  Exorcist." She isn't so sure, however, about how to handle the homeless  population.  </P> <P> "We've got to do something about them," she said. "I don't know what -- but  anything." Blair co-stars in an upcoming spoof of "The Exorcist" titled  "Repossessed," in which the devil once again takes control of her.  </P></p>

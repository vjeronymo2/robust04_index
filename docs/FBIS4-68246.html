			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vitaliy Tsygichko, professor, doctor of </F> technical sciences, under rubric "Analysis": "What Kind of Army  Do We Need?: On the Political Content of Russian Military  Doctrine"]    [Text] The country's Armed Forces are a very  important tool of national security, and so the most acute  question at the current stage of creating a new Russian Army is  what kind of army this should be, from whom and how it should  defend us, what its goals and missions must be for the near and  far term, and in what direction structural perestroyka of the  Armed Forces will be accomplished in accordance with their new  missions.    These questions must be answered by Russian military  doctrine, the publication of which has been awaited impatiently  both in Russia as well as abroad. The doctrine finally has been  published and a broad discussion and interpretation of it is  under way in the West, but this document's publication  essentially has gone unnoticed by the mass media in our country.  The article by Igor Serebryakov (NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, 8 February  1994) is an exception.    Inasmuch as Russian military doctrine is a reflection of our  state's overall national goals and policy, then the new military  policy of the United States and NATO, which is in the stage of  formation, also will be built in accordance with this document.    An analysis of debates being conducted in NATO and the  United  States on the fundamentals of future military policy attests  that a rather fierce struggle is going on between proponents of  a policy from a position of strength, who stubbornly refuse to  see the realities of the changed world on the assumption that  the cold war has not yet ended, and proponents of an alliance  with Russia as a future partner of the West that is extremely  important politically, economically and militarily.    Depending on its content, Russian military doctrine can  substantially reinforce the position of one side and largely  determine the West's long-range economic and military policy  toward Russia.    A very important foreign policy function of military  doctrine  is to create a new democratic image of Russia as a state  friendly toward former ideological enemies and with common  interests in maintaining international stability and peace. The  doctrine's political content, which spells out the state's  long-range strategy in the national security area, acts as  practical confirmation of the country's proclaimed political  course.    Of no less importance is military doctrine's internal state  function, called upon to formulate principles and priorities in  the building and functioning of the state's military system and  to substantiate long-range military organizational development  strategy, which takes into account real threats to the country's  security and its economic capabilities.    Igor Serebryakov's analysis indicates that the published  doctrine fulfills neither a foreign policy function nor an  internal state function. It is difficult to disagree with this  inasmuch as the doctrine does not answer to the substance of a  single one of the questions posed above.    Let us refer to the political content of the military  doctrine.    In the traditional understanding of this term, it is absent  in the submitted text of the doctrine. The document proclaims  only some very general principles of state military policy  irrespective of any kind of analysis of the real geopolitical  situation and its development trends. Russia's place and  interests in the new multipolar world are not considered; its  attitude and long-range policy with respect to the former main  enemy, the United States and NATO, are not defined; and the  possibility of building collective security systems and of  Russia's place in them is not evaluated. Without such an  analysis, it is naturally impossible to indicate real and  potential allies and enemies, predict threats and determine  their directions and nature. All this means that there is no  basis for developing fundamental doctrinal provisions such as an  evaluation of theaters of possible wars and their presumed  nature, likely forms and methods of warfare, possible  participants of a conflict, and other provisions determining the  real content of military policy and military organizational  development as guides to practical activity in the national  security area. Without these fundamental elements of military  doctrine, the document that was submitted turned into a  political declaration that is empty, but unfortunately far from  safe for the country's interests.    The basic reason for the absence of a specific political  content of the military doctrine unquestionably is the fact that  until now there has been no document spelling out the country's  long-range foreign policy course. This is connected above all  with the absence of a legislatively incorporated Russian  political doctrine reflecting the world and political outlook of  the new state authority and its views on certain trends in world  development and Russia's place in this process.    Military organizational development is a lengthy, sluggish  and very costly process which cannot be oriented toward  momentary interests of authorities and transient internal and  external factors. In this context the authors' statement that  this doctrine is a document for the transition period appears  groundless at the very least. Provisions contained in doctrine  are realized over decades, and so they must be based on a well  grounded, long-range strategy comprising the foundation of state  activity in the domestic and foreign policy area.    I am far from thinking that the military doctrine's  developers do not realize everything said above. It is quite  obvious that this document is strictly opportunistic and certain  circles are using it in an attempt above all to incorporate a  new domestic political function of the Armed Forces, i.e., that  role which they played in the national tragedy of 3-4 October of  last year. Another task is to obtain maximum possible funds and  the freedom of choosing directions of military organizational  development in the corporate interests of the military  establishment.    The new military doctrine evoked bewilderment and great  cauton abroad, because of its vagueness. Many western experts  interpret the lack of desire to express oneself clearly  concerning relations with NATO, the United States, Japan and  other power centers and the absence of clearly formulated  military policy priorities in the doctrine as an attempt to  conceal its true goals and intentions.    The change in Russia's nuclear policy causes alarm. The  principle of non-first use of nuclear weapons in any possible  military conflict as proclaimed in the previous doctrine was  replaced by a provision envisaging the possibility of delivering  a preventive nuclear strike. This is perceived as a challenge  and a veiled threat to the West. There is no doubt that the  published document reinforces mistrust of the foreign policy  course officially proclaimed by Russia and provides weighty  arguments for our ill-wishers.    The circumstance that the military doctrine is equally  suitable both for democrat Yeltsin and for extreme right  nationalist Zhirinovskiy also causes concern. There is no trace  of any kind of political orientation in it, and it would be  naive to assume this is by chance. Legislative incorporation of  the possibility of Army intervention in the country's internal  affairs makes it a very important foreign policy factor that is  potentially dangerous for incipient Russian democracy. The West  sees this circumstance as evidence of political instability in  the country and a result of the uncertainty of Russia's foreign  policy course, which in itself represents a danger.    During the cold war years a persistent defensist mentality,  presuming the presence of a constant danger of enemy attack,  formed both in Russia and the West. When the ideological  confrontation ended, the military both here in Russia and in the  West began seeking new threats and is attempting to reanimate  old ones.    The theory of multilateral strategic balance arose and now  is  being actively developed on this basis. That very same  confrontation and the supposition that the one who has a  military advantage can use military force to achieve its  interests is the basis of this theory. The question of the  substance of these interests and reasons for the possible  appearance of contradictions which may lead to a wide-scale  military clash or to world war is carefully avoided.    The presence of several opposing alliances or countries is  presumed instead of the bilateral rivalry which faded into the  past. Within the framework of such a model, each side naturally  attempts to change the balance of forces in its own favor for  purposes of greater security, chiefly by increasing military  might, i.e., with the help of that very same arms race.    In other words, the new strategic stability model preserves  old approaches inherent to the cold war period and again  proposes a balance of power as a guarantee of security. Such a  multilateral strategic balance model became the basis of  Russia's new military doctrine, although it is quite obvious  that this approach clearly contradicts the geopolitical  situation which has been forming since the USSR's disintegration  and contradicts the political course of the majority of states  (including Russia), which proclaimed an aspiration for creating  a collective security system based on cooperation, not  confrontation in the military area.    In my opinion, a fundamentally new document should be  developed in place of the published text of military doctrine,  free of the deficiencies examined above and unequivocally  spelling out the strategy for ensuring Russia's national  security and specific directions for military organizational  development.    Above all, the doctrine's political content should be  developed not in private, as has been the case up to now, but  publicly, with the involvement of a wide circle of specialists  and the interested public. It should register clearly the aim of  military cooperation with the West as the general goal and  long-range orientation of Russian military policy. It must be  realized that Russia's general line toward integration into the  world market economy cannot be implemented without striving for  cooperation with the West in the military area.    This fundamental provision must steer the doctrine from a  mythical danger on the part of the West to the real threats and  possibly future threats to Russia's national interests and to  its citizens. Today the main threat stems from political  instability on former USSR territory and from militant  nationalism and separatism. One also cannot forget the potential  threat to our country in Asia and about protection of Russian  interests in the Far East.    Russia's entry into the world economic community makes it a  natural ally of the West in the defense of common interests, but  this by no means signifies that Russia does not have its own  national interests, which may not coincide with or may  contradict those of other countries or blocs. As a great  Euro-Asiatic power, Russia represents an important part of the  world balance of forces, which ensures consideration of national  and regional interests in a multipolar world. Russia's basic  line toward friendly relations of partnership with the United  States and NATO in the military-political and military-technical  area and their joint actions in defense of common interests must  not contradict the independence and interests of the Russian  center of power. Russia's military might should give it not only  a guarantee of security, but also conditions for equal  participation in world affairs and an opportunity to defend its  own national interests. The new military doctrine should take  full account of a reasonable balance between common interests  with the West and Russia's own interests. The question of the  rational degree of Russia's military integration with the West,  which meets the country's national interests and geopolitical  status, also must be resolved in accordance with this balance.    Possible ways of building a collective security system with  consideration of today's realities should be formulated from  this standpoint. The Russian Army's place and sphere of possible  responsibility in this system and a realistic program for  adjusting military cooperation with former enemies, leading step  by step to guaranteed mutual security, must be stated.    An aspect of military doctrine such as excluding Army  influence on society's political life and turning it into a  guarantor of internal stability and a reliable tool for  protecting the democratic state system from external threat also  is extremely urgent.    The possibility of Army intervention in the country's  internal affairs should be excluded legislatively, and this  provision should be reinforced by socioeconomic conditions of  the Armed Forces existence. Restoring the Army's worthy position  in Russian society is a very important means of accomplishing  this priority task. No Russian democratic statehood will succeed  in being built without this. In all times and eras, only when a  good material situation was provided for officers and men was  the Army a reliable support for state authority and did not  intervene in politics.    If this condition is not fulfilled, if officers and men drag  out a miserable existence and regular personnel are not sure of  their future, which is not secured materially, then the Army is  quickly politicized, turning into a dangerous political force  inclined to support those who promise to improve its situation.  Leaders of antidemocratic forces understand this full well and  are taking advantage of the situation at hand for their  political goals. They unfolded broad, pseudopatriotic propaganda  for returning the status of a great military power to Russia,  for a special antiwestern path of Russian development, and for a  totalitarian, postcommunist form of state government capable of  returning the past importance and social prestige to the Army.  On the right flank of this movement stand such odious political  figures as Zhirinovskiy, whose totalitarian ideas have support  in the Army and in a considerable portion of the population.    The situation at hand is leading to the Army's moral decay  and to a drop in discipline, reliability and combat  effectiveness of troops. The best young officers are leaving the  Army, which unquestionably will affect its future. There is no  moral-political unity in the Army itself, nor can there be under  the conditions at hand. Officer meetings have turned into  political clubs, which contradicts the very essence of Army life  and creates the real danger of Army intervention in politics.  The deepening economic crisis and deterioration in the material  situation of regular Army personnel objectively contribute to a  growth in the number of proponents of rightist forces in its  ranks. Doctrinal provisions allowing Army intervention in  domestic political processes only exacerbate trends dangerous  for our fragile democracy.    A return to a totalitarian form of government invariably  will  lead to reanimation of ideological confrontation with the West  and to a new cold war. Russia's path to integration into the  world economic community will be closed for a long time and a  real danger of war will reappear.    Under conditions of international economic isolation there  can be no mention of any kind of transition to a market economy,  inasmuch as, rephrasing the familiar clich&eacute; of Soviet  propaganda, it is impossible to build capitalism in one  individual country. It is quite obvious that such a prospect  contradicts fundamental and most important national interests of  the country and its citizens.    Under conditions of the economic crisis being experienced by  the country and the rigid limitation of military expenditures  connected with it, the most advisable way to preserve well  supplied, combat effective Armed Forces dedicated to the regime  is above all their sharp reduction to a level ensuring the most  necessary security needs: security of borders, maintenance of  combat readiness of minimum strategic nuclear forces,  preservation of the necessary nucleus of branches of the Armed  Forces, and creation of small rapid reaction forces based on the  most combat effective formations of ground troops. In the  military-political situation at hand, Russia can fully perform  missions of defense by having an Army of no more than one  million persons. A new system of the country's mobilization  preparation should serve as a guarantee of security under  conditions of a sharp reduction in the Armed Forces.    The new military doctrine could incorporate the proposed  numerical strength of the Armed Forces as one of the goals of  military reform and thereby facilitate a solution both to  political and economic problems of the country.    A radical reduction in the Army is a complex, lengthy,  painful process engendering a multitude of social problems.  Great material expenditures, connected above all with provision  of housing, pay and work to the officers and warrant officers  being discharged, are needed to resolve these problems. But  these are necessary social costs which must be undertaken for  the sake of preserving political stability and future economic  advantages of military reform. If the government and parliament  will not undertake these expenditures, they may lose control  over processes occurring in the Army, and this can have  catastrophic political consequences.    The problem of manpower acquisition also will disappear with  a reduction in the Army, when it will be possible to call up  only literate, cultured young people wishing to serve in the  Armed Forces.    A small Russian Army will be fully capable of beginning a  gradual transition to professional principles of manpower  acquisition on a contract basis, which will permit a  considerable increase in its combat capabilities, political  attitude and morale.    Such an Army will be a reliable support for Russia's  democratic statehood and will be capable of reliably protecting  the country's interests.</p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): New helmsman for Chicago's Navistar Navistar, the Chicago-based truck and engine maker, has teetered on the brink of financial disaster more than once in the past decade, and each time James Cotting, an intense man with a flair for finance, has brought the company back, writes Laurie Morse. The 61-year-old Cotting helped pull the company, once known as International Harvester, out of Dollars 4bn in debt in 1981, and went on to oversee a restructuring plan that saw the sale of the core agricultural machinery line, and the Harvester name, to Tenneco in 1985.

He was made head of Navistar's engine division in 1983, and became the company's chief operating officer in 1991. Although not faced with an immediate financial crisis, Horne's challenge will be to bring Navistar's truck manufacturing group up to snuff with the industry.

'Jack Horne is an operating guy credited with making a success of Navistar's diesel engine business,' says John McGinty, an analyst with CS First Boston.

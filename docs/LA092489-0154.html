			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY DROPOUT FIGURES CALL FOR A FEW LESSONS  </P> <P> The state Department of Education figures released last week show the average  dropout rate for all Orange County students is 16.9%, nearly 6% lower than the  state average of 22.7%.  </P> <P> Averages can be deceiving.  </P> <P> The more significant statistic in the state report is that 33% of the Latino  students in the county drop out, usually before their junior year of high  school. That is about 2 1/2 times greater than the 13% dropout rate for Anglo  students. In some school districts, as many as four or five of every 10 Latino  students do not stay long enough to get a high school diploma. The frustrating  thing about the three-year statewide survey is that although the state has been  able to determine the most realistic dropout figures possible, it still cannot  pinpoint exactly why students drop out, why the gap is so great between Anglo  and Latino students, and why the dropout rates for Latinos vary so much between  school districts.  </P> <P> The one thing that is certain is that it is not just the students who left  school that failed. The schools did too. And so has the community.  </P> <P> Some students quit because they cannot keep up with the work or lack basic  skills. Others become bored or get involved in gang activity. Some students  from poor families must leave to take jobs to help out at home. Girls also quit  to get married or because they became pregnant. Whatever the reason, dropout  rates for all minority students exceed those of Anglo students, and past  studies have shown that 80% of the Latino and black students in the state have  fallen behind by the third grade. And fewer blacks and Latinos who do graduate  go on to colleges or universities.  </P> <P> Regardless of ethnic background, the result affects not only the individual  student, but also the entire community. Dropouts lacking education or  marketable skills are stuck with lower-paying jobs -- or no job at all. The  community bears the economic and social costs of less productive residents,  reduced tax income, more costly social service programs and fewer qualified  workers.  </P> <P> It is time that educators and residents learned a few lessons in how to keep  more students in school. Potential dropouts must be recognized early, and  enthusiastic programs that increase their confidence, keep them interested in  learning and that involve the parents as well as students should be part of  every grade school. Without them, the gap between Anglo and minority dropout  rates -- and productive, successful lives -- will remain so seriously out of  proportion.  </P></p>

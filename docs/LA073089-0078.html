			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAKING MOOKIE;  </P> <P> DO THE RIGHT THING BY SPIKE LEE WITH LISA JONES (FIRESIDE/SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER:  $10.95; 297 PP., PAPER)  </P> <P> In his disarmingly candid tie-in with the film of the same name, movie maker  Spike Lee (writing with Lisa Jones) happily functions as his own strongest  booster. Journalist Joseph Gelmis, Lee notes, "considers me one of the most  important film makers in the world today. . . . I've felt this, but hey, now  somebody else has seen it also." If self-confidence is the key to success (as  the shrinks tell us), this guy will go far.  </P> <P> He already has, of course, and along the way he's probably needed every ounce  of that ferocious self-assurance. The sex comedy, "She's Gotta Have It" (1987),  and the campus musical, "School Daze" (1988), are milestones of black American  movie making, produced on teensy budgets in the face of daunting obstacles and  reaching wide mixed audiences.  </P> <P> There has never been anything quite like these films, with their undiluted  expressions of black culture, outlook, anger. The films are made for a  sophisticated black art-house audience -- a crowd that the studios didn't  believe existed until Spike Lee brought it to them on a silver platter. "What  we're doing is revolutionary and courageous," Lee writes, with some justice.  "No other black people in the industry are doing what we're doing."  </P> <P> The "Right Thing" book contains Lee's screenplay (which diverges from the  finished product in interesting ways) and the journal he kept as he was writing  it. The day-to-day record is full of fascinating false starts and variations.  Lee himself was initially set to play the troublemaker Buggin' Out, for  example. As casting choices shift almost from page to page, the picture grows  darker; characters evolve toward something more truthful, if less overtly  "sympathetic." The ending inexorably darkens. At one point, a character who  dies and stays dead in the finished version was pegged to reappear -- wearing a  neck brace -- for an upbeat finale.  </P> <P> Lee is a gifted manipulator of the film medium, and "Do the Right Thing,"  despite some narrative clumsiness, is his most controlled and effective  picture. His own pivotal performance as Mookie, a pizza delivery man, will  cement the personal comic celebrity that has helped his career chug forward  even between pictures. (Directors who are also ingratiating performers, from  Woody Allen onward, naturally have a leg up.) Set in Brooklyn's  Bedford-Stuyvesant section on a blisteringly hot day, "Right Thing" builds to a  climactic race riot. (A few boneheads were even expecting that the movie would  provoke violence. If anything, it will forestall some incidents, by offering an  alternative catharsis.)  </P> <P> The book is instructive here: Lee is never seen wondering how race relations  ought to unfold. He considers news reports about racial incidents in Miami and  New Jersey, and struggles to honor the facts. His attitudes aren't even  ambiguous. He complains about blacks who blame all their problems on whites and  on racism (although he has a knee-jerk tendency toward this sort of thing  himself) and declares: "There are no winners in this one. Blacks burn down the  pizzeria, but so what? . . . The conditions that we live under have not gotten  any better."  </P> <P> Lee knows better than anybody that a lot of youthful black energy is being  misdirected. The movie is partly about how and why black rage gets sidetracked,  deflected onto easy targets because the real culprits are too far away or too  powerful. Only the tag-end quote from Malcolm X, who validates violence as  self-defense, seems to blur the issue, because the riot in the movie scarcely  qualifies.  </P> <P> Under the prideful surface of "Do the Right Thing," some observers have  detected a scathing strain of black self-criticism that goes way beyond the  controversial depiction of a caste system dividing light-skinned and  dark-skinned black collegians in "School Daze." The book confirms that Lee was  thinking hard thoughts even about the character he plays himself. Thus:  </P> <P> "(His sister) is bothered that Mookie -- like many black youths -- has no  vision. (She) constantly yells at him that he can't see beyond the next day,  the end of his nose. It's the truth. The future might be too scary for kids  like Mookie, so they don't think about it. They live for the moment, because  there is nothing they feel they can do about the future."  </P> <P> Lee's drive to bring full-strength black material to American movie screens  accounts for a lot of his appeal, and not just to black audiences. His  "Afrocentricity" is crucial. The absence of crossover dreams gives his films a  distinctive authenticity. There's been no attempt to translate the story into  homogenized "universal" terminology. The result of their specificity has been,  oddly enough, to broaden their appeal: Pictures with a distinctive outlook are  so rare in today's happy-face Hollywood that we respond eagerly.  </P> <P> Lee's isn't the truth of objectivity and consensus -- a journalist's or  sociologists truth. It's an artist's truth, roiling with fruitful  contradictions. A personal frame of reference like this would not seem  startling in an Italian-American or WASP director, but to the great discredit  of the American film biz the black version is still a novelty.  </P> <P> Not for long.  </P></p>

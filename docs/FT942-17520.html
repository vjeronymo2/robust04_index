			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Sport: Just Himself - Book review Christy O'Connor neither won a major championship nor assembled a good Ryder Cup record. So if crude statistics are the measure then the Irishman will struggle for a place in history as those who witnessed his genius diminish with the years. Thankfully, there is not yet a shortage of such witnesses to counterbalance the statistical distortions, and they have queued up to contribute to a diligently researched biography of the great man as he approaches his 70th year. It is entitled Himself (Colorman, Pounds 16.99), the name given to O'Connor many years ago by his supporters in recognition of the fact that he never tried to be anyone else. Edited by Seamus Smith, sports editor of the Irish Press newspaper, the book pieces together O'Connor's life from chapters written by various golf journalists and fellow professionals. Like Ballesteros, some of O'Connor's best moments in his career came at Lytham. In his first three Opens over the Lancashire links he never finished outside the top six, and last year, aged 68, he still finished tied for 8th in the British Seniors Championship. His last Open appearance also came at Lytham in 1979, which marked the first of Ballesteros' two wins. So why did O'Connor never win a major championship? Well he failed to win an American major because he never played in any. O'Connor received 18 invitations to the US Masters at Augusta and turned them down because he could not afford the fare. But he did play in 28 Opens and led a few, too. The consensus, including O'Connor's view, is that he tried too hard. O'Connor won just about everything else he played in over a long, long career. His record 10 Ryder Cup appearances is testament to that longevity. Even at 59, he still finished 26th in the Irish Open. Two years ago, he was asked to partner Jack Nicklaus to mark the completion of a course Nicklaus built in Kilkenny. The organiser feared the ageing O'Connor would be shown up in front of his own people as the course is of a daunting length Jack shot 74. Christie shot 72.</p>

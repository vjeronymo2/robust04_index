			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Philips slashes CD-I list prices in US PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, yesterday slashed the US list price of its latest consumer electronics product, compact disc-interactive (CD-I), to Dollars 699 from Dollars 999, less than a year after launching the first CD-I player in the US. The company said the move was part of plans to double the number of US retail outlets carrying CD-I players to 2,000 by Christmas and to start a national advertising campaign. Philips declined to say whether it would reduce prices in the UK, where the product was launched in the spring, or in continental Europe, where the players will become available in September. The company, whose results in the 1992 first half were hit by price-cutting in its consumer electronics unit, said US sales of CD-I were developing 'according to expectations'.</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Interest rate controls lifted Bank interest rates in Japan were yesterday freed from final government controls, as the finance ministry completed a series of deregulatory measures begun in 1985. Interest rates on ordinary and savings deposits rose slightly above peviously fixed levels, in line with the general upward drift in market interest rates. Rates on ordinary bank deposits, which were a uniform 0.22 per cent a year, increased to between 0.27 per cent and 0.3 per cent at the country's main commercial banks. Rates on time savings deposits rose by between 0.05 and 0.1 percentage points. Until 1985, virtually all Japanese interest rates were fixed by the government, as it sought to keep borrowing and lending rates low to finance post-war economic reconstruction. But, under pressure from foreign governments and financial institutions, the finance ministry allowed a limited deregulation of interest rates that year. The deregulation will put further competitive pressure on banks, already weakened by bad debts.</p>

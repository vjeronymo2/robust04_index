			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Personal View: Can aid buy Palestinian peace? Even before the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organisation accord on the principles for peace negotiations was concluded, the US and European countries rushed to offer massive economic assistance to the nascent Palestinian autonomous entity. It is gratifying that policy makers realise, at last, that economic growth is vital to the success of the peace process. Yet it is also to be feared that this aid will not only be wasted, but may even increase political rivalries in an already fractious Palestinian society. There are signs that donor countries are aware of the risks involved in funnelling massive aid through the PLO, an organisation that has hardly excelled in managing its own considerable treasure. However, concern about how efficiently aid will be used, albeit important, misses the more fundamental issue: the impact any large amount of aid, however well administered, is likely to have on the politics and society of recipients. Massive aid inflates an anti-productive public sector and inflames political competition for the resources it makes available. In the Middle East - where statism already exacts a high economic toll even in such wealthy countries as Saudi-Arabia, and where politics are not blessed by moderation - large amounts of aid tend to have grave repercussions. It is encouraging that the World Bank, which was put in charge of implementing the aid from western governments to the Palestinians, has endorsed reliance on markets and private initiative. It also seems determined to provide aid only for infrastructure development, such as roads, water purification and sewage systems. Western recognition of the dangers inherent in aid was underscored by the British foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, at a recent London conference. He asserted that donor nations were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the past. They will do all they can, he claimed, to ensure that aid promotes private sector initiative. Such sentiments are good news, so far as they go. But the World Bank will have to struggle against the grain of most European bureaucracies if it is to translate its good intentions into effective policy. Unfortunately, these bureaucracies are inclined to encourage political meddling in the economy, ostensibly to correct market failures. Their encouragement of a dominant public sector may pose a real danger to the economic success of the autonomous entity - and, ultimately, to the peace process. Furthermore, worries remain not just about how the aid will be used, but about its size. The fledgling Palestinian administration could easily be overwhelmed by the political results of a flood of easy money. The economic agreement reached between Israel and the PLO in Paris does seem to offer a promising opportunity for private sector development. It posits open borders between the parties and should facilitate a fair degree of movement of people and goods among them. Nevertheless, beneficial co-operation cannot materialise without structural reforms in Israel's own economy. Since Israeli markets are highly regulated and dominated by powerful monopolies and oligopolies, which render market access difficult even for small, or newly formed Israeli enterprises, freedom of access granted to the Palestinians will not be as beneficial as hoped. Worse still, this agreement may encourage Palestinian Arabs to adopt economic institutions similar to those prevailing in Israel. The Israeli economy has long been managed by a cabal of economists and bureaucrats, along with their 'private' sector associates, who think they know everything. They control market forces because they are determined to bend them to the service of ephemeral 'national goals' or to 'correct' market failures or avoid 'unconscionable' profits by speculators. The unfortunate results include a banking system that has had to be bailed out by the government and a decade of stagnation of output per head. Palestinian economists could easily contract the same hubris, with worse consequences. The balance between the forces that can promote and undermine the peace process is delicate and volatile. Manageable quantities of economic aid, focused on building basic infrastructure, along with limited emergency aid to alleviate the plight of the unemployed, would encourage those supporting peace. Western governments and their aid agencies must, however, guard against the political manipulation of aid, which could undermine growth and destabilise Palestinian Arab society. It would do so by encouraging rivalries between competing factions and promoting corruption and nepotism. This is, in turn, likely to exacerbate radicalism and militant fundamentalism, so frustrating all hope for peace in the near future.

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Evans of Leeds advances to Pounds 4m Evans of Leeds, the property investment company, raised pre-tax profits by 10 per cent from Pounds 3.67m to Pounds 4.04m in the six months to September 30. The company said the result was satisfactory as the market was still difficult, with rental levels rising only slowly and tenants remaining cautious about taking on new commitments. Total revenue advanced from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 12.1m. Earnings per share came to 4.72p (4.28p) and an increased interim dividend of 1.58p (1.48p) is declared. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

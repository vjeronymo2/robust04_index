			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Forest sell-offs plan attacked THE PRIVATISATION of the Forestry Commission's properties, which is being studied by the government, would produce a meagre sum for the Treasury and lead to greater recurrent expenditure on forestry and reduced income for the state. This is the view of three former top executives of the Forestry Commission who issued a public statement yesterday to say that privatisation is 'against the interests of the taxpayer, the private forest owner, the timber industry, the conservation interest and the public who enjoy access to the forest'. Mr Gwyn Francis and Mr George Holmes, both former directors-general of the commission, and Mr Toby Seal, a former chief research officer, say that the commission's 1.1m hectares of forest might only raise Pounds 500m in a 'forced sale'. This contrasts with its 1992 book value of Pounds 1.7bn. They say that if the forests were sold the government would have to hand out more money in grants to the new owners for planting and restocking, as well as providing more management grants and other items whose additional costs in 2000 would total Pounds 44m. Taking into account the annual loss of Pounds 20m in timber sales, the total additional cost to the exchequer would be Pounds 64m. By 2010 this would have risen to Pounds 83m because of increased planting and restocking, and lost timber sales. Ministers reviewing the future of the commission and the incentives for tree planting are due to report next year.</p>

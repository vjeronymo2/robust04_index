			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND CHECKLIST FOR DIGGERS, PLANTERS : GARDENING  </P> <P> For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of  Nurserymen:  </P> <P> * To keep weeds in check during the winter rains and give a neat appearance to  your flower beds, weed now and apply a layer of mulch.  </P> <P> * If you have hard-packed soil, including clay, be sure to apply gypsum or  other additives to the yard in order to break the barriers to water  penetration.  </P> <P> * Did you spray your peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl yet? If  not, do so immediately and then follow it up with another spraying before the  buds swell.  </P> <P> * Leave your poinsettias in the pot after the blossoms have gone and put them  outside in a protected area, watering them occasionally. Plant them in the  ground only after all chance of frost is gone.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "First Exit Poll Ever in Hungary"] </F>   [Text] For the first time in the history of Hungarian  elections, three polling agencies came forward with the  projected result of the elections practically the moment the  polls closed. The exit polls, the legality of which had earlier  been questioned by the interior minister, indicate a great  advance by the opposition parties, and among them especially by  the Socialists.    The Median polling agency conducted its survey together with  NEPSZABADSAG. Their preliminary plans were to conduct a survey  in 704 districts, but as a result of last week's antipolling  campaign, pollsters were turned away from several localities by  the authorities. According to Median, it is conceivable that  because of the campaign there were more people than usual among  right-wing voters who refused to answer, and therefore they  might have somewhat underestimated the percentage of  national-conservative voters. Incidentally, the pollsters of  Szonda Ipsos who prepared their survey for MAGYAR HIRLAP had  similar experiences.    Median's survey, prepared on the basis of a national sample,  was completed a few minutes after the polls officially closed.  According to the survey, the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]  received 33 percent of the votes for party tickets. The  Association of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] followed with 19 percent,  while third place, with 11 percent, went to the Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF]. The Independent Smallholders Party  [FKGP] got 10 percent, and the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz] and the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] got  7 percent each. According to the preliminary survey, three  representatives were elected in the first round: Gabor Kuncze  [SZDSZ] in Pest county, Tamas Suchman [MSZP] in Somogy county,  and Agnes Gyarfas Rado, also a Socialist, in  Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen county.    The Szonda Ipsos agency also conducted a national survey.  Their ranking: 27 percent for the MSZP, 20 percent for the  SZDSZ, 12 percent each for the MDF and Fidesz, 10 percent for  the FKGP, and 8 percent for the KDNP. According to Szonda's  data, of the 32 Budapest election districts, Socialist  candidates were in the lead in 25 and Free Democrats in seven.  Nationally, 104 MSZP candidates and 40 Free Democrats are in  first place in the election districts for individual  representatives.    The Hungarian Gallup Institute, whose pollsters questioned  134,733 voters, arrived basically at similar results. According  to the afternoon survey of the Gallup Institute, the MSZP led  with 31 percent. The Socialists were followed by the SZDSZ with  20 percent, the MDF with 10 percent, the Fidesz and the FKGP  with 9 percent each, and the KDNP with 7 percent.    All three exit polls indicate that no new party will have  seats in the Hungarian National Assembly.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the news agency  INTERFAX-UKRAINE, a Communist leader and member of the Ukrainian  parliament Piotr Simonenko said the bloc of left-wing forces in  the national legislature would oppose President Kravchuk's call  for the postponement of the 26 June presidential elections.    According to Simonenko, the Ukrainian Communists would see  any move to reschedule the elections as illegal and would  insist, even in defiance of a direct presidential decree, that  the elections be held on 26 June.    The bloc of left-wing forces brings together the Communists,  Socialists and the Ukrainian Farmers' party. It has some 120,  or more than one third, of the parliament's 338 distributed  mandates and can block the endorsement of what it sees as  ill-intended amendments to the national Constitution.    Simonenko said the Communists would support the candidacy of  Socialist leader Aleksandr Moroz in the presidential elections.  Most other presidential nominees, he said, had already had a  chance to serve Ukraine but failed to perform well in positions  of power. In principle, however, the Ukrainian Communists  opposed the institute of the presidency.    According to Simonenko, the left-wing bloc would aim  primarily to insure economic stabilization. It intended, first  of all, to put in order the national taxation system by  balancing the producers' and the country's interests.    In Simonenko's view, the producers must be given a chance to  streamline production with the help of government-controlled  levers. Activities in the financial and credit fields must be  controled. Simonenko held high credit rates responsible for  economic recession in Ukraine.</p>

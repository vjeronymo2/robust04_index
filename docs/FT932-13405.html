			<p>930423 FT  23 APR 93 / Letter: Rail needs subsidy to compete Sir, Perhaps Mr Gill (Letters, April 20) does not leave his ivory car very often to travel by rail. Surely he knows that no railway can compete with road without subsidy from taxpayers - not even in Japan with its amazing population densities. The amount of subsidy/debt depends in part on political judgment of the externalities, of the social benefits a decent rail service provides, and not just on efficiency. If you want measures of the latter, how do British Rail and German Rail stack up on, say, passenger miles per worker hour, investment as a proportion of turnover, average vintage of rolling stock, proportion of trains on time?

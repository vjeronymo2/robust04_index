			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: ``The Middle East and Nuclear Arms''] </F>   [Text] In a step that is no less important than the step  taken to issue a resolution supporting the process of finding a  political settlement in the Middle East, the UN General Assembly  adopted a new resolution supporting the establishment of a  nuclear weapons free zone in the Middle East. This should be  preceded by a major step: Nuclear countries in the region should  agree to submit their installations to supervision by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. The importance of  such a step is that it befits the spirit of peaceful settlement  that is taking root in the region despite the obstacles and  hindrances it is encountering. It also confirms that nuclear  superiority naturally contradicts the desire to establish peace  and stability.    It can be said that this resolution contains both implicit  and explicit support for Egypt's policy on this matter, which is  based on rejecting violence and superiority, as well as removing  all weapons of mass destruction from the Middle East. President  Mubarak has always had a positive call in this field.    Despite the fact that the resolution adopted by the UN  General Assembly was not unanimous, it expressed the desire of  the world's countries to get rid of all kinds of highly  destructive weapons. Of course, Israel's stand is believed to  be the cornerstone in the process of turning this resolution  into a tangible reality. It is the only state in the region  that has nuclear reactors and exceptional capability in the  nuclear field. All international circles believe it is highly  likely that Israel has nuclear weapons. Its stand is based on  not allowing any kind of international supervision of its  installations. This is a regrettable state of affairs that  contradicts everything Israel sometimes claims regarding its  commitment to a political settlement of its problems with its  Arab neighbors. Israel's agreeing to allow the IAEA to inspect  its installations is crucial to the establishment of peace and  stability in the region. In addition, such a step would change  the international resolution into a tangible reality.</p>

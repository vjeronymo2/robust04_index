Good evening.    [Falandysz] Good evening to you [addressing Skowronski], and  to you, Ladies and Gentlemen.    [Skowronski] What will be the consequences of the  parliament's rejection today of the president's constitutional  initiative?    [Falandysz] It would be hard to predict all the  consequences, but it is not true what Sejm Speaker Oleksy says  when he talks about rejection of initiatives being a routine  type of measure by the parliament, and that it happens often.  The truth is that as far as I can recall, it has never happened  that a presidential initiative would have been rejected. The  point is that a presidential initiative comes from an organ of  state power which is elected in popular elections, so it is not  just an ordinary legislative initiative but quite a special one.  Naturally, the rejection....[Falandysz pauses] The parliament  and the majority there can do anything it wants to that is  completely legal, except that, in my view, it is quite  incomprehensible and also unreasonable, and quite arrogant, when  you think about it. That is because I cannot think of a reason  for having done such a thing--that in effect amounted to  prohibiting the president from joining the debate on what he had  proposed. After all, the situation was that the debate was cut  off and the initiative was not forwarded to the appropriate Sejm  commission. So by doing this, the parliamentary majority  demonstrated it does not want to conduct a dialogue with the  president on constitutional issues--and that is exactly what is  painful.    [Skowronski] And what will be the consequences of that?    [Falandysz] Well [words indistinct]    [Skowronski, interrupting] What kind of conclusions will the  president draw from that?    [Falandysz] What I think is that questions must be asked  about the future of the president's cooperation with the  National Assembly's Constitutional Commission, if constitutional  issues are what we are talking about here. Well, it so happened  that yesterday, Sejm Deputy Jaskiernia very strongly emphasized  that the president will be coresponsible for the Constitution  since, after all, he is participating in designing the document.  Well, the point is he does not have to participate. Of course,  the president has not made a decision on that yet, but he is  empowered to discontinue his participation in the Assembly's  Constitutional Commission; he can withdraw his representative  there--that is myself. I will then have less work to do. He is  also empowered not to put forward any initiative or to withdraw  the one he had submitted....    [Skowronski, interrupting] And what will that mean in turn?  I mean what if the president decides to withdraw your  participation from the proceedings of the....    [Falandysz, interrupting] Well, that will mean that the  constitution will be designed without the president's  participation. Perhaps Mr. Kwasniewski will be happy with that,  and perhaps he will say: Who needs the president anyway? At  least nobody will get in our way. We will manage without him.    But that will be a significant event. I think the president  is fully empowered to act this way because the Sejm acted in  quite a determinant way--let me put it this way--and they  refused to talk to him. And with the Sejm additionally not  making it easier to submit other extraparliamentary initiatives.  By the way, both Mr. Oleksy and Mr. Kwasniewski had said that as  far as constitutional issues are concerned, there should be  compromise, national consensus, and joint work. Forgive me, but  how is one supposed to view today's decision by the Sejm in the  light of those declarations?    [Skowronski] Yes, but it so happens that Sejm Speaker Oleksy  and Aleksander Kwasniewski voted in favor. How did it happen  that the leaders voted in favor whereas all the other Sejm  deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voted against?    [Falandysz] You know, I do not know why. That is their  secret. You should ask them first of all. They are bound to  know what happened.    [Skowronski] But it was a strange situation.    [Falandysz] Well, if you allow me to speculate a bit here--I  am not saying that this is what really happened--there are just  two possibilities: Either the gentlemen, all the SLD leaders--I  mean the elites, the deputies club's leaders, there is a whole  elite there--voted in favor of the president, which would be  very nice. The only problem is that either the elites' views are  different than the rest of the deputies club, or its big  majority, and that is of course a bad thing to happen since it  means they have no control over the deputies club. The other  possibility is that they have conspired in a cunning and  Machiavellian way, along the lines of: Gentlemen, it wouldn't  look good if we were to vote against, so we will vote in favor,  but you, gentlemen, should vote against and this way we will  save face and it will look like we of course love the president.    Except that is not only a fraud, but it is also a kind of  cowardly behavior since one is afraid to declare one's views  publicly. So either way, there is a pathology involved in this.    [Skowronski] Does today's vote and the rejection [of the  president's initiative] mean a substantially new situation on  the political scene?    [Falandysz] I do not think so. As I said, the president  will think about whether to cooperate with the Constitutional  Commission. It is an open question as to how the other parties  will act--I mean the parties outside of the circles of the  governing coalition or the Union of Labor [UP], I mean those  parties whose votes indicated that they were kind of willing to  support the president's initiative. Despite their  criticism--the Democratic Union [UD] is especially  characteristic in that regard--they were all very critical but  they were all almost unanimously in favor of at least debating  the initiative and of sending it to the appropriate Sejm  commission. After all, that would not amount to enacting it into  law. One must also consider whether these parties should also  [hesitating] not do some thinking about their role in the  drafting of the constitution since the role is indeed marginal.  The parties are dominated by a huge majority, so their  coauthorship is nonexistent. In that sense, this may bring  about some additional consequences.    [Skowronski] Perhaps we should try to explain what the  president's initiative was all about.    [Falandysz] In essence, the initiative was quite  straightforward. It was initiated with the idea in mind that  under the concept of direct democracy, the president will have  his contribution. Well, it is not the president but UP that  began tinkering with a law on the procedures for enacting and  preparing a constitution, which had been enacted some time in  the past. They also proposed a preconstitutional referendum.  The president said: All right, a referendum is a form of direct  democracy, but there is another form as well, which is less well  known and applied less frequently; it is called Citizens'  Legislative Initiative; in this case it would apply to the  constitution. According to the initiative, a group of 100,000  citizens--it could be bigger than that, it does not matter, but  it would have to be some organized centers outside of the  parliament--could submit their constitutional drafts to the Sejm  commission and they would have their representative on the  commission whose rights would be the same as those of the  president's, the government's, or the Constitutional Tribunal's  representatives. To my amazement, yesterday everyone said of  that initiative: Of course, we are in favor of democracy, and  so forth. But what they did not like a lot was the second ....    [Skowronski, interrupting] You mean item number two [words  indistinct]    [Falandysz] Exactly. Of course, that is also a debatable  issue. But the debate was cut off extremely quickly, as if they  were afraid to continue with it. Namely, the president used to  say: Under a situation where [hesitating] it is the parliament  that is kind of responsible for the constitution--or to be more  exact, the significant constitutional majority in the  parliament, since it is only they that enact a  constitution--then in that case, if the referendum's outcome is  negative for them, then they should be dissolved by force of  law. Of course, that situation [of the Sejm's dissolution] may  happen anyway, because if the Constitutional Commission and the  governing coalition are left completely on their own with the  constitution, that is if the others decide to leave, and if they  lead to a referendum, which, it is true, would be a very good  referendum from their standpoint since....[Falandysz pauses]  Perhaps they will get rid of referenda now, I do not know. So  even if they lose the referendum, that would not mean anything  to them, they will be able to continue with the proceedings as  if nothing happened: We lost a referendum and so what?    A constitution is the basis for all laws, it is a country's  fundamental law. And if the Sejm is not capable of [hesitating]  recommending--let me put it this way--such a law to the nation,  then I have no idea how the Sejm should be capable of enacting  laws of lesser importance. It is a very comfortable situation  [for the Sejm majority] since most probably, the goal is to  survive [hesitating] for four years at any cost. Four years is  the magical number in this case.    [Skowronski] Yesterday, the president visited the  parliament to take part in the constitutional debate. He had  not been there for three months, I think. Was that the  president's last visit to the parliament?    [Falandysz] You know, it would be hard to say no, at least  under that kind of situation [laughing]. As you know, I have no  intention of making jokes on this, of course. There are history  books where one can read about that. But as far as the  [hesitating] normal type of situation is concerned, I mean when  a president comes to visit a friendly parliament. By the way,  Speaker Oleksy gave the president a very warm reception there  and he said: As you can see, Mr. President, we decided to deal  with all of your initiatives as absolute priorities. We are  very much in a hurry.    [Skowronski] We are dealing with them, and then they go to  the waste basket?    [Falandysz] Exactly. So that is interesting, and Mr. Oleksy  no longer smiled at today's press conference. It is not a good  situation because there are signs that our prominent SLD leaders  are kind of losing touch; they seem to have such a good presence  and be so European, but it does not quite work for them.    [Skowronski] What do you mean when you say the SLD leaders  are losing touch?    [Falandysz] You know, I would put it this way: Mr.  Kwasniewski for instance seems to think that the internal  coalition agreements are more important than the president's  constitutional powers. He often says: The coalition decided on  this, or that, and the president is supposed to follow what the  coalition has decided. My question is: How on earth did he  figure that out?    You know why I am amazed? Because this is an example of the  old Marxist thesis on the supremacy of politics over law.  Kwasniewski learned about that at some point, and he continues  to have it in his mind, to the effect that once the coalition  decided something, that is the way it has to be. But I am  saying: That was the situation under the Polish People's  Republic [PRL].    As regards the Sejm's role, the situation in the times of  PRL  was that the Sejm was the organ of supreme authority, and that  provision was included in the Constitution. Now Sejm Speaker  Oleksy seems to be beginning to believe that he is the organ of  supreme authority. My answer is: There is no such thing as the  organ of supreme authority. We have a division of powers in  effect in Poland; there are three kinds of powers and one must  gradually get used to that. I hope this is just a temporary  forgetfulness on his part.    [Skowronski] And what if it is not?    [Falandysz] If it is not, then I suppose the education  process would have to be extended. After all, we are all  learning democracy. I am not saying that I or anybody like me  already knows everything there is to know about democracy. Of  course, people make mistakes, but you know, when an individual  makes a mistake, even if he is the president, that is very human  because an individual is entitled to make a mistake. But when  you have the case of a body of people making mistakes and acting  like [hesitating] someone malicious or envious, that is a bad  thing to happen, I mean when a majority makes unreasonable  decisions. I remember that in the period of martial law, I  think it was Professor Lopatka [a male] who was running around  the Sejm saying: The Sejm can do anything, it can even pass a  law which would say that I am a female. Now what I say is: Of  course it can do that, but it would make no sense at all. The  Sejm is empowered to reject a presidential initiative and that  is a legal thing to do, except that it makes no sense at all.    [Skowronski] How will one live in a country where the  president has disputes with the parliament? The president will  fail to show up in the parliament and all the governing  coalition will think about is how to eliminate him.    [Falandysz] You know, there is nothing bad about it. There  is a rule in effect in many democracies, that the president does  not enter the parliament at all and does not pay visits there.  In Poland, under some remnants of the previous system, the  president used to pay visits to the parliament, and he even  enjoyed it and felt comfortable. But after the most recent  incident, I think he will not enjoy it as much. But let us not  overreact when it comes to having disputes. In my view, these  are the usual symptoms of political competition.    You know, here is how I would reflect on this: Perhaps this  [hesitating] whole sudden measure by the Sejm....[Falandysz  pauses] What did it prevent, for instance? Well, it prevented,  for instance, the National Commission of Solidarity--which had  established an alternative constitutional commission of its  own--from taking a serious measure. The trade union can easily  gather 500,000 signatures under a constitutional draft, if the  draft is of a specified, easily propagatable nature. I do not  suppose that was the goal, but there will be more political  events in Poland in that regard, and unfortunately one must  remember that President Walesa is not any kind of friend either  to Mr. Oleksy, or to Mr. Kwasniewski, or to the people  associated with the two of them. Historically speaking, they  were always on opposite sides, and right now it is precisely  that group which makes all that happen. I mean the people who  feel very self-confident because of their gigantic majority.    [Skowronski] So are you saying the old divisions are  coming back now? Or are these old divisions under new labels?    [Falandysz] I do not know that. I think that it just so  happens in life that people who used to be in power, want to be  back in power. I am not saying that....[Falandysz pauses] You  know, I do not use terms like postcommunists or  communists--these are misleading labels. But the fact is that  they want to be back in power under a different situation, and  they are fully entitled to that, since we are in a democracy.  But if it is their plan for instance to [hesitating] eliminate  President Walesa--I mean eliminate in legal and constitutional  terms--then to be honest, that is not a nice intention to have.    [Skowronski] Do you think such an idea has emerged?    [Falandysz] I do not know that. You would have to ask those  gentlemen who keep smiling. But of course, they will not tell  you. They will smile and say: But Mr. President, that is  absolutely not true; we would do anything for you. But they do  something different behind his back. That unfortunately is also  a certain trait that is inherent in politics. We will see as  time goes by--perhaps there will be better times.    [Skowronski] Today, Aleksander Kwasniewski said, in the  aftermath of statements by [presidential spokesman] Drzycimski,  or by the president, that things are no longer merry and funny,  they are scary now. What is the scary part about, according to  Aleksander Kwasniewski?    [Falandysz] I do not know; you must ask him about that, too.  I do not know what he got scared of. Perhaps he got scared of  his own courage and of the discipline in his own deputies club?  I just do not know.    [Skowronski] We will talk about all that during the  breakfast show. Mr. Aleksander Kwasniewski will be here, and  also you [addressing Falandysz] will be here, so we will have a  chance to talk about all that.    [Falandysz] I hope so.    [Skowronski] So we will talk about that at more length, and  right now, I thank you for the conversation.    [Falandysz] Thank you very much.    [Skowronski] Radio Zet's guest today has been Professor Lech  Falandysz, minister of state in the President's Office.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Court may plug bank insurance sales loophole A FEDERAL appeals court ruling has threatened to block a loophole that allowed many US banks to sell insurance policies. The loophole allowed nationally chartered banks to sell insurance in towns with fewer than 5,000 inhabitants. A 1986 decision by the Comptroller of the Currency, who supervises these banks, allowed them to expand insurance sales from their small town branches to other markets. This extension, as well as a number of other regulatory measures which have gradually opened up the insurance field to banks, has been hotly contested by insurance agents, who have brought a series of lawsuits contesting the Comptroller's interpretation. The appeals court decision not only overrules this interpretation, however; it says that the entire clause was in fact erased from law in 1918 by a congressional drafting error.</p>

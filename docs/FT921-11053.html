			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Storm over Habash affair shakes Cresson government THE French government was under renewed political fire yesterday as some Socialist party members demanded government changes following the controversial admission into a Paris hospital of Palestinian guerrilla group leader George Habash. The political storm which broke last week after the stay in hospital of Mr Habash, leader of the extremist Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), has continued to rage since his sudden departure on Saturday for Tunis. Mrs Edith Cresson's Socialist administration has been shaken by the crisis, which even government ministers have admitted indicates a serious malfunctioning of the machinery of the state, and it is not clear that the government's authority can be restored without a reshuffle. Speculation about a reshuffle was prompted on Saturday when President Francois Mitterrand summoned Mrs Cresson to the Elysee for an 80-minute post-mortem on the affair, followed by a 90-minute interview with Mr Philippe Marchand, the interior minister. Until last week, Mr Mitterrand was expected to postpone any reshuffle until he had measured the results of next month's regional elections. The crisis may force an acceleration of that timetable. It has already claimed five victims. Mrs Georgina Dufoix resigned as adviser to Mr Mitterrand, and also faces demands toresign as president of the Red Cross, which endorsed Mr Habash's request for hospital treatment. Four civil servants from the foreign and interior ministries have also resigned. However, these resignations have failed to convince the French that the decision to allow into the country a man suspected of masterminding aircraft hijackings in the 1970s was taken by civil servants without clearance from their political masters. The government's official story is that Mr Habash was admitted for hospital treatment last Wednesday without the knowledge or the authorisation of the highest levels of the government, while Mr Mitterrand and Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, were visiting Oman. But the Red Cross has said it told the Foreign Ministry of Mr Habash's request for hospital treatment last Monday, before Mr Mitterrand and Mr Dumas left for Oman. The lawyer representing Mr Habash has claimed the decision to admit him to France had been taken at the Elysee 'at the highest level'. Mr Jack Lang, government spokesman, yesterday vigorously defended the disciplinary measures and claimed the incident was now closed. But conservative opposition leaders have continued to call for the resignation of Mr Dumas, Mr Marchand and Mrs Cresson.</p>

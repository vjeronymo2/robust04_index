			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Abhay Vaidya: "India, U.S. Heading for Conflict"] </F>   [Text] Washington, March 12. New Delhi and Washington  appear to be heading for yet another round of acrimonious  exchange with the Clinton administration's reported move to  deliver 71 F-16 fighter planes to Pakistan.    It is as yet unclear whether the administration is  considering an unconditional delivery of the planes or whether,  it plans to obtain specific, nuclear non-proliferation-related  assurances from Islamabad prior to any delivery.    The possibility of a qualitative shift in the weapons  balance  in South Asia came into sharp focus when the South Dakota  Republican Senator, Mr. Larry Pressler, disclosed that the US  defence department was keen on completing the sale deed of the  combat aircrafts to Pakistan.    Further corroboration of the F-16 transfer was provided on  the very next day by Ms. Robin Raphel, the assistant secretary  of state for South Asia.    During a testimony to the house foreign affairs  sub-committee  on Asia and the Pacific, Ms. Raphel said that the aircrafts in  question had already been sold to Pakistan; it was now just a  matter of delivery.    She said that certain aspects of amendment which applied to  the transfer of the fighter planes, could still be used as a  "leverage" to persuade Pakistan to cap its nuclear programme.    This unfolding episode forcefully reinforces yet again, the  perception of an unabated deterioration in Indo-US relations.    This was reflected in a March 9 New Delhi-datelined dispatch  in THE NEW YORK TIMES. The report, "US Remarks Over Kashmir  Anger Indians" said that for now, the Indian government's  unhappiness with the Clinton administration "seem minimal,  although the Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, has shelved  plans to visit Washington soon."    Speaking to THE TIMES OF INDIA, Dr. Sumit Ganguly, a  researcher at the Woodrow Wilson Centre observed that the  Indo-US relations under the Clinton administration had suffered  enormously "because of a number of careless, thoughtless, and  tactless statements" and gestures by administration officials.    These included some routine letters from the White House  over  which there was no supervision and "a couple of singularly  tactless statements" by Ms. Raphel.    In contrast to popular perception in India, Washington was  not obsessed with Kashmir, Dr. Ganguly noted, pointing out that  the secretary of state, Mr. Warren Christopher, did not even  mention Kashmir in any of his prepared testimonies.    The administration was concerned about nuclear  non-proliferation, but without devoting the same intensity of  attention to India-Pakistan, as to Iran, Iraq and North Korea.    Fourteen months into the Clinton regime, the damage to  Indo-US relations appears unabated with the White House  continuing to issue auto-signed letters to reply to anti-Indian  Congressmen who repeatedly refer to the Indian state of Punjab,  as "Punjab, Khalistan."    American scholars and administration officials, however,  have  termed the Indian protests as an "over-reaction" to minor issues  and gestures by politicians towards their constituents.    Some analysts, however, point to the Clinton  administration's  bankruptcy on foreign policy issues, with recent US diplomatic  conflicts even with such allies as Japan, France and Britain.    By the same token, these analysts say that if India wants to  be taken seriously by the US in its foreign policy  considerations, tangible actions showing displeasure with the US  would have to be seriously considered.    "The US will not take India's position on Kashmir seriously  unless New Delhi demonstrates that it means business and that it  is prepared to put an end to international terrorism by  undertaking a hot pursuit of terrorists directly into Pakistan,"  a Washington-based Indian-American analyst said.    He added that such a legitimate move aimed at eliminating  terrorist training camps in Pakistan "would ring the right  belles at the situation room in the White House."    The Clinton administration's latest act of insensitivity  towards India, is the administration's reported attempt to  proceed with the sale of F-16 combat aircrafts to Pakistan. It  is not difficult to visualise the enormous damage that such a  decision would do, if carried through without meaningful and  verifiable nuclear-related assurances from Islamabad.    Mr. Selig Harrison, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie  Endowment was aghast when informed of the F-16 delivery  proposal. The US policy of delivery arms to Pakistan seemed to  resemble the motions of a revolving door, he said, with  successive administrations, appeasing Islamabad with military  aid, only to withdraw it later.    The decision to deliver F-16s to Pakistan "couldn't have  come  at a worst time in Indo-US relations," said Mr. Harrison in an  interview with THE TIMES OF INDIA.    He pointed out that the rhetorical exchange between New  Delhi  and Washington had "already given the impression of a US tilt  towards Pakistan."    Mr. Michael Krepon, another analyst at the Henry L. Stimson  Centre said it was probable that the US would demand specific  nuclear-related steps from Pakistan before delivering the F-16s.    "My reading is that there is some sentiment to waive  Pressler  but only if Pakistan takes verifiable and concrete steps that  are in support of US non-proliferation policies," Mr. Krepon  told THE TIMES OF INDIA.    "This administration came in on a platform that focussed far  more upon American domestic revival further than any grand  promises of dramatic changes in foreign policy," Dr. Ganguly  said.    "Foreign policy has not been the principle concern of this  administration when it came and it has not been since the past  year in office."    The priorities were unlikely to change significantly, Dr.  Ganguly said, as President Clinton remained focussed on the  domestic economy and other national issues such as health care  reforms, job retraining and social welfare.</p>

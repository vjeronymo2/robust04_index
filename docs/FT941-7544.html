			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong name for cancelled BCCI session Sir, In your article, 'Sir Sonny had special loan' (February 16) you repeat the allegation that a session at a crime symposium at Cambridge University in 1989 on the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and money laundering 'was cancelled on the directions of the (Commonwealth) secretary-general's office'. At the time of the symposium, officials of a branch of the BCCI in the US had been convicted of money laundering. Sir Sonny Ramphal was then Commonwealth secretary-general. Had this suggestion been referred to the secretariat, rather than simply reported, it would have been made clear that, as the one with overall responsibility for the programme at Cambridge, I alone was the one who took the decision not to name the BCCI in the agenda item as such, but gave full approval for discussion of the money laundering conviction. This in fact took place. At that stage, there was no reason other than that conviction to have suspected that the BCCI was engaged in large-scale fraud and money laundering. At no time was the question referred to Sir Sonny Ramphal, or referred to any member of the staff of his private office. Jeremy Pope, Akazienstrasse 15, Berlin, Germany</p>

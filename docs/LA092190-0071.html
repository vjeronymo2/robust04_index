			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRIME FEARS CRAMP NEW YORKERS' STYLE;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: CAUTION IS THE WATCHWORD AS LURID SLAYINGS GRAB HEADLINES. BUT SOME  OFFICIALS INSIST THE CITY IS NOT THAT DANGEROUS, NOR THE SITUATION NEW.  </P> <P> Fueled by a series of spectacular incidents and constant media attention  ranging from the cover of Time and People magazines to local tabloids and  television, fear of crime is changing the way many New Yorkers live.  </P> <P> Like many other residents, Herbert J. Sturz, a former deputy mayor for criminal  justice, has routinely put "mugger's money" for potential holdup men in his  pocket when he goes out late at night. But even that precaution is no longer  reassuring to Stutz, who has stopped taking late night walks from his upper  East Side Manhattan apartment to purchase the first edition of his morning  paper.  </P> <P> "I think crime is a real consideration in neighborhoods that used to feel  secure," said Michael Taylor, president of Precision Films Inc., who lives just  a few blocks away from Sturz. Taylor no longer rides the subway. His  14-year-old son Matthew never takes a ball to play basketball at a nearby  public school -- one of the most desirable in Manhattan -- because roaming  young gangs steal athletic equipment. Several of Matthew's friends have been  mugged on a playground further uptown.  </P> <P> David Baker went jogging around the Central Park reservoir well after dark last  Sunday night. When he returned to his upper West Side Manhattan apartment, his  wife clearly was worried about him. She wouldn't have reacted that way a year  ago, he said.  </P> <P> Baker, a 3rd-degree black belt in Shorin Ryu karate, is director of the Midtown  Karate Dojo in Manhattan. He said that during the summer, enrollment at his  school increased by 35%. Some other schools also report larger than usual  numbers of students signing up for the martial arts.  </P> <P> These fears of random violence are magnified in poorer neighborhoods, where  crime is much more prevalent.  </P> <P> The fact New York last year ranked ninth in homicide statistics below such  cities as Washington, Detroit, New Orleans and Dallas seems largely ignored in  the face of all the anxiety.  </P> <P> Crime, always a front-page item here, has received unparalleled attention in  recent days. Brian Watkins, a 22-year-old tourist from Provo, Utah, was stabbed  to death Sept. 2 in the subway trying to protect his mother from a gang who  wanted money to go dancing. Three days earlier, a deputy district attorney was  slain in a random shooting in the Bronx and a Brooklyn politician was shot to  death. Earlier in the month, three teen-agers were convicted in the gang rape  of a woman jogger in Central Park in 1989.  </P> <P> Police statistics show violent crime rising rapidly in Manhattan -- up 25.3%  for homicides, 19.2% for robberies and 15.5% for assaults compared to three  years ago. The statistics mirror trends in the rest of the city.  </P> <P> Subway crime is particularly threatening to many riders. For the first six  months of this year, overall felonies in the subway system rose 17% while  robberies increased by 22%.  </P> <P> "There is a high level of violent rampant crime in the city and it is very  disturbing to people," said Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau. "People  are very concerned about it, and they have a right to be concerned about it.  But that does not mean that people should leave the city."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, in private and public conversations, the topic of leaving seems  at least as high as during the dark days of New York's fiscal crisis of the  1970s.  </P> <P> A poll of 1,000 New Yorkers taken for Time magazine and Cable News Network by  Yankelovich Clancy Shulman accompanied a Time cover story this month highly  critical of the city. The poll found 59% would move somewhere else if they  could select where they could live.  </P> <P> Many residents have mixed their perceptions of crime with performance  appraisals of Mayor David N. Dinkins, who promised during his campaign last  year to become the toughest mayor on crime the city has ever seen.  </P> <P> Some of the mayor's critics charge that he has been slow to anger and even  slower to react to the crime crisis, more concerned about matters of style than  substance.  </P> <P> Dinkins has responded by seeking to mobilize clergymen and neighborhood groups  in a crusade against crime, and ordering Police Commissioner Lee Brown to come  up with plans by Oct. 1 to increase the number of officers on the streets. He  also has shared with New Yorkers his own fear of what it was like to be robbed  at gunpoint while working in a Harlem liquor store 38 years ago.  </P> <P> This week he said that recent concern about crime was based on well-publicized  incidents and attacks in neighborhoods outside of poor minority areas of the  city, where the problems of crime and violence are not new.  </P> <P> "We've had this problem, and now I guess it has gone beyond our borders and  others have become concerned," Dinkins said in a radio interview on a New York  station with a largely minority audience. "Fact of the matter is we have been  concerned since day one."  </P> <P> Morgenthau said the crime wave really started in 1985 -- well before the  Dinkins Administration. He now fears the chorus of calls for more street police  will come at the expense of detectives who are badly needed for investigations  and other components of the criminal justice system, including the courts.  </P> <P> Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for reelection, called for hiring 5,000  more policemen but has promised no additional state funds. U.S. Sen. Alfonse M.  D'Amato (R-N.Y.) argued that 4,400 more police could be hired by putting off  repairs on roads, bridges and subways.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A large number of commenters opposed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision at proposed 488.155(b) and suggested we delete it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section states that the State survey agency's failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to follow HCFA survey procedures will not invalidate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise legitimate determinations that a facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies exist. Because the provision does not appear  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Act, a few commenters questioned whether the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctioned this policy, and certain commenters asked that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities be allowed to appeal surveyor noncompliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey protocol. Many commenters felt that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would encourage disregard of established survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines, and for this reason one commenter believed this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision would cause the standard survey to violate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fourth Amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe the provision accurately reflects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intent of the Act and are retaining it in &sect;488.305(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To invalidate legitimate determinations of noncompliance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leave them unaddressed would be in opposition to the mandate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of OBRA '87 that all requirements be met and enforced, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would lead to inconsistent application of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sections 1819(g)(2)(C) and 1919(g)(2)(C) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reveal the intent of the Act very clearly. These sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state that standard surveys must be conducted based upon a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol, but add that the failure of the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop, test or validate such a protocol will not relieve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any State or the Secretary of the responsibility to conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys. Because the Congress intended for survey results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be binding even when surveys were conducted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absence of a formal protocol, it is clear that the Congress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> views the substance of survey findings to be of greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importance than the process used to identify them. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal of a deficiency based on surveyor noncompliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the established protocol would be inconsistent with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> position, and as a result, we will not offer facilities an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal on these grounds. In particular, we wish to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations where otherwise well documented deficiencies are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to challenge, and potentially invalidated, simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because a surveyor did not follow every last detail of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> survey protocol. We believe this would be surrendering all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance to form and would clearly thwart Congressional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will. Moreover, since the source of binding requirements on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities is not in the survey protocol, but in the Act and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, the ultimate, and proper, test of facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noncompliance will not rest on whether the survey protocol  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was rigorously followed, but on whether a requirement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act or the regulations has been violated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The foregoing does not imply that HCFA encourages or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condones disregard of its established survey policy; on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contrary, HCFA trains surveyors in survey policies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and is responsible for assessing State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency performance and applying sanctions when there has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been a failure to use Federal standards and protocols. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance we provide to surveyors, and the expectation we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have that they adhere to our directives, contradict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim that surveyors are given unbridled discretion which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would render the standard survey an unreasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a facility seeks participation in the Medicare or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicaid programs, it must accept the responsibility of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrating its compliance with Federal certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements which the Congress has directed must be done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through the survey process. A facility cannot seek such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation, and accept program funds, and then argue that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal or State efforts to monitor compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential health or safety requirements constitute a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of the Fourth Amendment as an unreasonable search  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and seizure. In any event, surveys that nursing homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience in the Medicare and Medicaid programs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable. They advance the government's interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protecting the health and safety of individual residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and because of the various requirements for surveys in both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act the Federal regulations, no facility can be said to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be unaware of its obligations to permit onsite visits by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or Federal surveyors as a condition of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in these programs. Commercial enterprises,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as nursing homes, do not have the same expectation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be free of warrantless searches as individuals in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> homes do. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has ruled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that warrantless searches of closely regulated businesses do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not pose a violation of constitutional Fourth Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protections that commercial enterprises have.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

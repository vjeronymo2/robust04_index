			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 17 Apr (TANJUG) -- In the northeast  section of the Sarajevo theater of war this morning, Muslim  forces attacked Serb positions near the Pretis industrial site  in Vogosca and the suburbs of Brioni and Ugljesic, Serb military  sources report.    According to the same sources, some 50 antitank shells were  fired and dozens of hand grenades were hurled.    The conflict culminated when UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  troops, stationed at Glavica and Sabanove Kuce, joined the  Muslim forces, the Serb military forces claim. They say that  the UNPROFOR and government troops were targeting the Serb  positions with antiaircraft guns and incendiary ammunition. A  trench in the central section of the Serb positions in Ugljesic  was destroyed.    The Serb fighters returned fire in retaliation for these  joint operations, so a lull followed 20 minutes later.    The Serbian military forces also report that there were no  dead or wounded on the Serb side and that the front lines remain  unchanged.</p>

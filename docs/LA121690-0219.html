			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDING CODE COMPLAINTS GO UNCHECKED;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: LONG BEACH AUDIT BLAMES INEFFICIENCY AND POOR RECORDS-KEEPING IN  THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT FOR BACKLOG.  </P> <P> The 23 inspectors in the Department of Planning and Building are so overwhelmed  with complaints of code violations that they are unable to respond to many of  them, according to a report issued by City Auditor Robert Fronke.  </P> <P> The inspectors examine the city's aging stock of 70,000 residential units for  building code violations ranging from holes in apartment walls to rats. The  report did not audit the city Health Department, whose inspectors investigate  health-related hazards in buildings.  </P> <P> In his report, scheduled to be reviewed Tuesday by the City Council, Fronke  found that the number of code enforcement cases in Long Beach increased 57%  during the last fiscal year. During that period, the section recorded a total  of 6,662 complaints, with 2,699 still pending. The audit blames the backlog on  the need for increased efficiency and better record-keeping. "It's fairly clear  that they don't keep up with the number of complaints," Fronke said. "We think  part of the process ought to be to place some priorities and controls and  allocate the manpower in the most effective way."  </P> <P> The audit found that data was incomplete or missing from the office's  computerized record-keeping system that stores information about violations.  There are few records of the disposition of some of those complaints, according  to the report. Sometimes citizens' complaints were not recorded completely, the  report stated.  </P> <P> Inspectors would have more time in the field if clerical staff assumed some of  their bookkeeping duties, the report suggested. It listed administrative  problems such as the failure of employees to fill out overtime reports and a  general lack of written policies and procedures for staff.  </P> <P> Code Enforcement Operations Manager David Evans said the audit is fair. "We've  taken steps to correct some of those inefficiencies," he said.  </P> <P> Others in the office argue that the backlog is not caused by inefficiency, but  by a lack of funding from the city. "We can't catch up," said Clark Searle,  chief building inspector. Searle said that the number of complaints from city  officials, tenants, and health and fire department officers is growing.  Increasing numbers of people are moving into the city's old apartment houses,  he said. "We've got a lot more people living in areas of the city that have  been neglected for a long time," Searle said.  </P> <P> Searle, who is retiring this month, said that in his 15 years with the office  he has never seen the inspectors more swamped. "We're not getting our promised  help," he said.  </P> <P> Searle said that two of the six inspectors charged with looking into  substandard housing violations have left but that there is no money to replace  them.  </P> <P> Not only does his office not get enough money, Searle said, but lately there  has been a push by management to take his people and use them in other offices  for work that generates money for the city.  </P> <P> Recently three inspectors, charged with investigating property maintenance  problems such as weeds, abandoned vehicles and run-down buildings were  reassigned to jobs that are supposed to put money into the general fund, Searle  said. For example, one inspector with the property maintenance unit was  assigned to hand out tickets for parking violations.  </P> <P> "If management thinks getting general revenues are more important than  eliminating substandard and blighted buildings, that's their view," Searle  said.  </P> <P> Robert Paternoster, director of the Department of Planning and Building, said  that funding for code enforcement is up to the City Council. "It's no secret  that we have more complaints than we can inspect. The demand for code  enforcement is greater than the resources we have," Paternoster said.  </P> <P> Fronke argued that until the code enforcement section gets better organized, it  is impossible to tell how much, if any, of the backlog is due to staffing and  funding shortages.  </P> <P> "I don't think we're prepared to say that until we see what can be done with  the current resources," Fronke said. "They need to have better controls and  ways to measure their data and performance."  </P> <P> But, inspectors ask, where will the money come from to make Fronke's  recommended changes to the computer system? Evans said that the office has been  unable to proceed with scheduled improvements to the system because of budget  problems.  </P> <P> Housing activists have long complained that the city does not adequately  enforce building code violations and that many apartment tenants live in filthy  and unsafe conditions.  </P> <P> "This city is in the Dark Ages when it comes to housing enforcement," said Kate  McClatchy of the Long Beach Housing Action Assn. "The real issue here is that  the city just doesn't make it a priority, because a lot of the people who live  in the worst housing are poor, and they can't speak out."  </P></p>

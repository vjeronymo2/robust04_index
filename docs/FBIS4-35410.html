			<p>BFN     [Text] Dr. 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, the deputy chairman of  the Presidential Council, has issued a statement to the YEMENI  NEWS AGENCY, Aden, on the military offensive being mounted by  the forces of the rulers in Sanaa against the sovereignty of our  country, the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. He said in the  statement: We had been expecting such an offensive, which  reveals the despair of the rulers of Sanaa, in that they are  making an attempt to draw the attention of the world to battles  and destruction, instead of to peace. The brother deputy  chairman of the Presidential Council expressed confidence that  this barbarous offensive against peaceful villages must fail and  collapse, noting that the rulers of Sanaa would fail to realize  their aims. Brother al-Jifri noted that the attackers had  mounted a broad offensive on all fronts, using in their vanguard  the good sons of Yemen, whom they have misled. He said: We  were expecting this attack -- our forces had been waiting for it  and are heroically repulsing it, inflicting great losses of life  and material on the enemy. The brother deputy chairman of the  Presidential Council reassured the sons of our people that the  enemy had not, and would not, achieve the aims of his attack.  Our forces, with their air, naval, and ground arms, are capable  of protecting the territory and sovereignty of the Democratic  Republic of Yemen.    The brother deputy chairman of the Presidential Council said  that, during the past two days, a number of false claims had  been put about, to the effect that Aden airport had been shelled  and destroyed by artillery. The sons of our people all know  that this is just an empty claim. He said he thought that the  allegations would persist for another couple of days or longer,  but that victory is our ally and God is on our side, because we  are the victims of aggression.</p>

			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON TO MOVE PILLARS  </P> <P> One of the pillars of tennis is getting rid of the pillars on the world's most  famous court.  </P> <P> The 26 pillars that hold up the roof of Centre Court at Wimbledon will be  removed after next summer's tournament, providing unobstructed views for an  additional 3,600 fans.  </P> <P> A new roof will be installed as well.  </P> <P> The All-England Lawn Tennis Club, where the grass-court Grand Slam is held,  said the old pillars were remnants of the original Centre Court design, from  1922. Their place will be taken by four new supports, only two of which will be  in the seating area; this will leave only 1% of the court's 13,107 seats with  obstructed views.  </P> <P> Club officials refused to reveal the cost of the work, which is due to begin as  soon as the 1991 tournament is over.  </P></p>

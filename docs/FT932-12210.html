			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Leading Article: Dilemmas for Mr Lamont IF NORMAN Lamont had known before the Budget what he knows now, would he still have postponed his tax increases to next year? Some advised him to increase taxes at once. He may already regret having ignored this advice. The case for postponing tax increases in March was that they were likely to extinguish the flickering flame of economic recovery. But there were also arguments in favour of raising taxes immediately. The obvious argument was that the fiscal position was unsustainable in the longer term, while any deflationary impact of tax increases could be offset by reductions in interest rates. An additional, under-emphasised, concern was about what would happen if recovery were to come before the fiscal action. The government would then rely on monetary policy as its sole disinflationary instrument. The consequence could be appreciation of the exchange rate and loss of competitiveness. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund gives concern about competitiveness little weight. But it is robust in its call for a smaller budget deficit. 'The sustainability of the recovery,' argues the IMF, 'will depend on the authorities' ability to safeguard the credibility of their anti-inflationary commitment, especially in light of the potential inflationary consequences of sterling's decline. This, in turn, depends critically on the adoption of further measures, in the 1994 budget or even before (our emphasis), to secure a faster reduction of the large budget deficit. . . . Any further easing of monetary policy . . . should be resisted unless there is good reason to believe that a further cut in interest rates would not endanger the goal of containing inflation.' Credibility undermined The IMF is right on fiscal policy. The credibility of the anti-inflationary commitment must be doubtful in the case of a government planning to borrow 9 per cent of gross domestic product this year and double its net debt, in relation to GDP, in just half a decade. Credibility is further undermined by willingness to borrow at 8 1/2 per cent over 20 years, when its target rate of inflation in the medium term is 1-4 per cent and its announced aim is 'to bring it down to the lower part of this range by the end of the present parliament'. More questionable is what the IMF has to say about monetary policy. Two concerns might arise. The first is whether policy has provided enough stimulation. The second is whether it is paying enough attention to competitiveness. Interest rates The case for cuts in interest rates to stimulate domestic demand is weaker than a month or two ago. Recovery is now unmistakable, while monetary data are also showing a greenish light. Over the three months to March narrow money (M0) grew at an annual rate of 9.9 per cent, while broad money growth (M4) accelerated to 5.3 per cent. The former is well above its monitoring range of 0 to 4 per cent, while the latter is at least within its wider range of 3 to 9 per cent. The difficult question is competitiveness. The exchange rate is the most important relative price in the economy. Given the social and economic costs of shifting resources into - and out of - industries producing tradable goods and services, the government must not ignore the level of the exchange rate or its variability. For a country with a current account deficit of 2 per cent of GDP at the trough of a recession, it seems particularly risky to ignore competitiveness. But sterling has already appreciated from DM2.33 at the end of February to just below DM2.50, while its trade-weighted effective rate is up nearly 7 per cent. The chancellor may well have been right to welcome this appreciation, since the devaluation had left competitiveness at exceptional levels, at least by standards of the 1980s. But appreciation should not be welcomed without limits. Particularly if monetary growth seems subdued, the chancellor should respond to any sustained appreciation by cutting interest rates. To do that safely, however, he must also be more aggressive over fiscal policy next time than he was in March.</p>

			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Management: When a Prince means business - David Waller tells the tale of a family fortune, management consultants and a punk princess Helge Petersen, a former partner in the McKinsey consultancy group, received an unusual phone call late in 1986. Egon Zehnder, a prominent Swiss headhunter, rang with a unique proposition: would he like to manage the business affairs of the princely house of Thurn und Taxis, one of the oldest and wealthiest families in Europe? Petersen took the job - but it did not turn out to be as idyllic as he first imagined. He and colleagues he recruited left their jobs under a cloud in 1990 and subsequently became embroiled in litigation with their former employer. It was only last month that this litigation was settled. Petersen's appointment came about because the head of the family, the late Prince Johannis von Thurn und Taxis, was concerned that the family businesses were not earning enough to support his extravagant life-style. The family's fortune - with assets of about Dollars 1.3bn excluding castles, pictures, collections and jewellery - reflected the entrepreneurial talents of Prince Johannis' distant forebears. In 1490, they established a postal system for central Europe and ran it successfully for a few centuries thereafter. During the 19th century, it was privatised and the proceeds skilfully invested in industry and agriculture. Unlike the fortunes of many noble German families, the T und T empire fared well in the 20th century too. It survived two world wars, the Nazi Reich and two periods of great inflation. This was, however, due more to luck than the entrepreneurial skills of the princes, who tended to be playboys rather than businessmen. Commercial affairs were left in the hands of administrators recruited from the Bavarian civil service. Acutely conscious that his outgoings exceeded his income, Prince Johannis at last decided it was time to bring professional management skills to bear on an empire which well as agriculture, banking, brewing, industry and international property. Hence Petersen was brought in and given leave to recruit a team of managers. For three glorious years, Petersen and his new recruits - principally Eberhard Crain, a former colleague at McKinsey, and Rolf Levedag from the Deutsche Bank - lived at the Thurn und Taxis seat of Schloss St Emmeram at Regensburg in Bavaria, chief of the family's seven castles. During the week, they had the fun of managing a large business from congenial surroundings. At the weekends, they were invited to boar-hunts by their employer, where they could rub shoulders with the likes of Donald Trump, the former real-estate giant, Prince, the pop-star, Gunter Grass, Germany's leading author, Franz-Joseph Strauss, Germany's former chancellor, not to mention the Prince and his glamorous relatives. Quite apart from the social attractions, the job was extremely stimulating. 'It was,' recollected Eberhard Crain earlier this year, long after the idyll had come to an end, 'a position that everyone would dream of'. Petersen agreed: 'It was intellectually very interesting. We had a first-rate management group; to start off with we had an excellent relationship with the Prince and we had a tremendous amount of entrepreneurial freedom. You don't get all this in many jobs.' The managers set up a corporate-style structure for the group. They established a holding company, of which they were the directors and the Prince was the sole shareholder. Their first task was to assess the value of the Prince's assets: he had a vague idea they were worth about Dollars 3bn and was disappointed to find that they were less than half of that. Then, with the help of Andersen Consulting, they installed a management information system. They divided the businesses into five divisions: agriculture, forestry, industry, brewing and financial services. These were further subdivided into some 60 profit centres. Agriculture and forestry - the bulk of the empire - produced a yield on assets of 1 per cent or less per year. The managers' task was to work the rest of the assets as hard as possible. They embarked on ambitious plans to franchise the Thurn und Taxis name in the financial services areas and: bought property in north America and Germany; rationalised the largest industrial company in the portfolio - Doduco, a loss-making electronics concern; sold off Dollars 145m of farm land. The net result was that the empire turned back into the black, making profits of Dollars 7.5m and Dollars 6.4m in 1988 and 1989 respectively. The strategy was based on the assumption that the Prince, 59 years old when he recruited Petersen in 1986, would live for at least another 10 years. However he grew ill and fell increasingly under the influence of his wife, Princess Gloria. The 'punk princess' was well known in the German popular press for the extravagance of her life-style and her imaginative haircuts. The Prince had married her in 1980 when she was just 20. It was only in the late 1980s that she started to develop an interest in the business rather than party-going. Relations between the managers and the Prince grew frosty early in 1990 after an article appeared in a German magazine accusing Petersen and his team of gross mismanagement and manoeuvring themselves to take control of the fortune when the Prince died. Formally, the Prince stood by his employees, but the old trust and confidence was gone and the managers' freedom to act was henceforth strictly circumscribed. By the middle of the year, Petersen and Crain had left of their own accord and shortly afterwards Levedag was fired. For the managers, the saga did not end with their departure from the Schloss, nor even with the Prince's death in December 1990. The Princess attacked them in numerous press articles, one of which in September last year alleged that they had systematically manipulated the Prince's accounts to pay themselves big bonuses. Petersen and his former colleagues hit back, suing both Gloria and a number of publications, claiming a systematic attempt to destroy their professional reputations. The Princess counterattacked by filing criminal charges against the managers. Late last month, the Princess quietly backed down: a statement issued in Frankfurt said that the House of Thurn und Taxis had dropped its allegations against the former managers. Both sides abandoned the lawsuits launched at each other; Levedag, who was sacked outright, obtained compensation and all the managers successfully won payment of unpaid bonuses due under their contracts. This attempt to subject a large family fortune to professional management discipline has not been good either for the fortune or the managers. While Petersen landed on his feet, taking up a post last year as managing director of the Wasserstein Perella investment bank in Germany, Crain has only recently found a new job with a French investment group in Frankfurt. Levedag is believed to be on the brink of taking up a new post. Meanwhile a distinctly press-shy Princess Gloria presides over a family fortune which is believed to be shrinking at much the same rate as it was before the ill-fated experiment with professional management.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Monetary union 'may be delayed' ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN in Europe has cast doubt on the ability of European Community member states to meet the timetable for monetary union contained in the Maastricht treaty, according to a Commons committee report published yesterday. The Treasury and Civil Service committee's report says it is not confident that seven of the 12 member states, including Germany, will be able to fulfil the convergence criteria in time for monetary union in January 1997. It will not be achieved before 1999 if Germany does not meet the criteria within the next four years, says the committee, but in view of Germany's present difficulties this may not happen. In spite of doubts about the timetable, the report points to a widespread belief among politicians in France and Spain, and probably elsewhere in the community, that monetary union should, and will, take place in 1997. The view among most member states is that there should be considerable flexibility in interpreting the convergence criteria, a view not shared by Germany. Failure to ratify the Maastricht treaty by all member states does not mean that prospects for monetary union would disappear, says the report. 'It is important not to underestimate the strength and depth of commitment to monetary union amongst politicians elsewhere in the community,' it says, adding that a number of member states would probably seek to create an alternative institutional framework to pave the way for monetary union should the Treaty be rejected. The committee believes political pressure on the UK from other member countries to rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism will grow. Non-membership following UK ratification of the Maastricht treaty would 'cause difficulties' it says. The report says that only limited progress has been made in practical preparations for the establishment of the European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank, 'a fact that may reflect the wider uncertainties surrounding the prospects for monetary union'.

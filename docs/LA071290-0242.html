			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN INDEPENDENT VISIONARY;  </P> <P> THE LATE JAY DEFEO WAS A SAN FRANCISCO LONER WHOSE 'PRIVATE' ART CHALLENGES OUR  EVERYDAY NOTIONS OF FORM  </P> <P> Jay DeFeo, who died in 1989, was the mystery woman of Bay Area art. She entered  the scene as a painter during the golden years of the '50s and '60s when the  young funk artists, beat poets and jazz musicians were cooking up cockeyed  rhapsodies and living on a dime. But at a time of social protest and exuberant  in-group activities, she was an independent visionary devoting herself to what  she called "private" art.  </P> <P> Starting Friday at the Laguna Art Museum, an exhibit organized by the  University Art Museum, Berkeley, will span 38 years of DeFeo's work on paper.  Often using everyday objects as a starting point, she focused on relationships  of forms to create work with an abstract feel that straddled the territories of  painting and drawing.  </P> <P> Most of the pieces in the show look like images of real-life objects in the  process of disappearing or changing into another form. Sometimes it's hard to  figure out just what the original object was -- either because it has become so  blurred and fragmentary, or because the angle chosen by DeFeo was so unusual.  (Drawings of a camera tripod, a tape dispenser and a shoe tree are examples of  this kind of mysterious evasion.)  </P> <P> DeFeo often reworked a single piece for months -- a methodical approach more  often associated with painting than drawing -- and frequently applied several  media (primarily acrylic, pastel, charcoal and wax pencil) in obsessive  sequences of layers to achieve the occluded effects that she had in mind.  </P> <P> "The Eyes," an uncharacteristically clear-cut image, is nonetheless  intrinsically related to her more obscure pieces. It is about the process of  seeing, the essential subject of DeFeo's transmutations of form. The pale glow  emanating from the eyes (based on DeFeo's own) suggests the focused  concentration of a larger-than-life Seer -- or an artist who quietly claims  such powers. Clusters of fine vertical lines read as reflections from a curtain  positioned between the Seer and the viewer, and rendered transparent by the  intensity of the Seer's gaze.  </P> <P> What  </P> <P> "Jay DeFeo: Works on Paper."  </P> <P> When  </P> <P> Friday through Oct. 7.

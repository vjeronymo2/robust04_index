			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: ANA proposes marketing links with BA All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan's largest carrier, has approached British Airways with a series of marketing proposals to help strengthen its international operations. But BA has so far not responded to ANA's proposals to enter into ticket code sharing agreements, although the two carriers are discussing co-operation on frequent flier programmes. BA yesterday said it did not comment on speculation about partnerships and alliances, but industry sources said that the UK carrier had been receiving approaches as frequently as one a week by airlines wanting to join the trend towards globalisation. They suggested the ANA initiative, made towards the end of last year, may be just one such approach. BA is understood to have taken no decision nor discussed internally the ANA approach. Before the latest approach to BA, the Japanese carrier had held discussions two years ago with another UK carrier, British Midland, over possible marketing co-operation. ANA's proposals to BA include a limited code-sharing agreement between London and Tokyo, and a wider plan involving ANA code-sharing with BA throughout Europe. Mr Yuzuru Masumoto, senior vice-president, legal affairs, also said the two airlines could negotiate sharing data, engineering facilities and flight crew. ANA was keen to conclude a deal as soon as possible, said Mr Taiji Kameyama, senior vice-president, commercial affairs. The Japanese airline is also negotiating with other groups, including Asian, European and trans-Pacific carriers. 'It's difficult to find the ideal partner. The best trans-Pacific carrier is not always on good terms with the best European,' explained Mr Kameyama. In Europe, All Nippon Airways said it is also talking to members of the failed Alcazar alliance, which involved Scandinavian Airlines System, Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Austrian Airlines. ANA already holds a small stake in Austrian Airlines.</p>

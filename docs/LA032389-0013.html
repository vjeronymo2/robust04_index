			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN'S DAY  </P> <P> In your description of a speech by Raisa Gorbachev, you refer to International  Women's Day as a Soviet holiday (Part I, March 8). Given that the whole month  of March is designated National Women's History Month across the U.S., I think  your readers deserve a clarification about the origin of International Women's  Day, particularly since the holiday originated in this country.  </P> <P> The holiday, which is observed all over the world, commemorates a March 8,  1908, march of many thousands of young women and their supporters. Their  demands were twofold -- women's right to vote, and an end to child labor in the  sweatshops of New York City's garment district. The march took place in New  York City.  </P> <P> MARK EPSTEIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

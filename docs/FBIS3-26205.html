			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Human Rights Conditions in China Have Improved Significantly"]    [Text] In the early seventies, a U.S. reporter, who had  experience of covering news in old China, revisited China when  Sino-U.S. relations began to thaw. When meeting with Premier  Zhou, he said with deep feelings that during his visit he had  found that China had traversed a long journey and had made great  progress. Premier Zhou answered: We still have a long way to go.    The Chinese are a modest people, and they normally do not  brag about their own achievements to foreigners. Speaking  realistically, China remains a developing country with a huge  population, and still faces the extremely arduous task of  modernization. Therefore, it has formulated a long-term  development strategy with economic construction as its central  task, and China is determined to improve its people's material  and cultural lives through the unswerving efforts of several  generations of people. Although time now has come to the  nineties, as Premier Zhou said in the past, the Chinese people  still have a long way to go. On the other hand, in retrospect,  new China indeed has made substantial progress, which also  should be appraised realistically and should not be denied.  China has made great progress and has further efforts still to  make. This is the actual condition of the country, and this is  also the case in the field of human rights.    Old China was bullied and humiliated by foreign powers, and  the people did not have any independent political or other  rights while living under colonial and semicolonial conditions.  Innumerable people were killed in continuing disastrous wars,  and human rights were just empty talk in such circumstances.  Fundamental changes were brought about by the success of the  Chinese revolution and the establishment of the People's  Republic, and only after that could the people's lives and  safety really be guaranteed and the nation move onto to the path  of development. The liberation of China turned human rights  into reality in the country. By comparison, in today's world,  "genocide" is still occurring in some European countries, and  human life is treated there as if it were not worth a straw;  "social purification" occurred in South America, and a large  number of street urchins were mistreated and killed. If they  were to see this, all justice-upholding people might not  underestimate the progress China has made in the aspect of human  rights.    China's reform and opening beginning in 1978 was another  emancipation. In the last 15 years, with the high-speed  economic growth, the people's living standards have been  enhanced, the legal system gradually has been perfected, the  market mechanism has been fostered, the scope of human and  material movements has been broadened, and the people's freedom  and rights have been improved in many aspects. No person who  holds an objective and fair attitude will deny all these facts.    China is making continuing efforts to improve human rights  conditions, but this is, first of all, China's own affair. The  Chinese people deeply believe that advancing along this course  of maintaining stability and developing the economy, greater  progress certainly will be made in the aspect of human rights.  Different nations view human rights in different ways, and all  nations have yet to improve their own human rights conditions in  various aspects. They may conduct dialogue and exchanges on this  issue, thus promoting each other's improvement of human rights  conditions. For example, in the United States, the social  status and human rights conditions of national minorities still  need to be improved; there are an increasing number of  single-parent families, and the rights of their members should  be looked after. The United States, however, pursues double  standards and often tries to interfere in China's internal  affairs under the pretext of human rights. This will do  absolutely nothing good for the improvement of China's human  rights. If the issue of human rights is linked with trade and  if Sino-U.S. bilateral trade is harmed for this reason, the  situation will not be in the economic interests of the United  States itself, and also will do no good for the improvement of  its domestic conditions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Rome, Jan 22 (AFP) -- The Italian Popular Party  (PPI) opened its founding congress here Saturday [22 January] by  firmly rejecting an invitation by the formerly communist  Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) to join a left-leaning  alliance.    PPI officials, seeking to regroup forces from the  ex-Christian Democratic (DC) Party and outline a strategy and  alliances for the upcoming March elections, left open the  possibility of joining a right-wing alliance.    Rosa Russo Jervolino and Mino Martinazzoli, respectively  president and national secretary of the PPI, told a crammed  constituent assembly in Rome's conference center that they would  refuse to "forge alliances that would contradict the identity of  the new party."    Occhetto was wrong to invite the PPI to joining his  progressive alliance and thus make the PPO "a satellite,"  Martinazzoli said to strong applause.    "We are not looking for solitude, we are not against joining  forces, but we have paid such a high price for our mistakes that  we will never renounce our reason for existing," he said.    Jervolino insisted the PPI would "maintain an identity as a  party of Christian inspiration even if it should mean losing  votes" and said she would set three conditions for any alliance  -- solidarity, democracy and national unity.    The PPI, which adopted its new name last Tuesday, has been  troubled from its inception, as a break in DC ranks led to the  creation of a parallel centre-right party, the Christian  Democratic Centre, whose avowed aim is to form an alliance with  the federalist Northern League of Umberto Bossi.    Over the past few months, other former Christian Democrats  have also left to join the conservative right or the progressive  alliance of the left.    According to a survey of 1,700 voters carried out by the  CIRM  polling institute for Telemontecarlo television, an alliance of  the Popular Party and the "Pact for Italy" launched by ex-DC  centrist Mario Segni would win 22 percent of the vote, the same  as its main rival, the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left  (PDS).    Segni, who is a candidate to head the future government  after  the March 27-28 elections, began consultations on Friday to  determine who would rally to his movement which presents itself  as a centre-right alliance with no ties to the neofascist  Italian Socialist Movement (MSI).    Segni's first meeting with Martinazzoli appeared Saturday to  have led to agreement on a broad plan of action.    The two men, considered in the moderate DC tradition, are  seeking to enlarge their movement from its traditionally  Catholic base to include lay forces.    Most observers say, however, that an alliance between the  Northern League and the moderate centre-right axis would stand  the best chance of winning the upcoming elections.    Also Saturday, neofascists and hardline communists were  holding their respective congresses Saturday at a hotel close to  the PPI congress.    The congress of the "Refounded Communists" was in its third  day at Rome's Ergife hotel, where the "National Alliance" of the  neofascist MSI and other ultra-conservative leaders were also  meeting.    These two movements are trying to convince voters that they  have become moderate enough to be able to join any future  government alliance.</p>

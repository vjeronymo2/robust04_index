			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / International Company News: Fault line splits Spanish banking sector - Tom Burns examines the results that have produced two tiers in performance terms Mr Emilio Ybarra, chairman of BBV: 'Last year was the most difficult year in the last 10.' Banco Popular annual report: 'The shock wave of change has pervaded these 10 years, radically transforming . . . the very content of the banking business.' Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander: '1992 has perhaps been the most difficult year since 1982.' SPAIN'S bank chairmen seem to have hired the same speechwriter. In unison, they have in recent days complained of diminishing business, of rising non-performing loans and of high interest rates. Taken together, the net profits of the top six domestic banks fell by more than 7 per cent last year. This was the first annual fall in the accumulated income of the sector's first tier group. It was also a sobering turnaround from the 50 per cent rise in joint profits that the big banks registered in 1988, at the peak of the sector's growth. The 1992 results would have been considerably worse had not the Bank of Spain decided in December to reduce its reserve requirement from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent. The move freed some Dollars 6bn of deposits that had been trapped, interest free, with the central bank. But while profitability has been squeezed, some institutions are resisting the pressure considerably better than others. The 1992 results starkly illustrate a fault line that for the time being has split the sector down the middle. Three banks - Argentaria, the state-owned banking corporation, Banco Santander and Banco Popular - reported increased profits, albeit less spectacular ones than in the past. The other three - BBV, Banco Central Hispanoamericano (BCH) and Banesto - posted lowered profits. This division is new to the Spanish banks. Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, says that in the recent past bank results 'were as alike as two drops of water'. Those similarities reflected tight regulations, such as reserve requirements, as well as an understanding among the banks to respect each others' business. The cosy arrangement within the sector, which was cemented by periodic lunches among the big bank chairmen, collapsed when Santander launched an aggressive deposit war in 1989 and began to lure customers away from its rivals by offering high interest bearing accounts. Mr Luis Valls, co-chairman of Banco Popular, and the sole surviving bank president from those quasi-cartel days, says the present slump is not unlike the one at the start of the 1980s when the economy ground to a halt and bad debts rose dramatically. 'The difference,' says Mr Valls, 'is that then we all came out of the banking crisis in step and now our starting positions are quite different.' Popular, a well-managed bank, can claim to have a head start. A cautious risk-taker which is strongly positioned among high net worth domestic corporates and individuals, it has steadily raised its net income return from 1.65 per cent in 1988 to 2.12 per cent last year. Popular, half of whose equity is owned by foreign institutions, has recently begun to lend to blue chip international companies. Santander, another profitable performer with a net income return of 1.1 per cent, has the advantage of a strong international position. Mr Emilio Botin, its chairman, has little doubt that margins will remain tight in Spain - non-performing loans are expected to increase this year - and his mid-term strategy is to raise the current 33 per cent income that the Santander group earns abroad to 50 per cent. Mr Botin is likely to exercise warrants in the course of this year that will lift a 16.5 per cent stake that Santander holds in First Fidelity Bancorporation of the US to 23 per cent. This development will strengthen the Spanish bank's already sound balance sheet by permitting the New Jersey-based bank to consolidate within the Santander group. Argentaria's 1992 rise in profits could be deceptive for the banking group, which is the fruit of a 1991 merger that pooled five state-controlled banks, and the year-on-year results are not strictly comparable. Mr Luzon, its chairman, however, sees room for increased profitability as duplication is eliminated although he is concerned about the punitive effect of high interest rates. Popular and Santander, which are highly liquid and are net lenders on the interbank market, have no problems with the high interest rates. The rest of the sector is less happy with a benchmark intervention rate currently standing at 13 per cent. 'The evolution of the rates will determine whether the bank results this year are good or not,' says Mr Luzon, who plans to place up to 25 per cent of Argentaria on the market this year in a partial privatisation. Those banks whose results were not good last year, blamed their tumbling net profits on the low income earned from disposals. Extraordinary income was down by 76 per cent at Banesto and by 48 per cent at BBV, but both banks posted strong improvements in their operating margin. Mr Emilio Ybarra, BBV's chairman, claims the proof of his bank's recovered momentum was the 1.25 per cent increase it reported in its market share of customer deposits. 'Today's market quota is tomorrow's profits,' he said. Banesto's Mr Mario Conde received a boost of another kind when an international investment fund led by JP Morgan, the US investment bank, announced recently that it would spend Dollars 200m in a forthcoming Dollars 452m Banesto rights issue.  -----------------------------------          SPAIN'S TOP BANKS           Net consolidated           profits (Pta bn)  -----------------------------------                   1992     % change BCH              *60.0      -17.18 BBV               81.1      -19.86 Banesto           45.6      -27.06 Santander         66.1       11.80 Popular           54.8        9.62 Argentaria        67.4       14.69  ----------------------------------- * Estimate  ----------------------------------- Source: Expansion  -----------------------------------</p>

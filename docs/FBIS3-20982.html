			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by TAR: "DRAM Chip With Trench Cells"] </F>   [Text] Frankfurt--IBM, Siemens, and Toshiba want to use a  trench-cell structure in developing their common 256-megabit  DRAM memory chip. This structure was recently presented on the  occasion of the International Electron Devices meeting of  experts in this field in Washington. What is involved is a  self-aligned trench-circuit contact which is defined by the  intersection of a deep trench-memory node and the "shallow"  trench insulation. As described in the journal SEMICONDUCTOR  INTERNATIONAL (Vol. 16, 1993, No. 12, p 18), the trench cell, a  "buried" strip, is 0.55 x 1.1 micrometers in size. It is  produced with the aid of the 0.25-micrometer technique. The cell  surface is claimed to be only 0.1 of a square micrometer larger  than the theoretical minimal surface of such a cell and the  smallest of the folded bit-circuit cells that have been  proposed. It differs considerably from Mitsubishi's  planar-stacked capacitor-cell design, which was also reported on  at the Washington conference. The superdielectric, constant  barium-strontium-titanate film was also discussed.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Hong Kong backs Patten proposal for election committee HONG KONG'S legislative council (Legco) yesterday supported one of the more controversial proposals in Mr Chris Patten's policy speech, providing local solidarity in advance of the governor's visit to Beijing next week, writes Simon Davies in Hong Kong. The council gave firm approval to Mr Patten's recommendation to create an election committee comprising democratically-elected district board members, who will then select 10 out of the 60 seats in Legco in 1995. The debate was raised by a councillor to provide a vote of confidence for Mr Patten's package of proposals, and its underlying theme of broadening democracy in the colony, while remaining within the confines of the Basic Law - the mini-constitution governing Hong Kong after the handover to China in 1997. China, however, has continued its barrage of criticism. Mr Zhou Nan, director of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency, said that the policy speech was unacceptable to the Chinese. Hong Kong's pro-China newspapers went further. Ta Kung Pao claimed that Mr Patten was fighting only for Britain's interests, while a commentary in Wen Wei Pao stated that the proposals contained three breaches of the Basic Law. These included a breach of the agreement that the social and economic systems of the colony would remain unchanged during the transition period. During yesterday's Legco debate, pro-Beijing trade unionist Mr Tam Yiu-chung questioned the rationale for the motion, claiming the election committee would be opposed from Beijing. There were also arguments from the liberal camp that the 10 seats should be directly elected, while at the conservative end of the spectrum there were concerns over possible aggravation of China; but there remained a strong consensus that the council should display initial loyalty to its new president. This will strengthen Mr Patten's argument to China that he has the Hong Kong people's mandate for his proposals. However, Legco members had little expectation that these could survive without some amendment, under pressure from China.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, </F> in Cairo, by Jose Mejia, in Havana; from the "Exclusive" program  -- live]    [Text] [Mejia] Please tell us about the Nonaligned Movement  [NAM] summit and the resolution condemning the blockade against  Cuba. How do you feel about Colombia hosting the forthcoming  summit?    [Robaina] I am glad to have this exclusive opportunity,  through the "Exclusive" program, to tell our people about this  summit, which ended just a few hours ago. It has been a great  opportunity to hold meetings. Practically every Cuban economic  and political proposal was included in the final resolution,  following many hours of extensive analysis. The 120 NAM members  meeting in Cairo clearly shows everyone's will and commitment to  strengthen its role and to ensure it plays the role it deserves.  The meeting was significant for Cuba, in particular, not only  because of what was discussed in every sphere but also because  Cuba's just position on the blockade was praised in bilateral  meetings. We have received the Movement's unanimous support not  only reaffirming what was approved in Jakarta three years ago  but also bolstering what the United Nations also recently  approved and demanding, on behalf of the NAM and the poor of the  Earth, the immediate cessation of such a hostile policy against  Cuba.    [Mejia] Colombia will host the next summit. How was this  decided?    [Robaina] The Movement has a regional rotation mechanism.  Latin America had the right to host the next NAM summit, which  should take place in September 1995. Colombia is one of the  countries which the Latin American group believes are in a  position to assume such a responsibility. Colombia presented  its candidacy. The responsibility originally fell on Nicaragua,  but Nicaragua announced that it was in no position to assume  this responsibility. We all have confidence in the Colombian  Government's organizational capacity. America, in general, and  Colombia, in particular, are preparing to host the event at a  very special time. Indonesia started strengthening the  Movement, and Latin America and Colombia now have the duty to  continue to do so.    [Mejia] Please tell us about the fourth Ibero-American  summit, in Cartagena de Indias. What will Cuba propose at this  summit?    [Robaina] The Ibero-American summit offers the nations of  the  continent and the region the chance to meet without being  summoned by the empire. This has been expressed even more since  the first meeting -- in Guadalajara -- since Madrid, and since  Bahia.    The Ibero-American forum and its very special  characteristics  give this summit a special importance. The organizers and the  Bahia summit called for this meeting to focus primarily on  economic integration and to replace protocol speeches with  debates among the regional heads of state.    Cuba is involved in all summit preparations. Our personnel  have been working on this in Cartagena, Bogota, and several  other Colombian cities. We will attend with many hopes and  wishes for the summit not to be a summit of intentions but a  summit of specific action that begins to yield something for the  peoples, specific results regarding integration, development,  exchanges. This is what we want from Cartagena. We are on its  doorstep. This is a good time for our country and for the  region, in particular.    [Mejia] Certain international news agencies have said that  the NAM summit focused on the Latin American countries since  they believe that the NAM has lost its strength. What is your  opinion?    [Robaina] There might have been a trend regarding the  Movement's strength or lack of strength, but today, more than  ever, the reasons which gave rise to this important force still  exist. I believe that as long as there is a strictly unilateral  [unipolar] world politically and militarily and that as a long  as the economic might is concentrated in the north, the other  two-thirds of mankind, represented by the NAM, more than ever,  have reason to pull together to have an authoritarian and  forceful enough voice to fight on behalf of all. This is what  the Cairo meeting has shown, the need for the Movement to become  that forum of which we, the poor of the Earth, are so much in  need.</p>

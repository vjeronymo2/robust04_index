			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ildar Nizametdinov: "Law on Service in Defense </F> Forces Passed"]    [Text] Last week the Estonian Riigikogu (parliament) passed  the law On Service in the Defense Forces. Many issues  of organizing state defense and the functioning of defense  institutions are not regulated by present laws. The new law is  intended to fill this vacuum.    According to the new law service in the defense forces is  compulsory for all male citizens of the Republic of Estonia  (foreign citizens and non-citizens are not conscripted to the  Estonian army).    Active military service from eight to 12 months (the precise  term is set by the government regarding the kind of troops and  the tasks of a military subdivision) is required of young men  from the ages of 19 to 27. Those who have finished active  service are entered into reserve and in the future can be  conscripted to military training.    Volunteers can start their service at the age of 17. The law  also provides for alternative service for those, who due to  ideological or religious reasons, do not want to take weapons in  their hands. This kind of service is organized by military units  and lasts from nine to 15 months.    Due to some family or other serious circumstances service  can  be interrupted for a period of up to six months. Persons who  have finished the service can continue service on a contract.  Women from the age of 19 to 40 can also serve in the army on a  contract basis.    During discussion of the draft law the maximum age for  conscription was reduced from 30 to 28 years after the proposal  of the Liberal faction. Secondly, the opposition factions  achieved reduction of the maximum term of service from 18 to 12  months.    However, the Royalist faction's proposal to free people with  advanced degrees from military service did not receive the  necessary support. During the Soviet period they were not  conscripted to active service although they had to cover  military education in special military departments in the  universities. Defense Minister Indrek Kannik also has not served  in the army because of this stipulation.    Deputies of the ruling coalition had the opinion that the  army should not consist just of "workers and farmers,"  university graduates are also supposed to serve. However, they  have the right to choose training to become reserve officers  instead of the usual service.    The law also sets the order for conscription into the  reserves and the order of financing expenses connected with  supplies for general military service. Persons involved in the  military service are forbidden to participate in the activities  of political parties, political meetings, and demonstrations.</p>

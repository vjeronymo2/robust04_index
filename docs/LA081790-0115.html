			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWELER LINKED TO NORIEGA GETS 10 YEARS IN DRUG-SMUGGLING PLOT  </P> <P> A Panamanian jeweler charged with Manuel A. Noriega in a marijuana-trafficking  scheme was sentenced Thursday to up to 10 years in prison.  </P> <P> Enrique A. (Kiki) Pretelt admitted last month that he had conspired with  Noriega to take bribes from Tampa-based drug smugglers to help ferry  $300-million worth of Colombian marijuana through Panama and hide the profits.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge William Castagna set a special status on Pretelt's term  that would enable him to be freed on parole at any time. The judge told him to  come back after he testifies in Noriega's drug-racketeering case in a separate  indictment in Miami.  </P> <P> A federal prosecutor from Miami told Castagna that Pretelt has been cooperating  in the Noriega case and is expected to be an important witness in the trial.  </P> <P> Noriega, in prison outside of Miami, is accused in a February, 1988, indictment  of taking $4.6 million in bribes from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn  Panama into a way station for U.S.-bound drugs. The trial of the former  Panamanian leader has been delayed until at least January.  </P> <P> Pretelt's attorney, George Tragos, said Pretelt is likely to be the  government's "big gun."  </P> <P> "He's probably the best witness the government has," Tragos said.  </P> <P> He said that Pretelt was a legitimate, well-respected businessman who, with the  exception of this case, was "clean as a whistle."  </P> <P> Pretelt, 47, promised to cooperate fully and agreed to forfeit $108,000 -- the  amount he received for his part in the transactions, Tragos said.  </P> <P> Pretelt pleaded guilty to conspiracy to launder money in one drug deal and to  aiding a second marijuana-smuggling attempt by making arrangements to relabel a  shipment from Colombia as being of Panamanian origin.  </P> <P> He could have been sentenced to a 20-year prison term.  </P></p>

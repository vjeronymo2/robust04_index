			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FDA APPROVES DRUG THAT QUICKLY DISSOLVES CLOTS AFTER HEART ATTACK  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a new drug that quickly  dissolves blood clots to prevent permanent damage following a heart attack.  </P> <P> The drug, called anistreplase, is the third clot-dissolving drug to be  approved. But its advantage is that it can be administered in five minutes or  less while the other two must be administered continuously for one to three  hours, according to SmithKline Beecham, which will market the drug as Eminase.  </P> <P> Although clot-dissolving drugs can open blocked arteries and limit damage from  heart attacks, they are used in only 20% or so of the estimated 400,000 to  600,000 patients who could benefit from treatment each year, according to the  Department of Health and Human Services.  </P> <P> More than 300,000 of the 1.5 million people who suffer heart attacks each year  die before getting to the hospital and an additional 300,000 get there too late  for treatment with clot-dissolving drugs, the department said in announcing the  FDA action.  </P> <P> "Ease and convenience of administration of anistreplase hopefully will lead to  greater use of this life-saving thrombolytic therapy even in emergency rooms  and small hospitals not equipped with sophisticated coronary care facilities,"  HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said.  </P> <P> A blood clot blocking one of the arteries to the heart is the most common cause  of heart attacks. The clot prevents blood from carrying oxygen to the heart  muscle.  </P></p>

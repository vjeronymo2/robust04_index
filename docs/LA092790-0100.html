			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN MARINO MONEY CRUNCH EFFECTS  </P> <P> Regarding your news story about the plight of the San Marino public schools  (Times, Sept. 20), let me cite another small example of how the financial  crisis has had a negative effect on the quality of life in the local area.  </P> <P> About a decade ago, the school system installed a superior lighting system for  the San Marino high school tennis courts, and those courts have provided  innumerable recreational opportunities for citizens over the years.  </P> <P> But for over six months, the lights on one of the five courts have been  completely dark; a few bulbs on the other courts that burned out more than two  years ago have likewise never been replaced. In other words, the school  district is so strapped for money that it does not even have the loose change  necessary to replace a few light bulbs on its deteriorating tennis courts.  </P> <P> I have complained to school officials in writing on two occasions but with no  favorable response to date -- just one phone call from someone in the  maintenance department stating that there were insufficient funds in the  current budget to repair the damage.  </P> <P> EDWIN J. PERKINS  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

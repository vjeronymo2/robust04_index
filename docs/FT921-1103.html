			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / CSCE breaks Karabakh deadlock: The decision by representatives of Azerbaijan, Armenia and the disputed enclave to begin talks EFFORTS to resolve the conflict over the trans-caucasian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh gathered momentum yesterday when the three parties to the dispute agreed to hold direct talks. The talks would be separate from the 10-nation peace conference in Minsk, the Belarus capital, which was set up on Tuesday by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE). Mr Raffi Hovannisian, Armenian foreign minister, announced the trilateral meeting between Armenia, Azerbaijan and representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inhabited mainly by Armenian Christians but administered by Azerbaijan. He had earlier held talks in the margin of the CSCE ministerial conference with Mr Hikmet Cetin, his Turkish opposite number - the first Turkish-Armenian meeting at this level since Armenia declared independence from the Soviet Union. Mr Hovannisian said Armenians had also been in touch with Azerbaijan at the highest level, through Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and the Turkish foreign minister. Mr Hovannisian said the place and date of the trilateral meeting remained to be decided, but he hoped it would take place in Nagorno-Karabakh. It would be held 'in parallel' with the wider CSCE meeting. The talks would address a ceasefire, the lifting of the Azerbaijani economic blockade on Armenia, and the return of weapons which have been taken by combatants from the former Soviet army. Mr Hovannisian stressed that no CSCE talks could be successful unless representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh were allowed to participate in their own right. Under a compromise reached by CSCE ministers on Tuesday, representatives of the enclave will be invited to the conference as 'interested parties' by the chairman of the talks, after consultation with the participating states. Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister and current chairman of the CSCE, told the ministerial meeting he would go to Nagorno-Karabakh next Monday to prepare the 10-nation peace conference. 'I expect that the ceasefire mediated through Iranian efforts, which are appreciated, will be extended,' he said. Mr Dienstbier attacked CSCE member states who he said had spent more than two years exchanging assurances about the collapse of totalitarianism and the progress of democracy, while failing to react adequately to dangerous developments. The future of the European Community, Nato, the Western European Union and the CSCE itself was secure only to the extent that they were able to deal with the fundamental changes that had occurred in Europe and elsewhere, he said. The rights of national minorities in an increasingly fragmented Europe emerged as one of the main themes of the Helsinki follow-up conference. Mr Hans van den Broek, the Dutch foreign minister, strongly supported by his German colleague, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, proposed the appointment of a CSCE High Commissioner for Minorities, whose task would be to provide early warning and early action to prevent 'simmering conflicts which have not yet come to an explosion'.</p>

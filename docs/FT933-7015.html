			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices rise further on Nigerian unrest NORTH SEA Brent crude prices edged up 11 cents in light trading yesterday with oil for October delivery reaching Dollars 17.09 1/2 a barrel as the market searched for direction amid conflicting signals. Prices were pushed upwards yesterday by market fears over the civil unrest in Nigeria and the possibility that a general strike called for Wednesday could affect oil loadings. The threat of an Iraqi return to the market, which caused so much price volatility last month, has abated for now. The Iraqis are pushing the United Nations for a complete lifting of sanctions rather than the one-off oil sale that was previously under negotiation. But the oil price is unlikely to show much of a rise beyond Dollars 17 a barrel before the next meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries on September 25 since countries are continuing to over-produce. Opec output is estimated at 24.6m barrels a day - 1m b/d higher than the ceiling. 'The market is trying to grapple with a number of crucial issues, but at least mentally, it's still on holiday,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head of Smith Barney's energy desk in London. Opec officials have estimated that the call on Opec oil from production and stocks will run to 26.02m b/d for the final quarter of the year. Since stock levels are fairly high that does not leave much room for a production increase.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Allders pathfinder indicates strong advance to Pounds 23m OPERATING PROFITS at Allders, the department store and duty-free retailer, are estimated to have reached Pounds 23m in the year to September 30. That compares with the Pounds 15.3m before exceptional items achieved last time. However, the latest financial year covered 53 weeks and excluding the extra period the profit would have been Pounds 21.4m. The figure was revealed in the pathfinder prospectus for the group's flotation next month. The prospectus says there are signs of recovery in the UK market, while the duty free side was exceeding expectations apart from the San Francisco store. Allders is suing the city and county of San Francisco over the poor performance of the outlet there. The document says the group's trading prospects are 'significantly better than at any time since the buy-out'. The group was formed by a management buy-out from Hanson in 1989. The float is expected to value the company at close to Pounds 200m, and it aims to raise about Pounds 85m for the company through a placing and public offer. Existing shareholders have yet to decide if they will sell shares in the issue. Hanson holds 5 per cent of the equity, with 94 per cent held by institutions who backed the mbo, and supported a Pounds 10m rights issue in 1991. Management holds 1 per cent at present. Share options will be granted which could give 130 managers about 5 per cent of the enlarged share capital, depending on the price at which the shares are floated. Within that Mr Harvey Lipsith, chief executive, will hold less than 1 per cent of the total, and the options cannot be exercised for a year. Mr Lipsith said Allders was a 'well established and resilient business' which, despite heavy debts from its mbo, had invested Pounds 55m in the business in the last four years and repaid Pounds 30m of debt. He said the group's two activities were each large operators in fragmented sectors. Sales from the department stores in the year just ended were 10 per cent higher at an estimated Pounds 286m, and operating profits were up 20 per cent to Pounds 12m. Mr Lipsith said growth would come from geographic expansion, especially the development of the six-strong chain of 'at Home with Allders' household stores, which could reach 50 in 10 years, and from economic recovery. The duty-free retail business had 4 per cent of the Pounds 10bn worldwide market, and operated on four continents. Sales were estimated at Pounds 399m, up 21 per cent, in the latest year, with profits nearly doubled at Pounds 13m (Pounds 6.7m) - partly a bounce back from the Gulf war. The 1993 figures will bear exceptional costs of Pounds 14m, including a Pounds 10.5m write-down of property values and the Pounds 3m cost of gaining a listing. However, exceptional credits will have totalled Pounds 5.1m. Pricing will be announced on October 27 and dealings are due to start on November 10. The sponsor to the issue is J Henry Schroder Wagg and the broker James Capel. See Observer</p>

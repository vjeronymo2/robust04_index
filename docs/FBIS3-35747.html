"Tajik opposition leaders supported by Afghan mujahideen do  not abandon attempts to smuggle gunmen, arms and narcotics  across the border," the commander said. Russian border guards  thwart their actions virtually every day."    "The past day was no exception," Chechulin continued. Troops  at the Pyandzh border section frustrated, on Saturday, an  attempt to smuggle weapons and drugs across the border. Gunmen  and narcotics were seized as a result of efficient actions by  Russian border guards.    The commander noted that militants use caches more often now  to smuggle arms. For instance, troops at the Moscovskiy border  section spotted a cache with great quantities of mines and  ammunition for firearms.</p>

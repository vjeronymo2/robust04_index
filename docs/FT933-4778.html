			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Renault-Volvo Merger: Sweden offers the deal a cautious welcome EXPRESSEN, one of Sweden's robust tabloid newspapers, was furious yesterday over what it described as the sell-out to France of the country's biggest manufacturer. 'Gyllenhammar's treachery against Sweden,' blared its headline in reference to the Volvo chairman. But if the newspaper expressed a populist view, it was not one shared by the political and industrial establishment. Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, welcomed the merger of Volvo's automotive operations with Renault as securing a future for motor manufacturing in Sweden; so, too, did the opposition Social Democratic Party. Even a senior trade unionist in Volvo said its competitiveness would be strengthened by the deal. 'Regrettable but inevitable,' a comment from a Stockholm investment banker, summed up the reaction of most professional Swedes to the long-awaited completion of the merger. The low-key response underlined how much attitudes have changed since 1990 when Mr Gyllenhammar said any move under foreign ownership by Volvo would cause Sweden 'to suffer an identity crisis'. A jolting, three-year recession is what has made the difference. In the late 1980s, when Volvo and other top Swedish companies were enjoying a boom, talk of industry becoming more international was framed mainly in the context of Swedish acquisitions abroad. The merger in 1988 between Asea, the Swedish engineering group, and Brown Boveri of Switzerland, to create the giant, Swiss-based ABB gave some pause. But with Mr Percy Barnevik of Asea in charge, it was seen in Sweden as a deal between equals. Today, with unemployment at 13 per cent and rising, there is widespread recognition that Sweden had become dangerously uncompetitive - a trend only partly offset by the 25 per cent devaluation of the Swedish krona this year. The acceptance of Volvo becoming a junior partner to Renault was not hard to achieve. 'Ten years ago there would have been turmoil from the unions,' said a senior government official. 'But not these days.' Instead, analysts in Stockholm regarded the ownership split, which leaves the Swedish side with 35 per cent of the new Renault-Volvo Automotive company, as a good deal for Volvo. Volvo could probably have soldiered on for some time, having returned to profit in the first half of this year. It may be due to big improvements in productivity. But a significant part of the reason it is making money again is that it has new car and truck models in place and is not currently incurring the huge development costs new models require. Volvo knew it almost certainly could not have borne on its own the next round of product development. It is not alone in Sweden in this. Within the stable of the Wallenberg family, the country's premier industrial owners, raising sufficient investment capital is a pre-eminent concern. Half of Saab, Volvo's great local rival carmaker, was sold to General Motors by the Wallenbergs to help spread the cost of new car development. The residual question about Volvo yesterday was over the future shape of the parent group. The aircraft and marine motor divisions were not part of the merger with Renault. Nor were Volvo's other holdings, principally in Procordia, a part state-owned pharmaceuticals and food group. Under a deal with the Swedish government this year, Volvo will have by next year up to a 35 per cent stake in Pharmacia, Procordia's pharmaceutical unit, and 100 per cent of its Branded Consumer Products arm, which includes beer and food products. Mr Gyllenhammar's evident intention is that the new Volvo umbrella group will become a holding company with stakes in the motor industry through Renault-Volvo Automotive, pharmaceuticals, food and other engineering interests - ironically not unlike Investor, the main Wallenberg vehicle. It is a far cry from the 1920s when Volvo was founded to make cars by Gustaf Larson and Assar Gabrielsson, two executives from SKF, the Swedish bearing company.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: BBL Imagine the City of London's reaction if several hundred of the Midland Bank's branch managers had openly expressed their preference for the Hongkong Bank, while Midland's directors had adamantly refused to choose between Hongkong and Lloyds. That is roughly what seems to be happening at Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL). Senior employees have voiced their support for a cross-border alliance with Internationale Nederlanden (ING), rather than a local solution involving the state-owned credit institution Credit Communal. Yet after yesterday's extraordinary meeting on the subject the bank had nothing to say. BBL is torn between the commercial logic of throwing its lot in with ING and the messier political option of linking with Credit Communal. For the moment it looks like a classic Belgian stand-off. Local sensitivities were ruffled by the French takeover of Societe Generale de Belgique in 1988, and there is eagerness in the Belgian political and financial establishment to ensure that another foreigner does not now walk off with BBL, one of the country's big three banks. Never mind that Suez, La Generale's majority shareholder, weakly allowed the Belgians to delay the much-needed restructuring of the sprawling holding company which is now under way. Given the 10-15 per cent speculative premium in BBL's share price, minority investors are playing a risky game. Admittedly ING looks to be moving on to the offensive by raising its stake to over 10 per cent, but the strategy of BBL's near-30 per cent shareholder Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) is far from clear. GBL can probably deliver effective control to one side or the other. But what if it does so without extracting a full bid as part of the price?</p>

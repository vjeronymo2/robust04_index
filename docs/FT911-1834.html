			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rallies as yen retreats A STRONGER than expected US National Association of Purchasing Managers Index helped to push the dollar up towards the top of the day's range at the London close yesterday. Trading was quiet, with most of the European centres closed for the May Day holiday, and although the dollar finished on a firmer note it lost ground on the day against the D-Mark and other members of the European exchange rate mechanism. The NAPM index for April was expected to be around 40.5 per cent, compared with 40.0 in March, but it rose to 42.1 per cent. This encouraged hopes that the US economy is about to recover, even though a figure below 50 per cent indicates that manufacturing is generally declining. In the Federal Reserve's latest survey of business activity, known as the Beige Book, it said the economy remains weak in much of the US, but there are signs that the recession may be bottoming out. Retail sales are still sluggish in most districts, according to the survey, and improved consumer confidence following the end of the Gulf war has yet to be translated into solid sales. The dollar touched a low of around DM1.6900, but by the London close had rallied to DM1.7060, against DM1.7170 on Tuesday. It also declined to SFr1.4445 from SFr1.4490 and to FFr5.7725 from FFr5.8025, but rose to Y137.55 from Y136.30. On Bank of England figures the dollar's index was down 0.4 at 65.5. The yen lost ground to the dollar and the D-Mark on speculation that the Bank of Japan may soon cut its discount rate. Japanese officials, including Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the finance minister, have indicated that there are no plans to change monetary policy, but dealers suspect that the central bank will act soon following this week's reduction in the US discount rate. This contrasts with the belief that the German Bundesbank remains reluctant to cut rates, even if the Fed's move makes it less likely that German rates will be increased. The D-Mark climbed back above Y80.00 to close in London at Y80.60 compared with Y79.40 previously. Sterling was steady against the dollar but weaker against its partners in the European exchange rate mechanism. The European Commission in Brussels was closed for May Day, but unofficial figures showed that the pound had fallen to second weakest member of the ERM, from fourth strongest on Tuesday. Sterling suffered from speculation that lower US rates have made a reduction in UK bank base rates more likely. Trading was nervous ahead of today's local government elections in England and Wales. The pound rose to Dollars 1.7245 from Dollars 1.7240 and to Y237.25 from Y235.00, but slipped to DM2.9425 from DM2.9600; to FFr9.9550 from FFr10.0025; and to SFr2.4900 from SFr2.4975. Its index gained 0.2 to 91.6. In New York, sterling eased 7 points to finish at Dollars 1.7238.</p>

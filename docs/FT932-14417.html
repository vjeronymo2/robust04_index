			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Matrix purchaser accused of default on payment THE Iraqi-owned company that sold Matrix Churchill, the former Coventry machine tool manufacturer, two years ago is taking legal action against the buyer for allegedly defaulting on a staged payment due in January. Matrix Churchill was bought from TMG Engineering, its Iraqi-owned parent, by Automation Investments, the holding company for BSA Tools, the Birmingham lathe maker, in February 1991 at the time of the Gulf war. The deal was a complicated transaction, hampered by the imposition of UN sanctions and the freezing of Iraqi assets in the UK. Details of the deal have never been disclosed by the buyer, but it is understood to have involved a Pounds 1.8m payment due at the end of January with a further payment of Pounds 1.2m if the net asset value of the company rose above Pounds 6m at a certain stage. The payments would have gone into a bank account supervised by the Bank of England. The account would remain frozen until the sanctions against Iraq were lifted, but the sellers say that they have not yet received any payment from Automation Investments. Mr Keith Bailey, chairman of Automation Investments, said an initial consideration was paid for the company but he could not give details at present. Mr Bailey said: 'I can't tell you precisely what has been paid simply because the contract has clauses of confidentiality.' He added: 'I don't think there is anything owing to them under the terms of the contract at the moment.' Mr Robert Koshaba, who is assisting TMG, said: 'I am not aware of one single penny that has been paid.' He confirmed that legal action had been taken under British civil law and expected a judicial hearing next month. The action was between TMG and Automation Investments. 'There is money to be paid and it hasn't been paid,' he said. He added: 'I think the Iraqi owners were very reasonable. They got kicked out, they sold the damned thing and the least they would have expected is that they get paid.' Matrix Churchill itself was placed in the hands of receivers in July 1992. The lathe-making operations were sold back to Automation Investments. The thread grinding and spare parts operations were bought by Transfer Technology, the specialist engineering group chaired by Mr Geoffrey Robinson, Labour MP for Coventry North West. Mr Koshaba said the receivership had complicated the original sale agreement, since it affected the asset value of the company. That had a bearing on the second staged payment.</p>

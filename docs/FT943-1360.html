			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy volume in Hanson International conglomerate Hanson attracted attention in the second half of the session on reports that Hoare Govett, the company's broker, had downgraded profit expectations. The shares slipped 4 1/2 to 230 1/2 p in heavy trading that saw volume soar to 18m. Unconfirmed reports suggested that Hoare Govett had reduced current year profit expectations at the Anglo-US group by Pounds 25m to Pounds 990m for the year to September 1994, and the following year's figure by Pounds 85m to Pounds 1,335m. The broker was reported to have cited several reasons for this including the weaker US dollar; the progressive impact of higher interest rates on the company's borrowing costs; and pricing pressure at Cavenham, Hanson's forestry products division and at its Peabody coal operations. The stock was also the most actively traded in options, with the equivalent of 9.3m shares traded by the close of business.</p>

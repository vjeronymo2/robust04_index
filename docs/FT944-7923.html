			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extended quota roll-over opposed at Opec meeting Opposition emerged yesterday to Saudi Arabia's proposal that the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries rolls over its production ceiling for the whole of 1995. Delegates meeting in the Indonesian resort of Bali said Kuwait would oppose the plan when ministers met today to discuss various extensions of 24.52m barrels a day production ceiling, which has been in force since September last year. The Kuwaitis are said to question whether the Saudi proposal would lead to lasting price increases. They favour a six-month roll-over, a position that Saudi Arabia also supported as late as last week but dropped in a surprise move at the weekend. The Kuwaitis believe the six-month option would give ministers full freedom to decide next June whether market conditions warranted making changes to the ceiling. It is also likely to be credible to international oil markets, according to Kuwaiti officials. Saudi Arabia, Opec's largest producer accounting for about a third of total output, believes a one-year roll-over would send a strong positive signal to oil markets. There were suggestions yesterday, however, that Saudi Arabia was prepared to be flexible and might agree to modify its proposal if other member states voiced strong opposition. An alternative approach could include a commitment to a one-year extension, with the proviso that ministers would have the option to review the ceiling and individual national quotas at the June meeting. Kuwait is believed, however, to be adamant that a six month roll-over would be sufficient. Proponents of the one-year option say it would reduce the possibility of an acrimonious meeting in June over output levels and quotas, the most troublesome topics for Opec. Other items on today's agenda include discussions on a successor to Dr Subroto, the Indonesian Secretary-General who stepped down last June.</p>

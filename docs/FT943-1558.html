			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Portillo uses veto on EU statutory paternity leave: Britain opts out of elected works council ruling The UK yesterday vetoed European Union attempts to extend statutory parental leave to fathers. It also formalised its divorce from its 11 partners on EU social policy by staying out of new rules for elected works councils in up to 1,500 trans-European companies. The European Commission will now recast the parental leave proposal for the 11 to go ahead for the second time without the UK, under the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, from which Britain has an opt-out. Mr Michael Portillo, UK employment secretary, on his debut at a meeting of EU employment ministers in Brussels, said plans to give fathers of new-born or adopted children the right to three months' unpaid leave would be 'immensely disruptive and destructive'. 'As far as the UK is concerned, this is not a right I think we should extend at a time of very high unemployment,' he told journalists. Mr Portillo, a leader of the rightwing Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party, denied that the UK's veto was evidence of the emergence of a multi-speed Europe. 'We are just going in different directions.' Asked whether he would personally want to spend time with a newborn child if he became a father, Mr Portillo said: 'Yes, and my employer could give me paid holiday and I would arrange that with my employer.' This, he said, was 'a matter of personal responsibility'. On parental leave and the works councils directive, UK companies, and 'foreign companies operating in Britain', would have a choice denied to the 11 other EU member states, Mr Portillo added. Offered a four-year exemption from the paternal leave provisions, with a review in 1999, Mr Portillo said: 'The best favour I can do the Council (of Ministers) is to say that these compromises will not work, because it is a matter of principle.' All EU member states except the UK and Ireland already have some provision for paternity leave, and in all but Belgium's case, it is more generous than the EU proposal. On works councils, companies inside the UK are legally exempt from the directive, which is intended to ensure that workers' representatives in companies employing more than 1,000 people, and more than 150 in at least two member states, are consulted on cross-border decisions that affect them, such as redundancies and investment relocation. However, about 100 UK companies operating in mainland Europe will be covered, against some 300 if the rules had applied on British territory. Among the most affected, according to a German study, will be 450 German companies, 250 US corporations in Europe, and 220 cross-border French concerns. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the opt-out for Britain. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director general, said: 'It is now up to the UK employers affected by the directive to choose whether to include their UK employees or not.'

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Career union officials mooted Union officials of the future could be career professionals, paid as highly as the managers they face across the negotiating table, Mr Peter Wickens, personnel director of Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), has told the Commons employment committee. Young people could be recruited 'on the basis of their ability and interest and that they can rise through the ranks by moving from one trade union to another,' he said in written evidence to the committee's inquiry into the future of trade unions. He also criticised the move towards larger unions. 'It is ironic that at a time when companies are actively devolving responsibility and decentralising, trade unions seem to be becoming more monolithic.' Mr Wickens urged unions to provide more training for their officers. Officials should understand 'their members' contributions to productivity and quality improvements and be able to formulate claims accordingly.' Unions could have a role in redressing failures in vocational training, he said. 'The voluntarist approach has not succeeded in establishing a genuine commitment on the part of British employers.' The unions should set a target that no young person aged between 16 and 18 should be employed without a guarantee of off-the-job training.</p>

			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: UK must aim to become a key player in information superhighways Sir, The space you have devoted to the new information superhighway ('France ponders superhighway gamble', October 28) and its potential benefits and implications for the future ('Information groups warned on multimedia hopes', October 26) underlines the importance of the decisions currently under consideration. The screen may replace the school and this issue is of such technological, educational and economic importance that we must ensure the best possible route is taken to allow it to develop and expand. As the report by the research organisation, Inteco, has pointed out,there will not be appreciable revenues from this industry until the next century. However, this cannot inhibit public and private sector expansion into the communications revolution. The key question is the public/private partnership; for example, can public benefits be negotiated for UK citizens comparable with those Vice-President Al Gore is working on in the US? In the US, Gore is operating within a wholly private sector. Equally, in France where the public sector predominates, the ambition is for the establishment of a network of fibre optic cables linking every household by the year 2015. The EU industry commissioner favours bringing the lead in development of a European information superhighway into the domain of private companies; some other states of the EU would prefer public operators to control national infrastructures. Therefore the question is not one of whether private or public sector dominates, but how both sectors can work together constructively and create the blend which delivers the widest benefits for the citizen. In that positive context a future British government will try to develop plans for information superhighways with a close eye on European and global developments. All excursions into the exploration of such high-tech industry must take account of European competition and industry policies. The potential for exciting development exists and we must ensure that Britain becomes a key player in this new revolution and that the benefits will flow to the greatest number of individuals.

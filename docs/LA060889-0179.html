			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA PLACED WITH PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The Southern Section Executive Committee voted, 7-4, Wednesday to group Santa  Margarita High School with other parochial schools for the purpose of placing  the school in an athletic league in the 1990-92 school years.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita, a Catholic school that opened two years ago in Rancho Santa  Margarita, had been rejected earlier by representatives both from the Catholic  Athletic Assn. and the 54 principals from public leagues in Orange County in  determining the placement of the school for the two-year cycle beginning in  1990.  </P> <P> Father Michael Harris, principal of Santa Margarita, said the team wants to  play in a public league in the county, largely because of transportation costs.  That grouping would set a precedent in the county but is common elsewhere in  the Southern Section.  </P> <P> The vote is expected to be appealed to the California Interscholastic  Federation.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita currently competes in the Olympic League, which is composed of  private schools with an average enrollment of 470 students. Santa Margarita  will play in the league next year, but the school is projected to grow to 1,200  students by the time its first senior class graduates in 1991.  </P> <P> Because of its projected size, the school would have to be grouped with county  public schools or with parochial schools of similar enrollment in the 1990-92  league realignment cycle. But neither the public schools nor the Catholic  schools want to accept it.  </P> <P> The school was accepted by league representatives of the county's public  schools last month, then later the move was rejected when many of the county's  54 public schools complained that they were not fairly represented at the  meeting.  </P> <P> Attorney Nicholas Wieczorek, representing the CAA, argued that the cost of  transportation and distance of travel to CAA member schools, such as those in  the Angelus and Del Rey leagues, would be unfair if Santa Margarita was placed  with the parochial schools.  </P> <P> Attorney David Larsen, representing the Saddleback Valley Unified School  District, argued that Santa Margarita has no boundaries and does not have to  accept every student that applies; therefore, it has an unfair advantage over a  public school in athletic competition.  </P> <P> "This is not a religious issue, but a difference in educational philosophies,"  Larsen said. "The public schools in Orange County have a concern over Santa  Margarita's athletic competitiveness."  </P> <P> Harris said he understood the position of each side, and described his school  as "a helpless pawn" amid the controversy.  </P> <P> "We have no power or opportunity to control our destiny," Harris said. "We just  want the opportunity to play. We don't want to cause harm to other schools or  leagues. I don't see any harm in our kids playing in an Orange County athletic  league.  </P> <P> "There is this perception that Santa Margarita is going to create problems for  public high schools that is unfounded. I feel we've been judged, tried,  convicted and sentenced before we've ever competed. Given the opportunity, it  will work out."  </P> <P> Father William Brelsford, principal at St. Bernard, said: "We still maintain  that Santa Margarita belongs in the Orange County geographic location. That's  the only issue we are concerned with. This will be appealed. That, I know."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar Principal Tom Jacobson, president of the council, also felt that  by making an exception, the committee would be making a mistake.  </P> <P> "We're talking about a major change in policy and practice that could set  precedent," he said. "Do we make an exception or continue with a common  practice of placing schools?"  </P></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / International Company News: Sharp falls for two Japanese shipping groups JAPAN'S two largest shipping companies, Nippon Yusen Kaisha and Mitsui OSK Lines, blamed their latest profits declines on a fall in imports to their economically depressed domestic market, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. Nippon Yusen's first-half revenue fell 10 per cent to Y268bn (Dollars 2.47bn), on which pre-tax profits collapsed by 49 per cent to Y3.61bn. Mitsui OSK's first-half taxable profits fell 23.8 per cent to Y2.72bn on turnover down 8.2 per cent to Y223bn.</p>

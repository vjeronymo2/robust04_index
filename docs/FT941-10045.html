			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / People: Mail order man moves his empire Michael Hawker, who resigned as managing director of mail order company Freemans last July, is joining rival Empire Stores as managing director later this year. Hawker was with Freemans for 13 years but left after Sears group chief executive Liam Strong decided a shake-up of management was needed to boost profits growth. He will work with current managing director Jean-Baptiste Tefra as a part-time consultant before taking over later this year. Tefra is returning to parent group La Redoute, the French mail order group which acquired Empire in May 1991, although Empire says he will retain active links with the company. Hawker faces the challenge of returning Empire, the UK's fifth largest mail order company with a 6 per cent market share, to profits after four years of losses.</p>

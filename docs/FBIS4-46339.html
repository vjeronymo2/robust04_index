			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Elias Maluleke] </F>   [Excerpts] Neo-Nazi mercenaries from German -- some of them  possibly posing as tourists -- are being brought into South  Africa in large numbers to wage terrorism against the new  government. Up to 2,500 hired killers could already be in the  country.    A special investigation by City Press has found a terrifying  web of conspiracy between the highly trained mercenaries and  groups of rightwingers bent on toppling the ANC-led Government  of National Unity. Police said they knew many German neo-Nazis  were infiltrating the country -- and warned that they should  expect no mercy from the law.    It has been found that the Nazis -- who enjoy close links  with the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] -- and other secret  organisations -- have been armed with weapons of Russian origin  and provided with military uniforms used by the SADF [South  African Defense Force]. The mercenaries have also been linked  to Third Force activities, the manufacturing of deadly weapons  and gun running.    Security forces believe some of the Nazis enter the country  illegally and are issued with false identification documents.  South African and German authorities are, however, cooperating  in trying to weed out the Nazi assassins.    Although the Department of Home Affairs and National  Statistics Services have no figures of German tourists who  entered SA [South Africa] in March and April, the figure for  February was 10,477, compared to less than 1,000 in January. It  is estimated that more than 800 mercenaries entered the country  in February.    During an interview, which was attended by a foreign  television crew, one of the sources -- who asked to remain  anonymous -- showed City Press a large quantity of rifle bullets  he said he had purchased from the foreigners. [passage omitted]    City Press also found that when Germans enter the country  they are put in a private house in Kempton Park. There they are  given money and documents before they are dispatched to their  underground cells.    The Germans were promised 1,000 German marks per week for  doing duty in South Africa.    A German embassy spokesman in Pretoria said they knew of the  Nazis coming into SA from Namibia and Mozambique. Others came  from Germany, the French Foreign Legion and Bosnia.    "There is little that we can do to stop them coming into the  country with valid documents, even though they are not coming  with good intentions. However, we are working closely with  South African authorities to identify them," he said.    Safety and Security Ministry spokesman Craig Kotze said  police knew of the mercenaries' presence and special action to  counter them had been launched. "They are planning to use South  Africa for easy pickings as a mercenary mecca. But we are  watching them. Their moves are being closely monitored." Kotze  said an investigation was underway into the role of the Nazis as  they were regarded as extremely dangerous.</p>

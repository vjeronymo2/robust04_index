			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Cleaning up the city of Birmingham BIRMINGHAM has started to primp and preen for next week's European Council meeting in the city, Paul Cheeseright writes. 'The first thing to say is we're going to try and make Birmingham the capital of Europe for four days,' the City Council promised. Away go the graffiti, out come more fresh flowers. Underpasses that have depressed and frightened pedestrians for two decades will be hung with banners. Streets will be extra clean. Birmingham Mint is producing special bronze coins: city arms on one side, the symbol of the UK's Community presidency on the other. A special flag will fly: 12 stars with 'Birmingham' in the middle. The city expects about 4,000 people to attend the summit. The Foreign Office thinks the figure will be more like 3,000: 750 from the delegations and about 2,000 from the media. They will converge on the new International Convention Centre, an appropriate place for the summit because the EC met about a quarter of the costs of building it. Journalists who do not arrive early enough will probably be guided into the nearby National Indoor Arena to provide a spectacle in the interregnum between Torvill and Dean and an all-stops-out Carmen.</p>

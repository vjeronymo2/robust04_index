			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Cash stays tight TIGHT conditions prevailed in the UK money markets yesterday forcing overnight rates high and leading to significant late assistance by the Bank of England, writes Peter John. Dealers said the leading banks were once again unprepared to release collateral in the form of bills. There was some suggestion that issuers of short-term bills - mainly companies needing to borrow cash from commercial banks - might be holding back in the belief that they will be able to borrow money at lower rates soon. As a result, the commercial banks may not have had enough bills to take up the offers of Bank of England help. Belief that base rates are about to fall was also reflected in the three-month interbank rate which eased slightly. The daily liquidity shortage was exacerbated by a large round of late assistance on Monday. That was repayable yesterday when the initial shortage forecast of Pounds 1.25bn was later revised to Pounds 1.4bn. Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 889m, and Exchequer transactions, which removed Pounds 295m. Partly offsetting these was a fall in note circulation injecting Pounds 120m into the system. The Bank of England provided Pounds 216m of early assistance via bills for resale in equal amounts on November 9 and 10 at 5 29/32 per cent. It provided Pounds 131m later, buying Pounds 121m of band one bank bills at the established 5 7/8 per cent rate and Pounds 10m of bills for resale on November 9 and 10 at 5 29/32 per cent, and a further Pounds 492m in the afternoon. It was not until after the official close that the shortage was finally taken out with late assistance of Pounds 690m at the customary unspecified rate. December short sterling futures, which reflect the market's view of where rates will be when the contract expires on December 15, remained steady at 94.61 ahead of the latest retail sales figures today. At that level, the contract discounts a half-point base rate cut. French short-term interest rate futures eased slightly shortly after the official close. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the governor of the Bank of France, said the country was still committed to a stable currency and rumours of a move toward a shift in monetary policy were false. The December contract rallied later to around 93.57.</p>

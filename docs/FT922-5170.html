			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Sears Sears' executive pay remains modest by the standards of Burton under its old management: according to its latest annual report and accounts, the entire board received emoluments worth a mere Pounds 1.6m last year. It is nevertheless curious that this was a 35 per cent increase on the previous year. Sears' pre-tax profits fell by 45 and 37 per cent in the last two years respectively, so there was little by way of performance-related pay in the directors' pot. The explanation lies in a series of boardroom expansions and reshufflings during the year, including an unfortunate six-month period when there were two chief executives on the pay-roll. Investors will doubtless watch with interest what happens to directors' pay if the group's much-vaunted recovery finally gets under way.</p>

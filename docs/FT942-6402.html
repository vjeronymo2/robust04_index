			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / LDP ex-official jailed over bribes Japan's opposition Liberal Democratic party suffered a fresh blow yesterday when Mr Fumio Abe, a former senior LDP official, received a three-year jail term for taking bribes. The downfall of 71-year-old Mr Abe, once a close associate of former prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa, comes at a time when a demoralised LDP is trying to disassociate itself from its corrupt past and attract public support for a return to government. This follows the arrest in March of Mr Kishiro Nakamura, a former LDP construction minister, on charges of receiving bribes. Mr Abe's jailing is the latest in a recent resurgence of political corruption scandals, a factor in the instability of Japanese government and near paralysis in policy making. Mr Abe, who is to appeal against the Tokyo district court ruling, was found guilty of taking Y630m (Pounds 4m) from Kyowa, a now defunct steel frame maker and property company. In return, Mr Abe helped Kyowa get construction jobs in Hokkaido, where he was head of the local development agency. The Kyowa scandal was one in a chain of events that led to last June's collapse of the Miyazawa government. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa - Mr Miyazawa's immediate successor - resigned last month after just eight months in office because of alleged financial impropriety.</p>

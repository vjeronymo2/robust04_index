			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 21 April EESTI SENUMID, P.EVALEHT, HOMMIKULEHT, pp 1, </F> 3, 4; "News Bulletin" No. 76/94]    [Text] The 10 right-wing parties and organisations that  met in Tallinn on Tuesday [19 April] formed a new organisation  "Parem Eesti" (Better Estonia), a news conference was told  yesterday ("Parem" can mean both "better" or "rightwing" in  Estonian and a founding member Hellar Grabbi claimed the  ambiguity to be deliberate).    The activists of the new organisation stressed that they did  not invite the ruling coalition members, since their policy has  been disappointing. Another fringe party, the Future Estonia  Party, refused to participate because of ideological difference.  Negotiations with some other organisations are in progress, but  the results have not been disclosed yet. One of the initiators,  Juri Estam, stressed that the organisation will not cooperate  with right-wing extremists, referring to the Patriotic Central  Union.    The initiators denied having formed the organisation for  improving their chances at the elections; the aim was to  actually restore the Estonian nation state, the organisation  statement read. A political party or an electoral union may be  formed, but there is no firm decision on that issue as yet.    The "Better Estonia" intends to use decolonisation and  desovietisation in order to achieve its aims. Green Party  chairman Juri Liim stressed that they intend to employ  "civilised decolonisation" by appealing to the Russian  Government to recall its colonists. A thorough investigation of  the activities of the Communist Party and the KGB and the GRU  [Soviet Army Intelligence] in Estonia was also mentioned as an  important part of the programme. Further items include rapid  return of land and property to the legal owners and support to  private ownership.    The organisation denounced the draft law of the Tallinn City  Council recommending that all persons registered as permanent  residents of Tallinn as of 1 July 1990 be granted permanent  residence permits. The council is exceeding its authority, the  "Better Estonia" declared.</p>

Tossed about by political battles which go way beyond  it, this modest institution has so far not had much luck. For  three years, France, although it initiated the project, blocked  any decision on the agency's headquarters while the future of  the European Parliament in Strasbourg was threatened. The  affair was settled last year and resulted in the selection of  Copenhagen as the final headquarters.    This new Community body, modest in size, corresponds to an  extremely ambitious objective: To finally give the European  Union the means of pursuing a real environment policy. "In the  absence of any reliable statistics, we cannot say anything about  the state of the environment and respect for the directives in  the different countries of the Union," Ioannis Paleokrassas,  current commissioner for the environment in the European  Commission, admitted. It is still impossible to compare the  quantity of waste consumed, air pollution, or the quality of  water between two Union countries. Indeed, Brussels' aim is to  have a reliable and indisputable tool which enables it both to  prepare future directives on the environment more efficiently  and to monitor their effectiveness on the ground.  <H5>  Independence but Modest Budget </H5>   "The original idea was also to combat ecological  inequalities  by preventing the transfer of polluting activities to less  demanding countries," Jacques Varet, director of research at the  Environment Ministry and first chief of the French Environment  Institute (IFEN), explained. The aim now is to gather, check,  and process data coming from the whole European Union in order  to make them available to Brussels but also to the member states  and the public (associations or enterprises).    To carry out its task effectively, the agency will have  around 40 people an a budget of around 10 million ECU's  [European Currency Units] (ECU 9.5 million this year, almost ECU  13 million when fully operational). These are limited means  which force it to work through a network. Correspondents in  each country, called "focal points" in Community jargon, will  have the task of collecting these data. In Germany, the focal  point will simply be the big Federal Environment Agency, whereas  France has set up a body especially devoted to this work -- the  IFEN. It is for the European Agency to harmonize the methods,  to compile and interpret the results. In addition, for specific  requests, the agency will use thematic centers (which may or may  not be focal points) on specific subjects such as air, water,  noise, waste, or land use.  <H5>  Political Role </H5>   At first, the agency will mainly work on air and water  quality, natural habitats, and waste. These priorities were all  defined in the Fifth EU Framework Program. Every three years it  will publish a report on the environment, a vast compendium  including all the data harmonized at European level. Meanwhile,  it will design specific studies, for instance on acid rain,  waste transportation, or the greenhouse effect.    The director of the agency should be appointed in April. A  work program covering several years will then be drawn up before  the summer. Officially, this institution will work completely  independently. This is demonstrated by the fact that its  18-member administrative council will comprise in particular two  Commission members, two others appointed by the European  Parliament, one representative per member state, a  representative from Eurostat (the European statistical body),  and one from the Joint Research Centers. This independence could  ultimately engender tension. Although all states agree on the  need to have a data collection tool, many are worried about  seeing this institution transformed into a censor with the task  of pointing out the good and bad students (which are not  necessarily those you would expect...) in the European Union in  the sphere of the environment and the implementation of EU  directives.    This is a "political" role which it is so far being refused  but which Brussels would like to see it playing. If it is  simply a question of compiling and harmonizing statistics, was  there any need to create a new body when a powerful tool in this  sphere already exists with Eurostat? In addition, the web-like  organization of the network, with focal points intersected by  thematic centers, raises the fear of an escalation of  bureaucracy, for which Brussels is already all too often  criticized.    The agency, because of this "battle of headquarters," comes  rather late, at a time when many of the European directives have  already been adopted or are "in the pipeline" and especially at  a time when the environment no longer has the same influence as  before within the Commission and in the member states. It will  therefore quickly have to prove that, despite its late arrival,  it is still an observation post which is more vital than ever.</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Spain's inflation rate on course SPANISH inflation fell last month to its lowest year-on-year September level since 1987, fuelling market expectations of interest rate cuts soon. The pressure on the monetary authorities to help kick-start the economy with lower rates has built up since figures released at the beginning of the week showed that the number of new unemployed between January and September had risen by 336,770. A total of 2.5m Spaniards, or 16.6 per cent of the active working population, are now registered as seeking jobs. Prices rose by 0.6 per cent last month to bring accumulated inflation for the first nine months of the year to 3.9 per cent. Year-on-year headline inflation is now down from 4.6 per cent at the end of August to 4.3 per cent at the end of last month. Underlying inflation, which excludes the more volatile prices of non-processed foods and energy, fell from an annual rate of 5.7 per cent to 5.4 per cent. There has been a significant slowdown in price rises in the services sector, which is now feeling the impact of recession. Analysts said that although annualised inflation is expected to rise slightly in the next three months to stand above 4.5 per cent at the end of the year, there was now room for the Bank of Spain to follow up on a half-point interest cut it introduced at the begining of September when it brought its key intervention rate down to 10 per cent. Since the last rate cut, the government has unveiled a restrictive 1994 budget that reduces expenditure and has an inflation rate target for the end of next year of 3.5 per cent.</p>

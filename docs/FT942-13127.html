			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (22): Software star of the Olympics - Transaction Management One of the stars at this year's Winter Olympic Games in Lillehammer, Norway, was, according to IBM, a 25-year-old software package. Known by the initials CICS, this veteran program was responsible for managing the results and information network installed at the games. The journalists and commentators in Lillehammer were unaware that they were CICS 'users' as the intricacies of the technology were hidden by a user-friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs - with their pull-down menus, icons and overlapping windows). But they joined millions of people around the world who, unknowingly, rely on CICS software every day. You probably are a CICS user yourself. Many of the automatic teller machines (ATM) operated by banks and building societies are controlled by CICS and most large companies use it. CICS - an acronym for for Customer Information Control System - is the most successful example of a transaction processing (TP) monitor. It addresses a persistent problem in computing: how to share a single resource among many users. Typically, TP monitors like CICS are used to control access to important data and ensure it does not become corrupt. In a banking system a TP monitor controls access from ATMs to individual accounts. The standard procedure involves entering a magnetic stripe card into the machine's reader, typing in a personal identification number (PIN) and requesting a service, such as cash withdrawal or balance statement. The ATM sends a series of messages to a central computer, where the account details are checked. If the user is authorised, a message is sent back to the ATM to carry out the customer's request. With all of these messages moving around the network, it is easy to imagine that an important one might get lost. This is where the TP monitor comes in, by ensuring that messages get to the right destination and that appropriate data files are updated. It also synchronises changes to data and makes sure that users do not have to wait too long for a response. As the longevity of CICS illustrates, TP monitors are well-established in large-scale mainframe data processing. PC networks, however, do not as yet have mechanisms like this. But with a move to client-server computing, (see page four), they are being expected to provide the security and the resilience to equal mainframes and minicomputers. A COMPLEX TASK Controlling communication traffic between many computers and environments attached to a network is a complex task at any level. But the software structures needed to make an open network of personal computers and servers match the mainframe for performance and reliability are only now beginning to find their way on to the PC agenda. The root of the problem lies in how business transactions are processed. These involve far more than passing an 'e-mail' message or a request for data to a server - functions which a PC network can perform adequately enough. Processing business transactions demands a solid foundation of management software to make sure that it is properly controlled. When, for example, a company receives an order, a whole sequence of processes is set in motion. The customer's credit is checked, the ledger is updated, stock counts are reduced and so on. Some of these processes follow each other and others can happen in parallel. Above all, they must be controlled and managed - or orders may be lost or duplicated. If the order processing application is distributed across a client/server network, a high-level, transaction 'manager' - a sort of 'super' TP monitor  -is essential. There are a number of possible candidates for this role. Conventional TP monitors are being extended from their proprietary base to cope with 'open' client-server systems and IBM has extended CICS to all of its main hardware platforms and operating environments - in addition to licensing it to other manufacturers. Novell is developing the Tuxedo monitor, which it inherited from its takeover of Unix Systems Laboratories, to compete with CICS in client-server systems. Database software developers are also building transaction management features into their database products. Oracle, Ingres, Sybase and Informix all offer some level of transaction management as part of their products. Emerging standards in object-oriented computing (see software engineering, this page) also include transaction management features. It seems likely that the problem of managing transactions in an open client-server environment will be solved by a combination of one or more of these approaches. What is clear, however, is that it is a problem which will continue to grow and demand the attention of software developers across every aspect of modern computing.</p>

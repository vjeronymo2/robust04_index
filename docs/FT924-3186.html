			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Observer: Free lunch? If public relations is all about winning friends and influencing people, then the small London PR outfit Rostron Parry may well be approaching its profession the wrong way. Its invitation certainly stands out from the general run as the Christmas party announcements roll in. Rostron Parry takes 'great pleasure' in inviting Observer to lunch . . . then asks for a cheque for Pounds 14 to cover food and 'a reasonable amount of drink'. Can times be so hard that even journalists are expected to pay their own way?</p>

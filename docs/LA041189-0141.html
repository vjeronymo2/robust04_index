			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> COCAINE SEIZED AT 2 WESTMINSTER LOCATIONS; 11 COLOMBIANS ARRESTED  </P> <P> Police have arrested 11 Colombians, seized almost 1,200 pounds of cocaine and  recovered about $103,000 in cash in Los Angeles and Orange counties, Los  Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates announced today.  </P> <P> Three of the suspects were arrested at a shopping center in Westminster, where  about 950 pounds of cocaine was recovered from their van. Another 220 pounds of  the drug was recovered from a home in Westminster. Gates said the suspects are  "top-level people" in the distribution of drugs shipped in from overseas. He  said most of the confiscated cocaine probably had been destined for shipment to  other cities across the United States. The arrests late Monday culminated a  two-month investigation, Gates said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> O.C. SPRAYING CALLED A SUCCESS  </P> <P> The first aerial pesticide spraying in Orange County history was concluded over  a 10-square-mile area early this morning, with officials calling the bid to  stamp out the destructive Mediterranean fruit fly a success.  </P> <P> "Everything seemed to go as planned and scheduled," Frank Parsons, chief deputy  agricultural commissioner, said this morning. "It went just like clockwork."  </P> <P> Today hundreds took time out to clean off patio furniture and wash cars. At  several lots, operators hosed down Christmas trees.  </P> <P> "Business has been brisk since we opened," said Jose Ramirez, manager of the  Brea Car Wash. "We have done almost double the business we usually do on a day  like today."  </P> <P> Parsons said that the spraying was finished shortly after midnight, an hour  ahead of schedule, and that the "Santa Ana winds didn't present any problem."  </P> <P> Traps in the area will be closely monitored to determine if a repeat spraying  will be needed, Parsons said.  </P></p>

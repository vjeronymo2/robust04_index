			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> RANCHO ALAMITOS PRESSES THE ISSUE AGAINST GARDEN GROVE  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos High School applied its full-court press to perfection Friday  night, reeling off 29 consecutive points in the second quarter, and went on to  a 101-73 victory over visiting Garden Grove.  </P> <P> "That's the way we practice it," Rancho Alamitos Coach Eric Hamamoto said of  the scoring streak, "but you never expect the press to create that kind of  run."  </P> <P> Although he didn't score a point, Oscar Ramirez, a 5-foot-6 guard, keyed the  scoring run with five steals.  </P> <P> "Defense is what I do best," Ramirez said. "Lately, I've been sitting out a  lot, but getting back in there tonight and helping the team felt good."  </P> <P> Garden Grove kept the score close early, closing to 22-21 on Bob Ioja's layup  moments into the second quarter. Ioja finished with 24 points.  </P> <P> But the Vaqueros responded with their spree to take a 51-21 lead with 3:15 left  in the half.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos (16-4 overall, 10-1 in league play) remained tied for first  place in the Garden Grove League with Kennedy.  </P> <P> Garden Grove (9-11, 7-4) scored just seven points in the second quarter, making  three of 18 shots from the field. Rancho Alamitos also forced 11 turnovers in  the quarter.  </P> <P> Paul Pruess sank four of eight three-point shots and finished with 26 points  for the Vaqueros. David Green added 21 points for Rancho Alamitos, and Mark  Perry had 18 points for Garden Grove.  </P> <P> In other league games:  </P> <P> Santiago 59, La Quinta 56 (OT) -- Van Trung banked in a 40-foot shot at the  buzzer to give Santiago (7-12, 3-8) the victory at La Quinta. Paul Hastings hit  a turnaround jump shot from five feet with 18 seconds left in regulation to  send the game into overtime for La Quinta (0-19, 0-11).  </P> <P> Kennedy 72, Los Amigos 43 -- Jim Barker had 27 points and nine rebounds and  Jermaine Galloway had 12 points and nine rebounds to lead host Kennedy (13-6,  10-1).  </P> <P> Bolsa Grande 60, Pacifica 54 -- Hinh Bui scored 21 points to lead visiting  Bolsa Grande (7-11, 5-6).  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Dissatisfaction benefits far right - Belgium Many Belgians were shocked by the unexpectedly successful advance of the far right, not only in Dutch-speaking Flanders but in francophone Wallonia. A doubling of the Flemish Vlaams Blok vote and a sharp swing to the National Front in Wallonia means that three of Belgium's 25 seats in the European parliament will be occupied by the extreme right. Vlaams Blok, the Flemish extremist party that wants independence for Flanders, lifted its share of the vote from 6.6 per cent in 1989 to 12.6 per cent, increasing its seats in the European parliament from one to two. More startling - the Vlaams Blok had already made its presence felt in the 1991 national parliamentary elections - was the popularity of the National Front in Wallonia. It won 7.9 per cent of the vote, from nothing in 1989. Both far-right parties had campaigned on an anti-Maastricht ticket, although few commentators yesterday believed that it was this that had encouraged voters to support them. Being 'anti-Maastricht' appeared to be less about opposing a federal Europe and more about tapping into resentment prompted by the presence of so many well-paid, tax-exempt foreigners in Belgium's capital, home to the European Union's main insitutions. 'The essence of their appeal was that they were racist and anti-foreigners,' said Mr Diederik Thibaut, a political analyst at Kredietbank, adding that extreme-right parties had also benefited from general and widespread dissatisfaction with the traditional parties. The election's other big surprise was that the Flemish Christian Democrats - Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's CVP party - maintained their position as the ruling party in Flanders. The revamped Flemish Liberal party - the VLD - had threatened to upset the CVP's hegemony, untouched since the last war, a threat backed up by opinion polls over the past two years. In fact, the CVP share of the vote dropped to 27.4 per cent in Flanders, from 34.1 per cent, their seats falling from five to four. The VLD meanwhile, made only a paltry gain from 17.1 per cent of the vote to 18.4 per cent, an increase of one seat to three. The francophone Liberals had a similarly disappointing day, their share of the vote rising from 22.8 per cent to 24.2 per cent. The relative strength of the CVP is good news for the ruling coalition, should Mr Dehaene depart from the government to become president of the European Commission. His successor, backed by Sunday's election results, would be in a stronger position and thus better able to hold the coalition together. In Wallonia, the Socialist party's woes, brought on by corruption scandals, were reflected in a massive 9 per cent drop in their share of the vote from almost 40 per cent in the last European elections to just under 30 per cent. 'We knew we were going to lose,' said Mr Phillipe Busquin, president of the Wallonian Socialists. 'The loss is very significant, this is not a good result. . . we are paying for 'the affairs' and socio-economic difficulties.' Corruption scandals also hit the French-speaking Christian Democrats. Their share of the vote dropped to 18.8 per cent from 21 per cent. The Green parties - Ecolo on the French side and Agalev on the Flemish  - which did so well in the 1989 election, failed to improve on that election's successes. Ecolo's share of the vote dropped to 13 per cent from 16.5 per cent, their seats falling to only one from two. Agalev also lost ground, although it maintained its one seat. One explanation for their setback was their support for 'ecotaxes', very unpopular in Belgium, although other commentators suggested that their reputation had been knocked following their foray into national politics.  ---------------------------------------------- Population: 10.0m Seats: 25  ---------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 90.7%, 1989, 90.7%)  ---------------------------------------------- Party*     Parliament    % vote        Seats              group     '94    '89   '94    '89  ---------------------------------------------- CVP           EPP     17.1   21.1     4      5 VLD           LDR     11.4   10.6     3      2 PS            PES     11.3   14.5     3      5 SP            PES     11.0   12.4     3      3 PRL           LDR      9.0    7.2     3      2 VB             ER      7.8    4.1     2      1 PSC           EPP      7.0    8.1     2      2 Agalev     Greens      6.7    7.6     1      1 Ecolo      Greens      4.8    6.3     1      2 VU            RBW      4.4    5.4     1      1 FN             ER      2.9      -     1      - CSP           EPP      0.2      -     1      -  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior  ---------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations:  ---------------------------------------------- CSP = Christian Social Party; CVP = Christian People's Party; FN = Front National; PS = Parti Socialiste; SP = Socialist party; PSC = Christian Social Party; PRL = Liberal Reform party; VB = Vlaams Blok; VLD = Flemish Liberals and Democrats; VU = Volksunie  ---------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  ---------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  ---------------------------------------------- Proportional from regional lists Compulsory voting:  Yes  ---------------------------------------------- MEPs  ---------------------------------------------- SP Freddy Willockx, Anne Van Lancker, Steve Stevaert  ---------------------------------------------- PS Jose Happart, Raymonde Dury, Claude Desama  ---------------------------------------------- CVP Leo Tindemans, Wilfried Martens, Marianne Thyssen, Raf Chanterie  ---------------------------------------------- PSC Gerard Deprez, Fernand Herman  ---------------------------------------------- Flemish Liberals and Democrats Annemie Neyts, Willy de Clercq, Mimi Kestelyn-Sierens  ---------------------------------------------- VU Jaak Vandemeulebroucke  ---------------------------------------------- PRL Jean Gol, Antoinette Spaak, Anna Andre  ---------------------------------------------- Agalev Magda Aelvoet  ---------------------------------------------- Ecolo Paul Lannoye  ---------------------------------------------- Vlaams Blok Karel Dillen, Frank Vanhecke  ---------------------------------------------- FN (National Front) Daniel Feret  ---------------------------------------------- Based on preliminary results issued by the European Parliament.

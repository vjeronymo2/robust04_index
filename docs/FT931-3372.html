			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): A culture clash of capitalist creeds CAPITALISM AGAINST CAPITALISM by Michel Albert Whurr Publishers Pounds 14.95, 260 pages WHEN MICHEL Albert, president of the insurance group Assurances Generales de France, wrote his book Capitalism against Capitalism, he wanted to warn the European Community against the dangers of unfettered, US-style capitalism. His thesis is that in the absence of communism as a realistic alternative, two strands of capitalism are at loggerheads with each other. In one corner there is what Albert calls the 'neo-American' model based on individual achievement and short-term financial gain; in the other is the Rhine model, of German pedigree but with strong Japanese connections. This model emphasises collective success, consensus and long-term concerns. The Rhine model, 'unheralded, unsung and lacking even nominal identity papers', has shown itself to be the more efficient of the two strands, says Albert. But in spite of this, the less efficient, more aggressive of the two variants (the neo-American model) is in the ascendant, representing 'a clear and present danger'. To drive his point home, Albert has littered his book with some astonishingly sweeping claims. Whatever the shortcomings of the US system, it is hard to take him seriously when he writes: 'It would no doubt come as a shock to the Brazilian lecturer, the Egyptian intellectual or the Nigerian don to find out that there is more than one kind of market economy, to be shown the proof that Rhine capitalism does not follow the same rules he has seen acted out in last night's sub-titled episode of Dallas - and that its results are, on the whole, more impressive.' Or, another example; 'In former times the poor revolted; today, dulled to a stupor by the drab ordinariness of their squalor (which never appears on their TV screens), they do not even bother to vote.' The cavalier way in which Albert advances his arguments is not the only problem. Its main defect is that the English version (translated by Paul Haviland) is in need of updating. Albert's thesis, that the neo-American model is in the ascendant, is rendered less relevant by the day and many of the book's claims sound dated. 'The veneration of Reaganism has been growing steadily since the mid-1980s. From Brasilia to Lagos, it is today the very embodiment of the ideals of success, prosperity and vitality,' he says, in a chapter entitled 'America is Back' which sets out to show how Reagan's America is spreading its influence across the globe. Not even Americans remain devotees of Reaganomics. They have just elected a President whose economic policy - an investment strategy to stimulate growth, reduction of the federal budget deficit and reform of the health care system - smacks more of the so-called Rhine model than the non-interventionist approach of presidents Reagan and Bush. Elsewhere too, recession has altered attitudes to economic policy. In the UK John Major is disassociating himself from some of the more excessive free-market policies of his predecessor and drifting towards an industrial policy. The ex-Comecon countries that opened their arms to the 'neo-American' model in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of the Berlin wall are now taking a more sceptical approach. The author is on stronger ground in his actual critique of the US economic system. It is surely right to ask why America leads the advanced nations in drug abuse and crime; why the public education system is 'in tatters'; why the infant mortality rate is twice that of Japan. He is equally cutting about the failings of the US financial system, where the short-term satisfaction of shareholders comes first, to the neglect of research and development and skills training. This, he says, stands in poor contrast to the 'well managed consensus' of the Rhine model. While these questions remain relevant, overall the debate has moved on too quickly. Recent developments suggest that the two strands of capitalism are moving closer rather than further apart. In the US, an interventionist president has been elected while in Europe doubts about the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty in countries other than the UK suggest opinion is shying away from excessive regulation. Meanwhile, it would be interesting to hear Albert's thoughts about the strains that the recession is putting on that supreme example of the Rhine model, Germany.</p>

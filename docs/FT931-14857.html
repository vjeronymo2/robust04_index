			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / International Company News: MCRB plans to generate cash MALAYSIAN Resources (MCRB), a group mainly involved in the property sector, has disclosed details of how it intends to raise the cash to take up controlling stakes in the New Straits Times Press, Malaysia's biggest media group, and TV3, the country's only privately-owned television station. Last week, the Renong Group, the sprawling conglomerate controlled by the United Malays National Organisation, the country's main political party, announced plans for the MDollars 800m (USDollars 320m) sale of NSTP and TV3 to Realmild, a small company controlled by four senior NSTP executives. Subsequently, the four announced that MCRB would be the takeover vehicle for the management buy-out of Renong's media interests. MCRB plans to raise MDollars 440m through a rights issue, MDollars 110m through bonds with transferable subscription rights and MDollars 250m through bank borrowings and internally generated funds. Under the terms of the deal reached between Realmild and Renong, the cash for the media interests - bought at a substantial premium to NSTP's and TV3's present share prices - has to be raised within six months. The deal has been viewed with intense interest - and some scepticism - by Malaysia's business people and politicians. There are doubts that even if the MCRB cash-raising exercise is successful, Realmild will be able to generate enough cash from NSTP and TV3 to repay loans and provide dividends to shareholders. Realmild is believed to be closely linked to Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister. Analysts say Mr Anwar is keen to gain influence over the country's important media groups in the run-up to party elections later this year which are likely to decide a successor to Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the country's prime minister. It is believed that Realmild might need a substantial cash injection to make its acquisitions of NSTP and TV3 a success. There have been rumours that Hicom, an investment holding company controlled by the ministry of finance, might be interested in taking up a stake in Realmild.</p>

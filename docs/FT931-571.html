			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, is expected to report substantially increased pre-tax profits, from Pounds 185m to about Pounds 248m, when its 1992 results are published today. Interest will focus on how the group has integrated Tozer Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing concern bought for Pounds 383m at the end of 1991, and which is thought to have enhanced earnings. Analysts will also want to hear how Toyota and Mazda vehicles are faring, now the car market is at last showing signs of recovery. Interims, also today, from Lucas Industries, one of the largest UK engineering groups, will provide few surprises. The group has already made clear its 1992-93 first half will be little better than the previous year when it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 200,000. But it is expecting to earn enough over the full year to pay a maintained covered dividend of 7p, pointing to total pre-tax profits of around Pounds 75m. Pearson, the diversified group which includes the Financial Times in its range of interests, is forecast to show a fall in 1992 profits when it announces today. Analysts are looking for around Pounds 140m-Pounds 146m, compared to Pounds 173.8m the year before. However, a maintained dividend is expected. Low activity in the US oil industry will have hit Camco, while recession will have taken its toll at Royal Doulton and the entertainments divisions. Construction company Taylor Woodrow is expected to reveal pre-tax losses for last year of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m when it announces results tomorrow. Analysts are expecting more than Pounds 60m of write downs to bring the company's land bank and properties into line with current market levels. After cutting its dividend at the interim stage, the final is also likely to be cut, possibly to 0.5p compared to 7.64p last year. Analysts following Burmah Castrol believe the lubricants, chemicals and fuels group will on Thursday report annual profits ranging from Pounds 82m-Pounds 86m, compared with Pounds 79m in 1991. The uncertainty arises because concern over the group's exposure to the faltering German economy, increased by its acquisition of the Foseco metallurgical business, is balanced by prospects for synthetic oil products in the US.</p>

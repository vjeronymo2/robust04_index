			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vasconcelo Quadros] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo -- The investigation into the corruption  scheme put together by Paulo Cesar Farias [PC], treasurer of  former President Collor's electoral campaign, led the Federal  Police [PF] to the largest clandestine network of operations  installed in the financial system. They also found out that  Brazil has become one of the largest Latin American fiscal  havens.    Subdivisions of the PC scheme could be identified in nearly  200 large companies. To get an idea of the mountain of money  that circulates in the arteries of this suspicious system, it is  enough to cite three foreign financial and exchange companies  being investigated: America, Guarani, and Amambai. These three  companies conducted operations in Brazil in 1991 and 1992  totalling more than $7 billion.  <H5>  Bank Secrecy </H5>   The Cambio America S.A. company, which is headquartered in  Panama, operated through its 0673-35-000069/3 account with the  Foz de Iguacu branch of the Sao Paulo State Bank [Banespa] and  moved more than $2 billion from February 1992 to December 1993.  The only explanation the police have so far about the origin and  destination of this money is contained in the bank balance  sheets obtained after bank secrecy on the account was lifted.    The Guarani Cambio S.A. company, from Paraguay, used account  number 0237-02-018-05 of the Ponta Pora (Mato Grosso do Sul  State) branch of Bamerindus and has operated with as much as $4  billion. The Amambai Cambio S.A. company, which police suspect  is linked to Guarani Cambio S.A., has deposited more than $1  billion in its account number 0237-17-731-10, also at the  Bamerindus Ponta Pora branch.    The three companies were created outside the country to  purchase and sell foreign currency, gold, silver, and any kind  of exchange operation. In the Central Bank [BC], however, there  is no request for operations in their name. The only data on  them is the bank register. "There is strong evidence that they  supplied funds to ghost accounts and `oranges' (people who lent  their names for illicit transactions). These details were  unveiled during investigations into the PC case," a PF source  reported. The first inquest on the Alagoas State-born  businessman was opened two years ago. Currently, this number has  increased to 40. Police now want to identify what other  operations these enterprises have conducted in Brazil.  <H5>  Pursuit </H5>   The three financial companies were identified during the  banking investigation of Cross Financial Corporation and Accent  Financial Corporation, which are headquartered in the Virgin  Islands' fiscal haven. The Cross and Accent companies operated  with an estimated $150 million. Also included among the PC  scheme companies is Kenaco Finance from Panama. According to the  BC investigation, this company operated through an account in  the Sao Paulo branch of Lloyds Bank and sent $1 billion abroad  in 14 months.    The account trustee was Uruguayan Salomao Sapov Kaplan,  whose  preventive arrest has been decreed in Brazil as a result of his  involvement in the PC scheme. Kaplan has been missing and the PF  believe he is a "professional orange" who operated in several  countries. Two other trustees of CC-5 (Circular Letter No. 5,  which was created by the BC to allow foreigners to receive and  send dollars abroad) accounts, from the Cross and Accent  companies -- Ezequiel Amaranto Camerini and Roberto Carlos Dias  Sosa -- are also being sought in Brazil. A few days ago, they  asked the courts to revoke their arrest warrants so they could  return to the country, but Judge Pedro Paulo Castello Branco of  the Brasilia 10th Federal Court denied the request.    According to the PF, evidence indicates that the flow of  suspicious money between Brazil and foreign countries may total  20 percent of the volume of foreign trade operations. Of this  total, the PC scheme operations were a minority. Nearly 700  companies registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission  are using the legal instrument represented by the CC-5 in the  country. So far, most of them have not created problems for the  government. Although police have barely begun uncovering a  portion of the network, there is strong evidence that the origin  and destination of these dollars may clash with several articles  of the Penal Code.  <H5>  Genealogy </H5>   The 270,000-page pile of the so-called mother inquest into  the PC case has resulted in the opening of 81 more PF inquests  -- 40 are related to the PC scheme and the rest to suspicious  activities by other enterprises. As a result of the new  investigation, 255 people have been indicted. They range from  former President Fernando Collor to the so-called "oranges." The  federal courts have suspended bank secrecy on more than 300 cash  accounts, 70 of them fictitious and opened in the name of 50  ghosts. Another policemen remarked: "We do not know where the  investigation will lead us, but we are certain we have uncovered  the activities of a network that has operated for years without  being controlled."    The network's discovery also has allowed the PF to  investigate CC-5 accounts in more detail. These accounts feed  the parallel dollar market and practically the overall  clandestine system, which is directly linked to the fiscal  havens. In these havens, a delicate method is used to make  identification as difficult as possible. One of the operations  detected by police shows that a $1.2 million remittance by a  company named RAS Holding left Luxembourg on 26 May 1993, passed  by the Indo-Suez Bank in Switzerland, an account in the Virgin  Islands, and two days later already had been made hidden and  distributed among the accounts of two Brazilian companies, the  names of which are being kept secret.</p>

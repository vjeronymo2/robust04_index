			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / French claim of presidential phone taps FRANCE'S beleaguered Socialist government yesterday ran into another scandal when Liberation, the daily newspaper, claimed that President Francois Mitterrand's security staff had in the mid-1980s illegally bugged a journalist's telephone. Liberation claims to have discovered security service transcripts of 16 phone conversations from the home of Mr Edwy Plenel, an investigative journalist on Le Monde newspaper, between December 30 1985 and February 26 1986. Mr Plenel was at the time researching an article on the falsification of evidence by the security services to convict three suspected Irish terrorists. All three were later released. The newspaper did not disclose its source for the documents, which bore the signature of Mr Pierre-Yves Gilleron, a member of France's intelligence service and a member of the cell in charge of the president's security. Mr Plenel wrote in Le Monde that Mr Gilleron admitted to him having been ordered 10 years ago to investigate whether Le Monde and Liberation journalists working on the Irish case had been involved in any political activities. President Mitterrand's staff refused to comment on the Liberation article. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he had no knowledge of the affair but expressed confidence that a law passed in 1991 had cleared up phone-tapping abuses. Mr Plenel said on French radio that he would take legal action. Under French law, the security services are only allowed to tap the telephones of suspected terrorists. Two prominent industrialists working for the government at the time both denied any knowledge of a bug on Mr Plenel's phone. Mr Louis Schweitzer, now chairman of Renault and then head of the private office of Mr Laurent Fabius, prime minister, said his policy was always to refuse requests to tap journalists' phones. The security services should have cleared all bugging requests with Mr Schweitzer. Mr Gilles Menage, now chairman of the EdF electricity group and then deputy director of Mr Mitterrand's private office, denied any knowledge of the alleged bugging.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Polonitskiy: "The Catastrophe Reminds of </F> Itself: The Incidence of Cancer Is on the Rise in Bryansk  Oblast"]    [Text] Bryansk--Over the eight years since Chernobyl, there  had been an increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in  Bryansk Oblast. Over seven years before the accident, 111 cases  of thyroid cancer had been registered in the oblast. Today the  statistics show 546 cases. The incidence of this disease  increased annually at a rate of 70 percent, while for other  types of cancer this indicator was only 1.5-2.0 percent.  Specialists associate the onslaught of thyroid cancer with the  radiation the population had been subjected to during the first  days of the catastrophe, when information about the tragedy was  carefully kept under wraps and local party bosses led the people  out to the May Day demonstration. Workers solidarity has cost  the Bryansk region residents dearly: The radiation background in  some areas of Bryansk Oblast reached 200 microroentgen an hour.    Currently the oblast administration takes steps to provide  social protection for those who were affected during the  catastrophe at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, However, it  is also time for the federal authorities to pay their debts,  which currently amount to about R50 billion.</p>

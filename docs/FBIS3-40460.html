			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] As director of the Fukuoka Prefecture Industrial  Technology Center for two years until last April, I would like  to describe my experience in participating in the promotion of  regional technology from the perspective of the prefecture.    As you well know, all the urban and rural prefectures and  one  tenth of the cities have a kohsetsushi (Technology Upgrading  Center) located in it. The total number of researchers is about  15,000. This number is 1.5 times the number at national research  institutes, excluding universities, and is in no way a small  number. Also, in contrast to the high concentration of the  researchers of private, national, and special corporations in  the Tokyo metropolitan district, naturally, these researchers  are distributed throughout the regional areas.    In kohsetsushi, 4,200 to 4,300 people, a little less than  30% of the total, are in the so-called industrial system  that  belongs to a commercial and industrial department. The number of  researchers at the kohsetsushi in the Chugoku region is about  320 people, 7 to 8% of the national total. Even when  looked at  in terms of the percentage of the total population and  industrial shipping nationwide, this is an adequate number.    Industrial kohsetsushi centers were positioned as  organizations to provide technical support primarily to small-  and medium-sized enterprises in regional areas. When support of  the advance of Japan's industrial modernization is considered  historically, they have played a major role in the introduction  of advanced technology primarily from Europe and the United  States to regional small- and medium-sized enterprises and  support industrial modernization in Japan. The kohsetsushi  center which has developed throughout the country is a uniquely  Japanese institution. In the past they were closely studied by  developing countries, primarily in Asia, but recently, advanced  countries in Europe and the United States have shown a  heightened interest in them. Even the difficult to pronounce  Japanese word ``kohsetsushi,'' which is how they are generally  referred to in Japan, is used unchanged in English; it even  appeared in the campaign promise of President Clinton for a  policy of industrial support. This seems to be the result of the  recent economic development in Japan being viewed with amazement  by other countries and its source being carefully investigated.  When something like this is heard, the view of foreign countries  will truly continue to change.    Recently, the promotion of science and technology in  regional  areas throughout the country has been stressed. Technology in  the prefectures is being advocated and the Government Industrial  Research Institutes are continuing to be transformed into  industrial technology centers in many prefectures. The  kohsetsushi is also in a transition period. To summarize this  trend, it is research directed and research centered. The work  of the kohsetsushi is roughly classified into the three pillars  of research and development, technological leadership, and  requested testing; now, the shift is towards research and  development.    This demonstrates that within the move in Japan towards more  advanced industrial technology, the major switch is from the  technical guidance support of the past by the kohsetsushi  centers to support for research and development; that is, the  objective is to nurture small- and medium-sized enterprises that  have technical development strength. In order to do this,  various reforms such as cultivating human resources that have a  high research potential and improving the research content are  moving forward.    Let me introduce some characteristic cases from Fukuoka  prefecture where I used to work.    (1) Along with converting four research institutes that all  had regional names into research laboratories that carry the  names of technical fields in 1990, a planning and control  department was established to conduct overall planning and  coordination. In addition, an industrial technology center that  integrates the organization was started. As an organization with  a degree of independence and self-reliance from the main office,  the center's head was ranked at the assistant director level in  the administration.    (2) For the past several years, many people have been  retiring so six new people were hired in 1991, and six to seven  new people are being employed each year. On average, the  retirees graduated from technical high schools, while the people  entering were trained at national universities like Kyushu  Technical University, and two have received doctorates. Most of  the applicants are skilled and about half have business  experience. Academic credentials are improving rapidly.    (3) As for the research content, support for the  commercialization of products is hidden in the shadows.  Fundamental and advanced themes related to food allergies,  synthetic bimolecular films, clathrate compounds, and new glass  are becoming prevalent. These themes are being actively pushed  forward by young researchers primarily in regional universities  and national institutes in cooperation with very enthusiastic  small- and medium-sized enterprises.    The shift to research in Fukuoka prefecture is occurring  smoothly overall, but administratively, priority hardware like  buildings and equipment, and software like academic trip  expenses and libraries for the research environment are  remarkably scant. Moreover, a major problem is inexperienced  research management that includes a lack of research leaders in  the labs. Although many problems abound, at least compared to  five years ago, the people and the substance has changed. For  the two years I was there, dynamic changes were realized.    These kinds of changes at the kohsetsushi centers have a  difference in degree but are occurring throughout the country.  The form in 10 years will probably have a completely different  image than it has today. This is one part of the restructuring  throughout Japanese society in the continuing move from a  developing country to an advanced country that leads. We would  like the national institutes in regional areas to look carefully  at the changing kohsetsushi and develop close ties in order to  contribute to the industrial activities of the regions and carry  out creative research exchanges.</p>

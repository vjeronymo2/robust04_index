			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / DTI to ease disclosure rule FUND managers would not be required to disclose stakes below 10 per cent in companies held by clients, under rules proposed by the Department of Trade and Industry. The present ceiling is 3 per cent. The DTI has been under pressure from the Institutional Fund Managers Association, the industry trade association, to ease disclosure requirements that fund managers say are expensive and unnecessary. 'In no way would you say that these stakes are predatory,' said Mr Richard Weir, director general of the IFMA. The DTI first consulted on its draft directive in February 1991 and its proposed rules have been prepared in the light of its consultation and other developments since then. The proposed rules are set out in a paper being circulated within the industry. They will apply to fund managers charged with buying, selling and voting shares held in segregated accounts in the names of individual clients. At present, fund managers whose sole job it is to sell shares on behalf of clients need give notification only of stakes of 15 per cent or more. That ceiling will be lowered to 10 per cent under the proposals. The rules say stakes in companies in pooled funds managed by fund managers need be disclosed only when they reach 10 per cent. While the directive is generally a relaxation of notification rules, they will be tightened in respect of unlisted companies. For the first time, stakes in unlisted companies of 10 per cent or more will have to be disclosed as well. The fund management industry has argued for a relaxation of notification requirements, saying the present rules are cumbersome and expensive to administer. Large fund managers typically need a half-time to a full-time staff person simply to administer notifications at a cost of Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 20,000 a year. IFMA also argues that no European country has a requirement to disclose stakes below 10 per cent and a 1988 directive set 10 per cent as the minimum size of a notifiable position. Nevertheless, in what is likely to be a disappointment to the pension funds industry, the DTI declined to lift the ceiling on notifiable stakes held by pension fund trustees. In its original proposal, the DTI suggested that trustees should be subject to the 10 per cent rule, rather than the current 3 per cent ceiling. In its paper, circulated to the industry, the DTI said it had decided to take no action on trustees' holdings. It cited a wide-ranging go-vernment review of pension law.</p>

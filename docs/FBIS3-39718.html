			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend by ORF </F> correspondent Horst Friedrich Mayer, Conrad Seidl of DER  STANDARD, and Herbert Lackner of PROFIL in Vienna -- live]    [Excerpts] [Mayer] It is Sunday, 11 o'clock. Good  morning from our Press Hour program, Ladies and Gentlemen. Our  guest today is Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend, and he will  be interviewed by my colleagues Conrad Seidl of DER STANDARD and  Herbert Lackner of PROFIL and by me.    Mr. Minister, with just a few hours before the Sarajevo  ultimatum expires, the first question that naturally arises is  what does the situation around Sarajevo -- the situation of the  Western alliance, but also that of the United Nations -- look  like from the Austrian viewpoint?    [Fasslabend] There is no doubt that the NATO ultimatum  addressed to the Bosnian Serbs constitutes some kind of turning  point in the international policy toward Yugoslavia. We can  note today that part of the heavy weapons and guns have been  withdrawn. It is impossible to say right now whether all the  weapons will indeed be withdrawn. In any case, one gets the  impression that the ultimatum is meant seriously. This is also  indicated by the meeting of NATO defense ministers this  afternoon and by the convening of the UN Security Council for  tomorrow.    Things will essentially depend on whether for the first time  the international community's determination will really be  expressed here, which might make the warring parties give in  and, in the long run, could lead to an end to the fighting.    [Mayer] Then we would have a solution for Sarajevo, but not  for the many other Bosnian towns, which will be all the more  embattled in the future. Their names also have been in the  headlines for the past two years. Thus, attention is shifting  to Sarajevo and to the solution there and away from the other  places, where the fighting continues unabated.    [Fasslabend] This is certainly correct and, in my view, this  is particularly important because a large part of the fighting  did not take place in and around Sarajevo, but rather all over  Bosnia. Even now, the main area of fighting is in Bihac in  northwestern Bosnia, and it has certainly been a rather skillful  policy of the Serbs to divert attention by one or another  maneuvers to the capital city and, on the other hand, to conquer  territory in other Bosnian regions, which has led to the fact  that a large part of the goals of this war -- that is, a large  part of the territorial gain, which is to lead to the  establishment of Greater Serbia -- indeed has been achieved.    In my view, it is necessary to make it clear that the basic  principle must hold true -- namely that an aggressor, someone  who is trying to achieve political goals by military means, must  not be successful. I think this is exemplary for Europe's  entire future policy. The point is not just to prevent as much  suffering as possible in Bosnia in the future, but the point  certainly also is that an aggressor must not be politically  successful with military means, because this would have  unpredictable consequences for all of Europe and the entire  world.    This would also have consequences for Austria. As a  neighboring country, we are certainly affected to a certain  extent by this specific security policy and, thus, also by all  other political decisions, such as joining the European Union  [EU].    [Seidl] This conflict, however, also has shown that a small  country -- even if it is diplomatically recognized and if all  people say how terrible all this is -- has had to stand up to an  aggressor for about two years before, it is said: If this and  that does not happen, then perhaps the international community  may intervene militarily. As the Austrian defense minister, one  would have to draw conclusions from that and say: Our country  would also have to wait about two years until someone comes and  helps us. Could Austria stand up to an aggressor for two years?    [Fasslabend] This is certainly a very good question you have  asked. There is no doubt it is one of the essential insights  gained from the Bosnian conflict, the Yugoslav conflict, that  one has to assume that, at least during the initial stage, one  only its own defense capacity, only the security one is willing  to provide for itself.    Of course, this is not the only thing. We can proceed from  the premise that, due to the new situation as well as the  measures we have taken, for the first time in our history, we  can expect to be able to fulfill a large part of our tasks on  our own in the future.    In addition, however, there are no doubt still many fields  in  which it is important that something is done at the  international level. Our joining the European Union will be the  most important step for Austria's security since the conclusion  of the State Treaty in 1955. By far this will be the most  important security policy measure, and one which will have a  decisive influence on Austria's position for coming years and  decades.    [Seidl] Will things then work more quickly? Will we be  helped more quickly if we are ever threatened?    [Fasslabend] One must certainly assume that different  yardsticks are used for an EU member state than for a country  that just stands on its own. Therefore, joining the European  Union, belonging to this community, is certainly of enormous  importance.    However, things go beyond that. EU membership today not only  entails a lower probability of being attacked and a quicker  reaction by other states, but from the outset a reduced  probability of a conflict that might affect our country. This  means that we would have more possibilities to influence the  preventive settlement of crises and conflicts in our  surroundings and we could, thus, certainly make a certain  contribution to the stability of our entire surroundings.  [passage omitted]    [Mayer] What do the analyses and information that you have  obtained tell you about what the Serbian side is expected to do  if a military strike is carried out [after the expiration of the  ultimatum]?    [Fasslabend] One has to distinguish between the military  part and what is going on beyond that.    [Mayer] I mean the entire security sphere.    [Fasslabend] In military terms, the case would be that NATO  forces would be united from various cities in Italy, would be  combined somewhere over the Adriatic Sea, would refuel, and  then, accompanied by an escort, would fly to Sarajevo, establish  an air shield there -- that is, ensure their own safety -- and  then, using exact maps, try to hit the heavy artillery.    [Mayer] Well, what I asked you about are the Serbian  reactions.    [Fasslabend] In this case, one cannot expect any major  military reactions by the Serbs because the weapons they have  there would be relatively insufficient.    On the other hand, there have been threats of reactions  beyond that, and one certainly has to take these threats  seriously. It is certainly not so easy to say what these  threats refer to, but, basically, they probably refer to  terrorist activities.    [Mayer] What kind of precautions are being taken?    [Fasslabend] Basically, Austria is actually not a country  that would be affected directly. Planes are not taking off from  our territory; we are not an aggressor, and we are not a direct  neighboring country. On the other hand, however, in addition to  Italy, we are the nearest Western country and, therefore, one  can certainly not rule out anything. One can only prepare very  consistently for this situation and for all potential incidents  by watching all events with utmost attention and by taking  appropriate measures, which has been done.    [Mayer] Even though no planes are taking off from Austria,  our territory is regularly and often flown over by planes that  are preparing for this military operation. Obviously, there are  quite a few flights that we always permit.    [Fasslabend] This is correct, but this has been the case for  many years. This means there is no special situation now as a  result of the UN decision. We constantly have supply flights  for the UN troops in Yugoslavia cross Austrian territory and  also trains running through Austria. However, this is also  partly in the Serbs' interest. Therefore, I would not say this  is being used as a reason to act against us.    [Lackner] I know this is a sensitive issue, but I would like  to come back to colleague Mayer's penultimate question: Do your  intelligence services have any information about potential  terrorist activities in Austria? After all, Austria has been  very exposed in political terms in the Bosnian issue.    [Fasslabend] As I said before, since we are not a  neighboring country and have not carried out any aggressive acts  and are not involved now, we can assume the center of such  potential activities would not move toward Austria. Instead,  one has to assume the Serbian side would probably try to bring  about a turnabout in public opinion in those countries that have  soldiers stationed in Serbia, in Yugoslavia -- that is, to make  them stop their activities. This means one has to assume such  activities would primarily be directed against countries that  have sent troops.    Second, one would have to think that activities might also  go  beyond these countries.    [Lackner] yesterday Russian President Yeltsin warned against  bombing and said this might have terrible consequences. Do you  believe a new East-West conflict might develop in Bosnia?    [Fasslabend] I do not believe a new East-West conflict might  develop along the lines of the old one because the conditions  have changed completely.    [Lackner] Perhaps along the lines of the very old one.    [Fasslabend] However, what one has to see without any doubt  is that the longer this war lasts, the more different the  positions of the big powers become, which, sooner or later,  might lead to discrepancies between individual states and, in  the end, to the shattering of the cohesion, which means an  enormous opportunity for Europe and which was very much in  evidence two or three years ago and is still possible -- just  think of the fact that the Russians are in the NATO Cooperation  Council and participate in the deliberations there. The same  goes for the Ukrainians, the Poles, the Czechs, and the  Hungarians. This is doubtlessly something that must be included  in one's calculations in this connection.    Therefore, I think the quicker this problem is solved, the  quicker the international community comes to an agreement, the  smaller the possibility will be that Europe might be in  disagreement again. After all, one has to see one thing -- if  military aggression were to be successful in Yugoslavia, if this  becomes a political method, one can almost make bets on when the  next military aggressor will turn up.    At the same time, this also leads to a loss of the Islamic  world's trust in the Western community of states because they  get the feeling that the West's determination is not so great if  a conflict does not involve oil fields but only people who  belong to a non-European religion. I think this would be very,  very dangerous.    After the end of the East-West conflict and after the  collapse of the Eastern system of power, we have had a unique  opportunity for the first time all over the world, namely that  all states orient themselves toward the Western values, toward  democracy, human rights, the relevance of international law. It  would be fatal if this opportunity were missed, if one were to  get the feeling that these are only instruments to implement the  Western policy of power and are not really values actually  enforced by the people and the democracies in the West if they  need to be protected.    [Mayer] Why is the security aspect, which we have  discussed and which is really important for Austria, hidden with  embarrassment in the government's arguments for EU membership or  is pushed into the background? The Austrians' need for security  does exist -- we know that and it has been confirmed by the  polls. Would it not be possible to get broader agreement to the  European Union by pointing to this important aspect?    [Fasslabend] I do not know whether one could achieve a  broader agreement with that argument, but I think the time has  come to tell the people in Austria how important EU membership  would be for the country's security. I can only repeat what I  said a few minutes ago: For Austria's security, our joining the  Europan Union is the most important step since the conclusion of  the State Treaty. This is the basis. We can assume membership  would not only entail a far higher degree of military stability,  would not only ensure Austria's safety and freedom, but also  would ensure lastingly all our opportunities and our ability to  develop. Just as the State Treaty constituted the basis for the  entire state for almost four decades, the EU treaty today is  probably the basis for the next three or four decades -- in  security policy and also for the economy and for overall  politics.    [Seidl] This also has a reverse side -- i.e., solidarity is  not just a one-sided issue but means that we, too, have to show  solidarity with others; we have to give up what we have  understood so far to be neutrality, find a new understanding of  neutrality, or give up neutrality completely. We must also  expect that we will be called upon to show solidarity -- for  instance, one sees tensions are rising between Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] and Greece -- that we  will be called upon to stand up for Greece's security interests  with Austrian soldiers, or what Greece considers to be its  security interests.    [Fasslabend] Basically, the position of neutrality certainly  changed fundamentally after the end of the Cold War. It was a  product of the Cold War -- as it is put so aptly -- and,  therefore, it lost its function when the Cold War ended. Still,  we need not throw it overboard. Austria will enter the European  Union as a neutral country, if the people so wish. The  precondition for that is a referendum.    As soon as we are in the European Union and when future  solidarity is involved, then one must say the following: The  probability that Austria will have to stand up for others in  some incident is extremely low. The entire area of West Europe  is no longer facing any immediate threat, if one considers the  fact that countries like the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium,  or France do not have any opponent in the neighborhood anymore,  but they are only surrounded by friendly countries. This means  we must ask ourselves whether the other countries would be  willing to stand up for us if a crisis develops in our  neighborhood, because we are the only European country that has  four neighbors from the former Communist sphere and, therefore,  we are affected to a particularly great extent by developments  and potential crises in this area.    In this case, it is certainly good to have friends and to  have the opportunity to go to them as soon as a crisis starts  and draw their attention to it, because we must also be clear  about one thing: One must explain crises and factors of risk to  those who make decisions in West Europe. These crises are  noticed much later from a distance of 1,000 or 2,000 km. We saw  this in Yugoslavia, where Austria was the first country that  constantly pointed to this crisis, where it was certainly a  disadvantage for us that we were not yet in the European  Community. In the future, it will be all the more important to  be in it and to be able to directly present issues that concern  us. [passage omitted]    [Mayer] The government agrees we have to join the European  Union for a number of reasons, also for the security aspect.  However, the government does not say anything about the form in  which we want to participate in such a collective alliance.  Obviously, it does not really agree among itself. For the time  being, citing a number of arguments, we have refused using a  number participate in Partnership for Peace. How does the  defense minister envisage that? A few weeks ago you were at a  NATO conference in Berlin in your official capacity. How do you  envisage that? What would be the ideal form of cooperation for  Austrian national defense?    [Fasslabend] Well, I must make one thing clear: Austria has  not only decided that it wants to participate in the EU, but the  Austrian Government has also made it clear that, as soon as  Austria becomes an EU member, it should also obtain observer  status in the Western European Union [WEU]. From the security  policy point of view, this is certainly a very big and important  step, because in the WEU we will have the opportunity to present  our analyses and ideas from the very start and to participate in  all security policy aspects in Europe. This means that this  step is already planned.    The issue of the Partnership for Peace, which has been  discussed all over Europe in the past weeks, is certainly also  an interesting development, which, however, is primarily aimed  at the East Europeans and the people in East and Central Europe  and not so much at the neutral countries, like Sweden, Finland,  Switzerland, and Austria, even though the latter are not  excluded.    One can already say that we certainly consider Partnership  for Peace to be a very valuable instrument in shaping future  security and peace in Europe, but we naturally see our priority  in joining the European Union and Partnership for Peace is of  secondary importance for us.    What we are going to do -- to say this quite specifically --  is that in those fields where we have already started  cooperation, such as in peacekeeping, disaster relief,  international doctrines, etc., we will engage in large-scale  cooperation.

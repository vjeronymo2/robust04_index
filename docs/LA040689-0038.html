			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> Garrison Keillor will make his first Los Angeles appearance in seven years June  9-10 in the "Third Annual Farewell Performance" of his "A Prairie Home  Companion." The local dates at Universal Amphitheater will cap a 13-city tour  that includes a stop June 6 in San Diego's Symphony Hall. The June 10 show here  will be broadcast live on American Public Radio (locally on KUSC-FM, 91.5).  Keillor, who quit his popular weekly radio variety program two years ago in  favor of a writing career, has continued to spoof his departure from the  airwaves with annual "farewell" programs. Last year, the second annual farewell  show emanated live from Radio City in New York. Keillor says he decided to do  the third annual farewell about a year ago, "a couple of months before the  second annual. I was afraid if I waited for people to beg me to do it, they  might not. It's a good rule in show business not to wait in the wings too long  before you come out to do an encore."ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

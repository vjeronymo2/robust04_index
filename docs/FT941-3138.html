			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cortecs Intl seeking Pounds 15m in flotation Cortecs International, the pharmaceuticals company, is planning to raise about Pounds 15m through a flotation on the London Stock Exchange next month. The company, incorporated in Australia but with research, development, manufacturing and sales in the UK, already has an Australian listing. The shares closed there yesterday at ADollars 1.05, barely changed on the day, representing a market capitalisation of about ADollars 80m (Pounds 39.4m). The shares will be issued at the equivalent of not less than ADollars 1.05, said Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based stockbroker which is handling the flotation. Cortecs has three strands to its business. research into drug delivery systems, such as capsules for swallowing. manufacture and marketing of medications. In one of its businesses, these two activities are combined: it imports the arthritis drug Diclomax into the UK in bulk and puts it into capsules. developing diagnostic equipment. Henry Cooke Lumsden said it hoped to issue a pathfinder prospectus at the end of next week and complete a placing by mid-April. The health of such companies is partially measured by their cash balances and rate at which they consume capital. The company's 1993 report and accounts shows cash of ADollars 998,000, compared with Dollars A6.54m a year earlier.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Allia: "Tyhpoid Epidemic in Annaba"] </F>   [Text] Annaba -- Alarmed by rumors of a typhoid epidemic,  students at the 2,000-bed university housing complex in Sidi  Amar (Annaba) are raising their voices and demanding strong  public health measures to stop spread of the disease.    Health officials in the wilaya of Annaba admit there was an  outbreak of typhoid but say major problems were avoided.  According to Mr. Messikh, a public health official, the first  typhoid case was reported to the health service on 13 February.  Other cases followed in the second half of the same month,  bringing the number of patients under observation to 38. After  analysis, it was determined that eight people have been stricken  with the malady, including two cases that required surgical  intervention. The six others were treated on an out-patient  basis.    According to the Health Department, the epidemic was caused  by a "cross-connection" (contamination of a potable water  conduit with waste water) at the university housing complex.  Investigation by a team of specialists disclosed the fact,  unbeknownst to local water authority officials, that a  state-owned road repair enterprise had failed to protect the  potable water conduit. Holes had been hastily plugged with  packed earth, creating pools of stagnant waste water. What is so  bizarre about these revelations is that only the water supply to  the university housing complex was contaminated, while external  branch conduits have remained untainted.    At all events, according to Dr. Boumaiza, the situation is  far from alarming. All appropriate steps have been taken to deal  with the situation. With the ORSEC [Emergency Preparedness Plan]  plan going into effect early this week, reinforcements arrived  to beef up the medical corps detachment assigned to the Sidi  Amar COSU [University Student Council]. Eleven health teams are  conducting numerous typhoid awareness meetings for the students.    A round-the-clock investigative unit was dispatched to Sidi  Amar, along with three laboratories for bacteriological testing,  in hopes of totally eradicating the epidemic. A dramatic  response, but one that will fail unless paired with draconian  public hygiene measures. Responsibility for such measures  belongs to COSU officials, Dr. Messikh concluded.    The DSPS [public health office] of Annaba wilaya notes that  several other wilayas are also affected by the typhoid epidemic.  The number of people infected is not alarming but is worth  reporting to the general public:     -  Skikda: 11 cases    -  Khenchela: one case    -  Biskra: one case    -  Oum  El-Bouaghi: one case    -  Mila: one case    -  Tebessa: two cases    -  Jijel:  two cases    -  Batna: one case    -  Constantine: one case.</p>

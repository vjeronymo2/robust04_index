			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- Kim Tok, director of the  Agency for National Security Planning (NSP), said Friday the  biggest problem facing the country is the possibility that North  Korea may misjudge the situation and provoke an emergency.    Kim told NSP officials at a ceremony commemorating the 33rd  anniversary of the agency's founding that North Korea's nuclear  development program poses a serious problem, asking the  officials to prepare for the possibility of an emergency  situation.    He emphasized specialization, efficiency,  internationalization and science as the NSP's four operating  principles and called on the officials to help establish the  agency as an "intelligence organization of the people."    The intelligence body was inaugurated on June 10, 1961, as  the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) and changed its  name to the Agency for National Security Planning (NSP) on Jan.  1, 1981.</p>

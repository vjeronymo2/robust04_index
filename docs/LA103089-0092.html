			<p><P> October 30, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ON THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> FENNIS DEMBO CUT BY PISTONS  </P> <P> Fennis Dembo, who watched mainly from the bench as Detroit won its first NBA  championship, has been cut by the Pistons.  </P> <P> The 6-foot-6 Dembo, who played guard and small forward, was released late  Saturday after Detroit failed to negotiate a trade for the second-year player.  Dembo's release left Detroit with 14 players on its roster, with two final cuts  expected by midweek, Coach Chuck Daly said.  </P> <P> Dembo was Detroit's first pick and 30th overall in the 1988 NBA draft after  finishing his college career as Wyoming's leading scorer and rebounder. He had  a total 36 points and 23 rebounds in his rookie season with Detroit, playing  just 74 minutes in 31 regular-season games.  </P></p>

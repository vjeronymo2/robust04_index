			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / World Trade News: White House gathers up endorsements for Nafta MOVING with all deliberate speed and flashes of passion and anger, the US House of Representatives yesterday approached its climactic vote on the North American Free Trade Agreement. At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue emotion of a different sort - barely suppressed elation - was evident as the White House totted up the steady stream of new endorsements for Nafta and calculated, though it would not admit it publicly, that it would win. Mr Mickey Kantor, the Trade Representative, was among those convinced that the administration's application of maximum political force was on the edge of producing a great victory for President Bill Clinton. Anything bigger than a margin of one would be 'academic,' said Mr Bill Daley, the White House's Nafta co-ordinator. An evening Associated Press count suggested that the agreement had secured support from 10 more members than the 218 needed for passage, though some may be released from their promises once the magic number had been passed. Significantly, Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, the Democrat from Ohio and a leading Nafta opponent, conceded that she thought President Clinton would carry the day, mostly, she added with scorn, on the back of support from the Republican party. The President went running in a pro-Nafta teeshirt and said 'it's never in the bag until the vote's in.' He had despatched officials by the dozen to Capitol Hill to keep up the pressure, as had the anti-Nafta forces. Mr Ross Perot, the Texas populist, was behaving exactly like the lobbyists he constantly condemns as he toured the halls exhorting members to vote against. In the House itself, the debate was briefly interrupted by anti-Nafta demostrators shouting that Mr Clinton was bribing his way to victory and throwing fake Dollars 50 bills on to the floor. Earlier Mr David Bonior, the Michigan Democrat and chief anti-Nafta strategist, had opened the debate by proclaiming 'its Nafta Claus time at the White House.' 'Its Dollars 50bn in goodies and give-aways,' shouted Mr Gerald Solomon, the New York Republican. Mr Solomon was at his most abrasive, which is saying something. He charged that Nafta established an 'unelected, unaccountable bureacracy' that would undermine the US constitution. But his assault on everything Mexican, especially its '64-year-old one party dictatorship' of a government, was too much for the venerable Kika de la Garza, the Democrat from Texas who rules the House agriculture committee. 'I share blood with the Mexican people,' he barked back, 'and I resent the xenophobia I've been hearing on this floor.' Reaching back into the last century, he turned on Mr Solomon and others who had spoken in the same vein. 'They want a Mexican government run by the US, but let me remind you, we tried that and it didn't work.' Perhaps unconsciously, George Miller, the California Democrat, evoked memories of Harold MacMillan's words condemning the Thatcher government's attitudes to the British miners 'who had helped defeat the Nazis.' The American worker, Mr Miller declared, 'had helped win the cold War and now are not even being given an afterthought.'</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Bundaberg Sugar attacks value of Tate &amp; Lyle bid DIRECTORS OF Bundaberg Sugar, Australia's third largest raw sugar producer, claimed yesterday that Tate &amp; Lyle's hostile takeover bid was pitched at least 44 Australian cents a share too low. In the defence document, they said Bundaberg's shares had been valued by Macquarie Bank at between ADollars 4.54 and ADollars 5.16, valuing the company at between ADollars 354m (Pounds 165m) and ADollars 402m. Tate's offer - recently-increased from ADollars 3.70 to ADollars 4.10 per share - values Bundaberg at ADollars 321m. Macquarie said it was inappropriate to value a commodity stock like Bundaberg on the basis of a weak point in the commodity price cycle, and claimed Tate had undervalued the strategic advantage it would gain from Bundaberg's milling and refining capacity. The bank's report concluded that the implied value beingoffered for Bundaberg's core milling and refining businesses was less than the prices paid in comparable international acquisitions in the sweeteners industry,and in Australian agricultural and food industry takeovers. In particular, Macquarie said the offer was not in line with prices paid by CSR, the Australian sugar and building materials group, for Pioneer Sugar in 1987, and by Tate &amp;Lyle for Redpath and Amstar in the US. Mr Roy Diecke, Bundaberg chairman, said shareholders should reject Tate's offer because it undervalued the company and was an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of the weakness of the world sugar market. He said Tate had not given shareholders 'the whole story' in its offer document, and claimed Tate had quoted sugar prices selectively to play down Bundaberg's performance over the last decade. 'The profitability of the company will follow the sugar price cycle, but the company has progressed through difficult times in the past,' Mr Diecke said. Mr Geoff Mitchell, managing director, said Bundaberg had outperformed the Consumer Prices Index and the index of Australia's 50 most traded shares since its formation in 1972. Mr Paul Keating, the federal treasurer (finance minister) signed an order yesterday giving the Foreign Investment Review Board another 90 days to decide whether to approve Tate's bid if it is accepted by shareholders. The bid hasprompted strong local opposition in Queensland, where Bundaberg is based, but neither the federal government nor the board have given any indication of their likely response. Bundaberg's shares closed at ADollars 3.85 on the Australian Stock Exchange yesterday. The shares were ADollars 3.52 immediately before Tate launched its bid.</p>

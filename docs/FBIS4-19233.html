			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The Hamburg customs authority  has confirmed the planned shipment of 212 Stinger missiles to  Turkey via Hamburg. All the necessary documents are on hand,  thus there are no further obstacles to the shipment, a customs  spokesman said this afternoon. The containers of missiles are  due to arrive in Hamburg by rail on the morning of 16 April.    The Hamburg Green-Alternative List (GAL) were the first to  become aware of the missile export, which involves missiles  manufactured by the firm of Dornier in Friedrichshafen, the GAL  said. They are to be shipped directly to Turkey on a Turkish  ship. The GAL called upon the German Government and the Hamburg  City Council to prevent the shipment. A council spokesman said  that, as far as this issue is concerned, "They would not get  involved in federal matters."</p>

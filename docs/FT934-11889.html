			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / US growth of 2.8% pushes Dow to high THE US economy expanded at a real annual rate of 2.8 per cent in the third quarter, the best performance this year, thanks to steady growth in consumer spending and industrial production, the Commerce Department said yesterday. Inflation fell to its lowest level in seven years. Evidence of a non-inflationary and stronger recovery, together with some better than expected corporate profits, pushed the Dow Jones industrial average up 23.20 points to close at a new high of 3,687.86, beating Monday's record of 3,673.61. The index traded briefly above 3,700 before investors stepped in to take profits. The gross domestic product improvement would have been even better but for the impact of this summer's Midwest flooding, which cut 0.6 per cent off the quarterly return. In the first two quarters, GDP rose by 0.8 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively. Growth was widespread across the economy, according to the department's initial estimates for the quarter, apart from the farm and defence sectors. Consumer spending rose by 4.2 per cent in the quarter, up from 3.4 per cent in the previous three months, a clear response to continued low interest rates. This was also reflected in a lower personal savings rate, down to 3.7 per cent from 4.4 per cent. Mr Ron Brown, the commerce secretary, noted that interest-sensitive sectors appeared to be leading the recovery. He pointed to the expansion of consumer durable equipment (up 9 per cent), residential construction (up 10.1 per cent) and durable goods (up 7.5 per cent). Inflation pressures also abated in the third quarter, down to an annual rate of 1.8 per cent from the 2.9 per cent of the previous three months, according to the Commerce Department's fixed-weight price index for gross domestic purchases. This is the lowest quarterly increase in the index since 1986. President Bill Clinton, pre-empting a report due out later in the day, also announced that the budget deficit in the fiscal year ending last month had fallen to Dollars 255bn (Pounds 169bn), 12 per cent lower than the Dollars 290.2bn of fiscal 1992. He claimed this was evidence his economic policies were working. A fistful of private economic forecasts foresaw even higher growth in GDP in the final three months. The Conference Board predicted a real 3.4 per cent, while Merrill Lynch was more bullish with its 4-5 per cent estimate. There remains some concern that the current growth cycle may resemble that of last year, when an anaemic first half was transformed into a 5.7 per cent expansion in the final quarter. This came too late to help President George Bush's re-election campaign and was succeeded by minimal growth in the first half of this year. The main negative non-farm elements in the third quarter were found in a widening trade deficit, with exports down 1.1 per cent and imports up 1.9 per cent, although this was a more modest increase than previously, and in reduced government purchases, down 6.1 per cent on lower defence orders.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gleb Cherkasov under the "Intentions" rubric: </F> "Three Parties Want To Reunite CIS Slavic Republics. Ivan  Rybkin May Receive Their Leaders"]    [Text] Aleksandr Tikhonov, chairman of the "Consolidation"  party; Igor Karpenko, leader of the "Slavic Unity of Ukraine";  and Nikolay Sergeyev, chairman of the "`Belaya Rus' Slavic  Assembly" party, yesterday circulated an "Appeal to the Heads of  State and Parliaments of the Republic of Belarus, the Russian  Federation, and the Republic of Ukraine." The appeal contains a  call to pass "legislative acts on the unification of the  sovereign states to form a confederation or some other mutually  acceptable state entity." In the opinion of its authors, "the  creation of a confederation will make it possible to prevent  disintegration of the unified community and to solve political,  economic, and defense tasks."    Speaking at a press conference devoted to the promulgation  of  the appeal, the leaders of the parties stated that the  pro-integration feeling prevalent among the peoples of the three  countries does not always meet with adequate understanding among  members of the political elites of Russia, Ukraine, and  Belorussia [Belarus]. At the same time, according to the  assurances of the "Consolidation" chairman and State Duma deputy  Aleksandr Tikhonov, Speaker Ivan Rybkin intends to meet with the  authors of the appeal as early as 21 June. Mr. Tikhonov thinks  the speaker's stance is drawing closer to proposals expounded in  the appeal.    As for practical steps to create a unified state entity, it  is suggested that referendums be held in all the three republics  following which the supreme organs of representative power could  take specific actions to carry into effect the peoples' will.  In the view of the authors of the appeal, the new Slavic  statehood ought to have unified armed forces, a unified "ruble"  system, and equality of state languages.    It is worth pointing out that the very fact of signing such  an appeal is, to a certain extent, a new method in the political  struggle both in Russia and in the Ukraine, as well as in  Belarus. Until recently pro-integration and unification  sentiments were mainly exploited by radical-communist and  national-patriotic organizations, so the same sentiments  expressed by "centrist" associations may have greater  repercussions.</p>

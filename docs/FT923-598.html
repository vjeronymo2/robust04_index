			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Tepnel for USM with Pounds 28m tag TEPNEL Diagnostics will join the USM on Wednesday through a placing of 4.58m ordinary shares at 120p to raise a net Pounds 5.16m. At that price Tepnel is valued at Pounds 27.5m. A biotechnology company based at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Tepnel has developed diagnostic testing systems there which are designed to 'meet growing consumer and legislative demands' for detecting the presence of residual antibiotic or other contamination in foods and of viral and bacterial conditions in blood. Mr Harold Morley, chairman and chief executive, said the risk period was over and Tepnel's products were now at the point of commercial exploitation. The scientific team is led by Dr Stephen Minter. In food diagnostics, the company has developed the FARAS (Food Antibiotic Residue Analysis System) test which requires one test for 16 answers, rather than the current 16. The milk industry will be the first market to be addressed. In medical diagnostics, a series of probes screen the particular DNA patterns of specific diseases. Here the National Blood Transfusion Service, which currently runs tests for HIV I and II, hepatitis B and C and syphilis, is the initial target market. The company said that advantages over the current testing techniques include no false results, test results in 60 minutes and the identification of latent, as well as active, viral diseases. The placing by Allied Provincial Securities, represents 20 per cent of Tepnel's enlarged share capital.</p>

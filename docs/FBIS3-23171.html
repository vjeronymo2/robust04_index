For this reason, 100 APF members have been  detained since last Sunday. It was also noted that 42 rockets,  explosives and an arms cache was discovered during a search of a  building used by APF supporters.    The APF denied claims of a coup. One of the APF leaders,  Nadzhaf Nadzhafov, claimed that the seized arms do not belong to  APF. The police raided the news conference being held by  Nadzhaf Nadzhafov at the APF headquarters in Baku, and sealed  off the building.</p>

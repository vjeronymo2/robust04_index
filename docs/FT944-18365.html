			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Observer: Older men Ructions within the City's Court of Aldermen last week suggest that the principle of Buggins' Turn is starting to go out of fashion as a means of producing Lord Mayors. Not only has alderman Neil Young resigned, but it is understood that two other names will not 'go forward'. Bryan Toye, chairman of Toye &amp; Co, a company making civil and military regalia, seems to want to slide down the list a bit and Tony Bull, a partner in surveyors Walter Bull, who when elected 10 years ago was initially vetoed by his fellow aldermen, has also heard his name will not now go forward. Meanwhile, Old Etonian Young's departure has sparked the re-emergence of a rather unlikely ally in the form of Dennis Delderfield, a liveryman who edits a rag called the City of London &amp; Docklands Times and who used to be on the Court of Common Council until he was declared bankrupt two years ago. He would like aldermen elected every four years  - at present, once elected, they can hang on until they are 70. The Corporation of London knows him only too well. He played a big part in orchestrating the Smithfield meat traders' (largely successful) battle over funding of their market. His grasp of the arcane world of City politics seems to be as keen as his tongue is vicious. Dennis the Menace has found another cause.</p>

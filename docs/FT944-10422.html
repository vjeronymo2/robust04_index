			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: CBoT to assist Poland with new futures exchange The Chicago Board of Trade will today sign an agreement with Polish officials to help establish a new futures exchange in Warsaw. The Chicago exchange has promised to contribute its expertise in market development in return for unspecified fees and 15 per cent ownership of the new exchange. Although US futures exchanges have informally assisted emerging markets for years, this is the first time one has commanded an ownership stake in a new venture. The CBoT's agreement is with a foundation led by the Polish government agency for agricultural markets and Rolimpex, a Polish agri-business concern. Mr Patrick Arbor, the CBoT's chairman, said the agreement was the first of a series of innovative international business arrangements his exchange expects to make. The membership equity gained from the Warsaw exchange 'will provide additional trading opportunities for our members and member firms,' Mr Arbor said. Polish officials see the creation of a commodities exchange as an important step in the transition to a free market economy. They expect wheat to be the first commodity traded there. However, futures trading may be a long way off for the country, which first needs to develop a free primary market for grain, and a legal framework for a futures market. Mr Fred Grede, the CBoT's senior vice-president in charge of operations and planning, acknowledges the difficulties that face the venture. 'One of the key questions is how to create a properly functioning cash market,' he said. He added that his exchange plans to use the expertise of its membership to help develop the underlying systems needed to support futures trading. Goldman Sachs initiated the talks between the CBoT and Poland, and intends to continue to serve as an adviser and consultant on the project.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Management: A change of address on Quality Street - Why Nestle is moving the head offices of some of its businesses Very few multinationals have yet taken the radical step of shifting the global headquarters of one or more of their businesses out of the parent company's home country. The best-known to do so is IBM. Late last month the select band was joined by Nestle. In the wake of its controversial takeover of Perrier, the Swiss food group made the astute move of announcing that the HQ of its mineral water business would be transferred to France. Yet only a few months earlier, Nestle made a quiet shift in precisely the opposite direction with another high-profile business, confectionery. It unwound an international strategy group for confectionery which, as part of its politically- sensitive acquisition of Britain's Rowntree in 1988, it had established with leadership in York, Rowntree's headquarters in northern England. In one sense, the unwinding of the York arrangement was only to be expected: Nestle has a managerially sensible (and politically convenient) habit of allowing its acquisitions a long leash while both sides get to know each other. It tends to integrate them fully into its organisation only after three years or more. Yet cynics might claim that Nestle has broken the promise it gave to the citizens of York, and Rowntree's more chauvinistic shareholders, at the time of the 1988 takeover bid. The reality is both more straightforward and more complicated. It is more straightforward in two senses. First, any feeling of betrayal should be removed by the fact that the confectionery strategy shift, from York to Nestle's headquarters in Vevey on Lake Geneva, was advocated strongly by its English ex-Rowntree management, who found the original arrangement difficult and exhausting to manage. Second, mineral water and confectionery are two very different cases. The former is a much newer and less well-developed business for Nestle than was confectionery, and much more based in one country, with only a handful of export markets. Perrier also dwarfs Nestle's existing businesses in the field, whereas Rowntree merely doubled Nestle's existing chocolate interests. The French HQ could, therefore, prove longer-lasting than was the York-led strategy group. There are also two main reasons why the reality of the York group's unwinding is more complicated than it might seem. First, the confectionery unit's staff were never all based in York, as many outsiders thought. Four-fifths of its 60-plus staff worked in Switzerland under the leadership of the Rowntree boss in York. Second, the unwinding of the confectionery strategy group occurred last autumn not in isolation, but as part of a radical reorganisation of Nestle's corporate HQ. Among other things, this involved the creation of a set of 'strategic business units' (SBUs) in Vevey for each Nestle business. Many of the tasks of the former confectionery strategy group have now been subsumed into an SBU which covers confectionery and ice cream, with a staff of only about 20. York still plays a special role within Nestle, since a much-expanded research and development centre there has retained the lead international responsibility for Nestle's chocolate R&amp;D. The new SBUs are intended to be a head office counterweight to Nestle's independent-minded national operating companies. But why was the strategy group so difficult to run from York in these days of electronic communication and regional jet flights? Two men, above all, can explain the chocolate rethink. The first is 48-year-old Peter Brabeck, an Austrian who recently joined Nestle's group management. He now supervises, among other people, the heads of four SBUs, including the confectionery and ice cream unit (its head is an ex-Rowntree Briton). Having had several years of bitter experience trying to co-ordinate Nestle's Buitoni pasta business in the late 1980s, when it was still being run from its original Italian HQ, Brabeck declares that 'you can't physically devolve yourself from the power circle in Vevey: that's where the shoulder-rubbing has to take place'. This is precisely what the second key player in this drama, Peter Blackburn, found when he ran the confectionery strategy group for two exhausting years. 'Ran' is very much the operative word. Blackburn, a Rowntree man for 20 years, took over chairmanship of the strategy group in May 1989. 'I got increasingly sucked into Vevey because of the need to talk to the various regional managers, and to all the corporate functions and services,' he says. 'I travelled there two or three times a month for between three and four days. It took me seven or eight hours just to do the one-way journey.' On top of that, he had to travel the world. Within a year, he told the Nestle top brass in Vevey that when the time came to hand the strategy job over, 'my successor mustn't be put in York'. That change occurred in 1991 when Blackburn moved to London to become head of Nestle UK (which now includes Rowntree). Even after everyone had got to know each other, 'things wouldn't have improved materially,' says Blackburn. 'I don't believe in electronic communication: face-to-face discussion is vital, especially in a group the size of Nestle'. This principle is very much encouraged within Nestle - even if it creates for some top managers a hectic, Blackburn-style travel schedule. Could a new head of the strategy group not have moved to Vevey, leaving some subordinates in dispersed locations such as York? On the same principle, why not base the heads of the new SBUs at Vevey, but leave some staff in York and elsewhere? Peter Brabeck points out that, if Nestle's new structure is to work smoothly, all SBU staff - not just their heads - need to have close contact with staff in the various regional units based in Vevey. There is also a strong internal logic, within each SBU, for everyone being co-located: the need to turn previously separate functional specialists from marketing, production and so on into a really integrated team. Even as things stand, Brabeck says the SBU heads and the managers immediately beneath them will have to spend up to half their time travelling away from base.</p>

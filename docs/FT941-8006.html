			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Senior Tory MP criticises MMC A senior Conservative MP has criticised the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in calling for a comprehensive review of UK competition policy, David Owen writes. Mr John Watts, chairman of the Treasury select committee, yesterday used a Westminster meeting to urge a 'thorough investigation into the British process for regulating competition'. 'There was a time when the great and the good could be relied on to interpret the public interest according to a widely held consensus view,' Mr Watts said, arguing that recent MMC reports 'clearly demonstrate that this is not the case today'. 'British industry deserves better of its regulators,' he said. The MP for Slough was supported by Mr Stephen Locke, director of the Consumers' Association policy unit, who said there was 'considerable duplication of activity' by the MMC, the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry. 'Each of these bodies has a learning curve whenever it tackles a new issue and knowledge and expertise does not appear to be shared,' Mr Locke said. 'The new proposal for greater consultation by the DTI might exacerbate the situation.' Mr Locke was particularly critical about the findings of MMC reports into the brewing and perfume industries. He said the inconsistency of such reports was partly due to panellists being part-timers and to 'very unclear' guidelines on what constituted the public interest.' The DTI said yesterday it would examine what Mr Watts had to say before commenting further.</p>

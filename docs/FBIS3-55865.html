Fierce fighting is under way, the sides are  suffering major losses. [passage omitted]    The real threat of the conflict's internationalization is  another noteworthy aspect. It is, alas, an open secret that  envoys from Azerbaijan and the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]  are spending big money to hire "soldiers of fortune" in Russia,  in Ukraine, in Belarus, in the Baltic countries....  "International aid" to the warring sides is already arriving  from beyond the former USSR's borders. Afghan mojahedin are  fighting on Azerbaijan's side. Furthermore, the notorious  Hekmatyar and General Dustum have examined the possibility of  rendering more effective assistance to Baku. Mercenaries from  Lebanon, Syria, and other Near East countries are fighting in  Nagorno-Karabakh's defense detachments. Teheran and Istanbul  are finding it increasingly hard to conceal their annoyance with  the development of events in the NKR. And even though these two  capitals issue assurances of readiness to perform a peacemaking  mission in the region, it is no secret that certain quite  influential forces in both Iran and Turkey are also considering  strongarm options of "international aid."</p>

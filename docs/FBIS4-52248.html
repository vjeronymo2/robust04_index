			<p>BFN     [Text] A clue to resolving the North Korean nuclear issue  is hard to come by because North Korea rejects fuel rods  inspections. It has been learned, however, that China is playing  an active mediating role.    Zhang Tingyan, Chinese ambassador to the ROK, visited Vice  Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong today and reportedly told him  that the Chinese Government is actively engaged in persuading  North Korea and requested that the Governments of the ROK and  the United States deal with the North Korean claims with  flexibility.    Ambassador Zhang Tingyan reportedly said that, according to  what the Chinese Government has found out, North Korea has not  replaced the fuel rods yet and asked that negotiations to  resolve the nuclear issue continue. Ambassador Zhang Tingyan's  visit to the Foreign Ministry was made at the request of the  Chinese side so he would explain the contact between the North  Korean and Chinese Governments.    Because it has been revealed that the Chinese Government is  actively mediating between North Korea, the ROK, and the United  States, negotiations over the nuclear issue, which have run into  difficulties because of the North Korean refusal to replace and  safekeep fuel rods, are likely to reach a compromise without  dashing toward a catastrophe.    Meanwhile, the ROK and the United States are said to be  planning to propose to North Korea that the matter of fuel rods  inspection, which North Korea rejects, be solved at the third  round of U.S.-North Korean talks without making issue of it any  more at the present stage.    It has been reported that the ROK and the United States are  planning to disclose their position to begin additional  inspections and technological inspections on North Korea around  the end of this week and to hold the third round of U.S.-North  Korean talks immediately after that.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Bank backs City panel to clarify legal uncertainties A CITY PANEL to tackle problems in the UK's financial markets caused by grey areas in the law was called for yesterday by the Bank of England's Legal Risk Review Committee. The committee was set up in April in response to widespread concern in the City after the Law Lords ruled that local authorities did not have the capacity to enter into interest rate swap transactions. Another of its recommendations was that the doctrine of ultra vires should be abolished. Under this doctrine, transactions which are outside the vires, or capacity, of one of the parties involved are void. Launching a consultation paper, the committee's chairman, Lord Alexander, who is also chairman of National Westminster Bank, said a range of problems caused by legal uncertainty had been raised with the committee. However, he did not believe this represented an indictment of City practices. The committee was aware that there was no lack of challengers to London's pre-eminence as the financial centre of Europe. But Lord Alexander added: 'We want to avoid drama on the threat to London.' What the proposals were designed to do was consolidate London's advantages, he said. The City's contribution to the UK economy last year was Pounds 4.4bn. The City was also host to around 500 foreign banks and was the largest treasury centre in the European Community. The committee proposes the establishment of two standing bodies - a Financial Law Panel and a Financial Law Liaison Group. The panel, comprising market and legal practitioners, would act as a problem-solving body. In co-operation with existing market bodies, it would warn practitioners of potential problems, set out its views on good market practice and clarify how the law would apply in certain technical areas. It would also act as the focal point for the consideration of the potential impact of EC legislation. Some issues would require more than a City self-help solution, however, and so a second-tier body comprising civil servants and market practitioners would also be set up. The liaison group would discuss problems brought to it by the panel, decide whether government involvement was needed and if so how the necessary changes in the law could be made. The committee proposes that both bodies should be resourced and funded by the City. Lord Alexander made it clear that it was never intended that the Bank's committee should find solutions to all of the problems drawn to its attention. It had only made specific recommendations in relation to ultra vires because the matter had been raised by more than 50 per cent of respondents. The committee hopes to present its final report to the Governor of the Bank of England by the end of June. Swaps team finds no 'timebombs', Page 8</p>

			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Health trusts cautious on deals NEARLY a fifth of National Health Service trusts have introduced some form of local pay for small groups of workers, such as cleaners and healthcare assistants, according to an internal government review recently issued to health authorities. The report is the first by the NHS Management Executive on how the 154 first and second-wave NHS trusts have exercised their new powers over pay and conditions. Trusts have the power to develop local pay and conditions packages for new staff although staff who transferred into trusts are entitled to keep the central arrangements of the Whitley Councils and the pay-review bodies. Trusts have been cautious in moving towards local packages, particularly as many want to do full job evaluations of all their staff first. The report shows a higher than previously assessed number of trusts moving towards local packages. It is likely that the chancellor's demand that total wage bills in the public sector must be frozen next year, and that all pay increases must be funded by productivity gains, will lead to an acceleration of local pay arrangements within trusts. According to the government's Human Resource Survey 18.5 per cent of respondents had introduced some form of local pay, but this was mainly for small or self-contained groups such as cleaners, healthcare assistants and senior managers. A further 33 per cent said they intended to introduce it in some parts of their organisations in one to two years. Ambulance services were the most advanced in moving towards local pay and conditions, accounting for four of the eight trusts which had comprehensive local pay and reward schemes in place. Northumbria Ambulance Service will today be served with a High Court writ by Unison, the public-sector union, challenging alleged increases in hours without extra pay for some ambulance staff.</p>

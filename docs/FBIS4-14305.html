			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal </F> al Sa'ud--read by announcer]    [Text] Saudi Foreign Minister Sa'ud al-Faysal al Sa'ud and  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher held a news  conference at King Khalid international airport prior to Mr.  Christopher's departure from Riyadh last night.    It is a source of our pleasure to host today the meeting  with  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and their excellencies the  foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council states [GCC].    The GCC and the U.S. have a long history of firmly  established relations. The most prominent of its  characteristics is the close cooperation to achieve regional  peace and security in the interest of all states of the region.    During our talks, we reviewed with Christopher our common  positions regarding the threat which Iraq still poses to  regional security. We agreed on a common, firm, and vigilant  stand toward Iraq to ensure the full implementation of UN  sanctions in accordance with the Security Council resolutions,  particularly Resolution 833 on the demarcation of borders  between the state of Kuwait and Iraq. Christopher also  reaffirmed, on behalf of the American President, America's  commitment to defend the Gulf. This commitment is appreciated  by all the GCC states.    The two sides expressed their utmost appreciation for the  efforts made by the United Arab Emirates and which are aimed at  solving the crisis of the three islands, Greater and Lesser Tunb  and Abu Musa, with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The two sides  also asked the Islamic Republic of Iran to enter serious  negotiations with the United Arab Emirates with a view to  reaching a peaceful solution to the issue of the three islands  in accordance with international law and the principle of  peaceful coexistence between states.    Christopher presented the GCC foreign ministers with a  resume  on the progress of the peace process and the objectives of his  visit to the region.    The states of the region reaffirmed their full support of  the  peaceful settlement through negotiations. In this respect the  ministers noted with satisfaction the progress that have taken  place in the Palestinian-Israeli accord, stressing once again  the need for speeding up the implementation of that accord. The  ministers also pledged to continue their tireless efforts to  back up the negotiations and the agreements that are reached at  in the other courses, and their effective participation in the  multilateral talks. One of the multilateral meetings had been  held in the Gulf area and another meeting is on the way to be  held in the area.    The GCC foreign ministers see that all parties have to exert  every possible effort to ensure the progress of the peace  process.    The ministers condemn terrorism anywhere in the world and  stress the need to abandon extremism which threatens the peace  process.    The ministers appreciate the efforts of President Clinton  and  the U.S. Secretary of State aiming at underpinning the  Arab-Israeli peace.    The ministers are looking forward to the day when a new  chapter will be opened in the Middle East and the comprehensive  and just peace be realized to all peoples of the region.    Regarding events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ministers  expressed their sincere appreciation of the firm stance taken by  the U.S. and their wish that this stance would continue until a  peaceful solution is reached.</p>

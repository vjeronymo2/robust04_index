			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the IFP on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 24 April]    [Text] Everyone in S.A. [South Africa] wants peace,  economic recovery, investor confidence, jobs, houses, better  schools and hospitals. We believe that IFP [Inkatha Freedom  Party] policy will produce these in the following way:  <H5>  Peace </H5>   Our policy of federalism would not have any group of people  feeling that they are dominated by any other. Power would be  devolved right down to local government level: we would have  government assistance but not government dictating to the  people. This will allow people to express their cultural  differences: to adopt different policies on such things as  abortion in different provinces according to the principles of  the people in that province. This will remove the resentment  created by dictating to people from above and would already help  towards creating peace.    Economic improvement, to give everyone jobs, better houses,  schools, hospitals, will come about through our economic  policies because we believe in free enterprise. This results in  people having enthusiasm to work because each man reaps the  reward of his own labour. Social programmes are created by the  state; assistance is sought from big business and the wealthier  private sector, but it cannot be forced from them; it is drawn  by incentives.    The IFP has always promoted hard work. We support self  reliance and self improvement, respect for other members of  society and responsibility in exchange for rights.  <H5>  Economic reconstruction and development </H5>   The IFP recognises the need to correct the economic  disparities which are a product of the policies in the past, but  we must do this in a realistic and productive way.    Our policy of federalism would result in competition between  the various provinces to create the most efficient economic  system. We believe that the less the government interferes in  the economy, the better. This does not mean that the government  plays no role. We recommended the establishment of permanent  independent commissions. An independent auditor general, a civil  service commission, the regulatory relief commission, the  economic development commission, the environmental commission  and the consumer affairs commission. Unlike the ANC we would not  allow government to appoint these commissions and then seek  advice from other bodies and implement it according to our grand  design. We would want the commissions to be representative of as  many sectors of the public as possible and let government be  advised by the commissions.  <H5>  Taxes </H5>   Our tax policy would require every province to receive an  entitlement from the central government, i.e. a percentage of  the amount of taxes paid returned to the province to use for the  benefit of the people of the province. Some provinces are poor  and would require more handouts from central government than  others, but the present interim constitution puts the provinces  completely at the mercy of the central government. Therefore an  ANC dominated central government could attempt to deprive  provinces in which the ANC is not in a majority; like the  Western Cape and Natal. This will build resentment, not peace.  The IFP's federal economic policy would allow the principle of  asymmetry and subsidiarity to take place; this means that each  province takes on as much responsibility for health, education,  schools and so on as it can cope with; as the province becomes  stronger and wants to take on more responsibility it is allowed  to do so. We cannot produce a nation of little grey people. We  want a multi coloured South Africa where people can grow as tall  as they are able.  <H5>  Land policy </H5>   We would want to see a strong welfare programme; but more  government money for welfare can only come from a market driven  economy. Only that way will we have the confidence of local and  overseas investors to invest money in our country. To return  land to the people, firstly we would look to the masses of  wasted land belonging to the state; thereafter we would attempt  to expropriate unprofitable land by paying reasonable  compensation for that land.    Our idea of government is that of a caring parent who  assists  the family of 9 children i.e. the provinces, and insists on  basic principles of good living i.e. the 33 principles of the  constitution and basic human rights for all. The ANC sees the  government as a dictating parent who believes that he or she  knows best what is right for everyone. Their's is a communist  style recipe for disaster.    Although we have governed in KwaZulu for 9 years we have not  been accused of corruption as has the NP [National Party],  wealthy businessmen have assured us they will invest in  KwaZulu/Natal if we achieve federalism.    To be a winning nation South Africa must have peace and  economic growth. Our policies will bring these about. We are not  going to deliver dreams in people's laps as the anc promises to  do; we want to build a country in which everyone's dreams become  possible.    To do this for you, you must vote for us.    Chief Buthelezi's final appeal to the country before the  election campaign closes is:    Please South Africans, no more violence. Let us all go  peacefully on Wednesday and Thursday to cast our vote and take  up the struggle inside Parliament.</p>

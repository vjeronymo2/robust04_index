			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Barclays recruits as it cuts jobs Barclays Bank is facing staff shortages in spite of being in the middle of a large-scale redundancy programme, and has been forced to recruit temporary workers. Half of the bank's 20 regions in the UK are recruiting workers on temporary contracts of up to six months. One region is even asking for people who used to work in its branches. The magazine Personnel Management quotes a memo from an area headquarters saying: 'The most likely candidates would preferably have worked for the bank in the recent past (including those who left under the voluntary redundancy programme).' Barclays employs 66,000 people in the UK. Since 1991 it has reduced its workforce by 18,500 and plans to shed a further 3,500 by the end of next year. The bank said the organisation was going through a period of unprecedented change.</p>

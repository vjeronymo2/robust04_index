			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Summary" of interview with Former Deputy Prime Minister </F> Michio Watanabe of the LDP by YOMIURI SHIMBUN on 28 April; place  not given]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you give your comments on  the newly formed cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata?    [Watanabe] I thought the coalition might leave some cabinet  posts open and headhunt senior members of the Liberal Democratic  Party [LDP] and the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] to  fill vacancies in six cabinet posts (which were occupied by the  SDPJ under the Hosokawa administration). So I am glad to see  they filled the cabinet posts at once. I think the cabinet  lineup is satisfactory, considering the people the coalition had  available.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What is your opinion on calls for  dissolution of the lower house or the mass resignation of the  cabinet immediately after enactment of the fiscal 1995 budget?    [Watanabe] At the end of the ongoing session, the Diet will  have to discuss scandals (involving former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa) and other pending issues, and a no-confidence  motion may be brought forward depending on manners (of the Hata  administration). If the SDPJ supports the motion, the Hata  cabinet would have to decide whether to resign en masse or  dissolve the lower house.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] If the Hata cabinet is forced to resign,  do you think it is possible to form a coalition government made  up of the LDP and SDPJ?    [Watanabe] If the two parties form a coalition without a  clear policy accord, the administration will meet the same fate  as the Hosokawa administration. It would be difficult (to form  a full-fledged administration of the two parties). The  resignation of the Hata cabinet is more likely to result in a  realignment of political parties. The SDPJ should take a more  realistic attitude toward security ties with the United States.  With respect to legislation for emergency situations (in  connection with the Korean peninsula), Japan cannot be freed  from logistics support duties. (In the case of an emergency),  the Self-Defense Forces are supposed to supply fuel and  provisions to U.S. vessels in operation.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Some quarters say confusion in political  circles should be cleared up by an immediate general election.  Do you agree?    [Watanabe] I think that is the due process of constitutional  politics. It would not hurt the political reform laws.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Could you describe the LDP's strategy for  winning back ruling power?    [Watanabe] I believe the LDP must try harder to change its  negative image, as its policies are widely supported by the  public. Of course, the LDP's drastic renovation may include a  change of the party's name. The question here is whether or not  we are ready to take action.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] LDP President Yohei Kono is critical of  the political manners of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa. What is your comment on that point?    [Watanabe] So many people think so, and I was surprised when  I noticed how many people dislike him. I did not realize it at  all. They say he is too opinionated and secretive. In fact, the  people are afraid of his dictatorship under the single-seat  constituency system.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] But, Mr. Watanabe, you are still looking  for a policy-oriented merger of conservative parties, are you  not?    [Watanabe] I have been saying it is more natural to join  forces with those who have common goals and methodology. I  wonder why everybody does not do that. Politics must not be run  on grudges. Based on emotions, people are saying they hate the  LDP and some other parties. He (Ozawa) also has some points  which merit blame; he should correct his manners a little. I  think he is a man of deed who has clear ideas.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Can you and President Kono win back the  LDP's ruling position?    [Watanabe] I am not sure about that until I actually face  the situation. At the least, I will try.</p>

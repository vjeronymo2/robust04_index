			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 27, BNS -- The Latvian Saeima  (parliament) ruling coalition partners, Latvia's Way and  Farmers' Union, reached an agreement Friday [27 May] on a common  version of the draft citizenship law.    The draft represents an optimal version, which took into  account both Council of Europe's recommendations and right-wing  opposition's proposals, said Latvia's Way faction Chairman  Andrejs Pantelejevs.    Under the bill, non-citizens are naturalized in accordance  with a complicated system of quotas that grants the citizenship  only to those who have de facto integrated into the Latvian  society.    The bill stipulates preferential naturalization of persons  at  least one parent of whose is ethnic Latvian; persons who legally  came to Latvia and lived there before June 17, 1940; Lithuanian  and Estonian ethnic minorities; spouses of Latvian citizens who  have been married for at least 10 years. All these groups,  however, should know the Latvian language.    The bill introduces one more category of persons for  preferential naturalization -- those who have finished full high  school course in Latvian.    The rest are free to apply for naturalization starting with  Jan. 1, 1996. From those, preference is given to persons who  were born in Latvia.    Starting with year 2000, persons who do not fall into any of  the above mentioned groups will be naturalized in compliance  with naturalization quota 0.1 percent of the body of Latvian  citizens per year.    Pantelejevs prognosticates that the real preferential  naturalization will begin Jan. 1, 1995, because the  naturalization mechanism is not complete yet. During this  stage, 150,000 persons could be granted the Latvian citizenship,  he said.    Latvian citizenship will not be granted to persons who have  been by court recognized as having propagated the ideas of  chauvinism, nationalism and fascism, as well as actively worked  against the Latvian independence.    In addition, citizenship will not be given to former Soviet  military retirees, who have chosen Latvia as permanent residence  country. This restriction, however, does not refer to ethnic  Latvians and spouses of Latvian citizens.    Pantelejevs acknowledged that this version was more radical  than required in CE [Council of Europe] recommendations but he  said it gives citizen candidates a clear view of their future  prospects.    If the citizenship law is adopted in the Saeima spring  session, CE could consider the issue of Latvia's acceptance in  its fall session.    Pantelejevs forecasts that the bill would be considered in  the second reading in the parliament on June 9. Pantelejevs  said he hoped that the opposition would not block the law's  adoption.</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Youth divided on patriotic pride FEWER than one in two young people in western Germany says he or she is proud to be a German. In the former communist east of the country, however, 68 per cent say they are pleased with their national origin, in spite of all the psychological and economic upheaval they are undergoing in the unification process. On the other hand, 66 per cent of young westerners say they have foreign friends. Only 19 per cent do so in the east. On both sides of the national divide, an overwhelming majority rejects violence against foreigners, including asylum seekers: the sort of violence which has seen a spate of arson attacks on the homes of foreigners again in recent weeks is justified by just 4 per cent of western youth, and 6 per cent in the east. Contrasts in the hopes and fears of young Germans in both halves of the country have clearly emerged from the latest thorough survey of attitudes carried out for the federal ministry for youth and women's affairs. Conducted by the IPOS social research institute, the study also reveals big differences in lifestyle on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. Given the current economic recession, and rising unemployment, a surprisingly high number in the 14- to 27-year-old age group say they are satisfied with their lives: 95 per cent in the west, and 83 per cent in the shell-shocked east. The researchers warn that eastern youngsters who have only had the minimum nine years of elementary school education represent a seriously deprived social group. They are far more likely to be unemployed - 35 per cent, against an eastern average of 16 per cent, and a western 3 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "JB Report" column] </F>   [Text] Electoral polls carried out by the Army Intelligence  Center (CIE) and the Navy Intelligence Center (Cenimar) have  both discovered that Lula [Luis Inacio da Silva, Worker's Party  candidate] could win the elections for president in the first  round.    The military analysts concluded that if a second round of  voting were held in the elections, Lula's probable adversary  would be former Governor Orestes Quercia from the PMDB  [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party], and not Fernando Henrique  Cardoso. According to the military analysts, Cardoso has a  chance to win in the first round only in the state of Minas  Gerais, where he has the support of Governor Helio Garcia.    The report was delivered to President Itamar Franco by a  military minister.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Bank support for UK Land rescue BACKED by its secured banking creditors, UK Land plans a reconstruction of capital and the raising of Pounds 256,000 (Dollars 384,000) to meet that expense through a fully underwritten rights offer. This will provide UKL with a 'sound financial base' from which it can develop by maximising the revenues from the Elephant &amp; Castle shopping centre in London, its main asset, and subsequently seeking property acquisitions. The alternatives to the plan are insolvent liquidation, administration or receivership. Every 22 existing ordinary shares will be consolidated into one ordinary of 5p and one deferred of 545p - the latter will later be cancelled. A total of 5m new ordinaries, or 64.44 per cent of the new capital, will be issued to creditors. Lloyds Bank will be issued 2m, a syndicate of banks will get 2.35m in respect of their secured advances, and unsecured creditors under a company voluntary arrangement will be issued 650,000. An open offer of up to 2.56m shares at 10p each (33 per cent of the capital) will be made to shareholders on the basis of 13-for-one. A shareholder with 1,100 existing shares would receive 50 new shares from the consolidation and be able to subscribe for 650. Lloyds Bank will also be allotted Pounds 250,000 worth of 10 per cent convertible secured loan 2003, convertible into 1.84m shares, unless that pushed Lloyds' holding to more than 29.9 per cent of UKL voting capital. Issued capital following the proposals will be 7.76m shares, or 9.6m on a diluted basis. Mr James Grace and Mr Christopher Woodhouse, who are sub-underwriters, will join the board. The existing facility from Bank of Scotland will be converted into a Pounds 9m term loan, repayable 1998-2003, and a Pounds 2.3m overdraft, reducing over the five years to April 1988. The facilities will be secured by a charge over the Elephant &amp; Castle. Lloyds and the syndicate banks may require Lillybrook, the underwriter, to purchase up to 2m shares of their entitlement at 10p each.</p>

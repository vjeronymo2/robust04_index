			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Leonid Vorontsov and Alexey </F> Korinenko]    [Text] Berlin February 8 TASS -- German Chancellor Helmut  Kohl said he firmly believes Russian President Boris Yeltsin is  determined to implement reform in Russia, although not in the  ways suggested by some Harvard professors who created a  theoretical model. Yeltsin proceeds from a specific situation  in Russia. Kohl said this in interview to SAT-1 television  network transmitted on Monday evening. The reforms will  apparently not be so rapid.    Kohl said his conversation with Yeltsin and the Russian  president's supporters make him realise that they represent a  proud nation and proud country with great history and  traditions. Kohl spoke highly of the recent visit to Moscow by  U.S. President Bill Clinton who showed respect for the people of  Russia that remains a great power and also showed the striving  for cooperation and aid. But this aid should not be self-aid,  the German chancellor said.    Regarding the situation in former Yugoslavia, Kohl stated  Germany's position of principle. It refrains from sending  troops into the region. First of all, this is not allowed by  the German Constitution, the chancellor said, pointing to the  need to amend the Constitution. But even if the Constitution  permitted sending troops into former Yugoslavia, Germans, for  historic reasons, would not be suitable partners.    Kohl declared again for a quest of political solution to the  problem and stressed that the forcible change of the existing  frontiers is impermissible.</p>

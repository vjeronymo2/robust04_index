			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not just great - but 'The Master' Sir, Your correspondent Laura Thompson needs to do some serious reading. She says ('Brian Lara - the dream machine', May 30) that Jack Hobbs was 'another great cricketer, but not in the racehorse class' - meaning (apparently) not in the highest class. Hobbs, the first cricketer to be knighted, was certainly the only cricketer to share with Henry James the accolade of 'The Master'. I would submit that he was the greatest batsman, and probably the best cover point, between the age of W G Grace and that of Don Bradman - a very long innings, which took in the profound alteration in the way the game was played after the first world war. Hobbs mastered the mystery of the googly, which I believe Grace considered an 'unfair' delivery. He scored 197 first-class centuries, incredibly hitting 100 of them when more than 40 years of age, which Bradman could not have done. He and Herbert Sutcliffe once batted all day on a sticky Melbourne wicket, a project in which Bradman would not even have been interested. Hobbs was not only the greatest but also the best-loved player of his era. If he did not often amass the very high scores which became more common in the Bradman era, it was at least partly because he tended, soon after getting his 100, to present his wicket to the bowler he had flogged the most (or so I've heard). He was supremely elegant and someone (Cardus? Swanton?) once remarked that he never played an ungrammatical stroke. Incidentally, Brian Lara has not come out of the blue. Everyone in Kingston, Jamaica, was talking about him when the Australians were last there. They were impatient for Greenidge to retire - to which Greenidge replied by hitting 215 or so in the fifth test. J R Pole, 20 Divinity Road, Oxford OX4 1LJ</p>

Meanwhile, a  delegation from Azerbaijan has arrived in that capital. Foreign  Minister Gasan Gasanov and Defense Minister Mamedrafi Mamedov  are among the members of the republic's delegation.    The Azerbaijan Ministry of Foreign Affairs Press Center told  a Baku Radio correspondent that the CIS Council of Foreign  Ministers is expected to deliberate on 11 matters related to the  convention on the rights of national minorities, the agreement  on collective security, territorial integrity of the CIS  countries, mutual relations between the CIS and the CSCE,  consultations among the CIS countries on the realization of the  program for cooperation for peace, and other issues.    The republic's delegation intends to try to have the  proposals Azerbaijan submitted during the CIS heads of state  summit on collective security in Ashgabat on 24 December  included in the agreement on collective security. Azerbaijan is  convinced that the agreement's provisions must not only apply to  foreign aggression against the CIS countries, but they must also  apply to internal attacks.    The delegation plans to submit another document to the CIS  Council of Foreign Ministers for approval by the CIS leaders.  That is a draft declaration of respect for CIS members'  sovereignty and territorial integrity and respect for the  inviolability of their borders. The declaration notes that the  principle of noninterference in each other's internal affairs  must be the essence of friendly relations and cooperation among  the CIS countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 29 KYODO -- Japan's new Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata and some of his key ministers will launch a flurry  of diplomatic activity next week despite his cabinet's lack of a  strong power base.    Hata inaugurated a minority cabinet Thursday -- the first  such cabinet in 39 years -- after three weeks of political  infighting within the ruling coalition.    The resultant withdrawal of the Social Democratic Party [of  Japan -- SDPJ], the largest ally in the coalition, leaves the  governing body as a minority force in both chambers of the Diet.    Despite the bleak outlook for his administration, the prime  minister will visit Europe during the holiday-studded "golden  week" while most Japanese are enjoying several days of leisure,  to make his international debut in Japan's top political post.    Hata, who served as foreign minister and concurrently deputy  prime minister in the cabinet headed by former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa, is expected to leave Monday for a six-day  tour of Italy, France, Germany and the European Union's  headquarters in Brussels.    During the European trip, he aims to start building personal  relationships with European leaders before attending July summit  of leaders from the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial powers  in Naples, Italy, government sources said.    Hata will tell his European counterparts that he will take  over and develop Hosokawa's economic reform policies, they said.    Meanwhile, newly appointed Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa  will visit several Middle East nations between May 2 to 8 to  promote the Middle East peace process, Foreign Ministry  officials said.    The trip will take Kakizawa to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria  and the occupied territories.    He is scheduled to meet Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr  Mahmud  Musa, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, Jordanian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister  'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar', the officials said.    They said the foreign minister may also meet Palestine  Liberation Organization Chairman Yasir 'Arafat during his trip.    For his part, Japan's new Trade Minister Eijiro Hata will  attend an international conference of economic, industry and  trade ministers from western industrial nations and East  European countries to be held May 6-7 in Warsaw.    The conference is expected to take up three major topics --  investment promotion in Eastern Europe, how to smoothly  privatize formerly state-owned enterprises, and East-West trade  promotion, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] said.    The Warsaw gathering will be the third of its kind,  following  one in Munster in 1992 and another in Tokyo last year.    MITI officials said Japan hopes to explore the possibility  of  resuming the stalled "framework" trade talks with the United  States when the minister meets his U.S. counterpart in Warsaw.    A top White House official recently said the U.S. would  welcome the opportunity to resume the talks following the  installation of a new Japanese Government.    Japan hopes to settle its protracted trade dispute with the  U.S. before the G-7 summit in Naples pledging a second package  of market- opening measures in June to reduce its huge trade  surplus with the U.S.    The two countries have been unable to resume the trade talks  that broke down in February over failure to iron out differences  on "objective criteria" for gauging foreign access to Japanese  markets.    Meanwhile, Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii will attend the  annual conference of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) slated for  Tuesday through Thursday in Nice, France.    On the domestic political front, other coalition leaders are  expected to devote themselves to canvassing support for the new  government among reform-oriented legislators of the top  opposition Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic  Party, political analysts said.    At the first news conference after taking office Thursday,  Hata said, "Although my administration will face difficult  times... I will ask the SDP to cooperate with us on whatever  policies they can, such as the legislation of budget bills."    "I will also ask the LDP to cooperate with us, as I believe  the LDP will also be ready to cooperate on agreed-upon  policies," he said. "The LDP was once our colleague with whom we  used to run the government together."    However, both the LDP and the SDP immediately rebuffed his  plea, pointing their fingers at Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party],  an LDP breakaway, in an apparent reference to the dominance of  Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa in the policy-making  process.    Despite the bleak political scene, a record 455,000 people  are expected to leave for trips abroad during the golden week,  representing a 20.5 percent rise over the same period of 1993,  the Japan Travel Bureau Inc. (JTB) predicted.    Hawaii tops the list of destinations, followed by Hong Kong  and tourist spots in South Korea.</p>

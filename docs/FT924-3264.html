			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Pretoria cancels talks with PAC after murders THE SOUTH African government said yesterday it was cancelling planned talks with the ultra-radical Pan Africanist Congress and would hold no further negotiations with the group until it distanced itself from attacks carried out by its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army (Apla). Yesterday the PAC further enraged the government, which is under pressure from its white supporters to take a tough line on racial violence, by defending Apla, which has claimed two attacks on white civilians over the past 10 days. Five people have died. Orde Boerevolk (Order of the Afrikaans People), a white splinter group, said it would bomb black taxi ranks in retaliation. Other white right-wing groups, most small but with former and serving security force officers among their members, also threatened vengeance. The Conservative party, the largest white opposition group, asked its supporters to report to their nearest CP office to help counter the Apla threat. Tour operators said publicity over the attacks, notably in the UK, had prompted some to cancel Christmas holidays. White South Africans have been shocked by Apla statements declaring war on whites - despite the fact that, in a country with one of the highest murder rates in the world, the risk of falling victim to racist terrorism is small. In the past, political commentators have tended to dismiss the PAC, which waged a guerrilla war from exile for more than 30 years until it was unbanned in 1990, but can claim few previous attacks on military or civilian targets. But they point out that the African National Congress's decision to enter negotiations with the government has alienated some radical black youths, and has probably boosted PAC membership. Although a recent opinion poll put this at only 3 per cent nationwide, the organisation has recently struck a chord with radical township youths by condemning the white reaction to Apla's attacks: the PAC argues, not without foundation, that whites ignore thousands of black deaths and react only when whites also die. The PAC army has established bases in the Transkei black 'homeland', where three out of five members of the ruling Military Council are understood to be PAC sympathisers. Ironically, one effect has been to cement the improving relationship between the ANC and the government, which are negotiating to rule South Africa by coalition in the transition to full democracy. In the face of PAC leaders defending their slogan 'one settler one bullet', the ANC, which has condemned the attacks, appears more moderate. The Apla campaign - even if it claims no further victims - is likely to undermine progress in constitutional negotiations. The government had succeeded in recent months in persuading the PAC to join talks on a new constitution, but PAC officials have now said they will no longer participate in talks, or in an interim government.</p>

[passage omitted]  <H3>  III. Reasons for the Change in Perception of Childbearing  Among People in Poverty Regions </H3>   At the hand of a large array of examples, the participants  showed that although economic development was the ultimate cause  that led to the change in the people's perception of  childbearing, there was not at all a simple linear relation  between economic growth and the change in the people's  perception of childbearing. Under certain circumstances,  economic growth would even stimulate the desire to have more  children. As things are today, the limited economic growth in  poverty regions is not sufficient to induce changes in the  people's perception of childbearing. People in some poverty  counties have been comparatively quick to change their  perception of childbearing, mainly because of ideological  education and the guidance of government policy. For instance,  in the Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County of Guangxi  Province and in Panan County of Zhejiang Province, the leading  cadres at all levels had paid most serious attention to  population control affairs and had devoted considerable manpower  and material resources to propagandistic education. In the  Longsheng Multinational Autonomous County, per capita investment  in family planning is in excess of seven yuan. Moreover, the  change in perception of childbearing among the people of poverty  counties is also due to such factors as the development of  educational and public health affairs, a relative opening up of  society, and the spreading influence of the large and  medium-sized cities.  <H3>  IV. Factors Restraining the Change of Perception of  Childbearing Among People in Poverty Regions </H3>   In the opinion of the participants, there are in the poverty  regions more than in ordinary regions factors extant that  restrain a change from the traditional perception of  childbearing to its modern perception. The following are some of  such restraining factors:    1. Poor natural conditions, backward productive forces.  Production methods and tools are rather primitive in poverty  regions, mechanization is at a low level, production relies  mainly on human labor, and there is, therefore, indeed,  objectively a need for many childbirths.    2. The educational level of the population is very low. For  instance, in Luchun County of Yunnan Province, over 70 percent  of the population are illiterate or semi-illiterate. Add to this  the fact that as a society they are also isolated, a fact which  seriously impairs their ability to accept new knowledge and new  concepts.    3. The unitary system of the production structure has a  detrimental effect on the employment of women. Women are  occupying a very low economic and social position.    4. The weak social security system and the traditional ways  of family-oriented care for the elderly has people believe in  the need to "raise sons to provide for old age."    5. The very deep-rooted influence of traditional culture and  customs. For instance, the people of Hani nationality in Luchun  County of Yunnan Province have the customs of early marriages,  of free premarital sex, the system of inheritance by the  youngest son, the belief in the transmigration of the soul, and  in the theory of the life-shortening effect of childbirths. All  this makes people desirous of early births and many childbirths.  The main group of Uygurs living in Shufu County of Xinjiang  Province are mostly following the rules of the Islamic religion  in matters of marriage and childbirths.    6. Some poverty regions have been receiving state relief for  a long period of time, and this has some people develop a  dependent mentality, which to some degree is hindering a change  in their perception of childbearing.

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Searing pain About the best that can be said of House of Fraser's investment in Sears is that the stake was not sold when the shares slumped to 63p. Still, a capital loss of over Pounds 60m and a similarly painful cost of carrying the shares leave plenty of room for reflection by all concerned. At present one can only wonder why House of Fraser has sat with the holding for over five years only to sell on the eve of a rebound in the economy. Admittedly, Sears is not the most convincing of the retailing recovery stories. Yet after enduring the horror of the past few years this hardly seems the moment to bale out. Perhaps the answer lies with House of Fraser's very substantial borrowings, some of which are due for repayment shortly. If the company needs to raise cash its options are limited. Department stores are not the most saleable of retailing assets, and the company would struggle to find buyers at anything like book value. Even putting Harrods on the block might not attract the kind of clientele which was interested a few years ago. The company is not alone in its philosophical reflections. Bankers feeling uncomfortable might also consider that their lending to House of Fraser looked aggressive even by the standards of the mid-1980s. For Sears the sale has fewer implications. Sears has to manage the rather different problem of earning a decent return from its sprawling asset base. It appears that the new chief executive, Mr Liam Strong, is having some success with the British Shoe Corporation. Whether he can keep all of the company's other plates spinning at the same time remains to be proved.</p>

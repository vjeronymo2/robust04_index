There was one celebrated occasion at the start of 1972 when the great editor led his newspaper with a banner headline declaring that 'The Times is a European newspaper' - rather than filling the front page with the usual diet of mere news. This odd decision prompted Owen Hickey, then the paper's chief leader-writer, to proclaim that he had always been brought up to believe The Times was a world newspaper. Perhaps Rees-Mogg, now back with The Times as a humble columnist, has belatedly come round to that view.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chang Hong: "Draft Law To Bolster Lead Bank's Policy </F> Role"]    [Text] The National People's Congress (NPC) Standing  Committee, the country's top legislature, will review three new  draft laws, including one which clarifies the role of the  central bank, next Tuesday in Beijing.    NPC Standing Committee spokesman Zhou Chengkui yesterday  made  public the draft Law on the People's Bank of China (PBC), which  took 15 years to put together.    Its principal goals are to legalize the bank's  responsibilities, intensify its supervision and management over  the financial industry, and ensure sound monetary policies.    Two other draft laws to be considered by the NPC cover  arbitration and auditing.    The PBC said that major international financial institutions  like the International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank and  World Bank had been consulted about the bank law.    "The law will specify the role of the central bank in the  country's financial affairs and benefit China's overall  financial reform," Zhou said.    China will have a banking system administered by the PBC,  with State commercial banks forming the backbone and other  financial institutions playing a part.    The draft central bank law contains 46 articles in eight  chapters.    It spells out the organizational setup of the central bank,  its business scope, relations with other departments and its  supervision over financial bodies.    One chapter covers issuing, circulating and protecting  renminbi.    A PBC official said that other financial laws, including a  commercial bank law and an invoice law, are in the draft stage.  <H5>  Legal Moves </H5>   Meanwhile, Zhou Chengkui said that the Standing Committee  would continue to deliberate over a Labour Law, an Urban Real  Estate Management Law and measures to introduce tough penalties  against copyright violations.    The arbitration law aims at improving the system for solving  economic disputes and maintaining social economic order, he said.    During its eight-day session, the legislature will for the  third time review a draft securities law.    Zhou said that major changes were made to the first version  of the draft law, which now contains more than 200 articles.    Also on the agenda are the examination of the final report  on  1993 State finance, a review of the State Council reports on  China's forestry industry and NPC special committee reports on  the implementation of a Statistics Law and a Teachers Law,  according to Zhou.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A blunder on a corporate scale - Hoover has joined the infamous group of companies which have made large public relations errors It looks as though Hoover's free flights offer will join that select, but infamous list of blunders which brought leading brand names low. Firestone Tire and Rubber, AH Robins (maker of the Dalkon Shield contraceptive) and Perrier are among companies which suffered similar blows. But judging by its performance so far, Hoover appears to have learnt little from other companies on how to mend its reputation. In the memorable words of Leonard Hadley, chairman of Maytag (Hoover's US parent), the UK company's 'free flights' promotion was like a 'bad accident and you can't determine what was in the driver's mind'. In 1992 Hoover offered any UK customer who spent a minimum of Pounds 100 on its products, the chance of two free flights to either Europe or the US. The response was like a tidal wave. The media have since been full of stories of irate customers who paid their money, filled in the application form and have still heard nothing from Hoover or its contracted travel agencies, in many cases months after making their initial purchase. At the end of April Maytag announced a net loss of Dollars 10.5m (Pounds 7m) in the first quarter of 1993, after taking a Dollars 30m special charge to cover the unexpected cost of the promotion. Hoover's European president and two senior executives were also dismissed over the controversial offer. The saga, which still has some way to run since those hoping to fly to the US will be able to take up their flights until April next year, is reminiscent of other damage limitation exercises. Take Firestone's decision to recall 10m of its 500 series radial tyres in October 1978. This came after pressure from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which acted only after receiving 14,000 consumer complaints, including at least 29 fatal traffic accidents and hundreds of property damage accidents involving cars using the Firestone 500. Throughout the messy episode the company continued to deny, against public anxiety, that there was anything wrong with the product. The US government did not order the recall, but Firestone was perceived to drag its feet. Analysts estimated then that bad publicity cost Firestone 3 per cent of its 25 per cent share of the multi-billion US tyre market. AH Robins also made mistakes. By 1973 independent researchers were linking its Dalkon Shield with a variety of medical problems, including fatalities. Consumer complaints were gathering force, but Robins criticised complainants rather than asking itself if the product was at fault. The US Food and Drug Administration asked Robins to stop marketing it until tests were completed. By the time it was cleared in December 1974 Robins was facing a welter of individual legal actions. By September 1980 the company sent a letter to 200,000 doctors saying the IUD should be removed. By then, the damage to the company's image was irreparable. On February 29 1984 three top executives from Robins were rebuked by a federal judge in Minneapolis. Instead of accepting the judge's remarks, the Robins executives took legal action against the judge; and lost. That same year Robins took an extraordinary charge of Dollars 615m against outstanding claims and later filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Eventually the company was bought by American Home Products in 1988. In his book Marketing Mistakes, Robert Hartley pinpoints one of Robins' basic problems. 'It was entering a market in which it had no previous experience whatsoever. . . (it) had not a single obstetrician or gynaecologist on its staff. . .it rushed the product to market.' Colin Gilligan, professor of marketing at Sheffield business school, is just one critic of Hoover's recent reaction to crisis. 'One gets the impression in the Hoover example that it has gone for immediate damage limitation rather than taking a more strategic approach to it,' he says. 'When Perrier recognised it faced a significant problem (traces of benzene found in its bottled water in February 1990, resulting in a worldwide product recall) it understood that you can't try to hide things from the public or the media, because the key issues are going to emerge sooner or later. 'Hoover has not looked at the broader picture but has responded in almost knee-jerk fashion.' Most consultants agree there is one fundamental requirement to avoid a corporate blunder affecting consumer perceptions turning into a public relations disaster. According to Peter Cunard, partner of Tolman Cunard, strategic communications advisers: 'The first rule in any crisis management is be completely open, because if you are not it is going to come back and hit you between the eyes.' Hoover has taken some steps towards opening up by admitting there has been a problem. And it has issued a rash of press releases promising that all those who took up its free flights offer will eventually get on to an aircraft. But Hoover refuses, on grounds of 'commercial sensitivity', to disclose the precise number of people who applied for the offer. Consumers participating in the offer - and shareholders for that matter - surely want to know the number. If only 5,000 have applied, Dollars 30m should easily cover the bill. But if 300,000 have applied, then is Dollars 100 per person really sufficient even now to get them all on board an aircraft? From its responses to inquiries, Hoover still appears to believe that withholding important information will not be damaging to consumer confidence. 'It's a casebook which I am sure will be taught in communication skills classes in years to come,' says Cunard. 'Hoover's first failing seems to me that it did not appear to have a checklist which had on it 'what if something goes wrong?' It's a standard formula for anybody linked to marketing. Let's say there is another disaster and an aeroplane went down loaded with Hoover passengers. What about that scenario? Is the onus then on Hoover to do something for the relatives? The evidence so far is that that checklist was not there. What they cannot calculate and I do not suppose they ever will, is the damage to the Hoover name hereafter.' What characterises successful companies in these circumstances, suggests Gilligan, is management recognition that they have an image problem, that they have to take decisive action and that secrecy is not going to pay off. 'Taking those points together, they then work out how they are going to respond strategically, which in the case of Perrier was to take the brand off the shelf completely, and keep the public informed via the media. Hoover can't take the product off the shelf but the parallel is that its response appears to have been characterised by a degree of indecision and a denial of the magnitude of the problem it was facing. 'That has not been helped by comments from one or two people within Hoover, that the consumer was being rather foolish in expecting to get something for nothing,' Gilligan says.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Including in the pool distributing plant definition a description of a plant located within the marketing area which processes at least 50 percent of its fluid milk receipts as ultra-high temperature fluid milk products for distribution in aseptic packages. A plant qualifying as a pool distributing plant under the new provision would be a pool plant under the Southern Michigan order regardless of its route disposition in the marketing area of any other Federal milk order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Determining whether an emergency exists to warrant the omission of a recommended decision and the opportunity to file written exceptions thereto with respect to issue No. 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This decision deals only with issues 3 and 4. The remaining issues of the original and reopened hearings will be considered in a later decision on this record. Issues 3 and 4 were not considered at the initial February 1993 hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Findings and Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following findings and conclusions on the material issues are based on evidence presented at the hearing and the record thereof:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Include in the pool distributing plant definition a description of a plant located within the marketing area which processes at least 50 percent of its fluid milk receipts as ultra-high temperature fluid milk products for distribution in aseptic packages. The provisions of the order that relate to the basis for pooling a fluid milk plant should be modified to include a distributing plant located in the marketing area if the principal activity of the plant is the processing and distribution of aseptically processed fluid milk products. Such pool status, however, should not be dependent upon the amount of route disposition in the Southern Michigan marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The order currently provides that to qualify as a pool plant during a given month, a distributing plant must have total route disposition of not less than 50 percent of the combined Grade A milk received in bulk at that plant direct from producers, supply plants, cooperative associations, or diverted by the plant operator or cooperative. A distributing plant may also be considered a pool plant in a given month if it qualified as a pool plant under the same performance requirements in either of the immediately preceding two months. A distributing plant which also meets the pooling requirements of another marketing area is regulated under the order in which it has a greater proportion of its route disposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parmalat White Knight Packaging Corporation (White Knight), a proprietary handler, proposed that the order be amended to accommodate the operations of its milk plant located at Wyoming, Michigan. The plant is located within the defined marketing area. A witness for White Knight testified that the plant processes, packages, and distributes fluid milk products that are processed at ultra high temperatures and packaged in aseptic containers. The witness indicated that the aseptic process includes the use of ultra high temperature pasteurization, and that the resulting products, commonly referred to as ``UHT'' milk, could be stored unrefrigerated. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  The proprietary handler proposed that this type of plant be a pool plant if it is located in the Southern Michigan marketing area and meets the current performance requirements for a distributing plant, except for the requirement that the plant is regulated where the greatest proportion of its route disposition occurs. The proponent stated that the intent of the proposal is to pool its plant under the Southern Michigan order, irrespective of the level of route sales in this or other markets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``UHT'' milk, however, refers only to the pasteurization process that is used in producing an aseptically processed milk product. For this reason, it is more appropriate for purposes of order provisions to refer to the products involved as aseptically processed fluid milk products rather than UHT milk. To simplify the presentation of the findings and conclusions, however, and because of the common usage of the term ``UHT'', reference is made in the decision to UHT milk or milk products and UHT plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The White Knight spokesman cited several reasons why the proposal should be adopted. One reason cited was the nature of UHT milk products. According to the witness, fluid milk products processed at ultra high temperatures and packaged in aseptic containers can be stored at room temperature for nine months, in contrast to typical fluid milk products, which must be refrigerated and have relatively short shelf lives. As a result, when compared to the regularly-scheduled and relatively local distribution of fluid milk products, White Knight has the ability to distribute its products at more infrequent intervals and over a much broader geographical territory. White Knight's milk supply is procured from two cooperatives which represent 80 percent of producer milk in the order. Because of the typical procurement but unique distribution patterns, the proponent asserted, the current pooling provisions create a disincentive against local producers supplying a local Class I plant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of the proponent's dairy products has led to chaotic marketing conditions, the witness stated. Due to the distribution and sales patterns of its aseptically-packaged products, the regulatory status of the UHT plant has shifted from order to order, even on a monthly basis. The witness noted that in the five months beginning in September 1993, the plant was pooled under four different federal orders: Carolina, New Orleans-Mississippi, Southeastern Florida, and Tampa Bay. In a recent month, proponent's products were sold in 17 federal order marketing areas, in addition to unregulated territory. Almost half of the proponent's sales were in unregulated areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness stated that continual change in regulation under different federal orders puts the proponent at a competitive disadvantage to handlers who know with certainty under which order they will be regulated, because advance knowledge of the Class I price virtually is eliminated for the proponent. This has made it difficult for the proponent to price and sell its products because its costs are not known in advance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

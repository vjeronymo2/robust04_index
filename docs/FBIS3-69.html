			<p>SUMMARY                                 The Government Work Report delivered by Premier Li Peng at the  recent National People's Congress (NPC) in Beijing indicates that  despite the resolve of party reformers to push ahead with senior  leader Deng Xiaoping's new wave of market reforms they have yet  to make significant progress in some of the most difficult areas  of the reform agenda--price, investment, and enterprise reform.  Although party reformers appear to retain the edge in pushing  forward Deng's reform agenda, they will be hard pressed to find  solutions to China's current economic problems that do not  conflict with market principles and that will deflect political  pressure coming from Deng's hardline opponents.                             END SUMMARY      Delivered by Li on 10 March, the work report sought to portray  Beijing as moving ahead on the far-reaching market reforms  prescribed by the authoritative decision of the Third Plenum last  November.  Calling 1994 a year in which the Chinese economy has  "continued to maintain its growth momentum" and an "important"  year to "press ahead with reform," the report reaffirmed the  course of comprehensive market reform charted by the plenum as  the "general blueprint" and "program for action" for creating a  "socialist market economic structure" (Beijing radio, 10 March).  It went on to claim that fiscal and tax reforms, as well as  reforms in investment, finance and foreign trade, had "in the  main been promulgated" and are "proceeding quite smoothly."  Modest Progress in Financial Reform      In an apparent effort to demonstrate concrete progress in  fulfilling some goals of the plenum, the work report emphasized  recent changes in the method of financing the deficit--a first  step toward transforming the People's Bank of China (PBOC) into  an independent central bank along Western lines--and further  reforms of the fiscal and tax systems that reduce the burdensome  fiscal and welfare obligations of state enterprises.  For  example, the report declared that the government "will solve its  deficit this year by issuing state bonds," giving "favorable  treatment" to those who purchase them, and "will no longer make  overdrafts from banks."  Suggesting that reformers are already  moving ahead in this area, a 10 March report in Zhongguo Tongxun  She, a PRC-affiliated Hong Kong-based wire service, claimed that  the PBOC recently refused a loan to the Ministry of Finance to  clear the national debt.  It went on to quote Politburo Standing  Committee member and PBOC head Zhu Rongji as saying that "no bank  should be treated as a teller or an accountant for the  government."      The work report also highlighted fiscal and tax reforms that were  introduced after the plenum to ease the market transition of  state enterprises by reducing their enormous financial and  welfare burden.  Echoing media commentary on tax reforms  promulgated in January, the report declared that "beginning this  year" the State Council will exempt state enterprises from taxes  levied to finance energy and infrastructure projects and from the  "budget regulatory fund."  According to Jingji Ribao on 4  January, these financial obligations have accounted for 25  percent of enterprises' after-tax profits.  The work report also  pledged to "actively advance" social security reform, both to  "ease the burden" of "social welfare projects" such as medical  care and housing and to enable enterprises to "compete in the  market on an equal footing."  Suggesting that the government will  exert greater pressure on unprofitable enterprises, the report  announced that a "special fund" will be established to  "consolidate bankrupt enterprises" and "reset tIe their workers."      Slow Movement on Price, Investment Reform      Despite these efforts to demonstrate progress in some aspects of  the agenda pushed forward by the reformers, the report indicated  that at least for now they have backed away from such  controversial and potentially destabilizing proposals as price  and investment reform.  Apparently reflecting leadership concern  over mounting inflationary pressures, the report took a  considerably more cautious approach to price reform than the  plenum last fall.  It pledged simply to "appropriately adjust"-  -that is, to increase by administrative fiat--the prices of  grain, cotton, and energy "this year," a move that stands in  sharp contrast to the plenum decision's statements on price  reform.  The decision stated that the "main tasks" in price  reform are to further "decontrol the prices of competitive  commodities and services" while "adjusting government-set prices"  for only "some" prices and to "establish a mechanism in which  prices are set mainly by the market."  The decision also called  for other price reform measures not reiterated in the NPC report,  such as "abolishing the double-track price system for capital  goods as quickly as possible" and "accelerating the marketization  of the prices of production factors."      Underscoring the leadership's concern that removing price  controls now might spark social unrest, the report went on to  warn that in carrying out price reform, officials must "consider  the ability of enterprises and the masses to cope with the  consequences" of reform.  In an apparent reference to the sharp  rise in grain and edible oil prices occurring late last year in  major urban centers, the report pointed out that "special  attention" must be paid to "controlling increases" in the prices  of "basic consumer products" and services that are "closely  related to the masses' daily lives."  Similarly alluding to  leadership worries over social discontent arising from the  effects of price reform and fast growth, the report, and Renmin  Ribao editorials on the NPC on 13 and 18 March, reiterated media  slogans carried in PRC media since the first of the year warning  that the push for "reform and development" must be balanced  against the need for "social and political stability."      The report also indicated that the leadership has backed away  from the plenum's commitment to market-based reforms in the  investment system, at least in the short term, falling back on  traditional socialist measures to rein in what it said was the  current "reckless" investment in capital construction projects.  Although giving a nod to market-based principles that restrain  irrational enterprise investment--a major component of the  plenum-approved reforms--the report made clear that for now the  leadership will rely primarily on efforts to fine tune the  existing state bureaucracy to curb excessive and unprofitable  capital expenditure.  "This year," it said, investment reform  will focus "mainly" on the establishment of a "National  Development Bank"--one of several socialist style "policy-  lending" banks mandated by the plenum to fund "major state  construction projects according to a unified plan."  The bank, it  explained, will "provide a steady source" of investment funds and  "check inflation and investment expansion through the balancing  of capital."      Similarly, the report reflected continued leadership reliance on  administrative fiat to curb current investment excesses, falling  far short of far-reaching plenum guidelines on investment outside  the state planning sector.  The plenum decision had stated that  "competitive project investment" should be "decided by  enterprises themselves" on the premise that they "bear any risk  involved" and had called for the establishment "commercial banks"  that would provide credit for such investment and would "assume  sole responsibility for profits and losses."  However, although  the work report urged that "a [market] mechanism for restricting  investment" be established by making "investors and banks  responsible for investment risks," it went on to simply issue a  series of administrative orders, declaring that the state "will  not permit" investment capital to be derived from "diverting  circulating funds or borrowing money," that new projects "must  not begin before necessary funds are available," and that the  state would "no longer approve the establishment of new  development zones."      Apparently reflecting these pressures on the leadership to resort  to administrative measures to stem economic overheating, the  government has already taken several steps to control inflation  and excessive investment.  A 1 March Renmin Ribao commentator's  article stating that the State Planning Commission had  promulgated new regulations to prevent price gouging was followed  by the announcement of a nationwide "price inspection" to be  carried out in March to "ease inflationary pressure" (China  Daily, 8 March).  Earlier in the year, during a financial work  conference in January, Zhu Rongji also unveiled policies that  impose strict limits on credit and investment (Xinhua, 19  January).      Difficulty in Enterprise Reform      Most likely reflecting these and other obstacles to more rapid  reform, the work report implied that progress toward the  enormously complex plenum goal of restructuring state enterprises  into quasi-public corporations based on various types of share  holding arrangements has not met reformers' expectations.  Although pledging to "experiment" with new forms of enterprise  organization as required by the plenum, the report echoed the  cautious tone of Li Peng's remarks to a national economic work  conference held shortly after the plenum (Xinhua, 1 December  1993), reiterating Li's observation that enterprise reform is  "both the focus and the difficult part of reform" and emphasizing  that creating a "modern enterprise system" is "complicated work."  Suggesting that the leadership has not reached a consensus on the  specifics of the new enterprise structure, PRC media since the  plenum have carried a steady stream of articles advocating a  variety of positions on share holding, managing state assets,  leasing, and related issues.      Implications      The NPC work report's reaffirmation of the ambitious market-based  reform goals approved by the Central Committee's November plenum  suggests that party reformers retain the political edge in  pushing forward senior leader Deng Xiaoping's aggressive policy  agenda.  At the same time, the report also indicates that the  reformers have made little concrete progress in implementing this  agenda and have resorted to traditional administrative means  rather than market-based methods to control economic overheating.  Inflation, unrestrained investment, and other potentially  destabilizing consequences of the reform drive have again put the  brakes on the pace of change and no doubt have given party  hardliners an opportunity to challenge Deng's authority and  restrict the pace and scope of his program.  Although pressures  to create a more stable and productive economic system through  fundamental market reform still appear to favor the reformers'  position, they will be hard pressed to find solutions to China's  current economic and social problems that are consistent with  marketizing the economy and that will undercut criticism from  Deng's conservative rivals.

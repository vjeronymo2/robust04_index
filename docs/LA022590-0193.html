			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BADHAM'S DAUGHTER CHALLENGES FERGUSON;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: PHYLLIS BADHAM IS A POLITICAL NOVICE, BUT SOME THINK THE GOP  ASSEMBLYMAN IS VULNERABLE.  </P> <P> Fresh from a narrow defeat in his bid for the state Senate, conservative  Assemblyman Gil Ferguson has returned to his Newport Beach district only to  find that he is facing a potentially tough reelection challenge from a GOP  colleague.  </P> <P> Ferguson's opponent in the June 5 primary is the daughter of former Rep. Robert  E. Badham, southern Orange County's congressman for 10 years. Phyllis Badham  proudly says she is following in her father's footsteps by seeking to represent  roughly the same Assembly district that launched his 26-year political career  in 1961.  </P> <P> At 30, Badham also notes that she is starting in politics at the same age as  her father.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of respect for my father (in the district) and he has taught me  to have respect for the system," Badham said. "I have a 10-year career in  business and a thorough understanding of the political process. Given those  ingredients, I am a game and talented opponent."  </P> <P> Some political experts think Ferguson, 66, could be vulnerable because his  outspoken conservatism may be out of step with his district.  </P> <P> At a time when many pro-life politicians are trying to downplay their positions  on the abortion issue, Ferguson has recruited the sometimes militant  anti-abortion group Operation Rescue to help with his campaigns. And he  recently made headlines when he used a slur against gays at one of his campaign  events.  </P> <P> Moderate Republicans have tried to defeat Ferguson before, but he has won  decisively. In 1988, Ferguson beat back a primary challenge from Republican  Newport Beach Councilwoman Evelyn Hart. He won 60% of the vote, compared to  Hart's 33%.  </P> <P> Ferguson also demonstrated that he has a loyal following when he narrowly lost  the Feb. 6 special primary to replace former state Sen. William Campbell  (R-Hacienda Heights). With a strong showing in southern Orange County, Ferguson  finished less than 1,000 votes behind Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier), who  faces a runoff election in the 31st State Senate District race April 10.  </P> <P> Ferguson's 70th Assembly District is viewed as the most solidly Republican turf  in California, with the GOP holding a commanding 61% to 27% lead over Democrats  in voter registration. The district includes most of Orange County's southern  coast, from Newport Beach to Dana Point and inland to Coto de Caza.  </P> <P> Ferguson, seeking a fourth term in the Assembly, said he is disappointed by  Badham's challenge, especially since he came to the aid of her father when  Robert Badham faced a hostile primary opponent in 1986.  </P> <P> "We said at that time, 'You don't run against an incumbent,' " Ferguson said.  "If you're a Republican and you want to stay in the party, you don't run."  </P> <P> But Robert Badham said Thursday that he does not believe a contested primary is  unhealthy for the party and that he was challenged by a fellow Republican in  almost all of his 13 elections.  </P> <P> Badham said he expects to do some fund raising for his daughter as well as  provide political advice for the campaign.  </P> <P> Phyllis Badham met last week in Sacramento with most of Orange County's  legislative delegation to ask for its support -- or at least its neutrality.  Republican Assembly leader Ross Johnson (R-La Habra) said the tone of the  meeting was positive, but Badham's mission was unsuccessful.  </P> <P> "We all made very clear that we would be supporting Gil and that . . . an  unnecessary Republican primary did not make a lot of sense," Johnson said.  "Obviously, she has every right to file and run a campaign, but that doesn't  necessarily mean it is a smart thing to do."  </P> <P> Badham said she does not consider herself disloyal just because she thinks  Republicans need a better representative in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Noting the oil spill that soiled about 20 miles of Orange County coastline,  including parts of Newport Beach, Badham said she plans to campaign heavily on  environmental issues.  </P> <P> She noted that Ferguson was recently listed by the California League of  Conservation Voters as one of the five worst legislators on environmental  issues.  </P> <P> Ferguson responded that the conservation league is liberal-oriented and so  "those lists don't mean very much."  </P> <P> Badham said she will also campaign on her pro-choice stance on abortion because  she believes her position has more support in the district than Ferguson's  anti-abortion stance.  </P> <P> Ferguson said his campaign theme in 1990 will be to simply remind voters of his  record as their legislator since 1984.  </P> <P> Referring to his constituents, he said, "I think on some issues I'm more  conservative than they are . . . but I think 90% of what I do receives a very  high approval rating. After six years of taking their pulse, receiving their  votes and appearing at their forums, I think I really do reflect the majority  of the community."  </P> <P> Eileen Padberg, an Orange County Republican political consultant, said she  thinks Ferguson is vulnerable. "I don't think this district is gung-ho Marine,  like he is, (and) I think he's a little bit embarrassing in his comments," she  said.  </P> <P> But Padberg said she believes that Ferguson can be beaten only by a determined,  well-financed candidate because "when push comes to shove, the district just  votes (for the) incumbent."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 183(f) requires the application of RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering ``costs, any non-air quality benefits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts, energy requirements and safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors associated with alternative control techniques.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 112(d) requires the application of MACT considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any non-air quality health and environmental impacts and energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.'' (In addition, as described previously, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum control level is specified, referred to as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 112(c) requires the EPA to establish categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and subcategories of sources for regulation under section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112(d). In the EPA's notice of initial list of categories,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA stated that ``a category of sources is a group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources having some common features suggesting that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be regulated in the same way and on the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule.'' (57 FR 31578, July 16, 1992). The EPA also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that ``criteria that may need to be considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defining categories of similar sources include similarities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in: process operations (including differences between batch  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and continuous operations), emissions characteristics,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device applicability and costs, safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities for pollution prevention'' (57 FR 31580). To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justify VMT being placed in a separate category or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategory, it needs to be shown that VMT has distinctions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are relevant from a regulatory standpoint (given the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions of section 112), in determining whether the VMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be regulated in a similar manner as other terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The VMT is the largest crude oil loading facility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the U.S. with hourly crude loading rates more than 15 times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that of any other marine terminal. The VMT is one of only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> few terminals which are exclusively used for crude oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska has acknowledged that it could use a combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device at VMT to achieve a 98 percent reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. However, Alyeska has raised concerns about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility of recovering crude oil vapors with a 95 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency using conventional recovery devices such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon adsorbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Alyeska the design and construction of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor recovery system for the VMT would be technically more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complicated than for any other marine terminal. This is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because no existing vapor recovery system is currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating on as large a vapor stream as the VMT terminal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is great complexity in recovering crude oil vapor (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed to petroleum product vapor), and for reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in the following paragraph, a VMT recovery system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to be designed to operate efficiently over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad range of declining input volumes. In addition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sub-Arctic climate of the region presents unique problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regard to handling water vapor in terms of both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complications on the technical processes by which crude oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapors can be recovered and in terms of monitoring accuracy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Different and more complex operating parameters must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered in the design and construction of a vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery system that will operate effectively on the VMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crude oil stream because the number and range of volatility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the hydrocarbon components are greater in a crude oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream than in a product stream. Alyeska believes that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not be possible to achieve as high a recovery from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crude oil vapor stream as is achievable from a product vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream because of this difference in the number and range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volatility of the hydrocarbon components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The throughput in the Trans-Alaskan Pipeline (TAP),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which supplies the crude for loading at the VMT, is expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to decline such that the volume of vapors that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handled by the VMT recovery system will decrease with time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1988 annual TAP throughput reached a peak of 2.14 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrels per day. Throughput subsequently has declined to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current level of 1.62 million barrels per day (average year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to date for 1993) and estimates indicate that production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will continue to decline over the life of the now declining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> North Slope oil fields. An emission control system designed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the VMT needs to be able to operate efficiently over a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad range of declining input volumes. When considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> declining throughput, a recovery system enables more design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility than an incineration system because recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems require enough contact with either surface area or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scrubbing liquid to ensure high recovery; as flow decreases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contact increases which marginally increases recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, a facility may design very large control units or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller parallel units, both of which will function at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design efficiency. An incinerator is not as flexible in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation as a recovery system. An incinerator requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper mixing of the waste stream and the flame and mixing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> becomes poorer as flow rates decline. Large incinerators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be run at flow rates much lower than one half design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rates without affecting mixing and corresponding combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition the VMT will require the use of ``active''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detonation arrestors instead of ``passive'' detonation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrestors used at other marine terminals, due to the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of vapors that must be collected and the distance between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vessel loading berths and vapor recovery facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska has developed active detonator arrestors that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been approved by the Coast Guard, because passive detonation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arrestors would not protect a VMT type system from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explosion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

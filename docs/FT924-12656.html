			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Wales given Pounds 10m in aid for industry THE government yesterday announced a Pounds 10m industrial aid package for Wales which it said would lead to the creation of more than 1,300 jobs and safeguard a further 500. Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said 17 projectswere to be assisted. The biggest project is the Pounds 30m Tesco dry-goods distribution depot outside Newport, Gwent, which will create up to 500 jobs. Tesco is to use the depot to serve an area from the west Midlands to south-west England. Mr Hunt said government support for Welsh industry in the current financial year had reached Pounds 40m before the latest Pounds 10m. This would create or help safeguard 7,200 jobs. Also receiving help is the Pounds 5m meat-processing project of McIntosh Reynolds and John Rhind Farms, of Scotland. The two are developing and expanding the former United Meat Packers (Wales) abattoir on Anglesey, creating 230 jobs. Development of abattoirs in Wales is essential as most do not meet new European Community hygiene regulations. Most of the other schemes being backed are small and cover companies involved in a range of areas, from motor parts to shellfish and environmental engineering.</p>

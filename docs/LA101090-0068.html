			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STRIFE BETWEEN UAL, UNIONS MAY DEEPEN WITH BID'S FAILURE  </P> <P> In the wake of another failure by employees to buy UAL Corp., parent of United  Airlines, most observers believe that the company and its unions are headed for  nasty confrontation and bitter rhetoric.  </P> <P> "There is going to be trouble, one way or the other," predicted Stanley  Aronowitz, a sociology professor who specializes in labor at the graduate  school of the City University of New York.  </P> <P> "Either there will be a lockout (of the unions)," he said, "or the unions are  going to have to make large concessions, or UAL will sell out to another  company on the grounds that it cannot remain competitive with such high labor  costs."  </P> <P> Aronowitz said he believes that UAL Corp. was acting in bad faith throughout  the union-led takeover attempt.  </P> <P> "The corporation was . . . playing a game to enter into negotiations with the  unions as a means of wringing concessions," he said. "The deal did not work, so  now you (the unions) will have to give back more benefits and wages and make  other concessions. That is the next step."  </P> <P> Joseph R. Blasi, professor in the Institute of Management and Labor Relations  at Rutgers University, said he expects a "battle royal between labor and  management."  </P> <P> He maintained that Stephen M. Wolf, UAL's chairman and chief executive, "wants  to turn the employees from investors back into simple workers, and he wants  wage concessions from them without giving stock. I expect management to try to  sell the position that business will go on as usual -- 'We're going to buy more  planes, expand our routes and improve service' -- but he will have great  difficulties in marketing that to his own employees.  </P> <P> "The employees are convinced that the airline must be made more efficient but  that they should share in the fruits of any kind of restructuring."  </P> <P> UAL employees are upset with Wolf for another reason: his sale of his own stock  in the company last May for about $150 a share -- a statement, in effect, that  he didn't think the unions were capable of financing their $201 offer.  </P> <P> "One of the unfortunate side effects of this thing is that the relationship  between the unions and Stephen Wolf has really soured," said Corey Rosen,  executive director of the National Center for Employee Ownership in San  Francisco. "He sold his shares at $150 when he said the company was worth much  more. They will view him as having been an obstacle rather than an aid in  getting this transaction completed."  </P> <P> Frank Spencer, a professor at the Northwestern University Transportation Center  in Evanston, Ill., agreed.  </P> <P> "The employees feel they have been put upon by Stephen Wolf," Spencer said. "He  walked off with all the goodies. He wants the employees to make concessions  while he walks off a millionaire."  </P> <P> Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst with Alliance Capital Management , a New  York-based pension and mutual fund manager, predicted that UAL will let its  employees strike rather than give in to their demands.  </P> <P> He said it is unprecedented for an airline to have to negotiate new contract  provisions with all its unions at one time. But that is the present case at  United because the contracts, under terms of the Railway Labor Act, which  governs airline labor pacts, are all now in the stage where they can be  amended. The unions are expected soon to present tough new pay demands.  </P> <P> The takeover effort was carried out by the pilots', mechanics' and flight  attendants' unions at United.  </P> <P> "There is a threat of anarchy at the company," Pettee said. "There will be a  fight for control and -- in order to exercise control -- management would take  a strike, if necessary." But not every expert interviewed believes that labor  chaos is inevitable.  </P> <P> Edmund Greenslet, a Florida-based airline analyst, said the unions still want  to buy UAL, despite the setbacks they have suffered -- and may try again. A  strike, he said, would kill any such possibility.  </P> <P> "If the labor groups push their negotiating demands on management to a point  that it results in a strike, the upshot of such a strike would be economic  disaster," he said. "If labor ever wants to come back and restructure the deal,  having put the company into a strike would kill any chances of doing that. It  would be zero. The banks would not be able to support a deal with the earning  power of the airline destroyed."  </P> <P> And Peter Cappelli, director of the Center for Professional Management at the  Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, doubts that there will be  lasting animosity between labor and management at UAL.  </P> <P> "The recent events," he maintained, "were useful for labor relations. These  (members of the three unions) were working together towards a common goal, and  that will be useful in the long run."  </P></p>

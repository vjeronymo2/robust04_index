			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Labour confident of true-blue Redbridge Three weeks ago Miss Liz Pearce, Labour leader on Redbridge council, was quietly accepting that the Tories would retain control of the borough, which they have run without break for 30 years. But her opinion changed this week. 'I am confident that the Tories will lose overall control here,' she says, running through a list of promising canvass returns in the north-east London borough. 'I think we have a very good chance of winning outright.' Miss Pearce's prediction should cause deep anxiety among party workers at Tory central office as they ponder how the elections in London will go today. Redbridge, where the Tory group has a majority of 23 seats, ought to be impossible to lose. Psephologists claim it is 'on the cusp' between a bad result for the Tories and a disastrous one. If Redbridge goes, the Tories will only have the big strongholds of Wandsworth, Westminster and Kensington left. The borough of Redbridge, combining towns such as Ilford, Wanstead and Woodford, is classic Thatcherite territory. It has many white, aspiring middle-class voters, who have been the bedrock of conservatism in the last 20 years. The council leadership has been composed of a closely-knit group of Tories who were all elected to the council 20 years ago. Yet Labour seems to have made huge inroads here in the last few days. Miss Pearce claims that in some marginal wards Labour is getting the support of between 50 and 60 per cent of those who say they will vote. She claims that 90 per cent of first-time voters are opting for Labour. Even in Wanstead and Woodford, Sir Winston Churchill's constituency for many years, Labour candidates are supported by a remarkable 42 per cent of those who say they will vote. Tory campaigners are still confident that they will win. They privately admit that the party will lose 9 seats on the council, but this will still give them a majority of 5. Mr Ronnie Barden, the Tory group leader, believes that the predictions of Labour victory are no different from those that were made - in error - in 1990. 'People may say on the doorstep that they will vote Labour,' he says. 'But, time and again, when they come to the ballot box they have second thoughts.'</p>

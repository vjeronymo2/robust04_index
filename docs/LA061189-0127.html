			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> On the second anniversary of the riots that brought down the authoritarian  regime of former South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan, thousands of radical  students battled riot police in Seoul. The students called for the overthrow of  President Roh Tae Woo and the expulsion of U.S. troops. Opposition groups  denounced Roh for failing to go ahead with a promised referendum on his  presidency. Roh has said he decided against the vote because it would create  unrest. The protesters used rocks, clubs and firebombs against police, and more  than 1,000 people were arrested.  </P></p>

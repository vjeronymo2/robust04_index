Borisova: "The Issue of the Liberals' Purse"] </F>   [Text] The first congress of a new social and  political organization--the Liberal Convention of Moldova  (LKM)--which is headed by N. Chirtoaca, adviser to the president  of the Republic of Moldova, was held last Saturday, 20 November,  in Chisinau.    The majority of the participants in the forum represented  business circles of the republic. They were leaders of  small-scale enterprises and cooperatives, stock companies and  insurance companies, and commercial centers and funds. A  telegram of greeting was sent the congress by entrepreneurs of  the Left Bank. The Convention has thus first and foremost united  those for whom neither the campaign against the market nor entry  into the market presents insoluble questions. This is  understandable, for the idea of liberalism contained in the  designation of the Convention is based, as we all know, on the  institution of private property and freedom of capitalist  enterprise. It was proclaimed at the congress repeatedly, for  that matter, that the organization is open to all who urge real  reforms in Moldova. It was emphasized that liberalism has always  been close to the Moldovan peasant. When, however, it was asked  from the floor: "What about the working class?" the response  was: "And workers in sympathy with liberal views should, of  course, be in our ranks."    As far as the coming elections are concerned, the Convention  identified its program maximum as follows: the creation of a  liberal-reform bloc capable of elaborating a common approach to  reforms in the republic.    "We intend," People's Deputy V. Dobria, an organizer of the  Liberal Convention of Moldova, declared, "to support at the  elections all parties and all individuals who have real reform  programs. We have the intellectual and material forces for this."    So, employing the well-known metaphor, it may be said that  one of the "moneybags" for bolstering the "body and spirit" of  certain political forces in the election marathon has been  filled. The candor with which this was stated is to be  respected, I believe. To the question as to who specifically  will, for all that, be receiving from that bag, V. Dobria  observed that it would not, of course, be either the extreme  left or the extreme right, since "both contain a direct threat  to Moldova's independence." Not the friendliest attitude toward  the Agrarian Democratic Party, "for an endeavor to preserve the  kolkhozes at any price and for blockages in the way of  privatization in the countryside" was expressed in passing. At  the same time the right-wing social democrats and the Reform  Party have already won the affections of the Liberal Convention.  Concerning the liberals' direct participation in the elections,  however, V. Dobria declared:    "We do not aspire to power, and we do not need positions.  Our  purpose is to help true professionals come to power. At the same  time, you will see the names of members of the Convention on the  slates of this party or the other that is participating in the  elections. On which slates precisely it is hard to say, for not  all parties have published their programs as yet."    Generally, both the congress and the news conference that  followed were conducted under the sign of such symbols as  "centrism," "private property," and "reforms." In the spirit of  true liberalism. In the spirit of the present day. In fact, the  entire organism of conventions seemed to me strikingly  contemporary. By their uncomplicated attitude toward such a  seemingly fundamental concept as the social base, for example.  Remember--"and workers should be in our ranks." In some newborn  parties, on the other hand, no social base is adumbrated at all.  Never mind, do not worry, there should be an idea, and there  will be a social base.    And how contemporary were all the liberal words on the  subject of private property! No matter that it is not even  mentioned among the vast majority of citizens. After all, the  social democrats are just as ardently promising our rapid  private-property formation in the process of privatization.  Although it has long been calculated that even with a length of  service of 30 years, a person is due four annual minimum  wages--approximately half a million rubles, that is, coupons.    Also entirely in the spirit of the times, incidentally, is  the fact that the head of the convention is none other than a  presidential adviser. As you will recall, this path was trodden  before him by another M. Snegur adviser, Stefan Gorda, now a  leader of the Reform Party. Yes, as can be seen, it is with good  reason that, in military terminology, the presidential host is  forming an extended line. After all, practically all parties of  the republic will be taking part in the early presidential  elections, which, as can be seen, are not that far off. And,  consequently, the head of state will be able to count on "his"  bloc.    But I would call the most modern stroke of Saturday's  undertaking the presentation of the convention. The smorgasbord  was reminiscent of the preface of the "Book of Appetizing and  Healthy Food" of the 1950's edition--a real treat! And how some  newly baked and hardened politicians are treating themselves  currently, lending an ear to the chink of coins in the liberal  purse!</p>

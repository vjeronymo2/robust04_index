			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENCE AND PORNOGRAPHY  </P> <P> Normally, The Times presents balanced views of qualified individuals. However,  the diatribes of Jerry Kirk ("Ted Bundy Shows Us the Crystallizing Effect of  Pornography") and Al Goldstein ("The Perversion of Truth Continues in Alleging  a Porn-Crime Link") ill serve the reader (Op-Ed Page, Feb. 8).  </P> <P> Kirk, who has a financial interest in puritanism, argues that the 1986 Attorney  General's Commission on Pornography statistics show that 81% of the serial  murderers studied "said their biggest sexual interest was in reading  pornography." Thank God they usually found reading more interesting than  killing!  </P> <P> He uses the statements of Arthur Bishop, who killed boys, to support the  contribution of pornography to the abuse of women. Isn't the indication instead  that the sickness is in the mind and not the material?  </P> <P> I don't know what " 'family' video outlets" Kirk habits but violent sexual  films are not available there although fantasy films featuring explicit sex  between consenting adults sometimes are. Kirk is as confused about the  difference in sex and violence as the offenders he condemns.  </P> <P> Goldstein, who has a financial interest in pornography, implies that any  censorship of pornography leads to Soviet-style repression. This is a lot like  the National Rifle Assn. worrying about a ban on AK-47s leading to the  Nicaraguan invasion of Texas.  </P> <P> He also uses loaded illogic, discrediting the Meese panel because of the former  attorney general's alleged improprieties which, if true, are reprehensible but  have nothing to do with sex.  </P> <P> There is a point at which censorship has a certain validity, Mr. Goldstein.  There is certainly validity in further studies in deviant behavior, Mr. Kirk.  Neither of you presents much validity in your self-interested arguments.  </P> <P> WILLIAM A. WELLS  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

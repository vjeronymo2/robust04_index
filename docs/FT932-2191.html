			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Travel: Great world rail routes - Practical Traveller THERE are evil plans afoot for the world's railways. In Britain, some companies hoping to buy rail franchises after privatisation are already hatching schemes to concrete over the tracks and run buses instead of trains. The 'guided busways', which allow specially-built vehicles to thunder at high speeds without being steered, are intended to combine the flexibility of buses with the speed and safety of rail. Such systems already exist in Essen and Adelaide. Rail enthusiasts will shudder. For these poor, old-fashioned souls, the concept of a railway is limited to tracks and trains. To indulge them - and other simpletons of like mind - here is a smattering of what the world still has to offer: Mexico - Copper Canyon Railway: Chihuahua is a city in the north of Mexico which has, as its claim to fame, a hairless dog. Los Mochis is a dull town on the Pacific. Between the two lies one of the world's most spectacular journeys. The route, which took six decades to construct, climbs to the peaks of the Sierra Madre before freewheeling to the Pacific. In between are 73 tunnels, 28 bridges and heart-stopping moments where passengers are dangled over some of the world's deepest canyons. The train leaves Chihuahua at 8.30am daily, arriving in Los Mochis at 8.30pm. Mexican Tourist Board, London. Tel: 071-734-1058. Japan - The Bullet Train: Japan's ultra-modern bullet trains explode through the ancient interior. To cut down on price (trains are not cheap), invest in a Japan Rail Pass - availble only outside Japan - for Pounds 172 which entitles you to seven days' unlimited travel. Japan Travel Bureau (071-836-9367). Recommended routes include The Twilight Express from Osaka to Sapporo, or between Koriyama and Niigata through the scenic Tohoku region. Japan National Tourist Organisation (071-734-9638). Former Soviet Union - Bolshoi Express: Tsar Nicholas I mistrusted technical innovation and only grudgingly agreed to the construction of Russia's first rail track between St Petersburg and his summer palace, 26 miles away. Since, rail has been vigorously embraced and the Commonwealth of Independent States now has the world's largest network. An extravagant way to explore it is by the Bolshoi Express, a train built for government officials in the 1950s and restored in 1990. Cox &amp; Kings (071-834-7472) uses steam locomotives for parts of the journey. The Tashkent to St Petersburg train puffs its way through Samarkand, Bukhara, Astrakhan, Volgograd and Moscow. The price: Pounds 2,495 for 14 days. North America - Amtrak: Most Americans travel by car and airplane, which is why railway stations are often as hushed as libraries. Yet rail is one of the best ways of seeing the countryside. Amtrak's Empire Builder, which takes 52 hours to trundle from Chicago to Seattle, passes through the pancake-flat Mid-West before reaching Glacier National Park and the Cascade Mountains. The one-way trip costs Pounds 215 (with a Pounds 100 supplement for bed and meals). Non-US citizens should consider the 15-day Amtrak pass, priced Pounds 135-Pounds 200. Amtrak(071-978-5212). India - rail pass: Tomes have been written about India's railways, and all of it is true. The Indrail pass, which allows a week's unlimited travel for Pounds 77, is hard to beat. First stop should be the London office of Dr Swaminath Dandipani, S D Enterprises (081-903-3411), who claims to have memorised the network's entire timetable and is the UK agent for Indrail. Britain - The Royal Scotsman: The Royal Scotsman, Abercrombie &amp; Kent (071-730-9600), makes unhurried, luxurious progress through the Scottish Highlands and between London and Edinburgh. Its Pullman carriages are remodelled in Edwardian style. The four-day Northern and Eastern Tour, which follows the Strathspey line, incorporates the Highland Wildlife Park, Kyle of Lochalsh, Isle of Skye and Glamis castle. It costs a mean Pounds 2,120. Or you could charter the entire train - Pounds 44,900 for three days.</p>

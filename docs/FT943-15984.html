			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Dixons uncertain Uncertainty ahead of full year figures from Dixons, the high street retail group, and speculation of an investigation into trading practices saw the shares dip 5 to 170p. Dixons is forecast to announce a profit of between Pounds 70m and Pounds 82m, up from Pounds 35m last time, but the provisions could be quite high, especially in relation to the recent sale of 100 of its Curry's elect-rical stores. The write-down for Curry's is forecast at around Pounds 20m but some analysts feel it could be substantially higher. Also, there was a rumour that the Office of Fair Trading was planning an inquiry into the pricing of white goods such as fridges and washing machines.</p>

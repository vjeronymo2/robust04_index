			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Brazil finance minister faces calls to quit ALL eyes in Brazil are on Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, the economy minister, to see if he can withstand increasing pressure to relax the government austerity policy in order to win political support for beleaguered President Fernando Collor. Mr Moreira continues to insist that he will neither quit nor abandon the government's tight monetary policy, despite pleas from Mr Collor's political allies in the Liberal Front (PFL) that money is needed for social projects to secure congressional votes to withstand an expected impeachment process against the president. 'I can open the coffers but there's nothing in them,' he says. Speculation is increasing over his possible departure as a result of mounting criticism from PFL members of the recessionary effects and lack of positive results of the economic programme. The most serious attack came from Mr Collor's most important backer, Mr Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the governor of Bahia and PFL leader. 'This marriage between high inflation and deep recession is not working,' he said. 'What brings down a minister is not a political party but constant inflation of 20 per cent. If Marcilio falls it will be because of the poor results of economic policy.' The supreme council of the powerful Sao Paulo Federation of Industries is also preparing to ask the government to reduce interest rates and delay the timetable of reduction of import tariffs. But the majority of the financial community both inside and outside Brazil is highly nervous about the effects of a change in policy or the replacement of Mr Moreira, fearing this could result in hyperinflation and a collapse of the accord with the IMF. The central bank has been intervening heavily in the market to prevent the cruzeiro falling too much against the dollar and Brazilian debt on the secondary markets has fallen to 30.6 cents. For the time being Mr Collor is managing to contain both the PFL pleas and Mr Moreira's resistance to a change in policy. However, political pressures will mount as the congressional inquiry into corruption comes to an end on August 26, after which an impeachment process is expected to begin.</p>

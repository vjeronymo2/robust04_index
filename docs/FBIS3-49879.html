He added, in an exclusive telephone interview with  AL-HAYAH from his office in Sarajevo:    "We have warned the European Union that the signatures of  the  Serb and Croat parties cannot be relied upon unless they are  accompanied by international resoluteness to force them into  compliance and implementation. The Europeans, however, have not  paid attention, which has led to the failure of the last truce  and the continuation of obstacles to humanitarian aid convoys."    The Bosnian foreign minister discussed the question of  Sarajevo, saying that the presidential commission still lacks a  final position in this regard, pending the decision of the  Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina. "It is certain, however, that  its decision will reject any partition of the capital."    He mentioned the city of Mostar in the south of the country,  whose population is 40 percent Muslim, 38 percent Croatian, and  22 percent Serbian, explaining that the Croats had expressed  their readiness to study its partition, under pressure from the  European Union, "but so far they have not shown any goodwill."    He asserted that the Bosnian government still stood by its  decision not to negotiate over an outlet to the sea at the  Prevlaka peninsula, "because it is absolutely unacceptable to  us." He pointed out that in the ongoing contacts with the Croats  over the outlet, it had been decided that Bosnian Prime Minister  Dr. Haris Silajdzic would meet with Croat Foreign Minister Mate  Granic in Vienna on January 3 to discuss the question of Niyum,  and reaching this port through Croatian territory. He said that  when this problem is solved, the fate of the agreement will be  deadlocked in the coming talks set for the 18th [of January] in  Geneva. [passage omitted]</p>

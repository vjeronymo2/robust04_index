			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP NOTES;  </P> <P> SINGER-GUITARIST QUITS IMAGINING YELLOW SUNS  </P> <P> Personal and creative differences have shaken up Imagining Yellow Suns.  </P> <P> Singer-guitarist Ed Bernard is leaving the Orange County band, which released  its debut album last year on Dr. Dream records.  </P> <P> The three other members -- Tim Bugge, Steve Cross and Rob Fadtke -- will  recruit a replacement for Bernard and carry on with the name Imagining Yellow  Suns, according to Dr. Dream's vice president, David Hansen.  </P> <P> Hansen said the label is "a little worried" about the impact of losing Bernard,  who sang and wrote lyrics for most of the songs on the album. Still, he said,  "we're supporting the guys. We think Tim and Steve and Rob are all talented  guys."  </P> <P> Hansen said that Dr. Dream's contract with the band calls for two more records.  </P> <P> Former Scarecrows front man David Pedroza has surfaced with a new band, Spanish  Fly, which made its Orange County debut Wednesday at Foul Play in Huntington  Beach. The lineup includes two old associates of Pedroza, former Scarecrows  drummer Mike Petrus and keyboard player Joe Simon (who also is a member of  Broken Homes). Rounding out the band are guitarist Brett Balaban and bassist  Oliver Mariachi -- players whom Pedroza has recruited since his move last year  from Orange County to Hollywood. The band's sound is close to the Scarecrows'  Rolling Stones-style rock, but with Simon's sweet-sounding organ and electric  piano taking over from the guitars as the primary lead instruments.

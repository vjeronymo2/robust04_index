			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti opposition to dominate assembly KUWAIT's political opposition has capped the most vigorously fought election campaign in the emirate's history by winning a surprisingly substantial majority in the country's 50-seat national assembly. Almost all Kuwait's leading opposition figures won seats in what promises to be a fiery and awkward assembly for the ruling al-Sabah family. The assembly will be the first full parliament since Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the emir, suspended the last for its obstinate opposition to the government in 1985. Judged on the basis of candidates' campaign platforms, at least 30 outright government opponents will sit in the assembly. At least 18 elected candidates are directly linked to opposition Islamic groups, particularly the moderate Sunni Islamic Constitutional Movement and the more conservative Salaf, while 12 are broadly liberal opposition figures, including two high-profile members of the Kuwait Democratic Forum, Mr Abdulla Nibari and Mr Ahmed al-Khatib - who drew crowds of up to 8,000 at some rallies. Information ministry officials put the turnout at 85 per cent of Kuwait's 81,400 voters, after an uncommonly outspoken campaign. However, the opposition's strong showing is certain to herald a period of tough political haggling. Immediate horse trading will centre on the appointment of a new cabinet, which Sheikh Saad al-Sabah must name within 15 days of yesterday's formal resignation of the sitting cabinet. Opposition leaders are already demanding that at least half the cabinet must be formed from government critics in the National Assembly - a step the government has always been deeply reluctant to take. Failure to meet opposition demands would almost certainly provoke an early confrontation in the new assembly, which will open the first eight-month term of its four-year tenure later this month. Whatever the make-up of the cabinet, the assembly is certain to raise a host of other potentially uncomfortable issues for the government. High on the list of these are calls for an examination of the government's conduct leading up to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, along with popular demands for a probe into the management of Kuwait's overseas investments - and the conduct of some of its managers - and the pursuit of several senior figures believed still to owe large sums following the 1982 collapse of the informal Souq al-Manakh stock market. Islamic groups are also seeking to change Kuwait's founding 1962 constitution by inserting an article stating that Islamic Sharia law shall be the 'sole source' of legislation. The constitution now describes Sharia as a 'main source' of Kuwait's laws. Observers suggest that the Islamic groups are unlikely to win the two-thirds majority necessary to effect constitutional change. But few doubt that the opposition will rally strong support on most of the election campaign's issues. At the same time, it would be very difficult for the emir simply to suspend a troublesome parliament.</p>

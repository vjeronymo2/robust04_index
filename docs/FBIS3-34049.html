Speaking at a press conference,  Eytan described Gonen Segev, Ester Salmovitz, and Alex  Goldfarb's breakaway as an attempt to strengthen their positions  in the upcoming elections. Eytan said he was not surprised by  reports of their possible plans to join the coalition.    Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says the Labor party must not  get involved in the internal political problems of the Tzomet  party. Speaking to reporters tonight in Jerusalem, Rabin refused  to say whether he would attempt to entice the three resigning  members to join the coalition and, in his words, would not  answer hypothetical questions.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1800 GMT on 2 February adds that Rabin "stated a short time ago  that he had not authorized anybody to negotiate with the three  seceding members of Tzomet."]</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ENCINO BUILDING PERMIT UPHELD;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: HOMEOWNERS COMPLAINED ABOUT THE WRONG PROJECT AFTER RECEIVING  PLANS OF A DIFFERENT VENTURA BOULEVARD COMPLEX.  </P> <P> Angry Encino homeowners Tuesday failed in their effort to require the developer  of a controversial retail and office complex on Ventura Boulevard at Woodley  Avenue to prepare an environmental impact report.  </P> <P> Although the homeowners claimed that the report was needed to determine  measures for coping with the additional congestion and noise that the project  would bring to the area, the Los Angeles Building and Safety Commission ruled  that city building and safety officials were justified in issuing a permit to  Golden West Properties without requiring the report.  </P> <P> The commissioners said they felt that the effect on traffic and noise had been  adequately addressed by the developer.  </P> <P> Jerry Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino, said he was considering legal  action to halt the project. "We have to consider all our options, but we are  not happy with what has happened today," he said following the five-member  panel's unanimous decision.  </P> <P> The three-story project, which will cost at least $10 million, is composed of  49,000 square feet of retail space, 20,000 square feet of office space and an  11,500-square-foot restaurant.  </P> <P> Residents who appeared before the commission said they had not been given  adequate notice of the project by city officials. Silver said that when he  learned of the project last August, he asked representatives of Los Angeles  City Councilman Marvin Braude to send him documents on the proposed project so  that he could file a formal protest.  </P> <P> However, Silver said he was mistakenly sent documents about a different Ventura  Boulevard project and unwittingly filed a protest against the wrong project. He  learned later that the permit was granted after no opposition was registered.  </P> <P> "The citizens were denied due process," Silver said. "The mix-up on the  notification took their rights away from them. This project is aesthetically  unacceptable and cannot be allowed."  </P> <P> Benjamin Reznik, attorney for Golden West Properties, said the project was  reviewed and approved by the city's Department of Transportation and the  Building and Safety Department's Environmental Review Committee. "There is no  substantial evidence to show that this project will have a negative impact," he  said.  </P></p>

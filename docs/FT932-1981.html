			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / When in doubt, buy dollars In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. Such logic surely justifies the dollar's surge against all other leading currencies on Friday. Investors may be sceptical about President Bill Clinton's leadership abilities and doubtful that the US recovery will ever take off properly. But compared with any other region, the US is undeniably a haven of prosperity and political stability. The collapse of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa's government has thrown Japan into an extended period of political and economic turmoil. On Friday, as Wall Street analysts debated the implications - including the alarming possibility that Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party might lose its grip on power for the first time in over three decades - the dollar staged an electrifying rally against the yen, closing nearly 3 per cent up at Y109.4. In Washington the momentous events in Tokyo made the Clinton administration's obsession with trade barriers look suddenly petty. The dollar was also remarkably strong against European currencies, closing at a 15-month high against the D-Mark of DM1.68 and pushing sterling below Dollars 1.50 for the first time in several months. In part this reflects a gloomy reassessment of European prospects: Wall Street is waking up to the fact that Germany's economic difficulties are far more profound than previously assumed. Bonn needs to take tough action not just to curb its budget deficit but also to reduce the share in national income of heavy manufacturing, which remains excessive by the standards of most service-oriented modern economies. Yet many US observers doubt that Germany possesses the political will to make hard choices. Such doubts extend from Germany to the whole of Europe, which many American economists believe is suffering from another attack of 'Euroscelerosis'. Just as the corrosive effects on jobs and confidence of 'corporate restructuring' delayed and weakened the US's cyclical recovery in 1991 and 1992, so it is expected to hold back Europe this year and next. The difference is that labour market 'rigidities', a euphemism for strong unions and generous unemployment benefits, suggest the adjustment process will be more troublesome in most European countries. In the short run, cuts in public spending and a threatened scaling back of the cherished welfare state can only undermine confidence further, with adverse consequences for private spending and investment. The strength of any dollar rebound, of course, will also depend on trends in the US. The negligible increases in consumer and wholesale prices reported for May have eased fears of an imminent tightening of monetary policy. But the Federal Reserve continues to watch inflationary trends with some trepidation. The dilemma for policymakers is that wages and prices seem to be rising somewhat faster than economic models suggest they should, given unused industrial capacity and a relatively slack labour market. The Fed doubtless hopes that the acceleration in inflation earlier this year will turn out to be an aberration. But its reported policy shift to a bias towards raising rates suggests that it is readying itself for the possibility that historical economic relationships have broken down. At present short-term US rates are either zero in real terms or slightly negative. Since the seeds of most inflations are sown earlier than people appreciate, this leaves the Fed feeling vulnerable, even though monetary growth is extremely subdued. After all, some great economists, such as the Swedish theorist, Knut Wicksell, argued that it is inherently inflationary to hold interest rates below their natural equilibrium levels. On a Wicksellian analysis, the Fed ought gradually to raise short- term rates to at least 4.0-4.5 per cent, regardless of what is happening to unemployment or the monetary aggregates. If the ghost of Wicksell guides Fed policy over the next year and if the German downturn proves as protracted as some American analysts fear, the dollar could rise sharply against the D-Mark. Economic weakness may force the Bundesbank to cut short-term rates by as much as three percentage points; in that case the differential between German and US short-term rates could narrow from some 4.5 percentage points today to zero this time next year. And at that stage the outlook for European growth might still look worse than that in the US, suggesting further dollar appreciation. The potential for a dollar rebound against the yen is more constrained. Indeed, if the Clinton administration could control markets it would be zero: it regards yen appreciation as an essential tool for eliminating the 'principal asymmetry' in the global economy - Japan's Dollars 130bn current account surplus. Yet it is not so unnatural for a rich economy to be a capital exporter at a time of domestic recession. The rapidity of the yen's dizzying climb this year could not be justified by economic fundamentals. By adding to the strain on Japanese companies, it threatened to deepen the domestic downturn and, perversely, to increase the current account surplus that so upsets Washington. If political turmoil in Tokyo prompts a more rational assessment of the relative merits of investment in Japan and the US, the dollar is likely to regain more ground against the yen.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A squeeze in stock index futures helped to reverse an initial decline as turnover in the derivatives returned to meagre levels, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening of the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 at 3,084 was below expectations and appeared to indicate that a dull session lay ahead. Within the first hour of trading the contract had fallen to a low of 3,074. However, an aggressive buyer appeared at mid-morning, taking the market by surprise. September saw the earlier decline reversed and a gentle squeeze was seen as dealers attempted to fill the order. A more favourable outlook on inflation helped to maintain the momentum. A firm opening on Wall Street, the strength of sterling and another bout of hectic buying by the morning's big trader brought a squeeze to the contract in the last hour which saw it climb to a day's high of 3,119. Following a bout of profit-taking it closed at 3,103, a point ahead of its fair value premium to cash of about 7 points. Volume was 11,468 contracts. Dealers reported a dull session in traded options, where a total of 24,372 lots had been dealt by the close. The FT-SE 100 option encountered business of 8,261 contracts, and among stock options HSBC closed well ahead with 3,814 lots traded.</p>

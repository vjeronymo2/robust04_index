Birns] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 19 SAPA--Inkatha Freedom Party  [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he won't take part in the  April election even if his demands are met by the government and  the African National Congress [ANC], as he won't have enough  time to campaign for votes. Independent Radio 702 on Saturday  reported Mr Buthelezi was speaking at Jan Smuts airport near  Johannesburg on Friday [18 February] evening after meeting  Swedish foreign minister Margaretha af Ugglas.    "It's not really fair (that) if our concerns are met now,  they don't consider giving us space to campaign and to  electioneer," he said. He reiterated that government/ANC  concessions on interim constitution amendments designed to bring  the Freedom Alliance into the election were "nothing new",  saying they were "vague and embarassing". Mr Buthelezi said the  aim of his meeting with Minister af Ugglas had been to push for  international mediation to break the constitutional deadlock.    The Swedish foreign minister said South African role-players  needed to solve the situation among themselves, but that  international involvement should be considered if it could help  the process towards breaking the deadlock.    ANC leader Nelson Mandela was reported on Friday as having  ruled out any postponement of the April election.</p>

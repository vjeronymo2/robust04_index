			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Diary of a Private Investor: Why directors bear watching - Kevin Goldstein-Jackson explains the importance of a company's board 'THE BOARD meetings used to start at 3 pm and sometimes went on until almost midnight. The managing director did not believe in capital expenditure. He did not understand the need for the latest machinery: he thought efficiency meant counting the paper clips and sacking staff. 'There was no way I could reach the main board. My division was propping up the rest of the company - but the boardroom was reserved for friends and relatives of the chairman.' MORE THAN a decade ago, I heard comments like these when I was interviewing applicants for the positions of company secretary and financial director of a public quoted company of which I was the founder. It occurred to me then that the business with the greatest ability to acquire insider information was not banking or stockbroking but executive recruitment. Many applicants for a highly-paid position will tell their prospective employer almost anything he wants to know: it will not all be sour grapes and moans. Some people explained to me how their employer was proposing to launch a new product, or had plans to expand by takeover into new areas of activity. I even heard boasts about how 'wizard wheezes' were devised to keep a certain amount of debt off the balance sheet of their companies, and how auditors had been persuaded to agree that stocks should be valued at rather more than they were really worth. (But I hasten to add that the successful applicants for the positions in my company did not reveal anything untoward about their previous employers). I learnt a lot about human nature and the interaction between various members of company boards. I did not act on any of the inside information - except to steer clear of investing in any of the companies about which I heard believable 'horror' tales. But it impressed upon me the importance of a company's board. Before investing in a company, I always try to find out something about its directors. Bitter experience has shown that following the 'great and the good' is no way to investment success. Just because there is a lord on the board does not necessarily mean the company will do well. Perhaps the 'names' are there as window dressing to distract attention from some of the things going on behind the scenes - or to impress gullible bankers into granting the company yet more loans. The same is true for boards stuffed with accountants: their companies may well produce a lacklustre performance, and some have even gone into receivership. I am a regular reader of the 'People' column in the FT. It surprises me how easy it appears to be for some finance directors of poorly-performing companies to move to similar positions elsewhere. But managing directors of ailing companies rarely seem to do this - they seem to be saddled with the entire blame for their company's performance. Yet, surely the finance directors are partly to blame, too? Sometimes, these moves can be a signal to buy or sell shares. If the finance director is bailing out, does this indicate that a company's financial situation might deteriorate still further? Or will it be refreshed by new blood? What influence might such a finance director have on his new employer? Should the shares be treated with more caution? There are times when the appointment of new directors can point to an otherwise unexpected direction for the company. Perhaps the director has been recruited with expertise in a specific area of activity in which the company is not yet involved. Is this a prelude to the company making a takeover bid in that area? If so, it might be worth investigating possible bid targets to assess their investment potential. What is the track record of the director being appointed? Is he likely to improve the performance of the company - or is he there mainly to make it more likely that the company's remuneration committee approves a huge salary for the chief executive? I am against non-executive chairmen receiving large salaries, particularly if they have various other commitments and devote only one or two days a month to the company. One unjustifiably large salary invariably leads to other people being overpaid. Before investing in the company, I also look at its annual report to see how many of the directors have shares in it. I like to see even the non-executives having a modest holding, especially if these are shares which were acquired on similar terms to ordinary shareholders and not as a result of over-generous option schemes. Share dealings by directors also interest me. I am particularly concerned when they sell large parts of their holdings in a company: do they fear it is about to hit hard times? Share purchases by directors are more problematical. Sometimes, these deals will have had a lot of publicity and people may be led to believe the company concerned has good prospects. But perhaps the director concerned had sold a lot of his shares earlier at a hefty profit and is just buying some back at a lower price. The BRI Director Dealings unit trust, launched on October 1, specialises in monitoring share dealings by directors of public companies. Most firms of stockbrokers and other financial advisers have details of this trust, which is being marketed mainly via financial intermediarites. Its list of major shareholdings could eventually become a very useful check on companies in which directors have affirmed their faith by backing them with their own money.</p>

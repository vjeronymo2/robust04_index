			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: On the ball Is there method in the madness of Michael Knighton's switch from the board of lofty football club Manchester United to ownership of lowly Carlisle United? The move might seem senseless given that besides being a tail-ender in the Football League's division IV, or division III as it will be known next season, Carlisle loses over Pounds 3,000 a week. But it is to become the model for another Knighton venture, a sports consultancy called Centre Forward. He will be joint managing director of the consultancy with Simon Pitt, who has produced two very gloomy reports about the financial state of football. Indeed the latest survey - entitled The Bankrupting of English Football, and putting the 92 clubs' combined debt at Pounds 150m - will be Centre Forward's 'headline' publication. Knighton, who made his money in property in the 1980s, paid Pounds 1m for Carlisle United. It evidently has an interesting location. There's also some evidence that he has a nose for a football bargain. He came close to buying Manchester United for Pounds 20m three years ago. Its flotation price last year valued it at nearly Pounds 47m and reaped about Pounds 6m for Martin Edwards, the biggest shareholder, whom Knighton nearly bought out. Even at United's more recent market value of Pounds 34m, the increase is a tidy one.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: BP quits polyethylene foam market with Spanish sale BRITISH Petroleum Chemicals completed its exit from polyethylene foams with the sale of its Spanish operations to Huels Troisdorf, the German group. BP Chemicals did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The business employs about 60 people in a plant at Alcala de Henares which mainly supplies the automotive and toy industries. BP Espana said the operations represented only a small proportion of its Pta4.6bn (Dollars 43m) turnover last year. The deal is subject to approval by the Spanish authorities. The move follows the sale last month of BP Chemicals' UK foams operations in Croydon, south London, to Zotefoams, a management buy-out. The deal, arranged by 3i, was worth more than Pounds 20m (Dollars 33.14m). The disposals are part of BP Chemicals' strategy of focusing on areas of competitive strength. Huels, a specialist in heat-resistant low-pressure polyethylene foams, plans to invest DM344m on a capital investment programme. Last month, the UK Department of Trade and Industry cleared the sale of BP Chemicals' 120,000-tonne-a-year low-density polyethylene unit in Antwerp to Neste of Finland. It also sold its polyethylene film business at Bromborough.</p>

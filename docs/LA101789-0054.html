			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY NURSES ACCEPT PACT THAT NEARS GOAL OF 'PARITY'  </P> <P> Los Angeles County nurses late Monday approved by a 3 to 2 margin a tentative  contract that includes a 17.25% pay raise over two years -- and a promise by  county officials to study increased security at hospitals.  </P> <P> "It's going to move the nurses working for the county health care network  closer to parity with the private sector," said Steve Weingarten, a spokesman  for Local 660 of Service Employees International Union, which represents the  nurses. "The nurses have agreed that this is a competitive package."  </P> <P> The nurses, who staff six county-run hospitals and 47 neighborhood clinics, had  been seeking a 22% increase over two years.  </P> <P> The proposed agreement must still be ratified by the county Board of  Supervisors. After results of the voting were announced, Supervisor Deane Dana  said he was confident the board would approve the contract.  </P> <P> "It's wonderful news," he said of the vote. "I congratulate the county staff  and the nurses for pulling it together."  </P> <P> The county promised to study proposed new security measures, such as trams, to  take nurses to and from parking lots. In addition, the county will study  installing a barrier to separate the emergency room from public waiting areas  at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center in Watts. The hospital was  singled out for increased security because of gang shootings in the  neighborhood, a county official said.  </P> <P> County nurses, who currently earn between $2,600 and $3,000 a month, claimed  they make less money than nurses working at private hospitals. The tentative  contract will increase nurses' top salary to $3,337 by July 1, 1991, Weingarten  said. A 10.5% raise will be retroactive to Oct. 1, followed by 1% increase on  July 1, 1990, 3% on Oct. 1, 1990, and 2.75% on July 1, 1991, he said.  </P> <P> The agreement was reached Wednesday, just five hours before the county's 5,126  nurses were set to strike, and after Board of Supervisors Chairman Ed Edelman  summoned both sides to his office in an 11th-hour effort to prevent a strike.  </P> <P> The nurses voted on the new contract throughout the day Monday at 18 locations  in the county. Only about half of the nurses are union members, although almost  all will be affected by the new contract.  </P> <P> County officials maintained during negotiations that in the event of a strike,  they were prepared to seek a court order, as they did in 1988, directing the  nurses to return to work.  </P></p>

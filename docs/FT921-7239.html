			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Arts: 1953 - Glasgow Citizens The Glasgow Citizens Theatre has just put its own house into new order. Where there was only one theatre, now there are two more. What was the downstairs bar is now the third theatre (seats 70); and an upstairs chamber is now the second (seats 130). And yet the building is far from cramped. Audiences from separate shows mingle beforehand or in the intervals without crush. The first three plays to run simutaneously at this 'new Citz' add up as a bravura gesture of eclecticism: Alonso Alegra's Niagara (directed and translated by Robert David MacDonald); Craig Raine's 1953 (a version of Racine's Andromaque, directed and designed by Philip Powse); and PG Wodehouse's Summer Lightning (adapted and directed by Giles Havergal). I shall write later this week on Theatres One and Three; here I talk of the Raine. Everyone agrees that Racine is the most untranslatable of playwrights; and yet in recent years we have seen several new translations of him performed on British stages, and, even more remarkably, many leading poets in our century have rushed to render him into the English language. Robert Lowell's Phaedra is especially famous or, you may say, notorious. And between 1980 and 1990 three of the most celebrated living poets set their highly dissimilar hands at Andromaque: Richard Wilbur, Douglas Dunn and Craig Raine. Please note, too, that Dunn's and Raine's were, like John Cairncross's 1966 version (now in Penguin Classics), each first presented by BBC Radio. Raine's was heard there in April 1990; it is said that it was first planned as the text for Jonathan Miller's 1988 Old Vic production. But, as its title shows, Raine's is no straight translation. The title tells you that 1953 transposes the Greek and Trojan characters of the classical mythology that Racine's audience knew so well into the modern era, and in this Raine follows the example of Tony Harrison, who put Phedre into British India as Phaedra Britannica. Racine's Trojans and Greeks are Raine's British and Germans. Raine's 1953, however, is not the actual historical past but the era that might have been. The Fuhrer still rules; the British Empire is extinct; the night when London fell to the Germans is still famous; and, by the by, Churchill had already died - in his own sick, after a night of heavy drinking with Brendan Bracken. The setting is Italy. Il Duce's son, Vittorio Mussolini, rules. Annette Le Skye (Andromache) is in prison garb with yellow star. The Germans want her son Angus - half Bowes-Lyon, half-Jewish - to be packed on the train to Germany. Vittorio (Pyrrhus) is in love with Annette, but engaged and politically bound to the Princess Ira, a loyal German of Hohenzollern blood (Hermione) who has been his devout mistress for some time. Her cousin, Klaus Maria von Orestes, sent to Italy to demand little Angus, is mainly obsessed by his own futile and self-punishing passion for her. Various forms of emotional masochism rule each of these upper-class characters. The sick soul of Europe, which so many film-makers and writers have returned to with horrid nostalgia, here becomes astoundingly real. For the rational and classical austerity of language which Racine's characters deploy with such violent eloquence, Raine has substituted the literate and urbane style of modern English high-class parlance, often ironic and sometimes effete. Where Racine's characters plunge straight into analysing their emotions, Raine's often take an oblique line. Raine's use of this language is virtuoso. That these characters are hypersophisticated eventually only heightens their intensity. (Klaus to Ira: 'Underneath this mask there are third-degree burns, like a Kokoschka oil . . . You used me like a tablenapkin, not a lover.') The bitter wit, the emotional abuse find striking modern equivalents. The basic metre is iambic. The Citizens' Second Theatre is a small chamber with the audience banked on four sides of the action. Philip Prowse's designs are chillingly elegant. The most daring stroke in his casting of this already politically loaded play is to give Annette LeSkye to the black actress Julie Saunders (as with Josette Simon in his recent White Devil at the National). The stiff-upper-lip nobility of Saunders's playing justifies his decision. She performs with a beautiful calm that goes beyond emotion; she is the same paragon through every volte-face or gear change. Julie Blalock and Greg Hicks are uncannily perfect as Ira and Orest, victims of their own elegance. As young Mussolini, Patrick O'Kane has a wonderful blend of fire, cruelty, narcissism and pantherine softness. 1953 holds its audience riveted on every level. Concept, dramaturgy, designs, language, utterance and movement are all on a high, high level.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 29 (XINHUA)--Zhejiang Province in  east China has offered a number infrastructure projects for  investment by foreign investors this year, according to a  provincial official said today [as received].    These projects, he said, ranges from energy, communications,  telecommunications, agriculture, water conservancy and raw  materials, which need several dozen billion U.S. dollars.    These include the expressway from Shanghai to Hangzhou to  Ningbo, an airport, an ore pier and two power stations. The  smallest needs [are] some one million U.S. dollars while the  largest requires over five billion U.S. dollars.    According to the official, half of the foreign investment  projects above 10 million U.S. dollars approved last years were  in infrastructure and basic industries.    As one of the bold policies, Zhejiang Province is expected  to  allow joint operation between the Chinese and foreign partners.  Joint stock companies will be established for those large  projects in communications, power and raw material industries so  that the enterprises can start from raising investment,  construction and operation.</p>

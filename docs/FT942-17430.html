			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Savings at BBC likely to more than double The BBC is expected to achieve more than double its planned savings of Pounds 50m this year, and the money will go mainly towards new programmes and services. Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said last September that the corporation would save Pounds 100m in the 1993-94 financial year, Pounds 50m in the current year and Pounds 25m in 1995-96. In the current year the BBC expects to achieve a gross Pounds 125m instead of Pounds 50m. The savings come from sources ranging from continuing cuts in the size of the central bureaucracy to Producer Choice, the controversial system which makes programme producers responsible for their budgets and gives them the right to buy services outside the BBC. The corporation has also been helped by a campaign against licence-fee evasion, growth in the number of households and indexation of the licence fee to inflation. After funding more than Pounds 30m needed to launch and run Radio Five Live, the news and sports network, and after removing a deficit of Pounds 18m planned for the resources department, the BBC will have an extra Pounds 80m available. The scale of the savings coming through, which will be seen as a vindication of the cost-cutting policies of Mr Birt, last month enabled Mr Alan Yentob, the BBC 1 controller, to expand his programme plans. Mr Yentob announced that there would be an extra 110 hours of new programmes between June and August this year to counter complaints about the high proportion of repeats shown last summer. EastEnders will move to three nights a week in line with its main ITV rival, Coronation Street. The news that savings will be greater than expected comes as the government completes its white paper on the future of the corporation. The white paper will preserve the existing structure of the BBC and the licence-fee system that funds it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Army has confirmed that Cameroon has again  mounted an aggression on Nigeria on the Bakassi Peninsula. A  statement by the director of army public relations said that  while Nigeria had resorted to diplomatic, political, and  judicial means to resolve the dispute over the peninsula,  Cameroon had consistently displayed arrogant repression. This,  it said, had resulted in the death of two Nigerian soldiers  recently.    The statement stressed that despite the provocations,  Nigerian troops had remained calm, as war is not the only means  of resolving disputes. While Nigeria continues to pursue a  peaceful approach, it said that Nigerian troops will continue to  keep to orders to protect the lives and property of Nigerians  residing in the disputed area.</p>

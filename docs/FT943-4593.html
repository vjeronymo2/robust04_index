			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Banham sets out Shropshire split Telford should be given an all-purpose unitary authority, and the other five district councils in Shropshire should be merged to form one large authority, the Local Government Commission recommended yesterday. It said this was the only alternative to the current two-tier position, which splits responsibility for services between Shropshire County Council and six district councils. Local people will be consulted about the options over the next two months. The commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, estimated that creating the two unitaries would cost between Pounds 13m and Pounds 16m, but would eventually save Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m annually. Under the plan, Wrekin district, dominated by the new town of Telford, would split away from the rest of the county, which would be labelled 'Shropshire'. The commission will also consult on extending Wrekin to the south to take in seven parishes from Bridgnorth district. This option provoked fierce opposition from local politicians, because the county and four of the districts had all supported leaving the two-tier system intact. Many had expected the commission to recommend making Telford unitary and maintaining the status quo in the rest of the county. The cross-party Association of District Councils welcomed the proposals for Wrekin. However, it said a single authority for the rest of Shropshire would be too remote to represent the views of local people properly. The district councils of Bridgnorth, Oswestry and North and South Shropshire all said they would prefer the two-tier status quo to this option, although Shrewsbury &amp; Atcham favoured unitaries. The Labour-led Association of County Councils said residents had been given a 'fair choice' between a unitary option and keeping the status quo. It said 'questions must be asked about the viability of a unitary authority based on the Wrekin', because the new organisation would be too small.</p>

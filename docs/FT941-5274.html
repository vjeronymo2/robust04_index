			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Fear of heights grips HK property market: Investor concern but no apparent let-up in fast-rising prices Ever since Mr Robert Ng, the youthful chairman of Sino Land, a Hong Kong property developer, paid HKDollars 4.4bn for two pieces of land for residential development in the New Territories last week, market observers have had the feeling they had seen it all before. In September and October 1987 Mr Ng was one of the biggest players on the colony's futures exchange. It seemed he had the Midas touch. Black Monday came and Mr Ng - and many others - was all but wiped out. Mr Ng has returned to ride Hong Kong's bull market in residential and commercial property. At the luxury end of the residential market, prices have risen 350 per cent since 1989; for commercial property, values have increased by 150 per cent over the same period. Sino Land's purchase of the two sites at prices 20 to 30 per cent above expectations suggests to some that Hong Kong's property market is becoming overheated. 'The higher the prices paid the more you have to think of risk,' said Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby Securities, a local Hong Kong brokerage. 'The Sino deal makes sense if you think interest rates will continue to remain low, income growth will remain strong and there will be no crises. In a perfect world it looks like a clever deal, but is the world perfect?' Since the US Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates last month Hong Kong's stock market has been trading uneasily in anticipation of a rise in Hong Kong interest rates. Analysts believe it is only a matter of time before Hong Kong's interest rates follow those in the US because the colony's currency is tied to the dollar. Such fears have already taken their toll on share prices; the Hang Seng Index, having touched 12,000 earlier this year is now hovering around 10,000. Last month, Hong Kong had the worst performing stock market of the 22 large markets surveyed by Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment firm. Since the beginning of the year the Hang Seng Index has fallen by 15.4 per cent. Investors have been particularly savage in marking down property and bank shares. Since the beginning of the year the property sub-index of the Hang Seng Index has fallen by 17 per cent; and the finance sub-index has fallen 15 per cent. The weakness in property shares has been enough to cause companies to postpone planned capital issues. Great Eagle, one of Hong Kong's leading property stocks, has postponed a Dollars HK3bn (Pounds 274m) flotation of a subsidiary. The underwriters doubted whether there would be sufficient interest in the deal. Investors have not been the only ones to be concerned about banks' exposure to the property market. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA), the colony's quasi-central bank, which has been tracking banks' exposure to the property market for more than two years, is also concerned. Recent data show that by the end of last year property lending by Hong Kong banks accounted for nearly 38 per cent of bank loans made for use in the colony. Overall, lending for property rose by 19.4 per cent; within that total, lending for residential mortgages was up 15 per cent, while lending for property development and investment was up nearly 26 per cent. Two weeks ago Mr David Carse, deputy chief executive of the HKMA, wrote to the Hong Kong Association of Banks calling on its members to review their exposure to the property market and ensure that it is being contained within prudent limits. Mr Carse said that banks should try to restrain the growth of their lending for house purchases to around 15 per cent a year - the pace at which Hong Kong's nominal gross domestic product is growing. In general, he said, banks should aim to keep their total exposure to the property market at around 40 per cent of their loans in Hong Kong. Those whose lending exceeds 40 per cent 'should consider how that percentage can be stabilised and if necessary reduced'. Mr Carse said his letter was intended as general guidance for banks. A large part of bank lending goes to property 'and it keeps going up and up', he said. But he added: 'I am not worried about a collapse in the property market; it is still underpinned by strong demand.' This view was echoed by Mr Paul Selway-Swift, general manager for Hong Kong and China with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He said the bank was comfortable with its exposure to residential and commercial property. But he was less certain about prices being paid for development land. 'Only time will tell if recent prices paid for land prove to be reasonable or far too high,' he said. The supply and demand outlook for residential property suggests that prices are likely to remain under upward pressure. Hong Kong's developers released on to the market 27,670 flats last year, 10 per cent fewer than forecast and well below the average of 33,000 that was typical in the latter half of the 1980s. The end-of-year vacancy rate for residential property had declined to 3.9 per cent from 4.2 per cent in 1992, suggesting that Hong Kong entered 1994 with a tight market. Relief for Hong Kong's home buyer, however, seems some way off with the forecast completion of 33,000 flats this year and 31,800 in 1995. Mr Hart of Crosby said it was difficult to judge accurately at what point in the residential property cycle Hong Kong currently was. 'I believe we are nearer to the top of the cycle than the bottom.'</p>

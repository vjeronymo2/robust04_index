			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow restrained by economic concerns Wall Street US STOCK markets settled down yesterday after Thursday's big declines, but continued worries about inflation and the economy meant prices ended largely unchanged, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 4.98 at 3,443.81. The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 ended 0.32 higher at 439.55, while the Amex composite finished down 0.45at 427.46, and the Nasdaq composite 0.73 firmer at 676.37. Volume on the NYSE was 252m shares. Prices opened flat as the markets digested the latest economic news - a 0.1 per cent increase in April industrial production. The rise was slightly below expectations, and fuelled fears that the economy is not growing fast enough to provide momentum for corporate earnings. Investors were also still considering the implications of this week's bad inflation news. Their greatest concern was that rising inflation might force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates, a move that could make already expensive equities look even less attractive. Equities were supported, however, by a stabilisation in bond prices, which held their ground yesterday after two days of big declines. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was up  5/32 at 102 9/32 , and the yield was at 6.939 per cent. Among individual stocks, banks, which fell sharply on Thursday, were again weak on fears of higher interest rates. Citicorp fell Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 , Chemical gave up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 36 5/8 , Banc One eased Dollars 1 to Dollars 51 1/2 , Chase Manhattan dropped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 29, Wells Fargo slipped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 101 3/4 and Nationsbank fell Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 , all in heavy trading. Some leading Dow stocks, however, more than held their own. AT&amp;T firmed Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 7/8 , Coca-Cola rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 39 7/8 , Boeing put on Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39 7/8 and Allied Signal rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 64 1/8 . Drug stocks were higher as a group, with Merck putting on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 37 1/4 , Pfizer adding Dollars 1 at Dollars 69 3/4 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars 59 3/8 and Johnson&amp;Johnson rising Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 . General Motors fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/4 in volume of 1.5m shares on the news that unfunded pension liability may increase by about Dollars 5bn at year end, required a non-cash charge of Dollars 1.8bn. The most heavily traded stock of the day by far was Royal Dutch Petroleum, which fell Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 90 3/4 in volume of 33m shares after the stock went ex-dividend. The company declared a final dividend for 1992 of Dollars 2.68 a share. Canada GAINS IN media and banking shares offset profit-taking in bullion shares and pushed Toronto stocks higher at the close, dealers said. Gold shares, which enjoyed a sharp rally earlier this week, suffered profit-taking as gold prices finished lower. The TSE-300 index rose 11.99 points or 0.32 per cent, to 3,813.33. Volume ended at 66.1m shares valued at CDollars 532.2m.</p>

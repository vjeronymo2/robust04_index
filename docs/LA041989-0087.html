			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANIMAL MUTILATIONS UNDER INVESTIGATION  </P> <P> Police in Covina are investigating the recent mutilation deaths of animals that  may be the work of devil-worshipers.  </P> <P> "Frankly, we were surprised by this. It's all new to us, " Sgt. Chuck Rosales  said. "We are a quiet, bedroom community."  </P> <P> The first complaints of mutilated carcasses, accompanied by Satan-related  graffiti, were received about seven weeks ago, Rosales said. Since then, about  a dozen animals -- cats and rabbits -- have been found with eyes gouged out,  legs cut off, and hearts and other organs removed. One cat was found crucified  upside down under symbols written with the cat's blood.  </P> <P> The animals -- none of whom appeared to be pets -- have been found at an  abandoned elementary school on Cienega Avenue and near a storm drain in Wingate  Park, in the 800 block of North Glendora Avenue, police said.  </P> <P> Pentagrams -- five-sided stars associated with devil worship -- and the number  "666" -- used by devil worshipers to connote the Antichrist -- have been found  near the carcasses, either burned into the ground or scrawled on walls.  </P> <P> Police have questioned three high school students who admitted to being devil  worshipers, but said they are not responsible for the mutilations, Rosales  said.  </P> <P> "It does seem to be centered around teen-agers," the sergeant said.  </P></p>

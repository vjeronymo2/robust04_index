			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARSONS SEEKING TO CONTACT KUWAITI EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> From offices in Saudi Arabia, Washington and Pasadena, Parsons Corp. has won  engineering contracts worth billions of dollars from governments in the  Mideast. Now, as the risk of doing business there has become painfully  apparent, the company is engaged in a frustrating bid to monitor the safety of  its employees trapped in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and to gain their release.  </P> <P> Parsons, like other U.S. firms with Kuwaiti operations, is finding that it can  do little. Still, it tries mightily to do something -- and to keep families  informed.  </P> <P> The Pasadena-based engineering and construction firm has about 100 employees in  the oil-rich emirate at the head of the Persian Gulf. About half are Kuwaiti  nationals and the rest are Europeans and North Americans. There are 12 U.S.  citizens, along with their eight dependents.  </P> <P> The effort to reach Parsons' employees in Kuwait began immediately after Iraq's  Aug. 2 invasion.  </P> <P> On the day of the invasion, the State Department accounted for all Parsons  employees, declaring them in no immediate danger. Parsons business offices  elsewhere in the Middle East corroborated the State Department report after  talking with some employees by telephone.  </P> <P> A day later, Parsons President Ray W. Judson said the company "will do  everything we can to assist our employees in leaving the country of Kuwait  safely."  </P> <P> However, Parsons, which has had operations in Kuwait for 30 years, has been  unable to make direct contact with its employees since Aug. 2.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, the Iraqi government ordered Kuwaiti-based citizens of Western  countries opposing Iraq militarily to report to authorities at three hotels in  Kuwait. An estimated 2,500 Americans are in Kuwait, most of them employees of  private companies and their dependents. Most are believed to have ignored the  demand.  </P> <P> However, some Americans and other Westerners have reportedly been detained and  taken to strategic civil and military sites as human shields against possible  U.S. attacks.  </P> <P> "This heightens our concern for our people (in Kuwait)," said Parsons  spokeswoman Debra Williams. "At this point, any communication is critical,  because we've not heard from our people (since Aug. 2). Now that the situation  is deteriorating, there is even more concern."  </P> <P> Communications have been hampered because telephone lines in Kuwait have been  damaged, destroyed or overloaded.  </P> <P> Parsons, one of about 60 U.S. firms with operations in Kuwait, was designing  and supervising construction of highway systems there. Some employees had  helped with construction of an oil-fired power plant and were designing a  waste-water treatment facility.  </P> <P> If Parsons contacts any staff in Kuwait, the firm will seek information on the  condition and location of other employees and dependents. However, Parsons  isn't likely to have much useful advice; Iraqis have closed Kuwait's airports  and are not allowing Americans to leave the country.  </P> <P> "We're relying on the State Department and the government to look out for the  well-being of employees," Williams said. "We'll do anything to help, but the  opportunity has to be there -- and it's just not there."  </P> <P> Williams said the State Department has supplied periodic reports on the status  of employees -- informing the company last week, for example, that some  individuals were known to be unharmed.  </P> <P> The State Department is using the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and sources in the  region to maintain contact with corporate employees there, said department  spokesman David Good.  </P> <P> This week, Iraq has tightened its grip on foreigners -- on Monday ordering  embassies in Kuwait to close by Friday or run the risk that diplomats will be  treated as "ordinary foreign nationals," making them liable to be rounded up.  The U.S. Embassy plans to ignore the Iraqi demand and continue efforts to  maintain contacts with American citizens, Good said.  </P> <P> Good said the State Department is advising U.S. citizens in Kuwait not to  report to Iraqi authorities at designated hotels "because their position  afterwards would be uncertain." He also said the State Department is urging  employees of U.S. firms in Kuwait to "remain at their homes," to stay away from  their corporate offices and to "keep a low profile."  </P></p>

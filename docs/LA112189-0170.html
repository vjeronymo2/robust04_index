			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YANKEES SIGN FREE AGENT PITCHER PEREZ;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: RIGHT-HANDER WHO HAS BEEN BATTLING A COCAINE PROBLEM WILL REPORTEDLY  RECEIVE $5.1 MILLION.  </P> <P> The New York Yankees, eager to improve their ineffective pitching staff, signed  free agent right-hander Pascual Perez to a three-year guaranteed contract  today.  </P> <P> The Yankees did not release financial terms of the deal, but Perez reportedly  will receive $5.1 million. The average of $1.7 million per year is double the  $850,000 Perez earned in 1989.  </P> <P> Perez, 32, was 9-13 with a 3.31 ERA in 33 games this year for the Montreal  Expos. In 198 1/3 innings, he walked only 45 while striking out 152.  </P> <P> He has a lifetime record of 64-62 with a 3.48 ERA in six-plus seasons in the  major leagues.  </P> <P> Perez was originally signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Pirates before  the 1976 season. After pitching in the Pirates system, he was traded to the  Atlanta Braves in 1982 before signing a minor league contract with the Expos  before the 1987 season.  </P> <P> Perez has had serious problems off the field.  </P> <P> He spent most of spring training this year in a drug-rehab center in Florida,  trying to kick a cocaine habit.  </P> <P> At the time, he reportedly had tried twice before to voluntarily complete a  rehab program. But the third time, which he spent at the Palm Beach Institute,  came at the request of the Expos and the baseball commissioner's office.  </P> <P> "In getting Pascual, we are getting a quality pitcher," said George Bradley,  the Yankees vice president of player personnel and development. "He will be one  of our top starters.  </P> <P> "We are very aware of his past problems. However, he has been involved in a  program with the Expos which has kept him clean, and we will help him to remain  with that program."  </P></p>

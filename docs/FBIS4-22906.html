Alekseyeva, Microbiology and  Virology Institute at the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences, Kiev;  UDC 579.22:577.113.6]    [Abstract] It is reported that low concentrations of  6-azacytidine (6-AC)--a synthetic analog of cytidine produced at  the Molecular Biology and Genetic Institute at the Ukrainian  Academy of Sciences--suppresses DNA-genome virus (particularly  adenovirus) reproduction and in contrast to 5-AC, is not very  toxic and is not a carcinogen; moreover, it displays anticancer  activity. It is also noted that there are no published data on  the antimicrobial action of 6-AC but only indirect observations  attesting to such activity. To bridge this gap, data on the  effect of 6-AC on the functioning of various mollicutes and the  probable molecular mechanism of this effect are investigated. In  so doing, Acholeplasma laidlawi PG-8 mollicutes from  the family of Acholeplasmataceae and two other  species--the Mycoplasma pneumoniae FH and  Mycoplasma fermentans PG-18--from the family of  Mycoplasmataceae were examined. All strains were  obtained from Dr. Freundt (Denmark). The mollicutes were grown  in the SM IMV-72 medium. The study demonstrates the inhibitory  effect of 6-AC on mollicutes in various systematic positions;  standard mollicute strains ceased growing completely in a  nutrient medium at a 6-AC concentration of 125-250 g/ml.  Different levels of inhibition at other 6-AC concentrations for  various strains are summarized. Translation of mollicutes on  ribosomes in vitro ceased completely at a 100 g/ml  6-AC concentration, attesting that there may be two targets for  6-AC in the mollicute cells and possibly other  microorganisms--ribosomes and DNA-dependent DNA-polymerase. In  the end, the blockage of translation and replication processes  by 6-AC leads to the death of mollicutes, but since 6-AC has no  mutagenic, carcinogenic, or cell differentiation-inducing effect  on human cells, it may be used as an efficient means of treating  respiratory (atypical pneumonia) and urogenital diseases induced  by mollicutes; with respect to the role of mycoplasma in the  development of AIDS, 6-AC may be used as a preventive measure,  provided that proper drugs are developed and clinically tested.  It is speculated that the mechanism of 6-AC effect on the  mollicute growth is related to direct interference in the  replication of genome DNA and blocking of the ribosome function.

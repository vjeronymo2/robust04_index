			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Earnings rise continues: Reasons for the upward surge in wages - Average pay increases 7.5% THE upward 'blip' in UK average earnings, announced yesterday, can be explained by various special factors but still puts into sobering perspective the controversy over a 5.4 per cent pay offer to Germany's public-sector workers. Germany, of course, is paying for reunification. But the figures make clear that Britain can afford no complacency over its pay-setting arrangements. In spite of a sharp reduction in inflation and the new discipline that ERM membership is supposed to impose on the manufacturing sector, UK manufacturing earnings are rising faster than all but three OECD countries: Portugal, Greece and Italy. According to the government's own figures, UK manufacturing earnings in March were rising at an underlying rate of 8.25 per cent. The latest available figures for other large countries include 6.6 per cent in Germany, 4.3 per cent in France, 2.7 per cent in the US and 1.7 per cent in Japan. The underlying rate of increase in average earnings for the economy as a whole was 7.5 per cent in March, more than 3 percentage points above inflation. That is the same rate as February after an upward revision of that month from 7.25 per cent to 7.5 per cent. That figure disguises a jump of more than 10 per cent in earnings in many sectors between February and March. There are two main reasons for that. One is that many companies paid bonuses in March, earlier than usual, to save their better-paid employees from the effects of a possible Labour government's tax increases. The other is that some workers will have received two pay rises in the 12 months to March. In March last year, when inflation was 8.24 per cent but heading down quite rapidly, employers were trying to postpone pay settlements. This year inflation is relatively stable, and is even expected to rise slightly, so employers have been settling promptly. Apart from those 'special factors', it should be remembered that average earnings represent pay increases over a 12-month period, so the current figure still includes pay rises from the middle of last year when inflation was considerably higher. Nevertheless, employers and the government have been expecting average earnings to fall significantly, along with inflation, for nearly a year, without any luck. Average earnings were rising at a rate of 7.75 per cent in July last year, only 0.25 per cent above the March figure. Even more worrying, there are signs that pay settlements - which have been falling more rapidly - may be hitting a floor between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Settlements are usually a percentage point or 2 below earnings increases because they exclude bonuses and overtime pay. The Confederation of British Industry is still reporting pay freezes for companies in special difficulty. The CBI, however, said settlements in manufacturing in the first quarter of this year rose from 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Some pay analysts are speculating that average earnings may not fall below 7 per cent at all, in the present cycle, if the recovery does pick up in the next few weeks. That would mean an increase in overtime and other bonuses. This view is probably too pessimistic and the recent low settlements from the banking sector suggest there is still downward pressure on pay. Even so, the latest 'blip' certainly serves to highlight the fact that Britain still has a pay difficulty both in the public sector - where settlements are running at about the German level of 5.4 per cent - and in the private sector.</p>

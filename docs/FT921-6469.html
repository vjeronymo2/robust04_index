			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Rival to BT and Mercury seeks licence NATIONAL NETWORK, the private UK telecommunications operator, has applied for a full international and domestic telecommunications licence in competition with BT and Mercury Communications. The group, which offers a telephone service over the Post Office's internal network, is one of about 20 companies which have lodged licence applications with the Department of Trade and Industry following last year's white paper liberalising the market. The variety of services the applicants propose to provide seems to support the government's contention that its policy has unleashed innovation. Apart from National Network and a similar application from Sprint, the US group, applicants are avoiding a head-on clash with BT and Mercury and focusing on niche markets instead. Mr Michael Davies, National Network's chairman and majority shareholder, said the DTI was in 'a very advanced stage of drafting' his company's domestic licence. The application for an international licence is likely to be more controversial, as the government has made clear that it is not encouraging full international network competition with BT and Mercury at this stage. Similar considerations are holding up Sprint's international licence application. Mr Davies said National Network planned to form strategic alliances with other groups to raise funds to build a network. Initially it would concentrate on business customers, linking their premises to a backbone national network with microwave or other radio links. The government has recently awarded licences to British Aerospace Communications and US-based Alpha Lyracom to provide international satellite services; to Ionica, a private UK group, to provide residential phone services over radio links; and to four groups to supply data communications services by radio. Other companies which have applied for licences include Millicom, World Communications and ACC, all of which are north American groups.</p>

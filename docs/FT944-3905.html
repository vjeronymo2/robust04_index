			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Who is to judge?: A bargain with public opinion means Myra Hindley should never be freed Myra Hindley should not be released. That is easy to say, but, for some of us, painful to contemplate. She was 23 when, along with Ian Brady, then 28, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of 17-year-old Edward Evans and 10-year-old Leslie Anne Downey. In 1987 she confessed that two other children had been killed. Now in her fifties, she has spent 28 years in prison. Her accomplice has asked not to be let loose but she has repeatedly applied for a line to be drawn under her sentence, most recently in a TV programme this week. She has paid her debt to society, she argues; she has changed, say those who advocate parole; there is a time for redemption, says the good Christian conscience. In 1966, it is protested, she was young, and under the thrall of her lover. She was forced to participate in sadistic acts. This excuse is disputed, but we need not seek to establish its truth. For none of the above arguments, overrides the social imperative that must determine the case. This is simply put. Justice and mercy come second. Sometimes a government must bow to a popular desire for revenge. If that awful proposition is ever true, it is true in this case. The details of the four killings need no repetition here; all who have heard of the Moors murders will know how vile were their perpetrators. The public memory of what happened is enduring. The torture of children cannot be forgiven. It is perhaps fanciful to say that if Myra Hindley was freed her own life would be in danger. It might be possible for her to change her name, and her appearance, and seek the safety of obscurity. Yet she could be no more genuinely free outside Cookham Wood prison in Kent than she is within its walls. Those of us whose attitude to penal reform is liberal cannot escape this reasoning. If you oppose the death penalty, as we do-gooders do, you cannot shirk the fact that a majority of the electorate would support it. In Britain, but not the US, that biblical form of retribution is quite properly resisted by the majority of our elected politicians. We must be thankful for that. But there is a price, an implicit bargain with public opinion. If the House of Commons is to maintain its civilised stance, brutal killers must be given particularly long sentences, including, in the worst cases, detention for the rest of the murderer's natural life. In this matter, although in few others, my view is in accordance with that of Mr Michael Howard. Following a recent ruling in the House of Lords, the home secretary is obliged to tell lifers just how much time they are likely to serve. It is suggested that about a score of the most notorious murderers, including the Moors killers, will be informed that they will never be released. Others may have to endure more years in jail under Mr Howard's rules than under those of his predecessors. The implications of this harsh regime must be faced, particularly by those of us who reject the home secretary's contention that 'prison works'. To deny anyone freedom is to deny him or her one of the principal attributes of life. Most British jails are not the cushy hotels depicted in tabloid newspapers. Many are overcrowded, grim, austere. They are, in the words of an earlier home secretary, universities of crime. The inmates may not be stealing car radios or burgling homes while locked up but many of them more than make up for lost opportunities once they are back in general circulation. Prison does work, but perversely. Britain has a higher proportion of its population in jails than any other country in the European Union save Luxembourg. This has not reduced crime, nor made people feel safe. That is why a succession of Conservative home secretaries focused more on prevention than on get-tough measures. The balance of the rhetoric of the present incumbent is the other way. Mr Howard's record at the home office would long ago have had him slung out of any cabinet save one so divided and desperate as his own. It is possible that when he announces his decisions on lifers, he may be challenged in the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. He probably should be. To say that those who commit particularly ghastly murders should be given 'life means life' sentences is not to accept that the power of incarceration should be in the hands of a minister. Sentencing is properly the job of the courts, not elected politicians. At present there are two types of lifer. 'Discretionary' life sentences may be imposed for crimes such as rape, or manslaughter. Judges decide the term. In cases of murder, life sentences are 'mandatory,' which means that the home secretary can determine the length of incarceration. Various advisory committees, including the parliamentary all-party penal affairs group and a select committee of the House of Lords, have suggested that all life sentences be discretionary. This might not have made any difference in the Hindley-Brady case. Most judges are as politically aware as any minister. The power to impose full-life sentences would certainly be exercised in the worst cases. These, fortunately, are rare. Against that there are types of murder, including, perhaps, crimes of passion, for which a compulsory life sentence is inappropriate. Finally, we face children who kill children. The recent decision by Mr Howard to increase the length of detention of the murderers of James Bulger from the judge's eight years to 15 is questionable. Mary Bell, convicted at age 11 of the manslaughter of two boys aged three and four, spent 11 years in detention and now, aged 36, lives under an assumed name. You may challenge me to say which outcome I support - the 11 years imposed in the earlier case or the minimum of 15 years imposed now. I cannot; perhaps only a judge can.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Empowerment Zones program confers upon rural distressed American communities the opportunity to take effective action to create jobs and opportunities. The program combines tax benefits with substantial investment of Federal resources and enhanced coordination among Federal agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communities which complete the nomination process will be strengthened by it; gaining by taking stock of their assets and problems, by creating a vision of a better future, and by structuring a plan for achieving their vision. Local partnerships among community residents, businesses, financial institutions, service providers, neighborhood associations and State and local governments will be formed or strengthened by going through the application process. Communities will be afforded an opportunity to work with these partners in the creation and implementation of a community-based strategic plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communities that are not designated as Empowerment Zones or Enterprise Communities are eligible for certain benefits. Under a separate program directed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Community Development Corporations (CDCs) nominated by the locality, or the applicant for the Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community, will be considered eligible for designation to receive tax preferred contributions from donors. HUD has committed to designating eight rural CDCs for this program. Communities with innovative visions for change will be considered for requested waivers of Federal program regulations, flexible use of existing program funds, and cooperation in meeting essential mandates, even if they do not receive a designation by the Secretary as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communities that are designated as Enterprise Communities receive a number of benefits. Enterprise Communities are eligible for new Tax-Exempt Facilities Bonds for certain private business activities. States with designated Communities will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grants (EZ/EC SSBG) in the amount of approximately $3 million for each rural Enterprise Community to pass through to each designated area for approved activities identified in the strategic plans. Enterprise Communities receive special consideration in competition for funding under numerous Federal programs, including the new National Service and Community Policing initiatives. The Federal Government will focus special attention on working cooperatively with designated Enterprise Communities to overcome regulatory impediments, to permit flexible use of existing Federal funds, and to assist these Communities in meeting essential mandates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Communities that are designated as Empowerment Zones receive all of the benefits provided to Enterprise Communities, in addition to other benefits. States with designated Empowerment Zones will receive Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Social Service Block Grants in the amount of $40 million for each rural Empowerment Zone. Employer Wage Credits for Empowerment Zone residents are provided to qualified employers engaged in trade, business, or human service delivery in designated Empowerment Zones. Businesses are afforded an increased deduction under section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified investments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rural part of the program will be administered by USDA as a Federal-State-local-private partnership, with a minimum of red tape associated with the application process. Applicants must demonstrate the ability to design and implement an effective strategic plan for real opportunities for growth and revitalization, that deal with local problems is a comprehensive way, and must demonstrate the capacity or the commitment to carry out these plans. Development of an effective plan must also involve the participation of the community affected by the nomination of the rural area, and of the private sector, acting in concert with the State or States and local governments. The plan should be developed in accordance with four key principles, which will also serve as the basis for the selection criteria that will be used to evaluate the plan. These key principles reflect the Secretary's intention that Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community designations should be based on potential for successful economic and community revitalization as reflected in the strategic planning process, participants in the plan, and the quality of the plan. Poverty, unemployment, and other need factors are critical in determining eligibility for Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community status, but play a less significant role in the selection process. The four key principles are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Economic opportunity, including job creation within the community and throughout the region, entrepreneurial initiatives, small business expansion, and training for jobs that offer upward mobility; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sustainable community development, to advance the creation of liveable and vibrant communities through comprehensive approaches that coordinate economic, physical, environmental, community and human development; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Community-based partnerships, involving participation of all segments of the community, including the political and governmental leadership, community groups, health and social service groups, environmental groups, religious organizations, the private and non-profit sectors, centers of learning, other community institutions, and individual citizens; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Strategic vision for change, which identifies what the community will become and a strategic map for revitalization. The vision should build on assests and coordinate a response to community needs in a comprehensive fashion. It should also set goals and performance benchmarks for measuring progress and establish a framework for evaluating and adjusting the revitalization plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State and local governments and economic development corporations that are state chartered may nominate distressed rural areas for designation as Empowerment Zones (which will also permit their consideration for designation as Enterprise Communities), or solely for designation as Enterprise Communities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title XIII of the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 included Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities as a new program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

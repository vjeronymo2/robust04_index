			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / People: MacSharry to join Smurfit Ray MacSharry, EC agricultural commissioner, will be joining the board of paper, packaging and printing group Jefferson Smurfit, Ireland's largest company, as a non-executive director early next year following his departure from Brussels at the end of December. Jack Lynch, prime minister of the Republic until 1979, and on the board of the company since then, is retiring aged 75. MacSharry, who earned the nickname of 'the second Cromwell' in his native Ireland because of farmers' fears for their countryside in the wake of CAP reform, has achieved the distinction of pushing through the most far-reaching changes in the Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year history. Twice a finance minister in Charles Haughey's cabinet, he was long tipped as the next Irish prime minister, but in the event he did not challenge Albert Reynolds and now says he wishes to withdraw from public life. Before entering parliament in 1969, he was involved in road haulage. The company is keen to deny any close personal connections between him and its chairman Michael Smurfit. 'Ireland is a small place and no doubt they have run into each other,' says a spokesman, 'but this was a board-driven appointment. We wanted someone who knew the streets of Europe.' Smurfit is keen to expand its presence in continental Europe and it also thinks MacSharry's advice will be valuable in helping deal with the flood of 'green' legislation from Brussels. William MacDonald, 74, a former company secretary, is also stepping down from the board. Meanwhile, Martin Rafferty, chairman of Dublin pharmaceuticals distributor United Drug, joins as a non-executive director and as the first chairman of the newly formed audit committee. The most financially experienced non-executive director, according to the company, he is also chairman of Ulster Investment Bank, the Industrial Development Authority, and Readymix, as well as being a director of Aer Lingus, Ulster Bank and Church &amp; General Insurance Company. ***** Tom Roberts, deputy chief general manager of General Accident, is to retire at the end of November. One of the Perth-based company's stalwarts, Roberts has been with GA since 1953. Now 62, he worked his way up through the company's hierarchy, working in Newcastle, St Albans and finally at the head office in Perth where he became deputy chief general manager in 1989. Recently he has been closely involved in GA's work on road safety, winning a CBE for his services in this area in 1989. GA is not making a replacement for the moment.</p>

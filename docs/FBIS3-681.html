			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE CITIZEN </H6>   TEC ANC Vehicle for Action Against `Enemies' -- Johannesburg  THE CITIZEN in English on 10 March in its page-6 editorial says  it expected the "African National Congress (ANC)-dominated  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] to take over functions of  the government, which it is doing," but "never expected it to  show such arrogance and treat the government with such  disrespect." The paper refers to the TEC's attempt to "stop  Housing Minister Louis Shill from going ahead with his R90  billion [rand] housing scheme for the low-income sector." The  TEC is "setting itself up as a vehicle for ANC action against  its enemies, including Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the IFP  [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader, and President Lucas Mangope of  Bophuthatswana. This does not augur well for reconciliation and  national unity, but suggests a dictatorial, aggressive attitude  which can only exacerbate matters."  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   Warning Against Postponing Election -- Johannesburg THE STAR  in English on 11 March in a page-12 editorial notes that General  Constand Viljoen of the Freedom Front, Lucas Mangope of  Bophuthatswana, and the Inkatha Freedom Party's Mangosuthu  Buthelezi want international mediation. "While such  intervention implies neutral adjudication, it will not guarantee  a satisfactory outcome, and will almost certainly (because of  the time factor) require a postponement of the election. The  country simply cannot afford that. If only out of  considerations of security and reducing uncertainties, the poll  must go ahead on April 27."  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   SANCO Appoints Itself `Inquisitor' for ANC -- "Spotting an  opportunity for power and influence, SANCO [South African  National Civic Organization] has appointed itself the  extra-parliamentary enforcer of the ANC's reconstruction and  development programme," declares a page 6 editorial in  Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 11 March. "It is now  setting about stamping its undemocratic authority on a programme  for which it is not accountable." "Last November, SANCO said it  would investigate the operations of development agencies such as  the Independent Development Trust and the SA Development Bank.  Both of these operate with public funds and their activities  can legitimately be questioned and directed by a new government;  SANCO has appointed itself their inquisitor. In addition, it is  now targeting private development agencies, the non-government  organisations which raise and disburse money here, or which are  channels of donations from abroad. SANCO is now determined to  see that these funds, too, go where SANCO directs." BUSINESS DAY  advises these agencies to "ignore these questions." "SANCO has  no right to this information and replies may well lead to  'suggestions' about changes in priorities or procedures."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Call for Military Solution in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 11-17 March says in a  page-16 editorial it "does not, as a rule, favour military  solutions to political problems" like the unrest in  Bophuthatswana. "But there is a very real prospect that more  lives may be lost, and the crisis in the homeland may spiral out  of control, if De Klerk continues to stay his hand. What, after  all, are the `South African interests' De Klerk says must be  jeopardised before he will intervene? Are they not the two  million people South Africa cut adrift when it granted  Bophuthatswana independence, and who have the inalienable right  to cast their votes in the country's first non-racial elections?"  <H6>  CAPE TIMES </H6>   Zimbabwe Government Abuse of Seized Land -- "The disclosure  in our news columns that the first of 70 private farms seized by  the Zimbabwe government ostensibly for peasant resettlement has  in fact been allocated to a cabinet minister is yet another  reminder of how government interference in the marketplace can  be abused," warns a page-6 editorial in Cape Town CAPE TIMES in  English on 9 March.</p>

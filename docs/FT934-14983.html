			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Kohl rails against protectionism GERMAN Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the French Senate yesterday that Europeans should 'resist the temptation of protectionism', in a speech designed to influence France's position in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. Chancellor Kohl's call won swift praise from Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, who was holding negotiations with the EC in Brussels on the Uruguay Round. Mr Kohl, stressing the need for freer trade particularly with east Europe, said: 'West Europeans would be committing a fatal error if they thought that in removing competition by closing their markets they could benefit in any way whatsoever'. Mr Kantor said he was pleased Mr Kohl was 'seized with the importance of restoring growth in Europe' and emphasised that 'increased competition rather than building a wall around the EC is an absolute necessity'. Mr Kantor took a firm line on French demands that the US-EC Blair House agreement on cutting Europe's subsidised farm exports be amended: 'We are not going to reopen or renegotiate the Blair House agreement,' he said. Meanwhile in Paris, in a speech to the National Assembly, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur yesterday gave little sign of conceding on the substance of France's demands. Calling for government and opposition parties to unite to defend 'our country's national interests', Mr Balladur cited unfulfilled demands on steel, aerospace, transport and market access, and warned that France would not allow itself to be 'forced to take one extra hectare of land out of production' when countries such as the US were putting set-aside land back into production. Mr Balladur said France would settle for a Gatt accord in the form of 'a progress report' by the December 15 negotiating deadline 'if certain partners were to propose this'. He thus appeared to back away from the campaign that his ministers have been waging in recent days for an 'interim Gatt' deal this year, leaving the contentious issues of agriculture and broadcasting for later. Mr Balladur and Mr Kohl, in Paris talks, discussed the possibility of Germany using its influence with the US to mediate in the farm trade dispute.</p>

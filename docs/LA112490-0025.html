			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER U.S. POLICY IN PERSIAN GULF  </P> <P> How could our Administration have been so stupid? It's obvious now that the  Conference of Catholic Bishops and the National Council of Churches have seen  fit to enlighten us.  </P> <P> All that would have been required last August would have been for these highly  principled bodies to have passed their resolutions deploring the Iraqi conduct  and forwarded these to Hussein. Think of all the problems and costs this would  have saved us, since no doubt, immediately upon receiving his copies of these  resolutions, Hussein would have seen the error of his ways, withdrawn his  troops and apologized to the Kuwaitis.  </P> <P> May the good Lord protect us from his benighted servants!  </P> <P> JACK ISKEN  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

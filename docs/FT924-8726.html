			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / The Matrix Churchill Case: A juggling act between business and espionage - 'I never saw myself as a spy but I suppose that is exactly what I was,' says British businessman who risked life for MI6 THE engineering heartland of the Midlands which moulded businessman Mr Paul Henderson might have been a world away from Whitehall when he stepped off a train at Euston station one day in September 1989 to be greeted by his control officer. This was Henderson, the spy, a man who for the best part of 20 years had been risking his life for British intelligence. In his first full interview to be published after the end of his trial yesterday, Mr Henderson spoke about his secret life and how he juggled the role of businessman and spy. For years he had placed his life in the safe-keeping of MI6, which he had long since come to trust. It was a trust that would be sorely tested in the months ahead. He recalled the rest of that September day. A chauffeur-driven grey Ford Granada took them to a building overlooking the Mall. They were escorted into an opulent room for a day-long session of intense questioning. Seated on one side of an oval table was Mr Henderson, managing director of Matrix Churchill, the Coventry machine tool manufacturer he had joined as a boy apprentice more than 30 years earlier. Facing him was a panel of six officers, mostly scientists attached to MI6. All were introduced using first names only. They proceeded to drain him of his knowledge of Eastern Europe and Iraq. They broke for lunch and walked the short distance to a gentleman's club in Pall Mall. Fresh scientists were introduced for the afternoon session, which concentrated on eastern Europe. When the session ended, the party walked across to the Foreign Office before they dispersed. 'Later I went back and retraced my steps. I must have walked that route 10 times, from the house, to the club, back to the house and over to the Foreign Office to be sure of where I went that day,' said Mr Henderson. Even now, with the Cold War and the Gulf war part of history, he refuses to disclose the full details of what he revealed. Part of what he told them emerged in the trial. Another part remains veiled in spite of his disillusionment with an intelligence service which he had loyally served since 1973. For the best part of 20 years he concealed his intelligence work from his colleagues and family, including his wife. Only his close friend and colleague Mr Mark Gutteridge was party to the secret and Mr Gutteridge was himself encouraged to pass information to the intelligence services. Mr Henderson was working in a deadly business for which he could have paid with his life. He worked to basic ground rules. 'I never made notes or contacted anyone in a country in which I was staying. I never made phone calls,' he said. He was told by his controllers always to memorise numbers and names. 'My memory was not that good and I wrote the numbers down against made-up names,' he said. His first encounter with British intelligence was in 1973 when he became managing director of Matrix Churchill International, which handled the export sales of the machine tools division within the TI Group of companies, to which Matrix Churchill then belonged. Four officers of MI6 - two men and two women - visited the factory to give a briefing on what to do and what not to do for sales staff working behind the Iron Curtain. 'It was a bit late for me because I had already been travelling there for four years. But it was all pretty common-sense stuff,' he said. A few days later one of the women phoned back. For the next two or three years she became his controller. They met in pubs and cafes whenever he returned from his visits to the eastern bloc. 'I went to every eastern bloc country in that time. I was travelling eight months of the year,' he said. Over the years his controllers changed but they remained hungry for information. 'They would tell me what they were looking for and I would decide whether I would do it or not; simple as that,' said Mr Henderson. He was never paid and never asked for payment. 'I did it because at the end of the day I thought it was the right thing to do and it was helping my country,' he said. 'I never saw myself as a spy but I suppose at the end of the day that's exactly what I was doing.' His business was machine tools, a business for which Britain was once renowned. Matrix made lathes that could turn almost anything from kettles to colanders. They could make shell casings and had served the munitions industry for more than 100 years. The company traded heavily with the Soviet bloc and had 1,200 machine tools installed in the Soviet Union. 'You don't sell a thousand machine tools to the Soviet Union without some having a military capability,' he said. In 1986 Mr Henderson was elevated to the prestigious position of joint chairman of the Anglo Soviet Working Group on the development of machine tool trade. The other joint chairman was Mr Boris Kurakin, a deputy minister of machine tool manufacture in the Soviet Union. Then, in 1987, at the end of the Iran-Iraq war, a delegation of Iraqis introduced by an Essex businessman called Mr Roy Ricks visited Matrix. 'I didn't think we would get any business out of them and thought we were wasting our time,' said Mr Henderson. The company received a Pounds 19m order for CNC lathes to be used in the manufacture of 80mm, 122mm and 155mm shells. Their use for Iraq's munitions industry was accepted by the then trade minister Mr Alan Clark. Other machine tool companies were also reaping the benefits of Iraqi orders to re-equip its defence industries. BSA Tools, Colchester Lathes and Wickman Bennet all had orders for machine tools for the Iraqi defence industry. The UK had a policy against supplying Iran or Iraq with potentially lethal equipment but, as Mr Clark later told the court, this was an 'elastic' policy which could be stretched to include machine tools. Later that year TI, the parent company, was contacted again by Mr Ricks on behalf of Iraqi interests which wanted to buy Matrix. The Iraqis had made earlier inquiries at other machine tool companies. Sir John Cuckney, the former MI5 officer who had been a non-executive deputy chairman of TI at the time of the sale, said later that there had been nothing unusual about selling Matrix to an Iraqi company. The price had been a good one and TI had wanted to sell it. Mr Henderson now believes that the deal had greater significance. 'There is no doubt in my mind that the business was sold to the Iraqis so that we could monitor them.' Mr Henderson put the deal together, negotiating with Iraqi intelligence officers posing as businessmen. He recalls Dr Safa Habobi wearing the military uniform of a brigadier, but this was not unusual in the Ba'ath Party where everyone has a right to a military rank. Mr Henderson would later be told by MI6 that Habobi was a member of Iraqi intelligence. The Iraqi ownership gave Mr Henderson the perfect opening. He could now amass information for the British government while doing business for his company. 'I used to drink with Iraqi officials until two or three (in the morning),' he said. 'Booze is a great loosener of the tongue. I found things out that maybe I shouldn't have found out.' Was he aware of the risks he was taking? 'After a couple of years I suddenly began to realise that at the end of the day I was putting myself at risk. But that was all there was to it.' From mid 1988 his MI6 controller repeatedly asked one question: did he know anything about project Babylon? 'I was confusing this at first with the Lion of Babylon programme which referred to the refurbishment of tanks. It was only later I understood they were asking me about the supergun programme.' With hindsight, this was a vital clue which suggests that British intelligence may have begun assembling a picture of Iraq's supergun project as early as mid 1988. This is earlier than any intelligence officer has admitted to MPs. It has taken two years for Mr Henderson and his lawyers to piece together the broader picture of the British government relationship with Iraq. It took an Old Bailey trial to drag it out into the open. For future businessmen who might do as he did he warns. 'Make sure you have everything in writing.'</p>

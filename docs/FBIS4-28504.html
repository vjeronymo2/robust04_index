			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 10 (YONHAP) -- The political tension  caused by the North Korean nuclear problem has had little effect  on inter-Korean commodity exchanges or trade with other nations,  business sources here said Friday.    Interest rates for spot financing, however, are on the rise.    Sources at trading companies said that inter-Korean trade  including processing-on-commission dealings is going on as usual.    Businesses which deal with North Korea said they will watch  how the situation develops before placing new orders with the  North, adding this does not mean they would suspend  processing-on-commission dealings with the North.    A source at Hyundai Business Group said Hyundai is  purchasing  zinc ingots without any interruption and that the nuclear  dispute is not harming trade with other countries. But he said  interest rates for long-term spot financing by overseas branches  and locally incorporated firms of Korean businesses are rising  slightly.    Other sources said they believe there will be little change  in South Korean trade with the North and other countries before  international sanctions against Pyongyang are actually adopted.</p>

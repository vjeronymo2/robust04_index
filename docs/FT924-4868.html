			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / International Company News: BASF trims polystyrene capacity as demand falls BASF, the German chemicals group, is to slash polystyrene capacity at its Ludwigshafen plant by 25 per cent. The group, which 10 days ago announced a 45 per cent slump in pre-tax profits for the first nine months of this year, blamed the need for cuts on falling demand and the impact on prices of the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. It is Europe's largest polystyrene manufacturer. Prices would have to increase quickly by around 30 per cent before polystyrene manufacture was economically viable, it said, but it saw no possibility of improvements during 1993. A recent attempt by manufacturers to increase prices failed. BASF's move is only the latest of a series of attempts to rationalise the industry which is suffering from overcapacity. Elf Atochem, the French group, closed a 110,000 tonnes a year plant in Dieuze this summer. Meanwhile, BP Chemicals and Enichem of Italy have tried to form an Dollars 800m joint-venture in polystyrene. BASF, which is planning to reduce its workforce by more than 2,000 next year, said people displaced by the closures would be offered work in other parts of its giant Ludwigshafen works at the confluence of the Rhine and Neckar rivers.</p>

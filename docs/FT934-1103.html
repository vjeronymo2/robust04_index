			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: British Gas strengthens presence in Argentina British Gas has bought a 45 per cent share in a Buenos Aires gas-fired power station for Dollars 24m (Pounds 16.1m) in a move which will strengthen its already considerable presence in Argentina. The purchase of a stake in the Central Dock Sud power station fits in with British Gas's strategy to focus on fast growing economies in which the company is already involved. It was made by Global Gas, the division responsible for British Gas's investments in overseas gas distribution systems and power generation projects. Mr Russell Herbert, Global Gas managing director, said the 'market for power generation in Argentina has major potential for growth . . .' The company will be involved in the expansion of the plant to 490 megawatts from its present output of 211MW. It will also act as an adviser in negotiations for future fuel and power contracts. A British Gas-led consortium has a 70 per cent shareholding in MetroGas, which supplies 1.9m customers in Buenos Aires. It also supplies the power station. Another British Gas division is involved in exploration and production activities in Argentina. Power generation schemes using local gas reserves and efficient combined cycle gas turbines are proving particularly popular in fast growing economies, in part because they can be built relatively quickly and are much cheaper than traditional power plants.</p>

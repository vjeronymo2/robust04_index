			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Franco-German Squabbles"] </F>   [Text] The words of French Ambassador to Germany Francois  Scheer, as spoken to a number of German journalists, have caused  a commotion in the federal capital. German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel and Chancellor Kohl interpreted the speculation  about the new course of German foreign policy since unification  as a demonstration of "distrust."    The questions raised by Mr. Scheer on Bonn's attitude  regarding the enlargement of the European Union and the  geopolitical uncertainties linked to the move of the capital  from Bonn to Berlin are legitimate. They put the finger on one  obvious element: Franco-German relations have changed profoundly  since German unification, in terms of both style and content.    We are far removed today from the friendly relations between  Roland Dumas and Hans-Dietrich Genscher. A less warm  relationship has evolved between [French Foreign Minister] Alain  Juppe and Klaus Kinkel; one which is marked by a coarser  frankness. However, what has been lost in style has often been  gained in efficiency. This was noticeable during the difficult  GATT negotiations, where Bonn made a decisive contribution to  the establishment of a compromise acceptable to Paris, and  during the finalization of the European Union's joint position  on Bosnia, whose only fault was that it came much too late.    In terms of substance, the incidents which have peppered  Franco-German relations in recent days underline the need to  update the alliance sealed in 1963 by Charles de Gaulle and  Konrad Adenauer. It is no longer a question of closing ranks in  order to confront the threat from the East. If good  Franco-German cooperation is necessary today, it is because it  is impossible to confront today's challenges alone: How can  unemployment be tackled in France and Germany without  harmonizing the monetary and budget policies of both countries?  How can the European Union make progress without defining the  correct way of combining enlargement with deepening? These are  all problems which call for straightforward explanations, not  ritualistic invocations of the "unfailing" nature of the  Franco-German friendship.    It is true that the political timetable in both countries  does not favor the smoothing out of accumulated differences. In  the midst of a tough election campaign, Messrs. Kohl and Kinkel  are tending to use a bit of muscle to rally the most  conservative part of public opinion, which is very concerned  about defending Germany's role in Europe and the world. In  France, the differences in approach within the majority on  European issues hinder the action of a government which has its  eye set on the presidential elections in 1995. The  Franco-German duo has certainly survived other disturbances in  the past. However, the politicians would be well advised to  calm a situation in which everyone has a lot to lose and not  much to gain.</p>

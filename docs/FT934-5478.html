			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Expenditure watchdog attacks market testing The introduction of market testing into the civil service is making it harder to keep track of public expenditure, says Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office. The office, which is parliament's public expenditure watchdog, has no right of access to the books of companies that win contracts for providing public services, Sir John told the Commons public accounts committee yesterday. Sir John contrasted his lack of power to inspect contractors' papers with those of the Audit Commission, which has the right of access in auditing local authority and health service activities. Apart from the defence and transport ministries, most departments and agencies had no experience in letting contracts, Sir John told the MPs. The NAO was keen to monitor the great expansion in the programme, which he regarded as 'an area of concern'. Sir John said that the NAO should be given more auditing work for more than 1,400 central government quangos. Most of these non-departmental public bodies are audited by private-sector accountancy firms, chosen by the secretary of state in charge of their sponsoring department in consultation with the Treasury. Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the committee, expressed concern about the way that accountancy firms used audits to win more lucrative consultancy work. Mr Terry Davis, Labour MP for Birmingham Hodge Hill, said opportunities to find ways of improving value for money in public services could be lost by excluding the NAO, which could generalise from the experience of several cases. Sir John also said the office was paying increasing attention to examining the vulnerability of management systems to fraud. There was a rising incidence of white-collar crime associated with computers, he said.</p>

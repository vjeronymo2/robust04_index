The German  parliamentarian calls on the German Bundestag and Western  countries to throw their weight in support of the Baltic states,  amid the threats voiced by the Russian ultra-nationalist  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy and worries sparked in the Baltic states  by the hints which have cropped up in the New Year's address of  Russian President Boris Yeltsin to his fellow citizens. "It has  to be made clear to the Kremlin leadership that, whatever the  government of the Russian Federation is, independence of the  three Baltic states has to be inviolable," says the statement.  "Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia should not be betrayed and sold  out once again, as it has already happened in 1940, 1941 and  1945. Russia ought to be told that the remaining troops be  withdrawn from Latvia and Estonia in 1994."    Dr. Von Stetten maintained that he had not witnessed any  evidence of Russians being discriminated repressed in any of the  three Baltic countries, they had been only deprived of their  self-assumed rights to act as occupants and masters of the three  people, which they had enjoyed until recently. He pointed out  that legislation on minorities rights in Estonia and Lithuania  met the most strict European standards, the only controversy  being the laws on citizenship. Von Stetten said, however, that  the citizenship laws in Lithuania and Latvia are much more  liberal than respective legislations in the countries of Western  Europe, including Germany. The German parliamentarian underlined  that both the allegations by Zhirinovskiy and implications by  President Yeltsin were groundless.    Von Stetten also stated that the former occupants could not  be granted any privileges they are claiming so vehemently. The  chairman of the German parliamentary group suggested it was  necessary to consider seriously and to discuss an option to  grant the Baltic states the NATO membership, or to offer Latvia,  Lithuania and Estonia guarantees of their security, in order to  ease their worries of a new eventual annexation on the part of  Russia.</p>

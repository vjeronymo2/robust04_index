			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / IMF urges monetary caution on Poles Attempts to combat recession in Poland through easing monetary policies would lead to a growth in inflation rather than production, Mr Richard Erb, the International Monetary Fund's deputy director warned yesterday, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The government continues to come under pressure to ease monetary policies and a meeting of economists to be held under the auspices of President Lech Walesa's advisory council on May 17 is expected to give vent to mounting public discontent. Mr Erb was speaking after two days of meetings with Polish government officials and political leaders. He said the talks had given him 'even more confidence in the political will' to maintain the direction of the country's economic reforms. 'I remain positive and optimistic Poland will achieve the targets it has set itself,' he said, referring to a letter of intent recently accepted by the IMF as the basis of a three-year programme of loans worth over Dollars 1.6bn.

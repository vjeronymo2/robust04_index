			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / New City insurance centre optimistic THE London Underwriting Centre got off to a good start yesterday Mr John Hesh, the general manager of the new City insurance market, said. 'We had a tremendous number of visitors and not only brokers,' Mr Hesh said. 'There was a full and heavy day's business and . . . the opening response was greater than expected.' Twenty-two underwriters from companies such as GRE(UK), Mercantile &amp; General Reinsurance, Commercial Union and Eagle Star have taken space in a new Pounds 50m building in Mincing Lane. Between them they underwrite Pounds 2.5bn of premiums a year. Their combined capital and surplus or 'capacity' totals more than Pounds 6bn. The capacity at Lloyd's is more than Pounds 8bn but there are predictions that it could fall next year. Mr Blake, chairman of the centre, said: 'In the past, brokers have had to trudge around 22 different offices for quotes. We are offering one-stop business. We see the LUC as complementary to Lloyd's. If Lloyd's is unable to undertake the same volume of non-marine insurance in the next year . . . we want the world to know that London as a centre can still handle the necessary business.' Mr Nick Phillips, Lloyd's property manager, said the LUC business was not new, just existing business under one roof.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. For tax reasons, the trust must be maintained as an essentially passive entity. Therefore, both the sponsor's discretion and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited. Pooling and servicing agreements provide for the substitution of receivables by the sponsor only in the event of defects in documentation discovered within a short time after the issuance of trust certificates (within 120 days, except in the case of obligations having an original term of 30 years, in which case the period will not exceed two years). Any receivable so substituted is required to have characteristics substantially similar to the replaced receivable and will be at least as creditworthy as the replaced receivable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, the affected receivable would be repurchased, with the purchase price applied as a payment on the affected receivable and passed through to certificateholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Parties to Transactions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> originator <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a receivable is the entity that initially lends money to a borrower (obligor), such as a homeowner or automobile purchaser, or leases property to a lessee. The originator may either retain a receivable in its portfolio or sell it to a purchaser, such as a trust sponsor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Originators of receivables included in the trusts will be entities that originate receivables in the ordinary course of their business, including finance companies, for whom such origination constitutes the bulk of their operations, financial institutions for whom such origination constitutes a substantial part of their operations, and any kind of manufacturer, merchant, or service enterprise for whom such origination is an incidental part of its operations. Each trust may contain assets of one or more originators. The originator of the receivables may also function as the trust sponsor or servicer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> sponsor <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will be one of three entities: (i) A special-purpose or other corporation unaffiliated with the servicer, (ii) a special-purpose or other corporation affiliated with the servicer, or (iii) the servicer itself. Where the sponsor is not also the servicer, the sponsor's role will generally be limited to acquiring the receivables to be included in the trust, establishing the trust, designating the trustee, and assigning the receivables to the trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> trustee <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a trust is the legal owner of the obligations in the trust. The trustee is also a party to or beneficiary of all the documents and instruments deposited in the trust, and as such is responsible for enforcing all the rights created thereby in favor of certificateholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trustee will be an independent entity, and therefore will be unrelated to NatWest, the trust sponsor or the servicer. NatWest represents that the trustee will be a substantial financial institution or trust company experienced in trust activities. The trustee receives a fee for its services, which will be paid by the sponsor or servicer. The method of compensating the trustee will be specified in the pooling and servicing agreement and disclosed in the prospectus or private placement memorandum relating to the offering of the certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

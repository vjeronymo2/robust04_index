			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> SWING AND SWAY THE SERGIO MENDES WAY  </P> <P> All that's left of the latest wave of Brazilian music that has swept the United  States in the last few years is the commercial backwash. Witness recent albums  by Djavan and Ivan Lins, whose Brazilian roots seem to have been more affected  by American pop music than the other way around.  </P> <P> That's why it was refreshing to hear Sergio Mendes and his latest group, Brazil  99, play to a near-capacity Strand Supper and Dance Club Thursday night. Over  his long career, Mendes has never presented himself as anything but a pop  artist. One of the first musicians to introduce Brazilian rhythms and lyricism  to Top 40 charts, Mendes has nevertheless not forgotten the source of his  success.  </P> <P> Mendes makes no bones about giving in to the temptations of the pop/rock  allure. The latest edition of his band is orchestrated with electric bass and  guitar, and his synth and electric piano are supplemented by an additional rack  of electronic keyboards manned by Steve Bach.  </P> <P> But the majority of the tunes that he and the group performed, and certainly  those that met with the greatest reception, were heavily flavored with  Brazilian touches: percussive play, swaying samba rhythms and the beautiful  sounds of the Portuguese language.  </P> <P> The success of the various Mendes editions has always rested with the strength  of his vocalists, and he was well-represented this night. Singers Angie Jaree,  Kevyn Lettau and Mendes' wife, Gracinha Mendes, provided smooth, lyrical  sensuousness, whether singing in unison or exchanging solo lines in English and  Portuguese.  </P> <P> Mendes' brief keyboard breaks were played with passion and brief displays of  agility, but were so short they added little to the overall mood. The guitar of  Dori Caymmi, a Brazilian star in his own right, was, for the most part, buried  under the mix.  </P> <P> The attractiveness of this music is its danceability, and by the end of the set  the audience was swinging and swaying. The dinner tables were removed from the  dance floor for the second set and then the real party began.  </P> <P> Mendes will appear tonight at the Ventura Concert Theatre. BILL KOHLHAASE  </P></p>

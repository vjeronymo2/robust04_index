			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Skanska suspends senior executive SKANSKA, Scandinavia's biggest construction and property company, yesterday accused a senior executive of unlawful foreign exchange speculation which is estimated to have lost the company more than SKr500m (Dollars 97m). Mr Leif Ottosson, 36-year-old president of its financial subsidiary, was suspended from duties yesterday and police have been asked to investigate whether a crime had been committed. 'Through his repeated and grave infringements of established risk limits and guidelines, the president of the subsidiary has utilised the summer months for extensive speculation in foreign exchange,' said Skanska. Mr Ottosson is accused of infringing company rules and procedures more than 50 times. The company said the losses would adversely affect the group's interim results due to be published on October 19. In April Skanska said it expected its profits after financial items for 1992 'not to be below' last year's SKr1bn. After requesting a temporary suspension of trading in its shares, Skanska said the losses came to light yesterday as senior executives were finalising figures for the interim report. After trading resumed, the restricted shares closed down SKr3.50 to SKr68 and the free shares lost SKr3 to SKr69. The finance subsidiary, Kapitalforvaltning, mainly manages Skanska's liquid assets, trades in securities and foreign currencies and helps to arrange outside borrowing. Mr Lennart Hallberg, a company spokesman, said no one else was suspected to have been involved. According to Skanska, Mr Ottosson admitted he distorted reports to the main board about activities of the finance company and changed figures in Skanska's computer. Skanska said it tightened internal security this year to prevent this kind of manipulation. This involved weekly reports and meetings to monitor foreign exchange business but these were terminated during the Swedish summer holiday. 'It would have been impossible for Mr Ottosson to do what he did if the procedures had been in force,' said Mr Hallberg. But while senior officials took their vacation, Mr Ottosson was able to operate unchallenged. Market report, Page 25</p>

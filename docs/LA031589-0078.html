			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OIL FIRMS CALL PLAN FOR MCCOLL CLEANUP 'SERIOUSLY FLAWED'  </P> <P> Labeling the plan "seriously flawed," a coalition of oil companies Tuesday  attacked a federal proposal to clean up McColl dump by burning tons of refinery  wastes and oil-drilling sludge at the eight-acre site in west Fullerton.  </P> <P> Of all the cleanup options under consideration, the excavation and incineration  of 150,000 tons of toxic wastes at the abandoned dump would pose the greatest  health and safety risk to neighboring residents because the process produces  toxic emissions, a coalition spokesman warned.  </P> <P> Bill Duchie of the coalition, which is known as the McColl Site Group, also  predicted that pursuing the incineration option would "lead to false hopes in  the community" and result in litigation that may "delay the cleanup  indefinitely."  </P> <P> The allegations by representatives of five oil companies were issued at an  afternoon press conference in Fullerton, several hours before officials of the  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of Health  Services met McColl-area residents across town to outline the incineration  plan.  </P> <P> Federal officials believe the oil companies -- Shell, Phillips Petroleum,  Texaco, Arco and Unocal -- are responsible for the toxic wastes at the World  War II-era dump, and should pay the cleanup bill before any work begins.  </P> <P> Burning the wastes on site as recommended by the EPA would cost an estimated  $117 million. The project would take 4 to 7 years to design and implement.  </P> <P> A plan put forth by the oil companies calls for "capping" or "containing" the  wastes in the ground by covering the 12 contaminated sumps with multiple layers  of synthetic material and soil approximately 7 feet thick. The option, opposed  by local, state and federal officials as well as the majority of 1,000  homeowners who live within half a mile of the former dump, would cost about $22  million and take 3 to 5 years to implement. The EPA estimates it would cost  another $500,000 to $1 million annually to monitor the site.  </P> <P> Duchie said the oil companies are motivated by "concern for the community," not  the cleanup costs, in opposing the incineration plan.  </P> <P> But Betty Porras, who lives behind the dump and heads a citizens group called  the McColl Dump Action Group, said the oil companies are "worried about the  bottom line and nothing else."  </P> <P> In an interview before Tuesday night's community meeting, Porras said, "We want  cleanup, not a cover-up," referring to the oil companies' preference to leave  the waste in the ground.  </P> <P> Porras was one of several dozen residents to question federal and state  officials at the Fullerton hearing Tuesday night, which was attended by more  than 350 people. Many of the questions focused on the specifics of the  incineration, and few expressed approval or disapproval of the concept.  </P> <P> The EPA is not expected to make a final decision on its proposed incineration  plan until August, and the oil companies acknowledge that they have little  leverage in shaping that decision, short of stirring up public opposition to  the plan.  </P> <P> The oil companies scheduled the press conference because they were were not  allowed to make a presentation at Tuesday night's meeting, coalition officials  said. EPA officials said the forum was designed strictly for residents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Metallic Vapors' Cited  </P> <P> In contrast with the EPA's contention that burning the McColl wastes on site  would probably present little or no risk, the oil companies warned that  incineration would not completely destroy some of the contaminants buried at  McColl.  </P> <P> Heavy metals make up a portion of the wastes at the site, said Catherine St.  Hilaire, an environmental and health risk consultant hired by the oil companies  to review the EPA plan. She said that heavy metals are not destroyed by  incineration but become "metallic vapors," which are released into the  atmosphere through the incinerator exhaust.  </P> <P> As a result, St. Hilaire said, the risk of developing cancer from exposure to  emissions from incineration is "500 times greater" than the risk from leaving  the wastes in the ground.  </P> <P> "Incinerator emissions will be deposited on the soil and vegetation of yards  and gardens and recreational areas," St. Hilaire said. "Contaminated soils,  vegetables and surface waters can contribute at least as much risk as breathing  contaminated air."  </P> <P> The EPA contends that burning the waste on site would probably be safe,  although they have expressed concerns that incinerator emissions may exceed  local air quality standards. To measure the level and toxicity of emissions,  the EPA has planned three test burns using McColl waste, including one  monthlong demonstration burn at the dump itself.  </P> <P> The oil companies' proposal to leave the waste in the ground has been  questioned because of the potential for contaminants seeping into the ground  water. St. Hilaire said it is "highly unlikely" that such seepage would occur  because the cover over the waste would prevent moisture from reaching the  contaminants and carrying them into the ground water.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drinking Water Not Affected  </P> <P> She acknowledged, however, that the issue of ground water contamination near  McColl must be studied further.  </P> <P> Recent tests of ground water 250 feet below the site show traces of  sulfur-based chemicals found in the dump. But EPA officials said there is no  evidence that local drinking water supplies have been contaminated.  </P> <P> The dump sits under a vacant field and part of the Los Coyotes Country Club  golf course, and is bordered on three sides by expensive homes. It was created  in the 1940s when oil companies began depositing wastes from the production of  high-octane military aviation fuel on a vacant patch of land that is now near  the intersection of Rosecrans Avenue and Sunnyridge Road. Controversy over the  dump's noxious odors surfaced in the late 1970s. An attempt to dig up the  sludge and haul it to a landfill in Kern County was halted in May, 1985, by the  courts, which ordered the state to conduct an environmental impact study.  </P> <P> Duchie said the EPA's incineration plan could lead to similar legal threats,  again shutting down the cleanup effort.  </P> <P> "If the agency continues on its current path, it will be stopped again just  like in 1985 by some community surrounding the area that says the risk is too  great," Duchie said. "They will say, 'We know you don't want the waste, but we  don't want the risk.' "  </P></p>

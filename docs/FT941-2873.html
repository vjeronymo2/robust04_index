			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Pochin's halved to Pounds 0.8m but interim held Pre-tax profits at Pochin's, the building, plant hire and property group, were halved from a restated Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 836,000 in the six months to end November. However, Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said that the result was an advance on the second half of last year and that both profits and turnover for those 12 months had been 'inflated by a large design and build project'. Mr Pochin said he thought 'a fragile recovery' in the industry had started. He added that although there was no consistent pattern, Pochin's had recently been more successful in gaining work and the forward order book was 'reasonable'. Earnings per share were cut to 56.2p (110.5p) but the interim dividend is held at 8p. Turnover on continuing activities fell to Pounds 15.3m (Pounds 24.4m) - all the corresponding figures are restated - and there was a Pounds 338,000 (nil) contribution from acquisitions. At the operating level, there were losses of Pounds 2,000 (profits Pounds 899,000). Other income edged ahead to Pounds 1m (Pounds 939,000) and interest payable eased to Pounds 168,000 (Pounds 234,000).</p>

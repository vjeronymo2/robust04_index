			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam </F> al-Majali, in Amman, by Antoine 'Awn, in London; date not given  -- recorded]    [Text] ['Awn] In Amman, Jordanian Prime Minister  'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali today announced a major reshuffle of his  cabinet, bringing in 18 ministers, including 10  parliamentarians. This move comes hours after Amman and Israel  reached an agreement in Washington to define future trade and  economic relations between the two countries, as our  correspondent 'Aziz Fahmi reports. To clarify the reasons for  this cabinet reshuffle, we contacted the Jordanian prime  minister and asked him about the significance of the timing of  the reshuffle and its connection with the Washington agreement.    [Al-Majali] I do not think it has any connection with that.  The real significance is that we feel that the entire region is  passing through a very delicate situation regarding the  possibility of the existence of a new regional order and the  much talked about Middle East market. Therefore, the executive  and legislative authorities must cooperate and the whole nation  must take a common stance.    ['Awn] Mr. Prime Minister, Syria has maintained that the  Jordanian-Israeli agreement is a violation of the principle of  comprehensive peace. Is it really?    [Al-Majali] Sir, first we do not think that Syria feels like  that. We and Syria are in full agreement. We have always  maintained each of the four tracks has its own peculiar  character, and therefore the acceleration on any of the tracks  is natural. We are fully committed to a comprehensive solution  on all fronts, including, of course, the Syrian Golan Heights.  This is a basic principle of our policy. We believe in a  comprehensive solution. But the speed of movement on any track  is good for the other tracks and not harmful to them.    ['Awn] You were quoted as saying in a parliamentary session  that the Syrians have reached an agreement with the Israelis on  the principle of withdrawal from the Golan. On what did you  base your statement?    [Al-Majali] The statement was based on remarks made here and  there, particularly the statements made by the American sponsor,  his repeated visits, and the possibility of another visit. All  these indicate that there is a possibility of progress on the  Syrian-Israeli track. We hope it will happen, we strive for  it, and we desire it because we think it is good for all of us:  for Syria and for us.</p>

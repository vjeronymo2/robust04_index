			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with recently released Chinese </F> dissident Wang Juntao by unidentified reporters for EASTWEEK  magazine -- owned by the Oriental Press Group, which also owns  EASTERN EXPRESS -- in New York on 3 May: "`Why Do They Keep on  Hounding Us?'"]    [Text] Just 10 days after his release from a Chinese  prison for his role in organising the 1989 pro-democracy  movement, Wang Juntao, one of China's most prominent dissidents,  remains unrepentant. Five hard years behind bars for a crime he  has repeatedly denied have taken their toll on his health. His  serious hepatitis condition shows through his yellowed eyes.  But his spirit has not been broken. He is chatty, often  enthusiastic in offering views on various aspects of the Chinese  government, talks of his time in prison, and more importantly,  of the love of his life his 30-year-old wife.    Coming from a military family, Wang, 35, is nothing short of  the character expected -- disciplined, patriotic and courageous.  Throughout the interview, he is forthcoming with his feelings on  China, but cautious when questions touch upon his comrades.    For years while he was in jail, Wang was refused treatment  for his hepatitis condition. It was only after his wife  travelled to more than 10 countries, rallying support from  various heads of state and numerous international democracy  groups, that Wang was finally released. During the interview,  Wang repeatedly turned to Hou, looking into her eyes and smiling  affectionately, grateful for her strong belief in him and her  efforts to have him released.    Wang still calls his wife "little girl", an affectionate  nickname -- possibly given to her because of her petite size  when they first met at a party in Wuhan in 1986. To him, Hou is  still a little girl -- but with a big character and immeasurable  courage. Because of his little girl's political rallying  worldwide, the ailing Wang was released on April 23, and arrived  in the United States after China agreed to allow him to go  overseas for medical treatment, a face- saving practice often  used by China to release dissidents when it bows to  international pressure.    Wang, however, denied that he was allowed to go overseas  purely for medical treatment. It was all a plot to satisfy  Beijing's selfish interests, he insisted. "I was not allowed to  go, I was ordered to leave my homeland. That is the real truth.    "I remember that morning on April 18 when three senior  judiciary officers came and told me that I would be allowed to  go after repeated requests from the US government and after  careful consideration by the Chinese government. It was decided  I had better leave for treatment overseas."    Wang's first tearful reaction was: "I don't want to leave my  country." He then pleaded with them to allow him to remain in  the country, putting him on parole so that he could get medical  treatment outside the prison. The officials replied:  "Definitely not. If you do not agree to go to the US you will  remain in jail with no treatment." He finally agreed.    Wang recalled that this was the first time he cried -- he  just could not bear the thought of leaving his homeland,  regardless of the difficult situation he was in. Even the  harshest conditions in prison, and the pain he suffered during  his 21 hunger strikes could not force him to cry. "I smiled  every time I went on a hunger strike. I was not sad because I  knew I was doing the right thing," he said.    Wang described himself as a patriotic Chinese, but admitted  he could never understand the government. "I cannot understand  why the Chinese government keeps on hounding its people and  keeps on treating us like enemies. And why are we being chased  out of the country?    "How come every time we are in trouble, we need other  countries and other people to step in to rescue us?"    Wang denounced China for repeatedly using Chinese dissidents  as political pawns to fulfil its trade interests, and above all  to win Most Favoured Nation trading status from the US. "This  practice should be stopped. They should not continue with this  shamelessly. The Americans are trying to use MFN to help solve  problems in China, but our government is using it to fulfil its  MFN dream," he said. "This is equal to selling out the whole of  the Chinese race. China needs to rethink its policy towards its  people and should treat us fairly if it still cares about  national dignity."    Surprisingly, Wang refused to blame his ill health on the  poor prison conditions he lived in and the fact that he was  denied proper medical treatment for hepatitis. But his prison  life was undeniably harsh and lonely. "The first cell I was put  in was less than three square metres. There was a bucket which  served as my private toilet, and for companionship I had dozens  of flies buzzing around all day and all night long, along with  hundreds of insects and various species of worms. It wasn't all  that solitary a confinement after all," he joked.    Wang's mental and physical condition have surprised a great  many people, including his wife and friends. Many anticipated  he would be completely broken after six months in prison. Wang  proved them wrong. But even he admits it was incredible that he  survived such harsh conditions. He hopes his fellow dissidents  who are still in prison will be better treated, and he called  for improved medical treatment for the sick.    According to Chinese law, any prisoner who has served one  third of a jail term can be allowed medical treatment outside  prison. In Wang's case, his request was repeatedly turned down.  In the US, Wang is receiving free medical examinations, but he  has yet to find money for the expensive treatment. Still, he  insists he does not want financial support from the US  government. "I don't want to deal with any government at  all...I want to be independent," he said.    Wang admits his decision to leave China was made because he  did not want to disappoint his wife and others who had worked  for his release. More importantly, he was concerned that, if he  turned down the offer of release, he might jeopardise the  chances of other dissidents.    Wang believes there will be a better China in the near  future  if democratic movements either inside or outside China are  better planned. He believes there are three things overseas  democracy activists can do to improve China's human rights.  "Firstly, they should do their best to preserve the present  democratic force in China, which means they have to provide a  safe back door to prepare for the worst scenario.    "Secondly, they have to provide financial support for the  mainland's democratic movement. Last, but not least, they  should continue to strengthen international support and keep  feeding this support back to China."    Wang believes China's mainstream democratic movement still  remains on the mainland, and urges overseas activists not to  become too removed from China. "Any slight detachment from the  mainstream movement in China would be equal to pulling the plug  of the life-support machine that is keeping the dissidents going  on the mainland."    He strongly disagrees with many who believe that China  should  be fed the Western recipe of democracy. "That Western style  would never work in China. We need to formulate something that  suits the Chinese taste." Wang says a better tomorrow for the  Chinese, either in or out of China, should begin with a fight  for dignity. "I want to let the world know we Chinese are not  cowards. There are many of us on the mainland who are not  afraid to fight the communist regime or voice a different view."    Throughout the best part of the interview, Hou kept silent  nodding at times to show support and agreement on certain  issues. Wang's little girl surprised many Chinese officials on  the mainland during her courageous five years of campaigning for  his fair treatment and ultimate release.    Wang admits that when it comes, to drawing the right  attention and support, his little girl is streets ahead. He  first met Hou at his own house party in Wuhan. A colleague  introduced the two and recommended she join their magazine.  Wang was not convinced of her ability then, despite praise from  various quarters. But it was love at first sight, and Wang said  Hou totally swept him off his feet. The two were married two  months later in December that year.    Wang says he believes in eternal love, at least in his case.  "The day we were married Xiaotian told me: 'Juntao, if you go to  heaven I will follow you. If you go to hell, I will follow you,  and if you get knocked down, I will be the first one to lift you  up.'    "I thought she was bull-shitting me at the time, because  many  people do that in Beijing. I was so wrong," he said, reaching  out to touch her hands. Hou said their strong love kept her  going during his imprisonment. "There was no communication  between us at all during those years. We both relied on that  special feeling linking our souls, which kept us going," she  said softly.    Wang did not realise his wife was the person behind his  freedom. Only on the day of his release was he told by those who  had imprisoned him. "I thought it was really strange they all  told me not to forget the greatness of my wife."    Even on the way to the US, when he thanked the accompanying  US official, the man told him: "You should thank your wife.  Her sincerity touched every major democracy activist worldwide,  many heads of state and our president."</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Two-way pull in Hanson CONGLOMERATE Hanson held up well in the face of a reassessment of its prospects by its own broker. It was boosted generally by a belief that it is well placed to benefit from an economic upturn and specifically by hopes of an acquisition. The shares closed only 2 off at 234 1/2 p with 12m traded. Broker Hoare Govett trimmed its profits estimate for the year ending in September to Pounds 1.13bn and for the following year by Pounds 80m to Pounds 1.275bn. Acquisition hopes have been fired by strengthening rumours that Hanson will sell its stake in ICI, by the recent disposal of Ever Ready and by a Pounds 500m Eurobond issue yesterday. Mr Geoff Alum, a conglomerates analyst with County NatWest, said that, discounting the Eurobond issue and the ICI stake, Hanson already had Pounds 7.8bn in cash. ICI, which has risen strongly on the stake sale talk, as well as a belief that an announcement about the sale of its fibres division is imminent, closed 12 ahead at 1366p. Analysts have seen 1325p as the price Lord Hanson would need for his 20m ICI shares if the sale was to be worthwhile. That would imply a discount of about 3 per cent to the current price, and some commentators argue that the discount will have to be nearer 5 per cent, suggesting a market share price of around 1400p. Dowty bid talk Strong bid speculation returned to Dowty Group, the aerospace components manufacturer, sending the stock racing ahead by 11 to 145p in heavy volume of 4.7m shares. Talk of a bid started early in the session following two sizeable agency crosses at the 138p level, with Smiths Industries and TI the two names in the frame. Smiths is thought to have been eyeing Dowty for some time but is said to be unwilling to pay a high take-out price. The speculation eventually settled around TI as the most likely bidder, with a cash offer price of 155p to 160p a share mentioned, and a higher paper alternative. There were even whispers of an agreed bid. TI weakened 19 to 716p and Smiths eased a penny to 314p. Mr Zafar Khan at Strauss Turnbull said: 'We have been here before but the heavy volume and the rise in the price suggest that the market is coming to the view that a bid is imminent.' Abbey retreats Building society turned high street bank Abbey National fell on record turnover after a profits warning prompted analysts to lower their forecasts. The shares lost 11 1/2 to 299 1/2 p and the turnover of 13.5m shares was the heaviest since the bank was floated nearly two years ago. Nomura Research, the securities house with the most optimistic view of Abbey, knocked Pounds 40m off its 1992 estimate to Pounds 640m, but Mr Mike Fesemeyer, the house's banking analyst, said the fundamentals were still in place and the position was not as bad as many thought. County NatWest's Mr John Aitken, who had been at the bottom of the range of predictions with Pounds 620m, commented: 'I might be tempted to knock another Pounds 20m off the forecast because the statement does seem to indicate a bigger increase in provisions.' Insurance gloom The insurance sector suffered the most pain in the London market yesterday as investors reacted to disappointing figures from Legal &amp; General. L &amp; G dropped 24 to 366p, the biggest percentage fall among the FT-SE 100 constituents, after announcing that its worldwide life and pensions new annual premium figures for the first quarter of 1992 were down by 16 per cent to Pounds 46.7m. Analysts said the group, along with the rest of the sector, was due for a correction following a good run after the general election. There was in addition an emotional impact from Abbey National's profits warning, although some observers felt that the bank had probably not taken out massive mortgage insurance. Prudential, which has very little exposure to mortgage problems, lost 13 1/2 to 241 1/2 p, Sun Alliance, already badly hit, fell a further 10 to 271p, General Accident slid 16 to 452p and Guardian Royal Exchange declined 5 to 135p. Scottish generators remained very active, with Scottish Power gaining 3 to 97p on turnover of 19m shares and Scottish Hydro-Electric also adding 3 at 102p on volume of 8.2m. The high level of activity reflected an approaching second payment of 70p on the partly-paid stocks. Scottish Power is believed to have around 1m small shareholders and Hydro-Electric about 600,000, who must sell their shares by the close of business on Friday if they wish to avoid making this payment. A third and final payment is due a year later. Analysts were generally bullish, believing the shares will perform well once the second payment is out of the way. Wellcome fell 25 to 1092p, reflecting general weakness in the drugs sector, led by recent falls on Wall Street. Troubled chemicals group MTM recovered 6 to 39p after announcing that the banks had extended their grace period until the end of May. Boots lost 17 to 472p on US selling. Disappointing results from clothing retailer Austin Reed pushed the 'A' shares down 18 to 260p. Continued optimism over the prospect of a cut in interest rates boosted housebuilders. Wimpey advanced 9 to 85p. Property groups basked in similar surrounds, Hammerson 'A' climbing 6 to 375p. Securities house SG Warburg upgraded Granada after a meeting with the group. The shares put on 4 to 275p in busy volume of 3.7m. The house has lifted its forecast slightly to Pounds 115m for this year and by Pounds 9m to Pounds 145m for 1993.

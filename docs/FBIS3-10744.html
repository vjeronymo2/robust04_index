After debating a list of eight candidates presented by an ad  hoc high-level commission for several weeks, Orellana Mercado  and Florentino Alvarez Alvarado [the new deputy prosecutor  general] were elected by the congressional plenary last Thursday.    Orellana Mercado addressed the deputies briefly after he was  sworn in and promised to do his work with loyalty to the  country, people, and God. He said he would make efforts to  strengthen the pillars of democracy and guarantee that all  Hondurans are finally able to enjoy a state of law and happiness  together with their families. "I will contribute so that,  together with you, we can build the country's future," Orellana  Mercado told the deputies.    Alvarez Alvarado was not sworn in as deputy prosecutor  general last night because, due to personal reasons, he was  unable to attend the Congress session. He will, thus, be sworn  in the coming days.</p>

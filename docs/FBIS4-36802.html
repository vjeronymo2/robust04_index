			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, deputy chairman of </F> South Yemen Presidential Council, by Lutfi Shatarah; place and  date not given]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Sanaa stresses  that Aden is seeking by all means to internationalize the Yemeni  situation.    [Al-Jifri] The issue has been internationalized by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih twice: once when he signed a document on the  formation of a joint military committee which included brothers  in Oman and Jordan and French and U.S. friends.    He thereby wanted to embarrass (President) 'Ali Salim al-Bid  and portray him as the one who was rejecting the solutions, so  al-Bid had to sign. He internationalized the issue for the  second time when he launched military aggression against all the  southern territory and not against the Socialist Party as he  claims. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] Are you satisfied with the Arab and international  positions on the war in Yemen?    [Al-Jifri] Most of our Arab brothers and friends have  adopted cordial stands which we will never forget. We thank  them for these stands, which our people appreciate.    [Shatarah] And the U.S. position?    [Al-Jifri] It too is a serious position which demonstrates  understanding of the issue.    [Shatarah] There are reports that the north is implementing  a plan aimed at separating Hadhramaut from the south, setting up  a Hadhrami state, and then merging the other southern  governorates with the north?    [Al-Jifri] That has not run, nor will it run, through the  mind of anyone in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. If  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's aim is to achieve that through the  aggressive war he has launched, he will not achieve it.  [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] Do you believe that the delay in recognizing the  DRY has contributed to the escalation of the fighting?    [Al-Jifri] World states are dealing with us -- which is a  tacit recognition. As for official recognition, without doubt  it is on the way. Because we have a cause and rights. And  because our people have maintained a heroic steadfastness  unprecedented in our contemporary history. They have made great  sacrifices for the sake of the DRY. World states cannot ignore  something like that.    [Shatarah] 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih says that he will not hold a  dialogue with the Socialist Party leadership but, instead, with  the moderates and the unionists, in the sense that he rules out  dialogue with you as a new leadership in the south.    [Al-Jifri] And who said that he is the absolute master in  this world and thus can exclude whomever he wants and accept  whomever he wants? Let him say what he wants. [passage omitted]    [Shatarah] What measures will you take in the event of the  failure of the cease-fire attempts and the international envoy's  mission?    [Al-Jifri] 'Ali 'Abdallah announced (for the media) his  agreement to implement the Security Council resolutions in  letter and spirit. But -- as usual -- he failed to fulfill  that. And we have no other option than to stand fast, resist,  and prevent him from entering, seizing, and toppling the DRY  (Aden). However, we will comply fully with the cease-fire. And  we will use our right to defend ourselves, the land, and out  honor.    And the only solution to this matter is the dispatch of  international observers to supervise the cease-fire. [passage  omitted]    [Shatarah] What truth is there in the reports of Jordan's  involvement in sending military engineers to work with northern  forces?    [Al-Jifri] I have no details about that matter, and it was  not expected of the brothers in Jordan. [passage omitted]</p>

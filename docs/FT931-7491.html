			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Butterflies before the first date: Major's meeting with Clinton matters far more to the UK leader than the US president It has been impossible to miss the apprehension in John Major's entourage as he prepares for his first visit this afternoon to Bill Clinton's White House. The anxiety is understandable. The UK and US leaders have never met. They confront a formidable array of issues. President Clinton's latest salvo against subsidies for the European Airbus consortium has provided an awkward reminder of the trade disputes souring transatlantic relations. The Gatt world trade talks have stalled. Washington is retaliating against what it judges to be unfair support for European steel companies. Other trade rows loom on the horizon. Britain is further discomfited by the moral dimension that President Clinton promises to inject into US relations with the rest of the world. Visible already in his approach to Bosnia and China, this has added a fresh uncertainty to the world disorder that has followed the end of the cold war. The administration's decision to back the peace efforts of Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance in Bosnia has removed some of the initial transatlantic friction over its approach to the crisis in the former Yugoslav province. But there are still doubts about how it will respond as events continue to unfold. Further afield, the US moral tone is viewed as a threat to the prosperity of Hong Kong during the critical period before the colony's transfer to Beijing. A decision by the new administration to revoke China's Most Favoured Nation trading status on human rights grounds would jeopardise 15 per cent of Hong Kong's exports. Then there is the awkwardness caused by President Clinton's decision to send an emissary to Northern Ireland. It is a problem that can, and almost certainly will be, smoothed over, but a nuisance nonetheless. There are more fundamental strategic concerns for the UK. Washington plans to scale down to 100,000 troops its commitment to European defence: this is judged in London not to threaten the US's pivotal role in Nato. But Mr Major fears that, if Washington were to go much below that figure, it would seriously threaten the alliance that has kept the peace in Europe for 40 years. The underlying question concerns how the US sees its place in the world  - whether it decides to look westwards to the Pacific for its future, rather than eastwards to Europe - more than bilateral relations with Britain. But historical associations mean that the uncertainty about the new administration's response to that question is felt most acutely in London. So it is an important meeting: but much more so for Mr Major than for Mr Clinton. Politically on the defensive at home, the UK prime minister has to demonstrate that he remains a force on the world stage. To do that he must be seen to get on with the first Democrat in the White House for 12 years. Mr Clinton, taking a few hours off from selling the bold domestic programme which he set out last week in his state of the union address, has nothing to prove to his British cousins. For weeks now, UK officials and ministers have been explaining why the encounter will go well: the special relationship, a concept still prized in London if rarely mentioned in Washington, will be reaffirmed. Their arguments go something like this: The two men are both 40-something, representatives of the new generation of world leaders for the 1990s. They will be around long after President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl have left to write their memoirs. The president, it must be admitted, is a Democrat. But if you discount the labels, that does not leave him far removed on the political spectrum from Mr Major's brand of conservatism. And if a couple of Tory henchmen helped the former president, George Bush, in the US election campaign, nobody told the prime minister. Sometimes the claims made for the forthcoming meeting are amusingly extravagant. The two men, it is said solemnly, will find common cause in their similarly humble backgrounds. No one bothers to fill in the detail of the shared boyhood experiences of the Rhodes scholar from Arkansas and the self-made politician from Brixton. But there are also more substantial points. It is suggested that one of Mr Clinton's first acts was probably to draw up a list of the foreign policy issues that could distract him from the priorities of his domestic agenda. Beside each, he will have noted the position of each of his main partners. A glance down the list will have confirmed that Britain appears most frequently next to the US, as its most consistently dependable ally. And the cold-war habit of close co-operation on military, intelligence and security questions has been reinforced by joint action against Iraq. The arguments add up to a reasonable pitch; and one that US diplomats in London have been happy to substantiate. Mr Raymond Seitz, the Anglophile US ambassador, has been bustling around Whitehall, confirming the symbolic significance of Mr Clinton's decision to put Mr Major near the top of his list of visiting world leaders. The Japanese must be furious. Mr Major's problem is that the intensity with which the pitch is made betrays the underlying apprehension. His officials are right on one level, wrong on another. He should get on well personally with the new president. He has a talent for making friends of old enemies - witness the bridges he built with Chancellor Kohl after Lady Thatcher's departure. There is no percentage for Mr Clinton in being anything but gracious to his guest. But the easy friendship and shared certainties that flowed from the coincidence of 12 years of Republican presidents and Conservative prime ministers will be impossible to recapture. With the ending of the cold war, Britain has less to offer. Mr Clinton has different preoccupations. The economic revival that buttressed Lady Thatcher's claim to a prominent role on the world stage has dissolved into grim recession. In crude political terms, Mr Major at present is weaker than any British leader since the 1970s. With a Democratic Congress behind him, Mr Clinton is as strong as any recent president starting a first term; and he has pinned the future of his presidency on the success of a domestic rather than an international agenda. So the astute minds in Whitehall have already adjusted their assessment of the relationship. Certainly Mr Major should be seen to get on with President Clinton. But the prime minister must emphasise an uncommon coincidence of interest between the two countries rather than press any claims for special privileges. Here Mr Major moves on to much firmer territory. He can offer no easy solutions to the trade problems threatening EC-US relations. But he can project London as Washington's staunchest ally in opposition to a fortress Europe, the honest broker between Washington and Brussels. No other member of the European Community is as unashamedly in favour of free trade. Few others are as committed as Mr Major to the EC's enlargement, to include first the Nordic countries and later the new democracies in eastern Europe. The unspoken question at the White House this afternoon will be: would President Clinton prefer France to set the tone for transatlantic relations? There is common ground across a broad swathe of foreign policy preoccupations. Mr Major proved in the final days of the Bush administration, in the confrontation with Saddam Hussein of Iraq, that Britain is as reliable an ally as a US president can expect. The same offer will be open to President Clinton. London may seem reluctant to join Washington on the moral high ground in its approach to the Bosnian crisis. But on a practical level Mr Major will offer firm support for Washington's determination to tighten the screw on Serbia and its leaders. He has kept to himself the serious doubts in Whitehall about the US plan to air-drop supplies to Bosnian communities. It is on the practice of co-operation that Mr Major is basing his hopes of establishing a rapport with President Clinton. But, if he is wise, he will allow talk of the special relationship to drift quietly into the history books.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article from "Castello's Column" by Marcelo Pontes: "Lula's </F> PhD and the Others' Sins"]    [Text] Five years after his 1989 election defeat, but  principally following his trips around the country, Workers  Party (PT) candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva is now more  mature and better prepared.    Lula is no longer the threat that led [Sao Paulo State  Federation of Industries President] Mario Amato to predict,  during the last elections, a flight of businessmen from the  country if he won. Yet there is also no guarantee that, once  elected, Lula will become a traditional president, like all the  others.    He begins by saying that he will not govern the country from  Planalto Palace but he will be a field president, travelling the  country, getting closely involved while solving the people's  problems, and governing, together with his cabinet, in the  field. Naturally, there is some electoral rhetoric in this. But  beyond his promise of a new governing style, we have seen that  Lula's trip around the country has made him a candidate apart  from the rest.    He did not begin campaigning with a government model  prepared  by experts in the great urban centers in mind. He comes from  the interior, heading for Brasilia with his heart and mind on  problems that are simpler and more important for the small  communities, for the humblest groups of professionals.    This union leader, who 15 years ago raised the conscience of  the Sao Paulo industrial belt metal workers, found during his  tours in the interior that 300,000 babassu nut harvesters in  northeastern Brazil, a group larger than the Brazilian  automobile industry workers, work under subhuman conditions.    Lula speaks of a farming cooperative in Telemaco, Borba,  (Parana), or of the peasants in Mirandiba (PE) [Pernambuco) or  in Nova California (AC) [Acre], like Fernando Henrique Cardoso  speaks of the Cavallo Plan in Argentina, or of the stages of an  economic stabilization program.    Naturally, the intellectual education of the two cannot be  compared. Fernando Henrique is a professor with a PhD from the  Sorbone University. Lula, who barely reads and writes, has  gained a PhD on Brazil. It would not be surprising if, once  elected with this curriculum, Lula ends up being a simple  councilman, or a super mayor. But equally, nothing guarantees  that Fernando Henrique's respectable curriculum and that of his  not-always-respectable allies will ensure that he wins the  elections. At least the coarse curriculum of Lula is more  useful in obtaining votes than the text books of Fernando  Henrique, mainly because this is a country of illiterates.    Beside truly representing Brazil and maintaining a  continuous  line of political consistency -- Lula arrived in migrant worker  trucks to become a factory worker in Sao Paulo, lost a finger  while working on a power lathe, defied industrialists and  generals, broke with labor union taboos, resigned his deputy  mandate disgusted with Congress, and began smoking expensive  cigars without losing his custom of drinking sugar cane brandy  like a farm hand -- Lula's current main campaign asset is the  sins of his contenders.    Orestes Quercia, considered the probable winner of the  internal PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] elections,  received a setback that will be very hard to overcome: the  attorney general is charging him with violating Law No. 171 on  fraud, in a case of importing weapons from Israel to equip the  Sao Paulo police when he was governor. Jose Sarney, who expects  a miracle from the PMDB machinery, is Lula's ideal contender and  the PT's best way to approach the PFL [Liberal Front Party],  which has joined Fernando Henrique. Leonel Brizola is  practically ignored by one third of the national electorate --  22 percent in Sao Paulo, and 11 percent in Minas Gerais.    Fernando Henrique is experiencing a delicate moment. As  finance minister, he obtained an economic miracle: he created  two inflations: one in real cruzeiros which he doubled from 20  percent to 40 percent; and another in URV [Real Value Unit]  which is expected to reach 2.62 percent in April or 5.86 percent  in a hypothetical calculation since January. Fernando Henrique  depends on the success of the implementation of the new  currency, the real. It is still doubtful if eventual success in  curbing inflation will allow him reduce the distance between him  and Lula.    As a candidate, Fernando Henrique has still not left his  office. Although he allied with the PFL, he has faded and  obtained no gains. It took too long to reach the alliance. He  lost some colleagues in this effort. In the process to choose a  running mate for his ticket, an Alagoas senator, he ended by  dividing the very party bloc he wanted to add to his own.  Fernando Henrique runs the risk of being abandoned by the urban  educated middle class that did not approve his alliance with the  PFL and of losing the rural PFL followers if he does not quickly  put out the fire in his alliance. In all, he is doing favors for  Lula which the best campaign strategists would be unable to  predict.    If all this were not enough to allow Lula begin to show a  winning profile for the first voting round -- even the numerous  factions in his own party, including the most radical ones,  suddenly seem to have been pacified -- there still floats in the  air the Ayrton Senna effect. The feelings awakened by Senna's  example must be channeled somewhere.</p>

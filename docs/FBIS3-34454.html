This statement was made yesterday to  HA'ARETZ by Fatah member Sufiyan Abu-Zayida in reaction to a  report by security elements on the emerging cooperation between  Fatah Hawks squads and Hamas.    "In their press interviews, Dr. Ibrahim Yazuri and Khalid  al-Hindi have encouraged the Fatah Hawks to act against  Israelis," said Abu-Zayida, the PLO liaison with the Israeli  authorities. Yesterday he was mentioned as one of the young  leaders who have lost control over the Hawks. "It stands to  reason that if they meant to forge such cooperation, they would  not run to the press with their remarks of encouragement. In my  opinion, this is just a guess on the part of the Shin Bet."  [passage omitted]    A senior officer said yesterday that the experimental period  in which the pursuit of Fatah members was discontinued in return  for their stopping all terrorist activity failed and therefore  was called off. [passage omitted]    Over the past month, the security forces have resumed their  efforts to capture Fatah activists. Their most recent operation  on 3 February, in which senior Fatah activist Salim Mu'affi was  killed, caused an uproar in Fatah.    Faysal al-Husayni said last Sunday that the Palestinians  never really accepted the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] proposal  concerning fugitives, including the clause proposing that the  fugitives lay down their arms and transfer to Tunis.    The senior officer added that Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister  and defense minister, was briefed by senior IDF officers on the  situation and voiced great disappointment in Fatah's inability  to control the terrorists and their squads. He added that Rabin  has endorsed the continued pursuit of terrorists.</p>

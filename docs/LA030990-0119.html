			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUDY QUESTIONS VALUE OF BIOTECH DRUG  </P> <P> An expensive drug used to dissolve blood clots in heart attack victims is no  more effective than a competing drug that costs one-tenth as much, a large  Italian study of TPA and streptokinase released Thursday in Florence shows.  </P> <P> The long-awaited study, involving 19,000 patients, is the largest study ever to  directly compare the drugs in heart attack victims.  </P> <P> It shows that there was no significant difference between the two drugs'  effectiveness among patients treated with TPA or the much less expensive  streptokinase.  </P> <P> TPA is sold under the brand name Activase by South San Francisco-based  Genentech. Streptokinase, sold under the brand name Streptase, is distributed  by West German drug giant Hoechst AG.  </P> <P> Genentech's Activase, a genetically engineered drug, sells for $2,200 a dose  while stretokinase sells for $200.  </P> <P> Genentech has long contended that its drug is superior to streptokinase, and  says the high price is justified because of the costs of developing the drug.  </P> <P> TPA is Genentech's major product. Last year it sold nearly $200 million worth  of the product.  </P> <P> Genentech's stock dropped $1.125 a share to $26.125 on the New York Stock  Exchange on Thursday.  </P> <P> In a statement, the steering committee for the study concluded, "On the basis  of the present trial's findings, the choice of thrombolytic (clot dissolving)  treatment cannot be based on clinical grounds alone but must take full account  of public health economy considerations."  </P> <P> It also said the higher rate at which TPA dissolved clots did not "appear to  correspond" to a better outcome for heart attack patients.  </P> <P> Genentech said the results of the study did not use a treatment regimen that is  favored in the United States, which makes the results of little use to American  doctors.  </P> <P> "It appears that this trial offers limited new information to the understanding  of thrombolytic therapy," said G. Kirk Raab, president and chief executive of  Genentech.  </P> <P> "Although we don't know how this study will ultimately impact our sales, we are  confident that physicians will consider their personal experience in treatment  over 170,000 patients with TPA in the past two years," Raab said in a  statement.  </P></p>

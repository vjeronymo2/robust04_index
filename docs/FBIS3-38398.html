			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ruediger Moniac: "Ruehe Sacrifices High </F> Technology"]    [Text] Bonn -- Today, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of  the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], will give a detailed  report in the Bundestag Defense Committee on the additional 1.25  billion German marks [DM] in cuts that have been imposed on the  Bundeswehr. Additional "severe cuts," particularly in the  sphere of personnel and material, had become necessary, sources  from the Defense Ministry in Bonn said yesterday.    The DM150 million that should have been spent on arms and  equipment and has now been canceled, also affect the "Midas"  project, which has been regarded as important by the Navy.  Midas is a radar-controlled automatic gun for boats and ships  for the defense against so-called seaskimmers, that is to say,  missiles that attack a few meters above sea level. A total of  DM40 million had been earmarked for the development of Midas in  1994.    The cuts hit the Mauser company in Oberndorf/Neckar out of  the blue. It had itself invested as much as DM40 million into  developments. Within one year the weapons system could have  been ready to go into production, company sources said.    Between the Bundeswehr and Mauser there is a development  contract for Midas, which had been orally confirmed by the  responsible state authorities last summer. The company has  stated that, as a result of the recent Bonn decision to impose  further cuts, which is also putting the "Bundeswehr Plan 95" out  of force, the "contract is in the air." The "Midas case" is  only one of a whole series that highlight the Bonn coalition's  "entire dilemma of making cuts without a concept" in the sphere  of the Bundeswehr, representatives of the business community  said. According to experts, the automatic gun is one of the top  products of German armament technology. By cutting the funds  for development, Mauser is losing its "system ability" in this  sector. The company of Oberndorf, which belongs to the Diehl  group of Nuremberg, and has reduced its personnel of 1,500 in  the past few years by half, can no longer keep experienced  engineers and technicians. "Not only Midas shows that this is a  dangerous spiral," one industrial expert emphasized: "The  Bundeswehr no longer finances innovation, but puts the little  money it has only into the maintenance of aging arms and  equipment until everything comes to a halt. And then?"    The industry is losing is national and international ability  for cooperation in the sphere of armament technology. The  expert warned that at one point it will no longer be able to  procure weapons for the German Armed Forces at home.</p>

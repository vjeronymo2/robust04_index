			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hungary intends to submit its application for EU  [European Union] membership in April, with parliament's  approval, Prime Minister Peter Boross said in Bonn. In the  second half of the year Germany, as the president of the EU at  the time, will put the extension of the organization on the  agenda. Chancellor Kohl considers it a wise decision that  Hungary wants to submit its application to the EU already in the  first half of the year. Helmut Kohl met the press after having  a two-hour discussion with Prime Minister Peter Boross in Bonn.    The Hungarian prime minister rules out the possibility of  any  conflict similar to the one in the former Yugoslavia evolving  between Hungary and its neighbors because of the nationalities.  Peter Boross pointed out in Bonn that Hungary observed the UN  sanctions against Yugoslavia despite the fact that it had so far  suffered a loss of 1.5 billion dollars because of them, and it  still could not see greater international willingness for  compensation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent] </F>   [Text] Evidence of an increase of epidemic proportions in  asthma among children, and related allergies such as hay fever  and eczema, are published today by the Parliamentary Office of  Science and Technology, which blames the rise in part on fumes  from vehicles.    The committee says the Government should consider powers to  order people to stop driving in cities when air pollution  reaches levels which spark asthma attacks. It says voluntary  exhortations used at the moment may not be enough.    One in 10 children are thought to be suffering from asthma  --  double the rate 10 years ago. In 12 years the annual cost of  treatment had risen from &pound;50 million to more than  &pound;350  million in prescription charges alone.    The committee says children are subject to a cocktail of  chemicals from motor vehicles which could be at least part of  the cause. Passive cigarette smoking and home pollutants such as  dust mites could also be a factor.    The report says: "While the evidence is not conclusive, the  long-term trend in road traffic would be consistent with the  observed trends in respiratory allergies, and vehicle exhausts  are the primary cause of pollutants. Government failure to  monitor the situation is criticized by the committee, which says  the UK has by far the smallest number of air monitoring stations  in the European Union.

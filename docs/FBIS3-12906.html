			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Economic Cast"] </F>   [Text] Ahmad Quray', alias Abu-'Ala', chairman of the  Palestinian Reconstruction and Development Council has told MBC  Television that Palestinian and Israeli delegations, who have so  far held five rounds of economic negotiations, are having  differences over the issue of trade and customs duties.    [Begin Quray' recording] We have made some progress on  banking and financial issues but we are having a real dispute  over trade and customs duties. I wish to point out that, first  of all, a new reality has come into being and we must handle  issues on the basis of this. The Palestinian territory cannot  remain in the same condition during the transitional period as  it was during the occupation phase. A new reality exists that  should apply to all spheres of activity, be they political,  economic, or social. This is the new reality. Another issue is  the following: According to the Declaration of Principles there  will be economic cooperation with Israel but the Palestinians  will continue to have strategic economic relations with their  larger Arab homeland. Israel must understand the Palestinian  trade relationship with the Arab homeland. The Palestinians  must make their own decisions on this matter. A third area of  dispute is connected with our determination to decide the level  of customs duties and taxes to be imposed on economic  development projects. We must also be the only authority to  determine how much tax is paid on certain basic commodities.  [end recording]</p>

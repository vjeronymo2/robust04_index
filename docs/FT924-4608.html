			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (20): Towards the new Europe EUROPEAN CORPORATE STRATEGY: HEADING FOR 2000 by Oliver L Landreth Macmillan Press, Pounds 35 THE KEY corporate battleground is now clearly that of Europe. Politicians hum and haw about the political and monetary future of Europe, but its economic future is already being shaped to a substantial extent by company policies and processes. The question of what strategies companies should follow has been the subject of academic treatises since the Single Market appeared on the horizon. What strategies companies are following is the question this book investigates. Landreth selects nine companies from the industrial, services and consumer goods sectors, originating from all over Europe (Portugal and Italy in the south, Scandinavia in the north). There is also a chapter on how the European truck manufacturing industry is being restructured. The two largest and best-known companies profiled are CMB Packaging and SAS: middle-sized companies are the focus, though the lessons drawn from these cases apply even to the largest multinationals. What are the challenges and opportunities for European companies? First, the elimination of traditional competitive advantages, such as protected access to technology and markets; then, ever-more sophisticated and internationally-oriented consumers. Internally, companies need to improve logistics, consolidate brand image, centralise R&amp;D, and promote innovation on a Europe-wide and indeed global basis. Contrarily, there is the challenge of handling cultural diversity and attempting product customisation. Landreth does not go as far as his research should take him, and continues to talk about the need for 'clearly-defined country strategies . . . (and) national sales, service and distribution plans': if these do not already exist, there is not much hope for any company; but, on the other hand, these national groupings will increasingly be replaced by language-groupings. The book is also marred by its prose, which is neither stylish nor clear: 'Economies of scale are now being acquired through mergers and acquisitions, as are the effects of the learning curve.' However, because Landreth has not followed the usual path of studying only Fortune 500 type companies, he has put together an unusual book which will be useful to a wide range of companies.</p>

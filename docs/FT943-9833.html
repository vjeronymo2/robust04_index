			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Grooming for higher things? Sir, In former days that nice Mr Clement Crisp used to tell us all about the ballet. Then he ventured into matters sartorial, although only as regards the Royal Opera House, which might still be regarded as his territory, I suppose. (He would, no doubt, be pleased to learn that I would willingly wear white tie every night at Covent Garden to earn the ticket price rebates suggested by one correspondent, probably with decorations.) Now, however, he appears to have assumed the mantle of your culinary correspondent ('Awful lapse in taste', August 8). Will he be continuing this foray through the various sections of your illustrious and delightful paper over the forthcoming weeks? Perhaps, my dear Sir, you are grooming him to be your successor. Neil King, 169a York Way, Camden Town, London N7 9LN</p>

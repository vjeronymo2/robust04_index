			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Marina Klimova and Sergei Ponomarenko of the Soviet Union won the judges, but  Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay of France won the crowd at the European Figure  Skating Championships at Leningrad.  </P> <P> To the overture from "My Fair Lady," world champions Klimova and Ponomarenko  easily defended their European title in ice dancing.  </P> <P> The Duchesnays, who delighted the crowd with a routine set to South American  music, were third. Skating to a rising crescendo of Pan pipes, reed flutes and  guitars, they depicted a struggle for freedom in South America. The program  ended with Isabelle perched perilously on her brother's knee as he was bending  backward.  </P></p>

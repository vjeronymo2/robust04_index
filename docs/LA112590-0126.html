			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOXING;  </P> <P> JACKSON WINS WBC MIDDLEWEIGHT TITLE  </P> <P> Julian Jackson knocked out Herol Graham of Britain in the fourth round Saturday  night to win the vacant World Boxing Council middleweight championship.  </P> <P> Graham, the British middleweight champion, dominated the first three rounds,  scoring with a variety of combinations and frustrating Jackson, who was missing  wildly.  </P> <P> But midway through the fourth round, when it appeared Graham (34-3) was in  control, Jackson suddenly floored Graham with a short right hand.  </P> <P> He was counted out by referee Joe Cortez of Atlantic City, N.J. Graham was on  the canvas for more than five minutes.  </P> <P> Jackson's victory gave him the WBC middleweight crown, vacant since Sugar Ray  Leonard retired earlier this year. He also holds the World Boxing Assn. light  middleweight crown.  </P> <P> Jackson (42-1, 39 knockouts), from the U.S. Virgin Islands, scored his 34th  consecutive knockout.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN BITES TOWN: OUT OF THE WATER CLOSET FROM THE OUTHOUSE TO THE GALLERY,  BATHROOM FIXTURES ARE NOW WORKS OF ART  </P> <P> AMONG THE ADJECTIVES least often used by my friends to describe me are "tidy"  and "fastidious." I share this with you not in any spirit of ugly  self-revelation but merely to acknowledge that what follows is not intended as  a critique of anyone else's lifestyle. The pot, having called itself black,  moves on.  </P> <P> I had a chance recently to get a fresh perspective on an aspect of modern life  that, if we're lucky and our personal plumbing doesn't obsess us, escapes much  notice. In a Westside community filled with galleries, tucked away among the  art spaces is a gallery of another sort, a continuing exhibition of what can  only be called world-class bathroom fixtures.  </P> <P> To walk through this wonderland of golden faucets, onyx bathtubs and commodes  whose seats are more commodious than most couches is to understand how close  the bathroom is to the American soul.  </P> <P> A good number of us, after all, still rate the foreign places we visit on the  basis of how closely their toilet paper resembles our own. And yet, many of us  are no more than a generation away from an outhouse. Some of us are only a  phone call away. So the grandeur of the fixtures, the incredible luxuries one  can lavish upon oneself while taking care of personal business may be the most  poignant way of telling ourselves how far we have truly come.  </P> <P> It may also be a way of erecting a wall of marble against the possibility of  slipping back.  </P> <P> When you see this stuff one bathroom at a time, the idea of water pouring out  of a silver eagle's mouth into a basin rimmed with Broadway marquee lights can  seem at least marginally sensible. There is a hotel in Washington, D.C., for  example, in which CBS occasionally puts me up for a night, where the bellperson  always reassures the visitor that he has made the proper choice of  accommodations: "You know, sir, we have the best bathrooms in Washington."  </P> <P> And I can say, without having conducted a scientific survey of the porcelain  palaces of our nation's capital, that it could be true. A shower stall built  for two; a tub long enough for Manute Bol to stretch out in; a phone beside the  toilet, which has been thoughtfully tucked away in a separate chamber, and  enough marble to choke a bank lobby.  </P> <P> As a visitor to Washington, you can somehow convince yourself that all this is  desirable and appropriate. After all, emissaries from a variety of foreign  lands might be staying here, and they are sophisticated enough that it takes  more than whisper-soft toilet paper to impress them.  </P> <P> But when you see hundreds of elaborate objets de bain lovingly displayed  together in a showroom, like art pieces, you get the idea that we are building  monumental shrines to our most basic needs. Parents should be taking their  2-year-olds to gaze at such a collection, promising, "If you learn potty well,  one day some of this will be yours."  </P> <P> For here is the Plaza Toilet (shown in bone), the Pompei Lav sink, the Galleria  Pedestal sink, the faucet handles with faux granite rings, the Windsor faucet  in satin gold (the handles look like gilded capitol domes, gold tassels flying  off the tops) and the Georgia sink in raspberry puree.  </P> <P> I've always thought people who named stuff had the great jobs of the world.  Someone gives wallpaper, carpeting, shoes, towels and sheets the fanciful  nomenclature that summons up images of the Riviera, or the South Seas, or the  heavens. But the folks who are paid to name the shapes and shades of sinks and  toilets must be laughing all the way to the cash machine.  </P> <P> Showrooms such as the one I roamed through don't raise to absurd heights the  bathroom alone. The kitchen is widely predicted, by those wide predictors I've  admired earlier in this space, to be the most important room of the '90s home,  and so kitchen design is running similarly amok. But kitchens have a  professional standard against which their equipment and decor can be measured  and to which they can aspire. In the salles de bains, all bets are off; there,  we are all professionals, and, sadly, we are all amateurs.  </P> <P> The ultrafine fixtures seem part of an elaborate spectacle to convince someone  (ourselves? our visitors? our cleaning personnel?) that something grand and  magnificent and imperial goes on in the bathroom. Somebody else is spending all  his time in there flossing and peering at hairlines and poking at pimples and  performing similarly grubby but necessary tasks.  </P> <P> The hauteur of certain outposts of the individual waste-disposal business is  especially piquant in light of the squalor that attends our communal attempts  to do the same job. Our landfills, full to bursting, are not lined in marble.  Our storm drains, dumping old motor oil into the ocean, do not boast golden  gratings. Old Styrofoam, our gift to the ages, is not gift-wrapped in raspberry  puree.  </P> <P> But, one bathroom at a time, we are making this planet a more exalted place to  be. Hey, I'll see you at the Plaza. Toilet, that is.  </P></p>

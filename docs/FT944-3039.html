			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Tribunal reform is intended to boost efficiency Streamlining rather than radical reform is the aim of the government's proposals for Britain's overburdened industrial tribunals, set out in a consultative document yesterday. The government also announced that it was preparing a bill for the current parliamentary session to consolidate all existing employment rights legislation. A further measure will be needed in the 1995-96 session to implement any of the measures set out yesterday. Industrial tribunals are independent judicial bodies chaired by legally qualified people appointed by the government's legal officers. They sit with two lay members - one drawn from a panel of employer members, the other from a panel of employee members - who are both appointed by the Department of Employment. The document, aimed at making tribunals more efficient and improving service to employees and employers, is part of the most comprehensive review of industrial tribunal activity since they were formed 30 years ago. Among radical options that appear to have been rejected is charging users of the tribunals. It is estimated that 80 per cent of employees who go to industrial tribunals are unemployed. Also, charging users would undermine the need for tribunals to remain open to employees seeking justice. The government's main proposals include the suggestion that the tribunals be called employment tribunals, rather than industrial tribunals. Among measures to improve procedures, it is proposed that tribunals would have discretion to dismiss cases judged to be hopeless at a pre-hearing review, and to dismiss a case during a hearing if its eventual failure became evident. To encourage the voluntary settlement of disputes, the document suggests that tribunals be required to take into account whether an applicant had sought to resolve their dispute with the employer before going to the tribunal. An employee should notify the employer in writing of his or her grievance and expect a reply within a 14-day period. The consultative document also lays out 'further possibilities' for reform, seeking comment from interested parties. These would involve: Provision of independent binding arbitration as a voluntary alternative to a tribunal hearing, where the parties agree. A statutory requirement on an employee to pursue a remedy of a grievance with the employer before a tribunal complaint can be made. Allowing chairmen of tribunals to sit alone - without the lay members, who represent employers and employees - for all except discrimination and unfair dismissal cases, with the discretion to sit alone in unfair dismissal cases as well. Giving powers to tribunals to set time limits on proceedings. Responses have to be sent to the Department of Employment by March 10 next year.</p>

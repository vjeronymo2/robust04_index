			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (12): Inhale jasmine sense the past - Tom Burns in the hidden city CONNOISSEURS of Seville descend on it throughout the year to sip a chilled fino, to inhale jasmine and orange blossom, to look at art treasures and to sense the past. The current hype about the city might put them off visiting it until the universal show is all over and that could be a mistake. The Expo months when everybody, starting with the locals, is packed into the Isla de la Cartuja's Exhibition zone until four in the morning, ought to be the best time to rendezvous with the half as old as time Seville that knows nothing and cares less about electronic visual displays. Instead of boarding an Expo-bound bus on the River Guadalquivir's embankment by the drum-shaped Torre del Oro watchtower, such visitors should cross the Paseo de Colon boulevard to the newly built Maestranza opera house and stroll into the city heading towards the Cathedral. There will be a Zefirelli production of Don Giovanni at the Maestranza in September and doubtlessly there will be many more to come in the years ahead. Those who really want to meet the role model for the Mozart-Da Ponte hero should visit the Hospital de la Caridad which lies just behind the opera house. Built as an old people's home in 1645, the Hospital's cool courtyard has all Seville's decorative bags of tricks - geranium pots, glazed tiles, stucco, and pastel strips of ochre and bull's blood on blindingly whitewashed walls. Its adjoining church drips with baroque ornateness. The building was endowed by the original Don Giovanni, an aristocratic hell raiser and womaniser called Miguel de Manara who became a charitable benefactor after narrowly surviving one of his endless duels or (according to another version) the death of his long suffering pious wife. Never one to do things by halves, Manara founded a religious order called the Very Humble Brotherhood whose principal job was to bury the city's paupers and its executed criminals. The Hospital, where he is buried, was Manara's chief legacy and two Valds Leal pictures in the Hospital's church were the weird emblems of the reformed rake's regained paradise. Valds Leal, a Sevillian contemporary of Velazquez, Zurbaran and Murillo, was commissioned by Manara to paint death with all the trimmings. His rendering of rotting flesh and crumbling earthy goods, of worms and maggots, is an astonishing allegory of the obsession with decay that marked the baroque period in general and Sevilla in particular. There are more art treasures and sensations in the Cathedral, a power statement if ever there was one, and in the Reales Alcazares, the nearby Moorish palace where all is languid lightness after the Cathedral's gothic gloom. Later Christian kings added extensively to the palace and to its gardens but they retained, even improved upon, the sherbet sparkle that the first emirs built into their home. There are scents aplenty in these gardens and they lead the visitor by the nose into the Barrio de Santa Cruz, Seville's pueblo within a city neighbourhood that lies beyond the walls of the Reales Alcazares. In the heart of the Barrio, the plaza de los Venerables is most Seville lovers' favourite bijou square. Occupying one of the plaza's facades, the Venerables building, once a home for retired Cathedral canons, has recently been restored to serve as an exhibition centre. It has a stunning columned patio built around a fountain that is driven, Moorish-style, into the ground. The ubiquitous Valds Leal decorated the chapel. On one corner of the plaza de los Venerables, the Casa Romn has smoked hams swinging from its roofbeams, period Sevillian pictures on the walls, sawdust on the floor, platters of tapas spreadeagled around the bar and ice cold fino on tap. There are umpteen such places in Seville but a good one for more sipping and nibbling close by is the Bar las Teresas which stands on Calle Teresa, the street where Murillo lived and died. Las Teresas has the inevitable bullfight photographs, glazed tiles and hams overhead. It also has a good-looking big wall clock which must have been locally manufactured. The clock has 'Sevilla' engraved on its face and it makes a telling point about the city's sense of pace for it has been stopped at 11 o'clock since as far back as anyone can remember. Nobody need be a Seville connoisseur to think of walking through the Barrio de Santa Cruz late at night when the moon hangs from the Cathedral's Giralda tower and purposefully getting lost among whitewashed alleyways and intimate plazas, dodging past orange trees, brushing against the hanging jasmine and avoiding the thorns of the bougainvillea creepers. But veteran Seville hands usually end up in a drinking haunt of old called Abades which has no welcoming sign on its great coffered doors. It is a 17th century town mansion that lies on Calle Abades number 13, just between the Barrio de Santa Cruz and the Cathedral. Sedately chic with decadent undertones, Abades is where people drink and chat into the early morning and reassure themselves that in Seville they are zillions of miles from anywhere, Expo '92 included.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro to write off at least CDollars 3bn Ontario Hydro, north America's biggest power utility, is to take write-offs totalling between CDollars 2.9bn and CDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.63bn), to be charged against 1993 income. The write-offs are part of a shake-up which started a year ago following the appointment of Mr Maurice Strong, former secretary-general of the United Nations Environment Programme, as chairman. Mr Strong has cut a swathe through the government-owned utility with the aim of transforming it from a bureaucratic, financially-stretched organisation into an operation run along business lines. Ms Eleanor Clitheroe, chief financial officer, said the charges give the utility 'a clean slate to proceed with its debt reduction programme'. The aim is to reduce Hydro's heavy debt burden, currently about CDollars 35bn, by at least one-third over the next decade. The write-offs, announced this week, are roughly double the figure projected six months ago. They include the cost of cancelling long-term uranium contracts negotiated with Denison Mines and Rio Algom at prices far above present market levels, and a write-off of surplus generating capacity. Details of the capacity write-downs have yet to be determined. Ms Clitheroe said that by taking the write-offs in one lump, Hydro will boost 1994 income from CDollars 250m to CDollars 600m. Due to lower costs and improved operating performance, it now estimates its operations virtually broke even last year, compared with earlier forecasts of a CDollars 200m operating loss.</p>

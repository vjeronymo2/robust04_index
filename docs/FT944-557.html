			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / UK study criticises post-communist state sales The quality of much privatisation in post-communist countries is very poor, argue Peter Young and Paul Reynolds, in a report from the London-based Adam Smith Institute, published yesterday.* 'Unless there are substantial reforms in the approach being taken, what will emerge will not be real market economies, but inefficient, partially collectivised, hybrid economies in which a bureaucratic elite still succeeds in exploiting the bulk of the population,' they say. The big mistake, argues the report, has been to forget the wider goal of establishing a competitive market economy. 'Instead, 'technical' privatisation, without liberalisation, has become the new objective.' The report's recommendations include: better integration of competition policy with privatisation; radical deregulation, combined with removal of barriers to entry of new companies; conversion of all share-holdings into ones that can be freely sold by their owners; national share registers, rather than registers managed by companies; and efforts to buy out the interests of entrenched managers, who remain dominant in most privatised enterprises. The Adam Smith Institute was the intellectual pioneer of privatisation in the UK. The authors of the report have themselves worked on behalf of the institute as advisers to several post-communist governments, including Bulgaria, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Mongolia. The report argues that mass privatisation is inescapable, given the scale of the inherited task. But present efforts suffer from significant defects, including: the wholesale transfer of unreformed monopolies into the private sector; creation of closed joint stock companies, whose shares cannot be sold without company permission; the sale of protected markets rather than just companies; restrictions on the goods and services that privatised companies can offer; conflicts between the different parts of governments involved in privatisation; use of residual state-owned shares by governments to exercise influence over enterprises; and the excruciatingly slow pace of privatisation in most countries. Privatisation, notes the report, 'is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the creation of a market economy'. Furthermore, 'the success of privatisation will be short-lived if the process is managed as an opportunity for enrichment amongst a bureaucratic or economic elite'. One big worry of the authors is over the failure to integrate competition policy with privatisation. 'In some republics, anti-monopoly organisations have reimposed price controls over organisations they deem as monopolies. . . . This constitutes reintroduction of the planned economy by the back door.' The solutions include liberal trade and 'strong action to ensure that new enterprises are free to enter markets.' A second worry is over how the shares are owned, registered and traded. In Russia, for example, share registries are maintained by individual companies. More important, 'closed company privatisation, especially when combined with the preservation of monopolies and a suffocating blanket of regulations, serves to preserve the old economic structure and system'. The persistent tendency towards chaotic over-regulation is a third big concern. 'Too many bureaucrats,' notes the report, 'still think that reforms are less important than forms.' One result is 'the culture of semi-illegality which prevails in post-Soviet industry and within administrative functions'. Yet this is inevitable when, for example, 'businessmen operating in Moscow today have to pay 51 separate taxes'. Moreover, 'over-regulation also undermines the authority of the state when the very constitutional upheavals of the present make respect for state authority paramount'. *Peter Young and Paul Reynolds, The Amnesia of Reform, Adam Smith Institute, 23 Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BL, Pounds 25.</p>

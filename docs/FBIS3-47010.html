Hata told Sadako Ogata, United Nations high commissioner for  refugees, that he wants to "positively consider" carrying out  the activities based on the law, Foreign Ministry officials said.    He made the remarks in response to Ogata's call for Japan to  utilize the law in the humanitarian field to solve problems  concerning refugees, the officials said.    Neither Hata nor Ogata specified the regions that might  recieve such Japanese assistance, they said.    Tokyo is likely to study possible humanitarian assistance  for  the former Yugoslavia, such as in the medical field and in  rescuing and repatriating refugees, after a government  fact-finding team returns from the region.    The mission, which is to leave Japan later in the day, is to  visit areas such as Zagreb, Skopje, Sarajevo and Belgrade.    The members are scheduled to meet Yasushi Akashi, head of  the  U.N. peacekeeping mission in the former Yugoslavia, as well as  other U.N. officials and government officials.</p>

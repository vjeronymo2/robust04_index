			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Text]  <H5>  High Risk Examination Process </H5>   It was not with a light heart that the Commission embarked  up  the process it was instructed to carry out by EC government  leaders. The examination of this report, on December 10-11 at  the EC Summit in Brussels, will be a highly risky business. The  Commission speaks of several hurdles that need to be cleared,  otherwise EC activities could become totally paralysed. This  year alone, the EC has repealed 158 proposals thought to be  technical or politically out of date because of the subsidiarity  principle.    This first hurdle consists of making sure that this  examination does not lead to a fresh in-depth debate and the  possibility of controversial texts being called into question.  Second, the simplification process is nonsensical unless the  Commission has a free hand to negotiate international agreements  and avoid duplication. Third, the EC has to decide just how far  the EC's exclusive area of business extends, for there is every  chance that ``the application of proportionality will meet  resistance from some national administrations, which because of  a lack of mutual confidence are anxious to obtain the most  detailed regulations possible.'' The Commission also wants to  extend the mutual recognition principle and to make better use  of the way in which it delegates its powers of implementation.    These conditions are nigh impossible. The enshrinement of  the  subsidiarity principle in the Maastricht Treaty was a highly  political matter during the negotiations and the result of a  difficult compromise between those seeking to extend EC  activities and those resisting the idea. John Major was the main  architect of the principle. The UK Prime Minister agreed to the  proposal to enlarge the Community's areas of business only on  condition that it would be compensated for by a control  principle, namely subsidiarity. Because of the No vote in June  1992 during the first Danish referendum on the Maastricht  Treaty, the principle became very popular in Denmark and  Germany, even though on first sight it hardly seemed a  vote-catching concept. It became so popular that at the  Edinburgh Summit in December 1992 half a dozen or so pages of  the European Council's conclusions were devoted to this subject.    Over above the issue of political rehabilitation, this still  leaves the basic problem: what is sought from Europe varies  quite considerably from one Member State to another and from one  national administration to another. ``Delegations which are most  in favour of subsidiarity at a political level are those which  call for harmonisation in the finest detail at legal level,''  notes the report.</p>

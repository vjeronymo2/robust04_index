			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belgian ambassador in Paris is trying to get  clarifications on the French proposal for international military  intervention in Rwanda aimed at putting an end to the massacres.  However, Belgian Defense Minister Leo Delcroix has already  defined the main lines of Belgium's position: There is no  question of sending Belgian troops to Rwanda again. Belgium is  hated by the Hutu extremists and the 10 Belgian paratroopers  killed in April have not been forgotten. Nevertheless, Belgium  could supply France with military and logistical aid. Our  country is thoroughly familiar with the infrastructure of Rwanda.</p>

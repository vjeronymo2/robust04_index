			<p>BFN     [Text] John Malecela, prime minister and first vice  president, has reiterated that the achievement of peace in  Rwanda will depend on an agreement by all sides involved in the  country's conflict. Speaking to a Rwandan Government delegation  which is in the country for peace talks, Honorable Malecela said  last night that all sides in the conflict must agree on three  issues which are vital to ending the hatred between them. The  prime minister said the issues include the need to immediately  stop the war between the government and the Rwandan Patriotic  Front [RPF] forces, an end to the killing of innocent civilians,  and the implementation of the peace agreement signed in Arusha  in August last year.    The Rwandan Government delegation led by Communications and  Transport Minister Andre Ntagerura and that of the RPF led by  RPF Chairman Alexis Kanyarengwe are in Arusha for a meeting  aimed at bringing peace to Rwanda. Because of the RPF's stand  that it cannot sit at the same table as the government  delegation, the prime minister is compelled to meet the  delegations in different sessions at the Arusha State Lodge.  This morning Honorable Malecela has held talks with the RPF  delegation.</p>

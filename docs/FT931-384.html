			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Codan pays DKr1.27bn for Hafnia insurance unit CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, yesterday acquired the insurance and financial service operation of Hafnia, whose parent company went into receivership in August. Codan, with premium income of about DKr2bn (Dollars 317.5m) in 1992, paid DKr1.27bn cash for Hafnia, with premium income about DKr7bn. The new group will have a market share in Denmark of 18 per cent in accident business and 12 per cent in life business, said Mr Peter Zobel, chief executive in Codan. The sale, which followed the failure the find a buyer through a tender process, became a matter of urgency last week. The group's capital adequacy ratio fell below the legal minimum when the price of shares in the other large Danish insurer, Baltica Holding, fell sharply. Hafnia owns just over 33 per cent of Baltica Holding's shares. On March 15, Baltica Insurance offered to buy Hafnia's insurance business if no other buyer could be found, and it looked at the time as though an all-Danish solution had been found to the chaos created by the collapse of Hafnia Holding and Baltica Holding. Codan does not need credit arrangements to finance the deal, said Mr Zobel. The Codan insurance company was founded by the Zobel family. Mr Peter Zobel, is the fourth generation of the family to run the business, although Sun Alliance, with 70 per cent of the shares, has been in control for over 20 years. Codan has concentrated on core insurance business and avoided the kind of ventures into banking and other financial service and investment activities which brought Hafnia Holding and Baltica Holding to their knees. It has consistently been the most profitable of the larger Danish insurers, although losses on its securities portfolio caused a net loss of DKr74m in 1992, compared with a profit of DKr275m in 1991.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 4 Apr (EFE) -- The Brazilian Foreign  Ministry today reports that Brazil has agreed to the naming of  Ramon Sanchez Parodi as new Cuban ambassador to Brasilia.  Sanchez will replace Jorge Bolanos.    In an official note, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry stressed  that between 1977 and 1989 Sanchez occupied "one of the most  relevant and sensitive posts for Cuban diplomacy" as head of the  Cuban Interests Section in the United States.    From 1989 to date, Sanchez, 55, has been a vice minister of  foreign relations, a post to which Bolanos has now been  promoted. Bolanos held the post of Cuban ambassador to Brazil  for 7 years.    Brazil resumed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1986 during  Jose Sarney's government, after an interruption of more than two  decades following the implementation of the one-party system on  the island.    Brazilian companies have shown increased interest in  economic  and financial relations with Cuba, especially following the  recent economic opening process.</p>

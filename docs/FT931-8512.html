			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Clinton package wins favourable public reaction PRESIDENT Bill Clinton and his cabinet yesterday embarked on the task of turning his four-year, Dollars 500bn (Pounds 350bn) package of tax increases and spending cuts into reality lifted by favourable public reaction, but facing hostility from Republicans. Overnight opinion polls, although narrowly based, suggested that three-quarters of those who heard the speech approved of its proposals, 60 per cent of them enthusiastically. At a meeting in St Louis, President Clinton challenged his Republican opponents, who attacked the package for raising taxes too much and cutting spending too little, to be specific about their proposals for spending cuts. 'No hot air; show me where,' he said. But Republicans questioned whether the efforts to reduce the budget deficit, which are concentrated in the later years of the four-year plan, would ever see the light of day. 'You hang your hat on what's going to happen three years from now. I'm sorry, but people don't believe that in America and on Wall Street,' said Mr John Kasich, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives budget committee. They also challenged Mr Clinton's presentation of his plan as a Dollars 500bn deficit reduction package. Although the plan includes Dollars 247bn of spending cuts and Dollars 246bn of tax increases in 1994-97, these are offset by Dollars 109bn of spending increases and Dollars 60bn of tax breaks. The resulting net reduction in the deficit will be only Dollars 325bn. This could spell difficulty for efforts to push the economic plan through Congress in an important budget bill, which congressional leaders hope to complete before the August recess. But Mr Dan Rostenkowski, who as chairman of the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee is one of those with the most control over the package's legislative fate, said that voters might be well ahead of their representatives in recognising the need for sacrifice to deal with the federal budget deficit. 'I honestly believe that the people, generally, are more willing than the Congress to move in this area,' he said. Mr Clinton is hoping to capitalise on this sentiment with a series of public meetings across the country. While Republicans are lining up en bloc against the bill, some Democrats, anxious not to be associated too closely with higher taxes before the 1994 elections, could also desert their president. Senator David Boren, a conservative Democrat from Oklahoma, urged Mr Clinton not to press the short-term stimulus component of his plan before he had won agreement on his broader deficit reduction proposals. If US voters react more favourably to the package, members of Congress might be emboldened. After extending an olive branch to the Republicans in his speech to Congress on Wednesday night, Mr Clinton yesterday sharpened his criticism of their economic policies in a book: 'A vision of change for America.' 'The election of 1992 was a mandate for change - and no wonder . . . such is the sorry legacy of 12 years of short-sightedness, mismanagement and protection of the privileged,' he wrote.

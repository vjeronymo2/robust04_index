			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Joint statement by ANC President Nelson Mandela and IFP </F> President Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the Royal Hotel in Durban on 1  March; on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] Both parties approached this meeting with a  determination to promote conditions in which the people of South  Africa as a whole can exercise their democratic right to make  political choices in accordance with their beliefs and  conscience.    Notwithstanding differences on constitutional matters, the  parties recognised the right of people to participate or not to  participate in the forthcoming general elections.    After a constructive exchange of views, the parties agreed  to  work together to ensure that canvassing for respective views  should be able to take place without let or hindrance.    In an effort to resolve outstanding constitutional  deadlocks,  the parties agreed to explore with their principals the  possibility of international mediation and in this regard the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] would consider provisional  registration in terms of the electoral act.    Both parties agreed that the present levels of violence in  our society were totally unacceptable and were jeopardising  conditions for socio-economic reconstruction and development.    They therefore resolved to redouble their efforts to  encourage their respective constituencies to participate in and  support National Peace Accord structures and all peace  initiatives.    While recognising the fact that members of the ANC [African  National Congress] and IFP are involved in political violence,  the parties are of the view that the primary responsibility for  the maintenance of law and order remains with the government of  the day.    The parties also explored the possibility of making greater  use of international expertise in areas such as conflict  resolution and the investigation of political violence.    It was agreed that a task group would be established in  order  to faciliate the strengthening of peace committees and to attend  to communication between the parties.</p>

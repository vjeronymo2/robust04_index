			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Eastern Europe 'failing to attract investors' - FT Conferences Progress in attracting private investment for infrastructure projects in eastern Europe has been painfully slow, Mr Thierry Baudon, deputy vice-president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said yesterday. Mr Baudon, speaking in London at a Financial Times conference on international infrastructure finance, said the telecommunications industry had made most progress in attracting private capital. There had been very little private investment in roads, power or water projects - other than a privately funded stretch of the M1/M15 motorway in Hungary linking Budapest with Vienna. Mr Baudon said the failure of eastern and central European governments to develop adequate regulatory and tariff structures to cope with the privatisation of vital services had made it very difficult to attract commercial investors. Private sector promoters needed to be reassured that they would be able to levy sufficient charges on users to repay loans and earn adequate returns on their investments. The cost to the public of water and power had traditionally been very low in these countries and it would be difficult to increase these charges. Governments seeking to minimise costs would have to increase the proportion of their own state investment in these projects. Private sector investors would have to be satisfied that tariffs and regulatory structures would not be changed in the future without adequate compensation, he said. Poland was most advanced in developing a regulatory framework to cope with privatisation but much work still needed to be done to satisfy international investors. Overmanning was another problem, Mr Baudon said, adding that he had not come across a single water treatment plant in eastern and central Europe which did not have twice as many employees as needed. Potential investors would also have to be confident that there would be sufficient customers to pay for their services. This was proving difficult in areas like energy generation, when demand for power was falling in many of these countries.</p>

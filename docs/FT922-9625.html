I look forward to my forthcoming visit to the European Parliament and the Council of Europe at Strasbourg, and to my visit to Malta later this month, France and Canada in June and Germany in October. My government attaches the highest importance to national security. It will continue to give full support to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and will work with our allies to adapt it to changing risks.

The United Kingdom's armed forces are being restructured to reflect these changes. Britain's minimum nuclear deterrent will be maintained. My government will work for a comprehensive and verifiable ban on chemical weapons, to prevent the proliferation of biological weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and to encourage greater international responsibility in conventional arms transfers.

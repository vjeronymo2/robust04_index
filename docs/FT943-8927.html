			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Jungle convention takes centre stage The most passionately held debate in Mexico's press last week was not, as might have been expected, on next Sunday's presidential election, but on a rebel-organised 'convention of democracy', held deep in the jungle in the southern state of Chiapas. The convention had been called by Subcomandante Marcos, the media-obsessed rebel leader, after he rejected a government offer for peace in Chiapas in June. Despite a lack of accommodation, water and electricity, and a 20-hour bus journey from the nearest town, some 5,000 delegates, accompanied by several hundred journalists, made the trip. To Mexico's leftist and independent newspapers the convention was one of the year's political highlights, a meeting in which the rebel Zapatista movement's future might be determined. Exercising a freedom that only a few years ago would have been unimaginable, a handful of newspapers devoted dozens of generally favourable articles to the convention. But to the right-wing, generally pro-government press, the convention either hardly mattered, or was seen as an attempt by a group of armed men to convert themselves into heads of a national revolutionary movement. In this quarter of the press, the meeting was barely reported at all, or stridently denounced. Proceso, Mexico's main weekly news magazine, led the pro-convention wing of the press, devoting two issues to the event before it began. The first carried a long, fawning interview with Marcos, who is famous enough for the cover photograph to feature just one of his eyes peering through his trademark balaclava. Marcos claimed extravagantly that the convention was the last hope of preventing Mexico slipping into civil war. Its second convention issue began with Marcos's unsubstantiated claim that the government has sought to buy him off with money. Desperate not to be outdone, La Jornada, a daily read by Mexico City's intellectual elite, sent one of the country's best-known writers, Eliana Poniatowska, to interview Marcos for a three-part series. The paper commissioned opinion pieces for and against the convention for the best part of two weeks. After the convention finally began, there was nothing to read about for two days. Marcos had imposed a news black-out, supposedly to prevent competition for scoops, but more likely to keep control on what was written. Journalists had to promise not to bring satellite telephones into the jungle, nor to smuggle stories out by messenger. After the convention ended - a day early because torrential rain destroyed the hand-made convention centre - La Jornada and a handful of others reported in voluminous detail the delegates' promise to shut down Mexico if there were fraud in the presidential election, along with Marcos's pledge to submit to the orders of the convention leaders, and not to be the first to take up arms. La Jornada immediately described the meeting as a great success. In an editorial, entitled 'Benefits of the Convention', the newspaper claimed the meeting had a positive response from diverse groups of society. 'The Convention was, more than an illegal assembly of guerrillas (as some political leaders, businessmen and citizens pretend to see it), a reunion where the search for political solutions instead of military short cuts prevailed.' Elsewhere the view could hardly have been more different. Marcos had banned several newspapers and both Mexico's main television networks from the convention, and all those not present fiercely attacked the rebel leader for censoring the press. Even La Jornada's correspondent seemed concerned when Marcos turned away the correspondent from Univision, the US Spanish-language network, on the grounds that Univision was controlled by Televisa, the Mexican television station that never puts Marcos on the air. La Prensa, a best-selling tabloid, attacked the convention through its main columnist, Juan Bustillos. 'With zero representativeness, the Zapatista convention was a democratic lie. For groups without national representation to discuss national issues, as if this right belonged only to them, and pretend their conclusions speak for the entire nation is madness or unreal,' he concluded. When the meeting finally ended, Marcos's pledge to submit the Zapatistas to new civilian orders was ridiculed by the editor of Summa, a new business daily with close links to Televisa. Summa had earlier in the year told its readers in an exclusive that Marcos was a former Jesuit priest, who is now suing the newspaper for libel, and has taken it upon itself to lead the anti-Zapatista attack. 'The National Convention of Democracy was a total failure,' wrote Jose Perez Stuart, Summa's editor. 'Independently of the weather, it collapsed.' Just winning is not good enough, Page 15</p>

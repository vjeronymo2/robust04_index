			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Australian satellite vanishes A Dollars 140m (Pounds 92.1m) satellite disappeared shortly after it was launched from south-west China on Monday. The loss endangers part of Australia's communications infrastructure and renews doubts over the capabilities of China's fledgling commercial launch industry. The Chinese Aerospace Ministry said the loss was caused by 'a satellite problem, not a launching problem'. China was 'not responsible for the loss of the satellite'. But the Californian builder of the satellite, Hughes Aircraft, said it had not ruled out a fault in the launch. Inquiries have been set up in China and California which could take several weeks to report conclusive findings. A finding against China could smother its recently successful efforts to win western contracts by offering cut-price launches. Optus Communications, the Australian telecommunications carrier that owned the satellite, needed it to replace one launched in 1985. It would have provided direct TV broadcasting, mobile and data communications and video conferencing. Mr Ian Boatman, Optus chief operating officer, said disruption to users would be minimised by re-allocating capacity on existing satellites. But analysts said the loss would reduce Optus's ability to compete in Australia's mobile phone market, and reduce the quality of service available to its broadcasting, defence and aviation customers. The loss could also force the postponement of subscription TV in Australia if the launch of a replacement satellite is delayed more than 18 months. Optus is owned by BellSouth of the US, Cable and Wireless of the UK, and Mayne Nickless, the Australian transport group.</p>

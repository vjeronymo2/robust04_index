			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN FEARFULLY CONFRONTS ATTACKER WHO STALKED HER  </P> <P> This was the moment Catherine Cline had been both dreading and awaiting since  last summer.  </P> <P> It was the chance to confront her former classmate at an Irvine high school who  had admitted stalking her for seven years, keeping detailed notes on her life  and finally attacking her with a baseball bat one grisly night in June, 1989.  </P> <P> But she was not ready for the meeting. As the acknowledged attacker, Steven  Schumacher, was led into a Santa Ana courtroom Friday, Cline, 22, began  trembling in her seat.  </P> <P> "When I saw him, I just wanted to get up and leave, I was so scared. I knew it  was stupid -- he was in chains and he couldn't break them, but maybe. . . ,"  Cline recalled later, her voice trailing off. "I just wanted to get out of  there."  </P> <P> But Cline stayed in the courtroom. And to her relief, so did Schumacher.  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge found that the 21-year-old defendant from  Irvine, confined to Patton State Hospital for psychological treatment since  October, is now well enough to stand trial for the assault and scheduled his  arraignment for later this month in Municipal Court in Fullerton.  </P> <P> If convicted on assault charges, he faces up to six years in prison. His lawyer  may seek an insanity plea in his defense.  </P> <P> Judge David O. Carter also kept the defendant's bail at $150,000, ensuring that  he will remain behind bars, at least for now, to face allegations that he  developed a violent obsession with his Woodbridge High School classmate, whom  he had never even met.  </P> <P> Standard bail in assault cases is $10,000. Prosecutors sought the higher level  for Schumacher because of what they described as the brutal and persistent  nature of his actions. Defense attorney Frank O'Rourke did not oppose the  higher bail, saying he will probably seek to lower it later.  </P> <P> "His offense was the product of a psychotic obsession," O'Rourke said,  previewing the defense. "But two psychologists have now said that he has  regained his mental stability. And what he needs now is to be restored to the  community."  </P> <P> Cline, the defense attorney acknowledged, "may be afraid for the rest of her  life -- we can't stop that. But in a free society, a person who's competent and  well and has served his time has a right to be free."  </P> <P> The victim said O'Rourke is right about just one thing: She will be scared the  rest of her life.  </P> <P> Cline, who manages her father's insurance office and models occasionally, said  that since the attack, "I don't trust anybody any more. People that I meet,  they have to prove themselves to me now."  </P> <P> She said she can't imagine living alone. And she is thinking of changing her  name for fear of what might happen when Schumacher is free.  </P> <P> Once Schumacher is released, Cline is convinced, "he'd try to find me again. .  . . He's sick. I just don't believe he could have gotten better this quickly."  </P> <P> Indeed, her mother, Carolyne Cline, said she began this spring to receive  repeated silent phone calls that she suspects were placed by Schumacher. She  has reported her suspicions to the police, saying the calls are reminiscent of  a string of calls -- as many as three or four a day -- that she got from  Schumacher before the assault.  </P> <P> Those earlier calls, also reported to police, culminated in this dire warning  from Schumacher, according to police and the mother: "You can tell your  daughter I'm going to break her neck for the last six years of my life."  </P> <P> Atop the emotional and physical scars of the attack -- she suffers some hearing  loss -- is the frustration of not knowing exactly what caused it, Cline says.  </P> <P> She said she thinks Schumacher was in a science class with her during their  senior year at Woodbridge. She also thinks that he was the unknown person who  sent her white roses once, but she does not remember ever having talked to him.  </P> <P> But Schumacher knew her. Asked by Placentia detectives after his arrest last  year how long he had had a "fixation" with Cline, he responded: "Seven years."  </P> <P> He had followed her and kept minute logs of her actions for eight months when  she lived in Irvine. Then, after Cline moved into a gated complex in Placentia  -- in part to escape the threatening phone calls -- he was somehow able to  track down her address through the post office, he said.  </P> <P> Finally, Schumacher said, he waited with a baseball bat in Cline's parking lot  the night of June 19, 1989. He knew the lot because he had mapped it out and  was able to get inside by following another car. Once Cline arrived, police  said, Schumacher emerged from the darkness and cracked her over the head with  the bat.  </P> <P> Bloodied, she managed to escape to her home and was rushed into intensive care  with a concussion.  </P> <P> Schumacher told police he had not meant to hit her so hard. Asked by police  after his arrest whether he still wants to hurt Cline, he said, "I don't think  it's worth it, no."  </P> <P> But police are skeptical.  </P> <P> In a letter sent just last month to authorities at Patton mental hospital,  Irvine Police Detective Peter K. Linton put it bluntly:  </P> <P> "Steven Schumacher's past speaks for itself with respect to his relentless  pursuit of Cline. I don't wish to see Cathy Cline murdered by this person in  the event he escapes or is released."  </P></p>

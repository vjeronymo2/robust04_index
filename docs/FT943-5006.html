			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: John Mansfield in black midway Better conditions in all its markets helped John Mansfield Group, the timber processing and manufacturing concern which came to the market in June, to turn in a pre-tax profit of Pounds 102,000 for the first half of 1994. This compared with a Pounds 36,000 loss last time. Turnover grew 8 per cent to Pounds 3.74m and earnings per share were 0.37p (0.12p losses). The company said that cash inflow following the flotation had significantly strengthened the balance sheet. Reduced bank borrowings had only a small effect on lower interest payments of Pounds 95,000 (Pounds 105,000) for the period and the main benefit would be seen in the second half.</p>

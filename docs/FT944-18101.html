			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Arts: 'Hamlet' without the prince The Birmingham Stage Company has been humouring the Hollywood actor Richard Dreyfuss, whose ambition was to direct Hamlet. This production at the Birmingham Old Rep marks his directorial debut and makes an evening of dire embarrassment. The text is cut to three hours including two intervals; it is a Coles Notes of a production - a summary of key points and key characters (no Fortinbras), with the key speeches all left in. Classroom didacticism sets the tone for Russell Boulter's 'To be or not to be'. He scrapes on the floor with chalk, just as he had earlier chalked 'Claudius' as if on the tables of his memory; and chops up the famous speech into ponderable nuggets like a schoolmaster at a blackboard, using a great deal of sign language. I half-expected him to flourish an eraser at 'ay, there's the rub'. Such a pun would have been in keeping with the levity of his first meeting with Horatio, the joke about the funeral meats coldly furnishing the marriage tables being delivered like a line by Ernie Wise. No mordant melancholy, inward searching, and philosophical ardour here. This is Hamlet as a plain, honest, reasonably intelligent young bloke, bounding through the play like an excitable young hound, lashing out at lover and mother, but enjoying himself the while, and perfectly amiable to the end. He evinces no psychological need for soliloquies, but these at least are clearly spoken, not like Claudius's soliloquy as given by George Irving, an indecipherable mumble. It may be that Dreyfuss dangerously intends to link Claudius and the Queen through poor articulation which betrays weakness of character. Certainly Irving's flat nasal vowels, glib but stumbling diction, and reliance on a still flappier sign language than Boulter's Hamlet are consistent with a shifty, amoral figure, over-anxious to persuade. Celia Montague's Gertrude presents a thoroughly superficial woman, bland-voiced as a bored and high-class London secretary. 'There is a willow grows askant the brook' is pure Home Counties. An opening tableau is imposed of Claudius and Queen in lustful embrace; and she goes as far in connivance with him - or is it really true love? - as to brandish a pocket-knife when he is threatened by Laertes. But I was more inclined to feel that the diction should simply be improved, and that of the gruffly Irish Laertes (Paudge Behan) and gabbling Horatio (Neal Foster) also. Steven Berkoff as the taped voice of the Ghost has his diction electronically treated, which confirms the resemblance of the actor miming the role to a gyrating Cyberman; but these fantastically distended vowels do provide a theatrical frisson. Bernard Kay is a nasty rather than a foolish Polonius, his prating very much abridged. Daniele Lydon's Ophelia has an aptly pre-Raphaelite prettiness and fragility though a fruity enough voice. The clumsiness of the staging is such that when Laertes leaps into her grave, Hamlet, Horatio and the grave-digger (Kay again) are already inside it, watching for the corpse to descend.</p>

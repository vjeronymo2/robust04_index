Also present was Dr. Muhammad Bani-Hani,  director general of the Corporation.    Mr. Marwan 'Awad spoke to the news desk about the talks:    [Begin 'Awad recording] We met with the director and the  joint delegation of the Chinese chambers of commerce and the  Chinese Exports Development Corporation. We reviewed the status  of economic and commercial cooperation between the two sides and  the agreements in place between our two countries. We pointed  out the investment opportunities that may induce Chinese  businessmen to invest in Jordan. We proposed instituting  assembly lines using Chinese technology and expertise.  Investors would benefit from Jordan's position and its  relations with neighboring states through the bilateral pacts it  has with them. This is in addition to the joint investment  opportunities that may open up for Chinese investors. We also  updated them on the measures taken to promote the export of  Jordanian products to China in settlement of a Chinese loan to  Jordan. It is a good opportunity for us to introduce Jordanian  products to the Chinese market.    In addition to increased trade, our aim is to reduce the  deficit in the balance of trade estimated at $35-40 million. We  import $60 million worth of goods from China and our exports to  China are on the order of $20-25 million. The Chinese side said  they were willing to raise the volume of bilateral exchanges and  boost their Jordanian imports. They requested and obtained  detailed lists of Jordanian goods that may form an export basis  to China.    For their part, the Chinese delegation will, through the  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Exports Development  Corporation, distribute the lists to the interested quarters.  [end recording]</p>

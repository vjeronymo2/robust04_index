			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: UK recovery hit by downturn across Europe ECONOMIC recovery is under way in the UK, but its strength is open to question, writes Emma Tucker. The most positive scenario outlined in the Economic Outlook is that low inflation and continued recovery in consumer confidence fosters stronger than expected growth. But rapid deterioration of economic prospects in Europe could check recovery as demand for exports stays subdued. The scope for further interest rate reductions depends on government ability to stay within its inflation target range of 1 to 4 per cent, says the OECD. But long-term bond yields of over 8 per cent, reflecting inflation expectations above the ceiling of the target range suggest that financial markets have yet to be convinced by the government's medium-term strategy for controlling inflation. Overall, the OECD's forecasts are slightly more optimistic than the UK government's own predictions, with gross domestic product forecast to grow by 1.8 per cent this year and by 2.9 per cent next. The rise in output will be led by a recovery in private consumption and residential contruction, broadening to other areas in the second half of the year as adjustment to corporate balance sheets tails off and de-stocking ends. After that, public investment and the 'continuing resilience' of investment by the newly-privatised utilities should act as a support to growth, according to the report. The OECD believes the government deficit will stop rising next year. It estimates, however, that the cyclical component of the deficit - the shortfall that occurs purely as a result of recession - accounts for only between one half and one quarter of the total deficit. In a separate article, the OECD points out that high tax revenues during the buoyant years of the 1980s were used by certain member countries to reduce tax rates, rather than to ensure greater fiscal consolidation and reduce public debt. 'The most that was achieved was a stabilisation of the debt ratio at the end of the 1980s, meaning that the current increase in government debt, relative to GDP, is taking place from a worse initial position than in the previous cycle,' it says. The UK's trade position is also a source of concern. The widening of the current account deficit, possibly rising to about 3 per cent of GDP, could constrain the scope for non-inflationary growth. The OECD believes the short-run outlook for wages, unit labour costs and retail prices to be benign. Its central projection, however, is that the sharp rise in import prices after devaluation will be largely offset by stable unit labour costs and considerable slack in the domestic economy.</p>

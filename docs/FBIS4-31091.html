			<p>BFN     [Text] Gyula Horn has become the MSZP [Hungarian Socialist  Party] candidate for the post of prime minister. At the  emergency congress which has just ended 431 delegates voted for  him out of the 450.    The delegates also decided unanimously that they will ask  the  SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] to become the MSZP coalition  partner. They have already sent the letter outlining this to  Ivan Petoe, chairman of the SZDSZ. In the letter the MSZP  emphasizes that the interest of the country would be served by a  joint government by the two parties. The Socialists are ready  for a compromise in every essential issue, the letter states.</p>

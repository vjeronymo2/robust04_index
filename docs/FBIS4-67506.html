			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [S. Litus video report; from the ``Dalniy Vostok'' program] </F>   [Text] What is to be done with the radioactive waste which  has accumulated in great quantities in our kray is an ominous  issue which does not seem to leave newspapers and television  programs these days. The tanker TNT 5 filled with radioactive  water is still moored at Zvezda in Bolshoy Kamen. Furthermore,  the condition of the vessel is such that there is no guarantee  the death-dealing contents will not spill out into the bay in  the near future. This would be an ecological catastrophe.  [video shows a nuclear submarine in dry dock, a rusty  tanker, a person testing radioactivity in the presence of a  naval officer, and a group of people inspecting the tanker]    Until recently, the liquid radioactive waste was simply  poured into the sea. Now, thanks to the active protests of the  world community, such dumping is forbidden. What are weto do?  The Japanese Government is offering to help us solve this  problem. Representatives of the neighboring states arrived in  the Maritime Kray, and together with our government  representatives and specialists they visited Bolshoy Kamen,  after which they held a meeting at the kray administration.  However, this conference gave rise to a strange feeling. The  sensation was that the terrible misfortune hanging over the  Maritime Kray concerns the Japanese Government far more than the  Russian Government. The Japanese say they are prepared to try  various approaches, allocate millions of dollars, and build and  assemble installations to process the radioactive waste.  However, they need assurances. Where, when, and what will be  the degree of Russian participation? From Russia there is only  incomprehensible haggling and no assurances. [video shows  a meeting of Japanese and Russian officials, then cuts to show  Litus interviewing Ye.I. Nazdratenko, leader of the Maritime  Kray administration]    [Begin Nazdratenko recording] You know very well  that the people of the Maritime Kray have voted overwhelmingly  for the new Constitution. They set a Russian Federation record;  72 percent of Maritime Kray voters cast a ballot. No other part  of the country did that. Maritime Kray once again proved its  maturity and citizenship. Maritime Kray residents once again  underscored that there should be integrity in Russia as stated  in the Constitution. The representatives of the federal  authorities here today said: you are here, it is your problem  and you have to solve it. I get the impression that the  Maritime Kray residents are like a dog which is kind and devoted  to its master. No matter how much the master abuses,  humiliates, or hurts it, this dog always crawls back to its  master. It crawls and crawls to prove its devotion to the  master. The master, who is in an inexplicable state at that  moment, simply kicks it in the face with his boot and pushes it  away, saying I do not want you, so go away. The situation here  strongly reminds me of this analogy. Just look for yourself!  The problems here are your problems, they keep saying.    At the same time, they have weighed us down with customs  duties, tariffs, and all kinds of conditions on maritime  operations. Here we have to implement the state system, laws,  and all the rest of it. This worries me very much and makes me  guarded, although naturally we will continue to fight for  Russian integrity and unity. I am for one president and one  political authority in the Russian Federation, and that all  territories should have completely equal rights as subjects of  the federation in accordance with the Constitution. Presently  this is not happening at all. [end Nazdratenko  recording]</p>

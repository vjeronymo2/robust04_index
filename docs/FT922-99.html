			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Algeria's leader assassinated in gun attack: Crackdown on Islamic fundamentalists likely after death of Boudiaf ALGERIA'S military government last night looked certain to crack down harder on Algeria's Islamic fundamentalists after Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, the head of state, was assassinated in a burst of machinegun fire. The country's collective presidency vowed to take 'all steps' needed to preserve security. Although the killer was at first reported shot dead, the military leadership later disclosed he was seized and investigations would uncover 'the instigators of the crime and their accomplices'. Suspicion is bound to fall on supporters of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front (FIS), who have killed up to 100 police and soldiers in hit-and-run shootings since February. The death of Mr Boudiaf, the 73-year-old head of Algeria's ruling High State Council, comes just five months after his appointment blocked a Moslem fundamentalist election victory. Witnesses said dozens of people were injured in the attack which took place as Mr Boudiaf was speaking at a cultural centre in the eastern city of Annaba. They said the killer, dressed in police uniform, struck from behind a curtain behind Mr Boudiaf, hitting him in the back and head with a volley of sub-machinegun fire. There were two diversionary explosions beforehand, apparently grenades. Mr Boudiaf's final words, heard on a newsfilm broadcast on television, were: 'We must know that the life of a human being is very short. We are all going to die. Why should (the authorities) cling so much to power?' Television showed Mr Boudiaf breaking off his speech because of a muffled explosion on his left. The camera swung away from him to show people diving under their seats. Moments later it showed him sprawled on a stretcher and police with guns drawn. Automatic gunfire and about a dozen single shots then crackled through the hall. Among the injured was Mr Abdenour Keramane, the industry and mines minister. The official news agency APS initially reported that the assassin was killed by the presidential bodyguard, but the collective presidency later disclosed that the killer had been arrested and was being questioned. The murder will be seen by many as a direct consequence of the government's decision to declare the FIS illegal when it was poised to win January's elections - Algeria's first since independence from France in 1962. The event seems bound to harden government determination to curb the organisation and its supporters. It also raises the danger that fresh violence will break out on the streets of Algerian towns and cities. The shooting took place almost a year after 55 people were killed in the first serious clashes between FIS supporters and police in Algiers. It came two days after the conspiracy trial of two FIS leaders, Mr Abassi Madani and Mr Ali Belhadj, was adjourned after a walk-out by defence lawyers. Tension surrounding the trial had prompted diplomats to suggest that FIS supporters would intensify violence against the government. Mr Boudiaf returned to Algeria in January after 28 years' exile in Morocco, to head the High State Council, which replaced the government of President Chadli Benjedid who resigned after the first round of elections in which the FIS scored a convincing victory. The five-man council, which the FIS denounced as having grabbed power in a coup, declared a state of emergency in February, banning the FIS, detaining thousands of its alleged supporters in desert camps and stifling public support for the group.

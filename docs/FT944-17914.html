			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Chip research consortium to shun federal funding Sematech, the US government- backed semiconductor industry research consortium, will pay its own way and no longer accept direct federal funding after fiscal 1996, it said in Washington yesterday. Formed in 1987, when the US semiconductor industry was rapidly losing ground to the Japanese and falling behind in chip manufacturing technology, Sematech has for seven years received half of its funds, or about Dollars 90m (Pounds 57m) a year, from the Defence Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. The rest is paid by member companies. Leaders of the consortium, which includes 11 of the largest US chip makers, said a resurgence in their international competitiveness and the increased profitability of the industry, which last year regained world market leadership for the first time since 1985, meant Sematech no longer needs government support. 'It is a matter of principle,' said Mr Craig Barrett, chief operating officer of Intel, the world's largest chip maker, and a member of the Sematech board of directors. 'The industry can now afford to support the consortium and we should. We are setting an example for other US industries and for the world.' 'We never intended direct federal funding to become an entitlement programme,' said Mr Bill Spencer, Sematech president and chief executive. Ironically, the consortium is turning down government money at a time when it has the whole-hearted support of the Clinton administration - after years of battling political opponents to maintain funding from Presidents Reagan and Bush. Sematech has long been at the centre of US debate over 'industrial policy' with critics - mostly Republicans - charging that the government was 'picking winners and losers'. It has been supported by the Pentagon, however, amid concerns the US might lose its leadership in technology vital to national security. The decision to reject further funding has met a mixture of praise, disbelief and suspicion from members of Congress, industry executives said. 'We expected a pat on the back. Instead, we have been accused by some of rocking the boat.' Sematech's decision has confounded critics and supporters alike. To critics, it is a surprising demonstration that this is not just another industry group looking to sustain itself at the federal trough. Supporters, on the other hand, are concerned that without the incentive of money, Sematech may no longer be a 'model' of government-industry collaboration. However, Sematech officials stressed that they aimed to expand, rather than end, co-operation between the private and public sectors and that the consortium would compete for government research grants for specific project on the same basis as other groups and companies. Ultimately, this could mean that Sematech will receive more government funding than its current annual stipend. Working through the congressionally mandated, but yet to be formed, Semiconductor Technology Council, an advisory group of government, industry and academic representatives, Sematech aims to influence a broader spectrum of government spending including Commerce Department and Energy Department research programmes, as well as the Pentagon. Total federal government spending on semiconductor-related research has been running at about Dollars 2bn to Dollars 2.5bn in recent years, Sematech estimates. 'If we can influence just 10 per cent of that so that it has commercial relevance we will be able to more than double the impact that we have had,' said Mr Frank Squires, Sematech's chief administrative officer. There is little possibility of the semiconductor industry reverting to its traditional 'arms-length and sometimes adversarial relationship with the federal government', Mr Squires said. Public attitudes in the US towards the government's role in ensuring economic security, employment and the creation of 'quality' jobs have changed, he believes. 'Perhaps Sematech has helped to bring about that change by demonstrating that not every government-industry partnership is larded with pork and bureaucracy.'</p>

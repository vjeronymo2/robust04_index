			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Coors to spin off non-beer side ADOLPH Coors, best-known as the third largest US brewer behind Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing, announced yesterday that it plans to spin off its non-beer interests as a separately-quoted stock market company. Shares in the new company would be distributed free to the company's existing shareholders. The new company would take in a fairly diversified range of businesses, including Coors's ceramics interests, its Golden Aluminum operation, a packaging subsidiary and three smaller 'developmental' companies - namely Golden Technologies, ZeaGen and MicroLithics. Coors said that the plan should leave the Colorado-based Coors Brewing Company largely intact. The businesses to be spun off had sales last year of about Dollars 544m, or about one quarter of the group's total. Among Coors's ceramics interests is a facility in Glenrothes, Scotland. Coors's action is the latest in a spate of demerger moves by US companies. Only last month, for example, Ralston Purina, the large US consumer products announced plans to spin off its Continental Baking Company subsidiary, the nation's biggest wholesale baker. Securities Data has calculated that 13 demerger announcements were made in the first quarter of 1992, double the figure for each of the preceding five quarters. Yesterday, Coors's shares rose strongly, up Dollars 2 1/8 at Dollars 20 1/2 . Coors was formed in 1873, and is still largely family-run. Under the demerger plan, different members of the family would head up both entities. The diversification into ceramics first took place in the 1920s, when the prohibition of alcoholic beverages in the US temporarily shut down Adolph Coors's fledgling brewery.</p>

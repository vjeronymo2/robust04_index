			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Japan Judging by its buoyant equity market, there is a mood of optimism in Japan. Yet Tokyo's strength is partly a function of weakness elsewhere. With other markets upset by US rate rises, international investors have had to scratch around to find a suitable home for their money. The question is whether they are right to conclude Japan is the place. The dollar's modest recovery against the yen helps, but it is hard to argue that the earnings outlook is really bright enough to allow the bull run to go for much longer. The Bank of Japan's latest Tankan survey of business confidence shows more corporate restructuring coming, despite the improvement in sentiment. The Nikkei 225 average is currently on a multiple of 89 times prospective earnings for the year to next March. That is demanding when the average company is expecting an increase of only around 8 per cent in pre-tax profits. Measured in relation to cash flow the market is on a more reasonable multiple of around 13, a reflection of the size of depreciation charges following the late 1980s surge in capital investment. But it looks as though the sheer weight of cash is the main factor. Domestic investors may be driven just as much by fear of missing out on a bull run so far fuelled mainly by foreign institutions. Liquidity also propelled the market before its spectacular collapse in 1990. That lesson is engraved deep on the heart of the Bank of Japan. It may not now want to risk another bubble by dropping the official discount rate.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Delay in listing of MPs' interests DETAILS of the business interests of MPs in the new parliament may not be published until the autumn, and even then will not reflect the changes to the register recently recommended by an all-party committee. Although MPs are obliged to register their business interests within four weeks of taking the Westminster oath, they cannot be publicly listed until approved by the cross-party committee on MPs' interests. That has not yet been set up. There is a register of MPs' financial interests as at January this year, but it omits the 140 new MPs and is increasingly out of date for those MPs it does feature. Even the first register of the new parliament will not cover plans for extending the information given about business interests, for example in categories of shareholdings to be listed. Such changes have yet to be approved by parliament and would probably not be registered until early 1994. There are now three reports from the cross-party committee on MPs' interests in the previous parliament awaiting debate. The others deal with rules for committee officers. Discussion of the reports may lead to calls for a more fundamental reform of the rules on MPs' links with business. Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, called the present system 'a parliamentary disaster', because 'it has allowed Members to take money from anybody and everybody as long as they admitted their connections'.</p>

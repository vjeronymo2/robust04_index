			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Trade Institute (ICE) President Alberto  Poletto said that Venezuela gained important advantages within  the framework of the GATT, the final agreement of which was  signed last week in Morocco.    During a news conference upon his return from this important  meeting, Poletto detailed some of the benefits obtained in the  Uruguay Round, among which he stressed the tariff reductions  Venezuelan products will receive in Japan (90 percent), the  European Union [EU] (43 percent), and the United States (36  percent).    According to the ICE president, the creation of the World  Trade Organization [WTO], which will replace GATT in 1995, will  offer our country guarantees. "We will be very much in the WTO,  because if we are not in it, we will be left out of the world,"  he commented.    Likewise, he stressed that Venezuela's entry into the WTO  gives it the right to demand proof of direct damage to verify  dumping claims before sanctions are imposed, including the  verification of direct damage to local producers caused by  dumping.    On this issue, Poletto referred to the controversy that  arose  over Venezuelan steel exports, which he described as an  "unjustifiable problem."    To regain this right, Venezuela--together with the Andean  Pact member nations--has promised to reduce tariffs on  industrial products to 35 percent within five years.    On the same subject, he pointed out that the WTO will  eliminate the discrimination that has existed concerning dumping  regulations, establishing safeguards, and resolving disputes.    Until now the GATT decisions on these issues were not  binding  on member nations, as was proven by the ruling on the quota  system imposed by the EU on Latin American banana exporters.    Likewise, Poletto referred to the achievements obtained in  the agricultural sector "in which tariffs became clear-cut."  According to the agreements, approximately 30 products will  receive a 40-percent tariff reduction based on the amounts  imported between 1986 and 1988.    In his judgment, this will allow the Venezuelan Government  "room to make changes in agricultural tariffs to meet the  country's needs."    The ICE president will soon present the agreements signed in  Morocco to Congress for its review and approval. According to  his expectations, this procedure should be completed before  January 1995, when the WTO will be created. Venezuela hopes to  become a charter member of the WTO.</p>

			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: WHEN ALL THE WORLD WASN'T BOLTED DOWN  </P> <P> There was a time when I would climb into bed, reach over and shake my husband  out of a dead sleep and shout in his ear, "Is the front door locked?" I could  always count on him to throw back the covers, stumble through the darkness and  check it out. He was back in a minute, a minute and a half tops.  </P> <P> It's not that way anymore. By the time he has to check the lock on his gas  tank, make sure the bicycles are padlocked to the house, turn on the outdoor  spotlight, bring in the tapes from the car, throw all the dead bolts on the  inside door, set the alarm, and make sure the cassette of the barking dog is  set for "play," he's awake. Man's home may be his castle, but now he needs more  than a moat to protect it. Today he needs a fortress.  </P> <P> This is what we have become: a nation where people aren't so bent on taking it  with them as they are hanging on to it while they're here.  </P> <P> Have you any idea how much we pay for security? And what are we protecting?  Have you ever used a pen in a post office or a bank that worked? They're drier  than Arkansas on a Sunday afternoon, yet there's a chain attached to them that  could support an anchor.  </P> <P> And I love the roadside parks where a table weighs about 15 tons and is bolted  to the ground. What do they think someone is going to do? Rent a flatbed truck  at $100 a day and transport it to his back yard?  </P> <P> You don't want to see the lamps and pictures that are screwed into tables and  walls in hotels. Why would I want a sampan painted on velvet with an orange  sunset or a lamp of a Nubian slave with the light switch buried in his navel?  </P> <P> To crooks, it doesn't matter. I've read stories of people who steal garden  hoses, hood, lawn and Christmas ornaments, pets and park benches. I stopped for  a light recently in Los Angeles and glanced at the car pulled up next to me. In  the window was a large note that read, "THE CASSETTE IS GONE. THE RADIO IS  GONE. I'VE BEEN HIT FOUR TIMES. THERE'S NOTHING LEFT!"  </P> <P> Good try. She was still driving on four tires with a transmission and a battery  that worked.  </P> <P> People are hard put to remember when thefts were so rampant. I remember only  one incident when I was a kid. Someone stole the wash off our clothesline. The  next day it was returned. We liked to think it was the wrong size.  </P></p>

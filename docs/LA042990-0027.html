			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> KILLER OF BOY, 11, FACES JUSTICE -- 33 YEARS AFTER CRIME;  </P> <P> MURDER: BILLY RUFF WAS HANGED FROM A TREE WITH A GO-CART ROPE. HIS KILLING  REMAINED A MYSTERY -- UNTIL A BROTHER HE NEVER KNEW BECAME A POLICE DISPATCHER  AND SOLVED THE CASE.  </P> <P> When they found 11-year-old Billy Ruff hanged from a big maple tree he had  loved to climb, innocence died in the hearts of his brothers and sisters.  </P> <P> They saw his killer everywhere, suspected everyone. The other Ruff children --  five were living when Billy died 33 years ago and three were born later --  lived with a fear so deep it darkened their every waking moment. It was a  terror inspired by a real-life bogyman who preyed on happy, fresh-faced kids --  kids who loved raisin cookies and baseball. Kids like Billy. Kids like them.  </P> <P> "All of us, at one time or another, didn't think we'd reach the age of 11,"  said Tim Ruff, who was 3 when Billy was killed.  </P> <P> Then one day three years ago, Christopher Ruff glanced up at the bulletin board  in the police station where he worked and saw the face of the man who had  killed the brother he never knew.  </P> <P> "Mom and I knew, as soon as I called her," said Chris, 24, who was born eight  years after his brother's death and two months after his father's. "We both  started to shake and say, 'This is it!' "  </P> <P> Earlier this month, Chris Ruff saw the man again -- in Albany County Court  being sentenced to life in prison for Billy's murder.  </P> <P> It was not murder, however, that had put the killer's likeness on the 'wanted'  poster; it was a sex crime involving a 10-year-old girl. The awful secret the  Ruff family had hidden was that Billy had been sodomized before he died.  </P> <P> "This sort of thing wasn't spoken about," Mildred Ruff said, sitting in her  living room with six of her children. "People wouldn't talk about  child-molesting. It was a hush-hush thing."  </P> <P> At the time Billy Ruff disappeared, Smith Avenue, in the northwestern suburb of  Albany where the family lived, was a street full of children set in a rural  landscape of fields and trees. Billy was last seen alive on Saturday afternoon,  Aug. 31, 1957. He had a pocket full of raisin cookies, and in one hand a length  of frayed clothesline he planned to use to steer a homemade go-cart. He didn't  show up for dinner. Mildred Ruff remembers wrapping his plate of lamb chops,  boiled potatoes and corn on the cob in wax paper and putting it in the fridge.  At 9 p.m., she called her husband at work, and he began a search that lasted  until dawn.  </P> <P> In her fitful sleep that night, Mildred Ruff had a dream or a vision, she  wasn't sure which: "I saw Billy, on his knees, hanging by a rope."  </P> <P> That's the way a friend's daughter found him the next day -- hanged with his  own clothesline in a densely wooded lot where all the kids played, and  continued to play for years after.  </P> <P> The police interviewed hundreds of people. "They didn't care how many hours  they put in," said Raymond Rasmussen, one of the first state police detectives  on the case. "We got to feel very close and very compassionate for the family  and what they'd been through."  </P> <P> What they could not know was that the killer was among them. Then, in the noise  and confusion of grieving and of police work, he was gone.  </P> <P> "The night of the wake, a priest friend of ours said, 'It may take 20 years,  but nobody can keep this thing to themselves,' " Mildred Ruff said. "And I said  if it takes 20 days, I'll lose my mind."  </P> <P> But she found strength and faith enough to last her family through Billy's  death and the loss of her husband eight years later. For years, she carried in  her apron pocket a rosary her husband had given her. The black beads were worn  to brown from constant fingering.  </P> <P> The 20 days became 20 months. The investigation died down. The police stopped  coming by with mug shots of child molesters.  </P> <P> Seven years passed. The police came around one last time to tell the family  that a forensics expert had decided Billy's death was accidental. His family  scoffed; they knew the truth would surface, and that belief never wavered as 10  years became 20, then 30.  </P> <P> "We know what it's like to have a lot of unanswered questions,"  </P> <P> said John, born four years after Billy died. "But in the back of our minds,  there was always the hope."  </P> <P> There was also fear -- of the dark, of being alone, of getting too close to  people.  </P> <P> "Everybody grew up with a paranoia," Chris said. "We couldn't have a normal  childhood because we were so damn scared. There's not one time we can walk into  an empty house and feel safe. Not one of us."  </P> <P> Regina, the oldest, 13 when Billy died, and Tommy, who was 5, told their mother  they knew there was a bogyman because he got their brother. All the Ruffs --  Regina, Tom, Tim, Joe, Lisa, Jay, John and Chris -- worried he was out to get  another of them.  </P> <P> "We'd stand at the window, stand there and watch when people weren't home on  time," said Lisa, who was 8 months old when Billy was murdered. "I remember  standing at my bed in the back bedroom, looking out the window and knowing I  was doing the same thing Mom was. We were always scared."  </P> <P> Fear became something they lived and breathed. In time, they would pass it on  to their wives and husbands, to their children.  </P> <P> "I was terrorized by nightmares most of my life," Regina wrote in a recent  letter to her mother. "I had to force myself to go anywhere. I was afraid of  the dark and of the daylight.  </P> <P> "All this destruction, all this fear -- and I am only one of eight. Multiply  the damage to me by every other life this touched."  </P> <P> While Billy's brothers and sisters struggled with demons, his killer was  finishing a stint in the Air Force and spending short periods as an Albany  police officer and an ironworker. He married three times and fathered two  children with a fourth woman. In the 1970s he wandered the streets as a  homeless alcoholic.  </P> <P> "I think he was a man that had this on his mind all that time," Rasmussen said.  "Maybe that caused him to become what he was."  </P> <P> When the case was 24 years old, Chris and his brothers found some old newspaper  clippings in the basement. "They wanted to know more," Mildred Ruff said. "They  wanted to know why it was unsolved."  </P> <P> From the state police she learned that the case file would soon be destroyed,  as are records of all unsolved cases after 25 years. Mildred Ruff called  Rasmussen, who by then was in charge of the state police Bureau of Criminal  Investigation. He ordered the file saved.  </P> <P> "In my mind, I guess I was always hoping someday, somebody would make an arrest  in the case," Rasmussen said. "Comparing my thoughts and hopes that someday  this might be resolved with how much space that little file took up in our huge  records section -- there was no question in my mind what I should do."  </P> <P> There was never any question in Chris Ruff's mind as to what he should do,  either. He wanted to be a cop. As a child, he drew a self-portrait with a badge  on his chest. He dropped out of college to work as a dispatcher for the police  force of suburban Colonie.  </P> <P> His mother says it was Providence that he missed a promotion to patrolman. That  would have sent him to the police academy, and he would not have been in the  station when the killer's photo was posted.  </P> <P> Chris contacted the state police and met the next day with two senior  investigators.  </P> <P> "They looked at the newspaper clippings and said, 'I think we may have  something. This may be the missing link, the reason we could never find  anything back then,' " Chris said. "They said, 'Don't get your hopes up. We'll  keep an eye out for him, and we'll let you know.' "  </P> <P> Months went by. Then came the break the police had been waiting for: Someone  inquired about buying the killer's car, which had a lien against it at a local  bank. The bank contacted police. Their man was in Florida.  </P> <P> Under questioning, he admitted molesting a 10-year-old girl but wouldn't talk  about Billy Ruff. After he failed a lie-detector test, he wrote a note saying,  in part, "I killed Billy and I need help."  </P> <P> Eventually, he signed a confession of how he "threw the rope over a branch  above my head, grabbed the rope and ran with it, pulling Billy up off the  ground . . . (then) I ran like hell."  </P> <P> It was only then, with the man in police custody, that Chris and his mother  were ready to tell the rest of the family that the man who had confessed to  Billy's murder was their own first cousin, Richard Ruff. Family had done this  to family.  </P> <P> "Ever since the day I found out, I've been enraged," Jay Ruff said, recalling  his first encounter with his cousin in 1982. "He shook my hand. And that's  what's enraged me ever since. Knowing what he'd done to my own brother, he  shook my hand and breathed the air I was breathing."  </P> <P> Richard Ruff, 53, was sentenced this month for the first-degree felony murder  of William Ruff Jr. He stood trial after recanting his confession, saying  police had frightened him into it.  </P> <P> In August, 1957, Richard Ruff was 20 years old. On leave from the Air Force, he  had dropped by his uncle's home that week to show off a red Chevy convertible,  which Billy had admired. The day Billy's body was found, he was there with the  family, just another grieving relative. He left soon after. Police never  questioned him.  </P> <P> Most of the Ruff family attended all nine days of the trial, reliving the  horror. They saw autopsy photos and heard testimony about the pain Billy had  suffered. They also learned why he was killed.  </P> <P> "This little boy was a naive, sweet, 11-year-old kid, and he had this fellow  sodomize him, and I'm sure the first words out of his mouth were: 'I'm going to  tell my mother and father on you!' " said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Daniel  Dwyer. "The ultimate result was Richard was going to be found out, and he  couldn't handle that."  </P> <P> For the Ruffs there is relief in knowing the truth, knowing that the man who  killed Billy will never hurt another child. They want other families to have  faith that killers can be found, no matter how many years pass. But they also  want them to know that solving the mystery cannot erase all the pain.  </P> <P> "We've lived this for 33 years, we'll live it for another 33 years," Chris  said. "There's no punishment that would equal what he did to our brother -- and  to us.  </P></p>

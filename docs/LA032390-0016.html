			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LITHUANIAN INDEPENDENCE  </P> <P> In speaking of events in Lithuania and the Soviet Union, the CNN reporter said  of Gorbachev: "Lithuanians will provide an early test of his presidential  mettle." Well, the same applies to President Bush!  </P> <P> We want to see some proof that he is not the wimp that some people have accused  him of being.  </P> <P> Will he have the guts to stand up for the freedom of Lithuania? He seems to  have conveniently forgotten that the United States had never recognized the  Baltic states to be legally part of the Soviet Union. We heard him talk on CNN:  "Well, we have to wait and see, who'll be in charge of this territory . . . and  it must all be peaceful. . . ." Since when is there any question about the land  of Lithuania belonging to its people? They certainly have gone about their  declaration of independence in a peaceful and orderly fashion.  </P> <P> Does Bush now mean that if the Russians send in their tanks and start killing  people in the streets as they did in Hungary and Czechoslovakia "things won't  be peaceful" and therefore he washes his hands of the whole thing?  </P> <P> There were suspicions about his behavior at the time of the Tian An Men Square  massacre and subsequent covert dealings with the Chinese government. Now his  abandonment of Lithuania will serve as further proof of his lack of strength to  stand up against the true enemies of the free world. It's easy to throw your  weight around invading poor run-down countries like Panama or Libya, but now  that he has to match his strength against that of Gorbachev he might come off a  poor second in the eyes of the world.  </P> <P> Will he show his mettle and support free Lithuania, or remain sitting on the  fence?  </P> <P> IRENE and FRANK GODDARD  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As we reviewed all of the comments supporting a dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution process, it became apparent that, while the words  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``informal'' and ``formal'' were used to distinguish the type of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process a specific commenter preferred, many commenters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of which word was used, preferred the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. The majority of those in favor of a dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution process have asked that it be required by HCFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since many believe that a process can be required only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through rulemaking, most commenters, therefore, prefer a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We note that the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1990 and the Executive Order 12778 of October 23, 1991,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Civil Justice Reform (56 FR 55195), encourage, but do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct dispute resolution, as some commenters have claimed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not accepting those comments proposing that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt a specific State's process on a national level, nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those suggesting that each State be permitted to design its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> own process in its entirety. While we have concluded that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all States offer some opportunity to resolve disputes, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have no evidence that suggests that any particular State's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is more successful or effective than that of another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we are accepting, with modification, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion that HCFA adopt one process to be used by all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. Just as participation requirements and the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and certification process for nursing homes are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from State to State, so should the opportunity for providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to challenge survey findings. In &sect;488.331, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring several core elements that all informal dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution processes must include as a minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entity conducting the survey must offer nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> home providers the opportunity, if they request it, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refute survey findings beginning with their receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> official HCFA&hyph;2567 with which they disagree;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Providers must be able to advance their disagreements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to survey agency or HCFA regional office officials, or both;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In no case, will dispute resolution delay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of an enforcement action;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The dispute resolution process (whether or not it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the minimum requirements specified in this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule) must be available to providers, upon their request, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written form. HCFA regional offices provide dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution to providers upon request, relative to Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that specific procedural requirements that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine the manner in which dispute resolution proceeds,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for example, such things as how the request is made, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method by which the process is conducted, and who may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participate in the process, should be left to the individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States. Upon the facility's request, the State will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a written summary of that State's procedures relative to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal dispute resolution process. Any attempt on our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part to codify procedural aspects of dispute resolution that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be applicable to all States would limit States' as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as providers' flexibility in utilizing and refining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process, as necessary, to satisfy their needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To allay commenters' fears that dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would stall the survey process and delay enforcement action,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are providing in &sect;488.331 the opportunity for providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to dispute survey findings upon receipt of the official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA&hyph;2567 with which they disagree, while prohibiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenges by providers from postponing or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delaying the enforcement process. In no case will dispute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution delay the effective date of an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action. Thus, while it is our hope that dispute resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures could be completed in all cases before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the enforcement action, we wish to make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear that where the completion of these procedures does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur by that time, this will not be grounds to either delay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enforcement action or give providers a right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> challenge the inadequacy of these procedures. We believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that to have a process that would allow for enforcement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be deferred pending the scheduling and completion of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informal appeals process is far outweighed by the needs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents to face a minimum of time during which they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive care that does not meet the requisite health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety standards. We also believe that not delaying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective date of the enforcement action until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion of the dispute resolution process will encourage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities to make the kind of swift corrections the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress obviously intended when it enacted nursing home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reform. If a provider is subsequently successful, during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the dispute resolution process, at demonstrating that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies should not have been cited, the deficiencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are removed from the HCFA&hyph;2567 and any enforcement actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that had been imposed as a result of those cited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies are lifted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The signing of the GATT by India at Marrakesh has  evoked mixed reaction. The former prime minister and the  Samajwadi Janata Party leader, Mr. Chandra Shekhar, has  criticized the signing of the GATT adopting Dunkel proposals by  India. Addressing public meetings at Chandigarh, Ludhiana and  Amritsar yesterday, Mr. Chandra Shekhar said these proposals  will badly affect and erode the Indian values swadeshi  [indigenousness] and self-sufficiency as propounded by Mahatama  Gandhi and other leaders.    Reacting to the signing of GATT by the government, the Uttar  Pradesh chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav, said the people  should have been taken into confidence before signing it. He  said the chief ministers should have been consulted before  signing the agreement which would affect the national interests.  The Bihar chief minister, Mr. Lalu Prasad Yadav, addressing a  public meeting at Sopol, charged the Congress-I with selling out  the country's sovereignty by signing the agreement.    The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] yesterday observed a  protest  day in Madhya Pradesh against the signing of GATT, while the  Communist Party of India-Marxist observed the black day in the  state. Janata Dal workers held demonstrations in some towns of  Uttar Pradesh. However, the Congress-I has welcomed the signing  of agreement by India and charged the Opposition with indulging  in a disinformation campaign on the issue. Speaking to  reporters in New Delhi yesterday, the party spokesman, Mr. V.N.  Gadgil, said the agreement will boost India's agricultural and  textile exports.</p>

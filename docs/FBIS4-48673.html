			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister and first vice president, the  Honorable John Malecela, has said the only way of finding a  solution to the current crisis in Rwanda lay in holding a  meeting of the heads of state of neighboring countries to  discuss it. Malecela said a meeting of the leaders of Tanzania,  Kenya, Uganda, Zaire, and representatives of parties involved in  the crisis could reach a solution that would end the conflict.  The prime minister said this during talks in his office in Dar  es Salaam with the Belgian ambassador to Rwanda, Mr. Johan  Swinning, who is paying a special visit to countries neighboring  Rwanda.    Malecela and his guest stressed that plans to bring about a  cease-fire and an end to animosity on both sides and the  killings were vital issues in ushering in a permanent peace in  Rwanda.</p>

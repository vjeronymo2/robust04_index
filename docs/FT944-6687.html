			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Italian terror suspects arrested Italian police claim to have made a breakthrough in unmasking Falange Armata, a right-wing group that has claimed responsibility for numerous acts of terrorism over the past five years. This follows the arrest over the past week of three policeman, two of them brothers, stationed in Bologna and the Emilia Romagna region. All three are believed to be linked to some 15 unexplained killings and a series of violent robberies dating back to 1988. A pistol found in the possession of one of the arrested policeman has been matched by firearms experts to the killing of a carabiniere and the murder of a prison educationalist. Police are now checking whether the group was protected within the service and allowed to carry out activities to destabilise Emilia Romagna, the region controlled by the former Communist party. The inquiry could also clarify still unexplained aspects of terrorist attacks in Bologna, including the bombing of Bologna station in 1980 that killed 80 people and left 200 injured.</p>

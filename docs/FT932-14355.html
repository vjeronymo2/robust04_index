			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Rumbles of discontent from the coal miners: Russia - Referendum WHEN President Boris Yeltsin last battled the Communist party, back in 1991, Mr Yuri Lutskii, a mine union leader from the Siberian region of Kuzbass, joined a 100,000-strong miners' strike to support the president. Two years later Mr Lutskii is one of a growing number of miners who could turn violently against him. For, if the Russian government sets about implementing the fiscal reform that the west is now demanding, cutting credit to inefficient enterprises and staging model bankruptcies, enterprises in regions such as the Kuzbass stand in the firing line. Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian energy minister, told Kuzbass leaders last week that many of the region's ageing and inefficient mines will have to be closed this year. Although details of the planned closures have yet to be revealed, the proposition leaves mine leaders such as Mr Lutskii increasingly fearful for the future - and so their support for Mr Yeltsin cools. 'If they do not develop programmes to find work for those who will lose their job, there will be a social explosion here,' warns Mr Lutskii. Viewed against Russia's spiralling budget deficit, the case for reform in the Kuzbass region is undeniable. Russia's coal industry is one of the most heavily subsidised branches of the economy. Since the collapse of trade and transport links in the former Soviet Union have left many mines unable to sell what coal they still produce, they are left with stockpiles of unused coal, and increasing debts. Local leaders insist the problem is that the government is demanding they operate under a market system while the price of coal, unlike many other raw materials, is still fixed at a low level by the state. Although the government then tops this up with subsidies, and lets the mine sell some of its coal on the open market, the mine managers say this does not even cover the payroll cost, coal miners' wages in Russia being traditionally high. The region, like many industrial centres in Russia, is trying to survive by withholding taxes from the centre, and seeking export markets. Some of the more modern mines on the region's rich seams have attracted foreign capital and some 20 per cent of the coal is now being exported. However, the region's administration is insisting that Moscow should provide full guarantees for the thousands of miners who will lose their jobs.</p>

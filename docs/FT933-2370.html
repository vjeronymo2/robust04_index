			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Gardening: Clear colours and new varieties for autumn - Pokers are no longer overheated and crocosmias are getting more and more unusual IN POURING rain this week, gardeners have been able to shelter and enjoy their Great Autumn Show. I am not sure which is more welcome. The rains have brought fresh colour to my fuchsias and lengthened the season of the late sweet peas. The two-day show is held yearly in London's Royal Horticultural Society halls and continues to raise my sights for autumn. The days seem far behind us when gardeners complained of too much strong yellow and believed that dahlias were all vulgar. In a Great Autumn Show you no longer see chrysanthemums: they now have to wait until late October. Instead, you confront clear colours in new varieties from old and new families. Some of them have emerged in families which used to be all orange and hectic, crocosmias, perhaps, or over-heated Pokers. Nowadays, the main Poker at the shows is the pale yellow Little Maid, a marked reversal of colour and gender. Other pale colours have turned up in half-hardy families, spread around for the new plantfinding market: I continue to profit from Brian Hiley's unusual forms of half-hardy salvias for pots. Some particularly rewarding forms are coming back from the wild, not least from Roy Lancaster's recent collections in China. From Paradise Centre in Suffolk, I admired a tall white-flowered Artemisia called Ghizou but its exhibitors do not yet list saleable plants of this border-flower for the future, dark-stemmed and holding its flowers at pleasantly wide intervals to a height of 4ft or 5ft. I also admired a new bright apricot Lychnis called cognata. There seem to be no problems here. Carol Klein, of Glebe Cottage Nurseries, raised it from seed collected in China and rightly placed it in the foreground of her outstanding exhibit. She foresees no difficulty with it and so I have bought one. Lychnis cognata grows about 1 1/2 ft high and has rounded flowers like an enlarged form of haageana, whose colour is a sensational shade of apricot. If it continues to flower in autumn, it will soon be all over the garden centres: whatever will China be found to be hosting next? Wherever you look nowadays on the smaller stands of hardy plants, good exhibitors are showing unusual crocosmias, those easy-growing corms with rushy leaves and flowers which used to be in various shades of orange. Once upon a time, the red and orange forms were believed to be tender but they are proven survivors in the worst winters of discontent. Will the new pale yellows and apricots prove to be so tough when we have a really testing season? I have been trying to pick the better forms, helped by John Metcalf, of Four Seasons Nurseries, at Forncett, St Mary, Norwich, Norfolk NR16 1JT, who supplies by mail order only. Like his exhibit, he has a sharp sense of the best performers and best value. Many of us have been struggling with Crocosmia Emily McKenzie, which has orange flowers with a brown blotch but never seems to last for very long. I have been blaming my cultivation. Metcalf agrees, and although he sells this variety, he does not reckon much to it. He prefers the new Star of the East, which he does not yet stock but which I value for its star-shaped flowers in orange and its long season at a height of about 2ft. Among the paler yellows, any visitor to the show would choose Citronella, which is also one of the cheaper varieties: I have bought one to celebrate and can imagine it in a sunny bed among the blues of autumn. I also fancy the pale apricot Solfatare, which has pleasantly bronzed leaves but which does not always flower freely. Nobody is entirely certain that these pale-flowered forms will survive a hard frost but there is one helpful trick: try to feed them with a potash fertiliser from July onwards so that they build up stronger corms below ground before the frost. Other varieties keep turning up, including a newish bright yellow called George Davison, which looks too orange to my eye, and the older James Cooey, which has small flowers and has not made much of an impact with me in the past five years. I would put Citronella first, at least until the winter sorts it out. On acid soil, anyone would be seduced by copying the exhibit from Edrom Nurseries, in Scotland, and multiplying the many forms of autumn gentian as an edging to their borders. The pale blues and the best white form are quite appealing but the best are surely the deep blues, which we all associate with this superb plant for cool northern gardens. I wish that everyone would plant it instead of yet more heather: once again, the best form seemed to me to be one of the cheapest, the dark blue macaulayi. Patient gardeners might consider giving it the background blue of a new shrub with blue-coloured leaves. Fothergilla Blue Mist was being shown by Starborough Nurseries below some good specimens of Nyssa sylvatica, which colours so prettily to red and orange in its leaves. Both these plants grow slowly and need patience, moisture and no lime. Nonetheless, they ought to be taken up by gardeners with the right soil and the need to find something for autumn among a core of azaleas. As always, I fell for Aylett's marvellous dahlias, the reputation of those who think that there is nothing between the awful forms with mauve pompons and the over-estimated red Bishop of Llandaff. A few, well-chosen forms add backbone and soft colour to a border from August onwards: if you disbelieve me, you can see them at their best in the National Trust's flowerbeds at Hidcote before you walk forwards up the famous Red Border. This year, the pink form with flowers like waterlilies, called Emily Crutchfield, look irresistible. Alternatively, there is even a pink called Gay Princess, about the only novelty which the tabloids have still not sprung on us. Thirty years ago, I remember the old Great Autumn idiom: apples on plates against green hessian; musty heleniums and chrysanthemums already on the in-curve. Nowadays, the best Michaelmas Daisies are small-flowered with names like Coombe Fishacre, a pale pink, and Little Carlow, a tall violet-blue at up to 6ft. Neither suffers from the dreaded mildew, which upsets the older show varieties, especially those with red flowers. Conscious of the changing fashion, I found myself circling past the tweed skirts and back to Glebe Cottage's enterprising stand. Even the familiar Japanese Anemone has taken a new turn in their observant care. They have picked out a rich rose-pink called Eugenie: she is a richer pink and has an unusually pretty shape to the flower, which sets her apart from the other pink forms of the well-known japonica. She shares their willingness to flourish in dry shade. She is the sort of speciality which you only see at a seasonal show and so I blessed the RHS's new willingness to allow plants to be bought throughout show hours and left with Eugenie in a polythene bag with the RHS symbol. Thirty years ago, not only the plants were more limited: shopping was strictly curtailed, to the visitors' disadvantage.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Management: Plane sailing for the business traveller - Health Check / Carol Cooper offers advice and remedies to help tackle the symptoms of jet lag FEW air travellers are lucky enough to escape jet lag. Its familiar symptoms include fatigue, disorientation, drowsiness, difficulty concentrating, headache, indigestion and loss of appetite. A variety of sometimes unusual remedies have been used for the condition, but you do not need to go in for aromatherapy or drinking your own urine to combat its effects. Fairly obviously, jet lag is caused by a mismatch between the external time and the circadian rhythm of your body clock. The clock is regulated by hormones: by day, high levels of adrenalin, cortisol and other hormones are produced. By night, melatonin is secreted by the pineal, a small gland at the base of the brain, which Descartes took to be the seat of the soul. In studies, melatonin capsules, taken at times when the hormone 'should be' naturally released, have been shown to reduce jet lag. However, more work is needed, and the treatment is not yet available for general use. Logic tells us that environmental cues such as light, meals and social rituals have an important effect on circadian rhythms, and recently physiologists have confirmed that this is so, although they prefer to use the term zeitgebers (time givers) for these environmental factors. Left to its own devices without any zeitgebers, the human body actually prefers a daily period of 25 hours. This has practical implications. It is easier to shift the body clock backward rather than forward, and jet lag is usually worse when travelling eastward. If you are off to the Antipodes, try gradually delaying, instead of advancing, your activities by 12 hours. For recovery from travel, one should ideally allow a day for each time zone crossed, but business travellers rarely have that kind of time. Fortunately simple measures help. On the aircraft adjust your watch to the new time and take plenty of rest, especially on eastbound flights - symptoms of jet lag are exacerbated by sleep loss. If you have any short-acting sleeping tablets, this could be a good time to take one. Otherwise consider travel sickness pills, which usually have a sedative effect and can be chosen according to the length of the journey. Kwells and Joy-Rides work for four hours, while Dramamine and Stugeron last eight. Alcohol dehydrates, so during the flight avoid the free champagne and try to average at least one soft drink an hour. Constipation may make abdominal symptoms worse; it is worth getting enough fibre. Once at your destination, zeitgebers become more important. The minute he disembarked, one executive from the US was dragged by his hosts to Battersea Park fun fair. He described it as horrible at the time, but later reported that he was less affected by jet lag than on previous trips. Bright light is the most important time-giver of all. Ordinary, indoor lighting can work, but strong, outdoor light is better and may explain why those who spend more time outside adapt more quickly to changes in time. The body clock can be advanced by bright light between 5am and 11am, and delayed by light between 9pm and 3am. Exercise plays a part, too, so if possible take a brisk walk outdoors in the sunshine first thing in the morning. Bioclok is an electronic device to help synchronise activities with time changes. It costs around Pounds 49.95 from Innovations or from Medical Technology International (Tel 031 220 4568). If you cannot adjust to local time, plan carefully. Try to schedule meetings for the morning (local time) when flying to the US and for the late afternoon or evening (local time) when in Japan. An important presentation may work as a zeitgeber, but can be a business disaster. There are other complications of air travel. Cabin pressure is only about the same as pressure 6,000 feet above sea-level. The resulting slight lack of oxygen can pose problems for passengers with heart disease, anaemia and severe asthma. For most travellers, however, the only adverse effects are on the sinuses and the middle ear. Ear ache or facial pain can last for days and could ruin a trip. If you have had a recent cold, ear infection, or sinus trouble, sucking a sweet during ascent and descent helps keep Eustachian tubes patent. Those who have not packed sweets should indulge in yawning. Blood flow in the legs can get dangerously sluggish on long flights, with thrombosis as the occasional result. Even in Club Class it is worth walking around from time to time, keeping the feet moving and avoiding tight socks and crossed legs. Recent studies show that in-flight entertainment headsets can act as a breeding ground for bacteria. It seems to be up to individual airlines to decide whether to discard, sterilise or re-use headsets, and while no harm has been known to come from headphones, this could be just a matter of time. The effect of airport trolleys is in less doubt. First reported in the British Medical Journal, airport assault syndrome is damage to the Achilles tendon from the use of luggage trolleys as battering rams. Various tendon injuries have been described, the exact disability depending on the design of the trolley and the ferocity with which the other passenger approaches with his suitcase - or possibly with yours.

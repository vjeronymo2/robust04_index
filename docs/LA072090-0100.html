			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON;  </P> <P> DEVELOPER LIABLE FOR GIRL'S INJURY  </P> <P> A Superior Court jury Thursday found the William Lyon Co. liable for a 1988  accident that left a 10-year-old girl brain-damaged.  </P> <P> The jury also ruled that the development company had defrauded her parents,  John and Patti Bretza, by intentionally overstating the size of their new  Trabuco Canyon property, where the accident occurred.  </P> <P> After four days of deliberation in Westminster, the jury found that the company  should pay the family $55,000 for breaching the home's implied warranty and  misleading the Bretzas about the property's boundary. The company told the  family that their property extended to a temporary chain link fence. But when a  permanent fence was erected on the true property line, it was closer to the  house.  </P> <P> The jury also held the William Lyon Co. solely responsible for their daughter's  accident. Irvine-based Leaverton Brothers Inc., which installed the plumbing in  the home and also was named in the suit, was found blameless.  </P> <P> The Bretzas alleged that leaky plumbing in an upstairs bathroom caused a chunk  of ceiling to fall on their daughter, Kristy, now 13. The Bretzas allege that  Kristy has suffered seizures, headaches, nightmares and visual and intellectual  impairment since the accident. On Aug. 20, the next phase of the trial will  begin. The jury must then determine damages. The family in this phase is  seeking to recover $600,000 spent on medical help since the accident plus  future medical costs and the earnings she would have made had she not been  injured, court documents said.  </P> <P> Attorneys for both the Bretzas and William Lyon Co. declined comment Thursday  because the damages phase is pending.  </P> <P> However, Patti Bretza hailed the jury's decision, saying that "the good guys  won."  </P> <P> "The fraud verdict was the best. They're so big and they think that if they  hurt the little people, they won't fight back," Patti Bretza said. JON NALICK  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: SCREEN GEMS:  </P> <P> With Sinead O'Connor on her way to a No. 1 with "Nothing Compares to You," you  can bet that American distributors will suddenly show some interest in "Hush A  Bye Baby," a current Irish coming-of-age drama which features O'Connor's film  debut as a teen-ager whose best pal suddenly realizes she's pregnant. (O'Connor  also composed the film's score.)  </P> <P> .. . "Late Night's" Paul Shaffer is serving as musical supervisor for "Lemon  Sisters," a goofy tale about a singing group struggling to make it in pre-glitz  Atlantic City. The film, which stars Diane Keaton and Carol Kane (plus Reuben  Blades), is due out this July from Miramax Films. . . . Little Richard will  play Old King Cole in an upcoming episode of Shelley Duvall's "Fairy Tale  Theatre" on Showtime this summer. . . . And documentary film maker D. A.  Pennebaker has directed a half-hour documentary about the making of Suzanne  Vega's new album, "Days of Open Hand," which will air May 14 on MTV.  </P></p>

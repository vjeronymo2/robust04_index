			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Calling investors to account - A look at the ins and outs of the stock exchange's new rolling settlement system There are now only 25 working days until the new system of settling payment for buying and selling shares comes into effect on July 18. Out will go account periods and in will come phase one: 10-day rolling settlement. The idea is to establish a quicker payments system by abolishing the existing account period of two to three weeks. The aim is to move to phase two - five-day rolling settlement - perhaps some time next year. Investors who deal only occasionally may find themselves little affected, at least by phase one, but others may find the transformation difficult. How will rolling settlement work? Unlike the other main financial centres - New York, Tokyo and Frankfurt - London operates on traded accounts. The stock exchange divides the year into account periods, usually two weeks. The value of shares which the investor has bought and sold within any account period is calculated at the end of it and the investor must then settle up, usually within seven working days. The day by which he must pay is called account or settlement day. This system means that those who trade earliest in the account period have more time to settle than others. Most importantly, investors are able to settle the net amount. If, for example, you were to buy shares for Pounds 1,000 and sell others for Pounds 600 within an account period, you would pay out only Pounds 400 (excluding costs) on settlement day. Rolling settlement will do away with this. Under the new arrangement, known as T+10, you would need to place Pounds 1,000 of cleared funds with your broker 10 working days after the day you bought the shares - and you would receive Pounds 600 10 days after the day you sold them. In effect, every day will be account day from July 18, with cash delivered for every trade; hence 'rolling' settlement. The mechanics of trading remain unchanged in that orders are still placed through a broker who will send out a contract note confirming the transaction, the settlement date and the amount due. According to the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), contract notes will become the demand for payment. Investors will have to get used to responding quickly once they receive the contract note. Those who will benefit the most are sellers, since they will receive their money more quickly than at present. The new system will, therefore, see the demise of 'account traders'. These are investors who buy shares they think will go up in a hurry. If the shares do, the investors sell them within the same account, so earning themselves a cheque without having had to pay out anything other than sharedealing costs. Delivery of shares will also be affected. Now, if you sell shares and buy them back during an account period, you do not have to deliver them. Under rolling settlement, you will. However, some inter-account trading will still be possible. By engineering the co-incidence of separate deals on one day, you would still be able to settle net on that day. So if you sold shares on a Tuesday on the maximum of T+10, you could buy shares on Wednesday on T+9 and pay only the difference on settlement day - Tuesday week. If the deal is closed off in this way and you were conducting it to 'bed-and-breakfast' shares for capital gains tax purposes, the stock would not have to be delivered. What about nominees? Many brokers are encouraging their clients to have stock registered in their nominee account - the company formed by brokers or fund managers to hold shares on behalf of their clients - rather than the client's own name. Nominee accounts ease administration for brokers and reduce their costs. A broker with 500 clients in a nominee account needs to handle only one dividend payment instead of 500 dividend cheques. Investors also face less paperwork because they do not keep share certificates and do not have to sign transfer deeds to sell shares. Brokers may charge for holding shares in their nominee company but Geoffrey Turner, chief executive of the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers and Investment Managers, says: 'If any client feels that he is being heavily charged for a nominee service, he should shop around for the many brokers who won't charge him.' Investors do not have to go into nominees just yet. Under 10-day rolling settlement, there will still be enough time to post certificates for a purchase or sale. But once/if T+5 emerges, this is likely to be impracticable. If you are happy to be in a nominee account, it is preferable to choose a broker who runs a designated, rather than a pooled, nominee. The latter groups together shareholders and the only name that appears on the register is that of the nominee company. Investors lose benefits - such as the company's annual report, access to the annual general meeting and direct news of a rights issue - unless they have made special arrangements with the broker. In a pooled nominee, the broker's name and the client's designation - usually a number - appear together on the company register and this should ensure that the investor retains shareholder benefits. How safe are nominees? Nominee services are not an authoriseable activity under the Financial Services Act, which set up the existing system of regulation for financial services. Technically, therefore, they fall outside the scope of the investors' compensation scheme which pays out a maximum of Pounds 48,000 to an investor, comprising 100 per cent of the first Pounds 30,000 lost and 90 per cent of the next Pounds 20,000. For all practical purposes, however, it is unlikely that investors would find they were ineligible for compensation were a nominee company to go under because of the close connection between it and the stockbroker (which should be authorised by the SFA). Turner does not doubt that nominees are robust. 'Anyone who has a personal equity plan is required by law to hold his assets in a nominee,' he points out. 'Why do we hear no anxieties about this from Pep-holders? Because the system works well.' What about payment for shares? Under rolling settlement, the broker must have cleared funds with which to take delivery of shares on T+10. If the investor has not managed to get the money across, the broker is faced with two choices: he can either extend his own credit to settle the agreed share purchase or fail to complete the trade, leaving the investor without the shares. Since brokers would prefer to avoid being put into that situation, many are encouraging clients to keep an account with them. They can then withdraw funds for payment of shares and deposit money when shares are sold. Some brokers offer little or no interest on these accounts, so check that the rates offered are competitive. A number of stockbrokers may extend cash to their clients if funds have not been cleared in time. 'Margin trading' - examined in the Weekend FT by Norma Cohen two weeks ago - which is common in the US, may take time to reach private clients in the UK domestic market.</p>

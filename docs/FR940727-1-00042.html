			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984, a State with final authorization administered its hazardous waste program entirely in lieu of EPA administering the Federal program in that State. The Federal requirements no longer applied in the authorized State and EPA could not issue permits for any facility in the State that the State was authorized to permit. When new, more stringent Federal requirements were promulgated or enacted, the State was obliged to enact equivalent authority within specified time frames. New Federal requirements did not take effect in an authorized State until the authorized State adopted the requirements as State law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, under section 3006(g) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6926(g), new requirements and prohibitions imposed by the HSWA take effect in authorized States at the same time that they take effect in non-authorized States. EPA is directed to implement HSWA requirements and prohibitions in an authorized State, including the issuance of permits, until the State is granted authorization to do so. While States must still adopt HSWA-related provisions as State law to retain final authorization, HSWA applies in authorized States in the interim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect on State Authorizations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The conditional exclusion and the universal waste management system would not be HSWA regulations, and thus would not be immediately effective in authorized States. Thus, the exemption would be applicable only in those States that do not have final authorization for the base (non-HSWA) portion of the RCRA program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3009 of RCRA allows States to impose more stringent regulations than the Federal program. Accordingly, authorized States are only required to modify their programs when EPA promulgates Federal regulations that are more stringent than the authorized State regulations. For those changes that are less stringent or reduce the scope of the Federal program, States are not required to modify their programs. Today's proposed options are considered less stringent or smaller in scope than the existing Federal regulations because that portion of today's proposal would exempt certain activities now within the purview of RCRA Subtitle C. Therefore, authorized States are not required to modify their programs to adopt regulations consistent with and equivalent to the proposed exclusion or the proposed universal waste management system for lamps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even though States will not be required to adopt today's proposed options (if either is finalized), EPA would encourage States to do so. As already explained in the preamble, a conditional exclusion of mercury-containing lamps or the addition of lamps to the universal waste management system could reduce barriers to participation in EPA's Green Lights program, which encourages pollution prevention through energy savings. Further, it could help to clarify for the regulated community the proper management of mercury-containing lamps. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the proposed options, by making regulations less stringent for management of lamps, would give States more freedom to develop programs for lamp disposal that would be appropriate for their situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Economic Impact Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order No. 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

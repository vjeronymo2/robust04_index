Each proposed transaction otherwise prohibited by section 17(a) or section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1 to which the Partnership is a party (the ``Section 17 Transactions'') will be effected only if the Board, through the General Partner, determines that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. The terms of the transaction, including the consideration to be paid or received, are fair and reasonable to the Partners and do not involve overreaching of the Partnership or its Partners on the part of any person concerned; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

In connection with the Section 17 Transactions, the Board, through the General Partner, will adopt, and periodically review and update, procedures designed to ensure that reasonable inquiry is made, prior to the consummation of any such transaction, with respect to the possible involvement in the transaction of any affiliated person or promoter of or principal underwriter for the Partnership, or any affiliated person of such a person, promoter, or principal underwriter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladas Burbulis] </F>   [Text] Vilnius June 20 TASS -- "An intention expressed by  the head of the U.S. Administration to meet leaders of the three  Baltic states in Riga on July 6 shows that the United States has  recognised and respects our independence," said Lithuanian  President Algirdas Brazauskas in a traditional interview on  national radio on Monday.    "I have received a very kind message to this effect from  Bill  Clinton in which he confirms the fact of his arrival in Riga and  his wish to meet the presidents of Latvia, Lithuania and  Estonia," Brazauskas said.    The Lithuanian president expects to discuss with Bill  Clinton  regional problems and hopes for Clinton's support which "has  been felt until now."    Brazauskas added that "we would attempt once again to  acquaint the U.S. president with the conditions for foreign  investments into the Lithuanian economy, which, in our opinion,  are not bad and which we are going to improve, taking into  account the experience of Central European states."</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Survey of Russia (3): Inspired individuals needed Some western observers ask whether it is realistic to expect Russia, with an administration which is itself desperately unreformed, to carry out the sorts of structural policies which have defeated many western governments, writes Leyla Boulton. Russian history reveals a deep-rooted tradition of state interference in the economy even before the 1917 Bolshevik revolution killed off Russian capitalism. But the doubts revolve around whether a Communist-era bureaucracy, with a Third World-level of corruption, can cater to the requirements of a modern market economy. Mr Grigory Yavlinsky, the prominent economist and a presidential hopeful, argues from his experience of conducting grass-roots reform in Nizhny-Novgorod province that the necessary policies are so simple they require little more than political will and expertise at the top. 'The problem is the mentality of a government and various lobbies which try to use money in a Soviet way,' he says. One example of a simple solution he is trying to introduce in Nizhny-Novgorod is provided by the burden on enterprises which have to pay for the maintenance of housing built for workers but no longer occupied exclusively by them. On the grounds that subsidising individuals is much more effective than subsidising unwieldy companies, the idea is to transform the corporate housing subsidies into salary increases for workers and let them deal with the housing as they like. Mr Yavlinsky is convinced that maintenance costs would fall to a third of their present level as residents sought to save money and rented out extra space to businesses. The benefits would be significant for attempts to restructure the economy as a whole. 'Only after that can you seriously talk of widespread bankruptcies of enterprises because this kind of reform would finally create a proper housing market, enabling people to move around the country to look for other jobs.' But he says the scheme is being held up because the government is refusing to let companies deduct from their tax bill the amounts they have until now deducted as housing subsidies. President Yeltsin's attempt to adopt a more pro-active approach to reform with the issue of a dozen new decrees this month included instructions for the sale of bankrupt state-owned enterprises. But Mr Boris Nemtsov, the governor of Nizhny-Novgorod, finds that it is still too vague to be helpful precisely because it provides no clear instructions on how to dispose of the so-called social assets attached to these enterprises. A related failure remains the absence of a convincing safety net capable of coping with poverty and mass unemployment. 'The main issue is that social support is not targeted,' says Mr Sergei Vasiliev, the radical deputy economics minister, who argues that reasonably well-off parents like himself should not, for example, qualify for child benefits. But partly because of political hang-ups about giving up a Soviet-era promise of benefits for all, means-testing - developed with success in the Baltic republic of Latvia - is unheard of in Russia. 'The social services do not know who the poorest are,' says Mr Vasiliev, who points out that it would be easy enough to use state-owned television to invite citizens who fall beneath a minimum subsistence level to apply for benefits. Despite widespread political hand-wringing over the social consequences of reform, he adds that the fact that no single ministry has overall responsibility for social policy means that nobody can be held responsible for its absence. The World Bank is discussing the establishment of pilot projects in three regions for improving the social safety net. But these would only take effect next year and would be of minor significance. Mr Vasiliev concludes that the government will only begin to take serious action under pressure from 'an external crisis, like an explosion in unemployment'. Meanwhile, the regions are being left to their own devices, with mixed results, as illustrated by the contrast between conservative Ulyanovsk (Lenin's birth-place), and Nizhny-Novgorod, a laboratory for economic reform. Both have social safety nets of a kind. Ulyanovsk, which continues to control prices, is maintaining a Soviet-era system. Nizhny-Novgorod has set up a minimum monthly income threshold of Rbs55,000 for every man, woman, and child. This means that the family of a factory worker on a salary of Rbs100,000, with an unemployed wife and two children, qualifies for an additional payment of Rbs110,000. This may not be much. But such initiatives provide ample proof that with inspired individuals in charge, Russia could deal with these pressing problems a lot more effectively than it is now.</p>

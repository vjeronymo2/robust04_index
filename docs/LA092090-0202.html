			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEMPLE CITY PLANS RECYCLING PROJECT  </P> <P> To help cut its waste 25% by 1995 -- as required by the state -- the Temple  City Council adopted a trash recycling program Tuesday that should be in  operation before the end of October.  </P> <P> The system, which will cost residents an extra $1.45 a month, provides to each  single-family home in the city three nesting bins, the size of milk crates, for  cans, glass and newspapers. These materials will be collected on each week's  second trash-pickup day.  </P> <P> The council said recycling programs for yard clippings and trash from  businesses are also planned.  </P></p>

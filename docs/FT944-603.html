			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: Revolution to redemption - Sarah Hemming admires a stage adaptation of 'A Tale of Two Cities' Best remembered by most of us for its opening and closing lines, Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities is a tricky novel to adapt, with its intricate storyline, constant shuttling between Paris and London and countless opportunities for sentimentality. It says much for Matthew Francis's fine, intelligent adaptation at Greenwich Theatre that it manages to embrace the scale, feel and thrust of the novel, and convey the sense of perpetual motion and of lives caught up in great events, while getting across (mostly) the complexities of the plot and bringing out the novel's fascinating themes of revolution, resurrection and redemption. There are no tricks, no frills and no musical numbers: this is a straightforward telling, and the better for it. Occasionally it plods, but mostly it is wholly absorbing. Julian McGowan's versatile set of dark wooden staircases, doors and platforms lowers over the auditorium and is both atmospheric and practical. We move from the Old Bailey to a Paris tenement to the walk to the guillotine with just a switch of lighting, no fuss and no elaborate changing of scenes - which is invaluable in keeping the momentum going. Beneath the staircase, centre stage, a pair of double doors and casually placed wheels suggest the shape of a coach: a visual emblem of the constant journeying to and fro that is at the heart of the book. The set also offers several platforms, an ingenious device which keeps the audience's eye moving round the stage and helps to overcome the fact that the novel is a different shape and has a very different impetus to a stage play. Francis's production, too, works hard to compensate for this, dramatising some scenes, reading some aloud, constantly moving and changing focus, to give the flavour of Dickens' original, as it see-saws between light and dark. The production is carried along by Timothy Walker's excellent Sydney Carton. Hair hanging in his eyes, clothes never quite where they should be, he is convincingly dissolute but manages to stay the right side of self-indulgence and makes sense of the characters disillusionment and final magnanimous act. And yes, he does speak those immortal last lines - and get away with it. Julian Mitchell as Dr Manette has a quiet, compelling gravitas (though he could do with quaking less in moments of great emotion) and Eleanor Tremain is appealing as Lucie, one of Dickens' difficult, flawless heroines. Bernard Lloyd is particularly good in the rather thankless role of Mr Jarvis Lorry, the amiable old banker who reunites the father and daughter - a masterful portrayal of decency and humanity; while Madame Defarge (Heather Tobias), the ruthless French revolutionary, sashays round the stage with an impervious, self-righteous smile. There are a few duff scenes - a rather lame staging of the French Revolution, for example - some heavy-handed sound effects, a few points where the pace drops and the production becomes solid, and the story could be clearer in places. Alexis Denisoff as Charles Darnay has little to go on, and makes very little of what he has (in the prison cell you would never believe he was a condemned man), while Susan Porrett wastes some of her comic opportunities as Miss Pross. But overall, this is an atmospheric, enjoyable production; not the best of adaptations, but far, far better than many. At Greenwich Theatre, SE10.</p>

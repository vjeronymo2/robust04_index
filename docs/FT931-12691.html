			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Akers to quit as IBM's chief executive INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS Machines, the troubled US computer group, said yesterday Mr John Akers would step down as chief executive. The company also said its quarterly dividend would be slashed from Dollars 1.21 to 54 cents, the first time it has cut its payout to shareholders. In an unprecedented move, IBM said the search for a new chief executive would be conducted outside the company as well as within the ranks of its senior executives. The management shake-up and dividend cut reflect the severity of IBM's difficulties and rising pressure from shareholders. Last week, it reported a net loss for 1992 of Dollars 4.9bn (Pounds 3.2bn) on sales of Dollars 64bn, the largest annual loss in US history, after taking restructuring charges of Dollars 11.6bn to cover the cost of drastic cuts in manufacturing and 40,000 job losses. Wall Street reacted positively to IBM's announcement, but analysts said the long-term health of the company remained in question. They expect additional large-scale write-offs. The share price, which has fallen more than Dollars 100 since July, surged yesterday to almost Dollars 53 when trading opened, but ended at Dollars 49 1/8 . The management changes were widely seen as a signal that IBM was prepared to take radical measures to return the company to profitability as quickly as possible. The dividend cut, although a disappointment to shareholders, had been expected after last week's earnings announcement. Mr Akers, who is 58 and had been expected to retire at the end of 1994, proposed at a meeting of IBM's board in New York on Monday that a search for a replacement be accelerated, IBM said. 'It is the right time in IBM's business transformation to identify new leadership,' Mr Akers said in a statement. He will remain chairman, at least for the time being. Underscoring the dramatic cultural changes that have shaken IBM under Mr Akers, he is the first chief executive of the company to retire early and the first for whom the board may seek an outside replacement. Moreover, IBM's non-executive directors have gained considerable power over IBM's executives in recent days. It was not immediately clear if they forced Mr Akers' resignation, as their counterparts recently did with the General Motors and American Express chief executives. Mr Akers has clearly been under increasing pressure from institutional investors and has been heavily criticised by industry commentators. It was also apparent that IBM's board wanted to prevent a prolonged controversy over the leadership. The selection of a new chief executive will be made by a new committee of outside directors chaired by Mr James Burke, former chairman of Johnson and Johnson and a long-time IBM board member. In the past such appointments have been made by executive directors. In other top management changes, Mr Frank Metz Jr, IBM's chief financial officer, who is 59, will retire a year earlier than expected. He will be succeeded by Mr Paul Rizzo, a former IBM vice-chairman. Mr Jack Kuehler, 60, will relinquish the title of IBM president, and becomes a board vice-chairman.

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Economics Notebook: An eery calm as new realities of the ERM sink in GREAT battles are often followed by a phoney war: and such has been the case in the European exchange rate mechanism. The dramatic events that ended in the early hours of August 2 in the widening of ERM fluctuation margins to 15 per cent gave way to an eery calm in exchange markets and a deafening silence about the future of the system from policy makers. But new realities are slowly taking hold. The Bundesbank's decision last Thursday to leave its discount rate unchanged at 6.75 per cent and its action on Friday setting a short-term 'repo' rate at 6.9 per cent against 6.8 per cent previously were blows for those who believed that the ERM might be able to count on falling German interest rates for quieter times ahead. The idea that former 'hard core' ERM currencies such as the French franc, Danish krone, Irish punt and Belgian franc might be able to move back within a 2.25 per cent range against the D-Mark is implausible for the time being at least. The Bundesbank made clear last week that it would use the freedom of the wider bands to strengthen its fight against domestic inflation. Last week's public flexing of the Bundesbank's muscles merely confirmed the reports that have seeped out of meetings of July 31 and August 1 of a brutal crushing of French monetary aspirations. France opened the discussions in the European Community's monetary committee on July 31 with demands that the Bundesbank should intervene unconditionally, intramarginally and on its own account to keep the franc in the 2.25 per cent range. France also urged an immediate cut in Germany's repo rate to be followed by reductions in official interest rates as soon as the Bundesbank's decision-making council could meet. It is unclear whether the French negotiators truly believed the Bundesbank would acquiesce to their demands. If they did, they were quickly disabused of the idea. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice president and president designate, interrupted Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the head of the French Treasury and monetary committee chairman, as he enumerated the French proposals with the observation that France had forgotten one item: that Germany abandon the D-Mark and its monetary sovereignty. Mr Tietmeyer's emergence as the hard man of the Brussels talks lends credence to reports that circulated shortly after the first great ERM crisis of September last year. It was rumoured among highly-placed European monetary officials that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had warned Mr Tietmeyer that he could forget about becoming Bundesbank president if the Franco-German currency link were broken. The old D-Mark-French franc parity survived successive crises that included the departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the ERM and the devaluations of the Iberian currencies and Irish punt. However, when the most recent wave of speculation began against the ERM in July, Mr Tietmeyer's promotion to Bundesbank president on October 1 had been confirmed and he was well clear of any possible move by Bonn to curb his room for manoeuvre. But there were also practical reasons for yielding to market pressures and moving to a 15 per cent ERM fluctuation band for all currencies except the D-Mark and Dutch guilder. The flow of funds out of the French franc at the end of July was unprecedented. The ERM was protected by exchange controls in most member states when it started operating in March 1979. The past year showed that it was no longer capable of dealing with the pressure of deregulated international currency trading. In the light of recent circumstances, it is no surprise that policy makers are still somewhat shell-shocked and disinclined to advocate new steps to reform or restore the old system. Conversations last week with monetary officials in Germany and some of Germany's neighbouring countries revealed an almost universal rejection of the idea of moving rapidly back to 2.25 per cent fluctuation margins for the ERM. Pride and embarrassment are contributing to a do-nothing approach. Last September's crisis spawned two official reports - one from the EC central bank governors' committee and the other from the EC monetary committee - which concluded that the ERM was broadly sound. Those reports, which look ridiculous today, were the result of lengthly horse trading among officials which eliminated all but the blandest remarks from the final texts. Officials do not want to reopen old wounds with a thorough-going examination of recent ERM developments. But inaction may not be a sustainable policy. The quest for European Monetary Union will not go away despite the past year of crisis in European exchange markets. Even Emu sceptics among continental policy makers are uncomfortable with a monetary free-for-all which could easily subvert the EC's single market. One central banker last week suggested that the Maastricht convergence criteria for low inflation, government debt and interest rates could be used to guide EC member states back towards the narrow bands in the coming years after which they could move swiftly to Emu. The financial markets are a more pressing issue. August has been quiet because many speculators went on holiday after banking huge profits from the ERM debacle. Market operators return in force this week for the 'autumn term'. The reluctance of France and Germany's ERM satellites to cut their most important interest rates and stimulate their recession-hit economies in the past weeks will be the subject of as much critical scrutiny as the Bundesbank's determination to maintain its tight monetary policy. Few of the expectations that followed the most recent ERM crisis have been fulfilled. That means new speculative activity could easily get underway, particularly in the run up to the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank at the end of September.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In the file of the Middle East, the PLO is still  exerting efforts with Western countries for obtaining financial  aid, and at the same time prepares itself for a new round of  talks with Israel which will most certainly be held in Cairo.  Nabila Khraifia:    [Khraifia] [passage omitted] President 'Arafat sent Abu  al-'Ala [Ahmad Quray], economy minister in the Palestinian  authority, to Washington to ask for urgent financial aid to  ensure the running of the self-rule institutions.    That was announced in Tunis by a Palestinian official who  refused to reveal his identity. He also pointed out that the  lack of money was the main reason for postponing President  'Arafat's trip to the self-rule areas and the installment of the  Palestinian government in Jericho.    The same source pointed out that the donor countries had  proposed to offer the PLO last week $ 10 million dollar of the $  24 million which they promised on 10 June last, and had raised  it to $18 million dollar after President Yasir 'Arafat had  rejected it.</p>

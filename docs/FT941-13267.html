			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom back in the black Northern Telecom returned to profitability in the fourth quarter of last year, but the telecommunications equipment maker dampened the good news with a warning that it would slip back into the red in the early part of 1994. Following two consecutive quarterly losses, Northern posted fourth-quarter net earnings of USDollars 106m, or 42 cents a share, down from Dollars 256m, or Dollars 1.02, a year earlier. Revenues dipped by 3.3 per cent to Dollars 2.46bn, with strong growth in Europe more than offset by declines in Canada and other overseas markets. Revenues from central office switches were flat, but sales of cable and transmission products were sharply down. Fourth-quarter orders were virtually unchanged from a year earlier, but the year-end order backlog of Dollars 4.82bn was 35 per cent higher. Northern has been thrown into turmoil by a loss of market share in its core central office switch business, delays in bringing fibre-optic transmission products to market, and its slow start in cellular phone technology. Mr Jean Monty, who has spearheaded a shake-up since taking over as chief executive early last year, said the restructuring plan begun in mid-1993 will take 18 months to complete. As a result, 'we will build profitability as we go through the year'. An operating loss is expected in the first quarter, due to a combination of pricing pressures, unfavourable product mix and seasonally lower volumes. But Mr Monty expressed the hope that the benefits of lower costs and a strengthened portfolio of products would emerge later in the year. He singled out wireless and broadband radio products to be launched in the second quarter, and rising sales of central office software in the second half. Ms Hilary Mine, an analyst with Northern Business Information in Portland, Oregon, predicted that 'in the long run, you'll see them come back as a major player'. Ms Mine said she was impressed by new switching software unveiled last autumn, and by its growing focus on operations outside North America. The contribution of offshore markets grew to 29 per cent of revenues last year from 26 per cent in 1992. Northern suffered losses of Dollars 878m, or Dollars 3.54 per share, for 1993 as a whole, due largely to restructuring and other charges totalling Dollars 1.16bn.</p>

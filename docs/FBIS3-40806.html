Ahmad Humayyid al-Tayir, minister of state for finance and  industry affairs, disclosed that the deficit in the federal  government's budget will decrease in 1994 by 322.6 million  dirhams [UD] to UD1.3972 billion ($380 million) compared with  UD1.720 billion ($468 million) in 1993. Al-Tayir stated that his  ministry had passed the proposed draft budget along to the  Council of Ministers that the Council will discuss tomorrow,  Monday.    The 1994 budget is estimated at UD17.6172 billion ($4.8  billion) compared with UD17.6309 billion ($4.804 billion), or an  increase of only UD13.7 million ($4 million dollars). [sentence  as published]    However, the important development that al-Tayir disclosed  is  the increase in private revenues in the federal government's  budget for 1994, estimated at UD300 million ($81.7 million) more  than 1993 revenues of UD15.911 billion ($4.335 billion), or  UD16.22 billion ($4.420 billion) in the current year.    The minister did not disclose the sources for this increase  in the new budget's resources, but financial sources indicate  that a potential increase of private revenues for the government  ministries and institutions is from fees and taxes that they  receive from services offered to citizens. These are basically  concentrated in the health, electricity, water and internal  customs sectors. The electricity minister recently announced an  increase in the electricity tariff to cover a large part of [the  ministry's] losses. Abu Dhabi and Dubai, the largest Emirates in  the state, participate in the federal budget with about 90  percent of its total resources, according to an agreement  reached on this matter in 1979.    The figures disclosed by the minister of state for finance  and industry indicate that Abu Dhabi's and Dubai's participation  in the 1994 budget did not decrease from that of 1993 despite  the decrease in oil prices.</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Merseyside profit 'declines 18.1%' The operating profit of Merseyside's top 100 companies, based on accounts filed in 1993-94, fell 18.1 per cent to Pounds 569m from Pounds 695m as they fought for business in the recession. Merseyside plc, an aggregate analysis by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick of the area's biggest businesses, says the fall in operating profit occurred in spite of a 3.1 per cent rise in turnover, indicating a significant squeeze on margins. This, it says, is likely to be due to companies being unable to pass cost increases to consumers in full and new business being won at lower margins. It notes, however, that Pilkington, the glass maker, accounted for 71 per cent of the operating profits fall. An increase in non-trading income and reduced interest charges contained the fall in pre-tax profits - down to Pounds 461m from Pounds 543m - to 15 per cent. Turnover rose to Pounds 14,779m from Pounds 14,338m. The businesses on which the analysis is based include plcs and private companies. The survey, compiled as a barometer of the area's economic health, says the pressure on margins has encouraged managements to review productivity, resulting in enhanced competitiveness and high capital investment. KPMG says this trend, with Merseyside's recently declared eligibility for European Union Objective 1 funds, supports the view that the tide is turning for Merseyside. Merseyside plc.

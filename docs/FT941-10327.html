			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Lossmakers accuse Lloyd's council Lossmaking Names who oppose the insurance market's Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer have alleged that members' of the Lloyd's council - or governing body - stand to benefit from the deal. The Names - individuals whose assets support the market - said that a number of members of the council have a higher than average involvement as Names on syndicates underwriting errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurance. Their liabilities will in effect be capped if the deal is accepted next week. Errors and omissions insurers, who cover Lloyd's agents against legal awards for negligence, are understood to be contributing about Pounds 400m to the Pounds 900m offer. The offer document issued to Names indicated that their actual exposure to claims was between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. Mr Michael Freeman, a solicitor representing loss-making Names, said council members should 'disclose their interest in E&amp;O syndicates when recommending Names to accept the Lloyd's settlement offer which has such substantial benefits for E&amp;O insurers'. Mr Freeman added: 'This is especially the case where the external members of the council have written to all Names urging them to accept the offer without mentioning this plain conflict of interest.' Lloyd's said yesterday that errors and omissions cover was written widely across the market and that there were hundreds of reinsurers both in Lloyd's and outside it. 'It is therefore impossible to assess the final impact on any one Name from a claim being made,' Lloyd's said. 'Lloyd's finds it very disturbing that, at a time when many members are faced with a serious financial decision affecting their membership, they should also be confronted with a flood of disinformation and scare stories.'</p>

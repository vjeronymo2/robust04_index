			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Gas challenge date advanced THE GOVERNMENT is to introduce more competition into the gas market earlier than expected, it announced yesterday. Mr Tim Eggar, minister for energy, indicated that he would consider opening the household gas market to rival suppliers in May next year  - three years sooner than expected. The government had previously said that domestic consumers would be offered a choice of supplier after 1996. Mr Eggar's comments followed the first meeting he has had with Mr Robert Evans, the chairman of British Gas, since taking up his appointment after the election. The meeting came after a fierce exchange on Wednesday between the company and Sir James McKinnon, the industry regulator, when Sir James threatened British Gas with legal action if it failed to cut its domestic prices immediately. Mr Eggar told Mr Evans he was surprised at the way in which British Gas had reacted and over its reluctance to cut household gas prices. He emphasised nevertheless that the issue should be decided between the regulator and the company. Mr Eggar said he would ask parliament to open up a greater segment of the industrial gas market for competitors to British Gas next month. That would allow 200,000 smaller commercial and industrial customers to negotiate gas supplies with competitors to British Gas in time for the new contract year, which begins in October. Mr Eggar's first step will be to lower the threshold for gas consumption under which rival suppliers will be allowed into the market. At present, customers must use 25,000 therms of gas a year before being allowed to choose a supplier. That will be reduced to 2,500 therms this year and possibly further next year.</p>

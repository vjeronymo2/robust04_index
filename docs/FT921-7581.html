			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / FT wins newspaper of the year award THE Financial Times has been named newspaper of the year in Granada Television's What The Papers Say annual awards. The judges praised the paper's 'new responsiveness' in its coverage of the Gulf war, the collapse of the Soviet Union and a series of business scandals, notably the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the Maxwell empire. Although parts of the newspaper remained primarily of interest to the specialist reader, the judges were impressed by the 'almost novelistic newsiness in the way some of the scandals were reported.' The award, said the judges, recognised the FT's 'remarkable energy, its new investigative and news-gathering strength and its visibly broadened appeal.' Mr Richard Lambert, the editor of the FT, received the award from Mr Roy Hattersley, the shadow home secretary. 'This is a great and welcome tribute to an outstanding team of journalists,' Mr Lambert said. This is the 35th year in which the press awards have been made by Granada, whose What The Papers Say is the longest running weekly programme on British television. The programme named Martin Woollacott of the Guardian journalist of the year, citing the 'dignity and enormous influence' of his reporting from Kurdistan. Other awards went to Private Eye, the satirical journal, (magazine of the year); Phil Davison of the Independent (foreign correspondent); Anne Leslie of the Daily Mail (feature writer); John Naughton of the Observer (critic) and Matt Pritchett of the Daily Telegraph (cartoonist).

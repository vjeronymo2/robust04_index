			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A sailor aboard a disabled pleasure boat and five crewmen from a passing  freighter, who tried to rescue him but also fell victim to rough seas, were  finally rescued about 900 miles west of San Francisco, the Coast Guard said.  The Panamanian merchant ship, Washington Rainbow II, received a Mayday call  from the sailor when his boat, Juicy Anna, lost a mast and began taking on  water, Coast Guard officials said in Long Beach. After the 45-year-old San  Francisco captain of the Juicy Anna, whose name was not immediately available,  lost his life raft, five crew members from the merchant ship launched their  lifeboat and pulled the man safely aboard, officials said. But the lifeboat  lost power in the 15-foot seas, which Hall described as "hazardous" to small  vessels. Coast Guard officials then contacted a 560-foot American-registered  freighter, the President Lincoln, to go to the area and crew members rescued  the six men, the Coast Guard said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1ST GAY MALE EPISCOPAL PRIEST IS ORDAINED  </P> <P> An Episcopal bishop Saturday ordained the church's first openly homosexual male  priest in a ceremony marred by only one brief interruption.  </P> <P> Bishop John Spong of Newark quickly brushed off two dissenters before formally  welcoming J. Robert Williams, leader of the Oasis ministry for homosexual  Episcopalians, into the priesthood.  </P> <P> Following church protocol, Spong opened the ordination at All Saints Church in  Hoboken by asking if anyone knew "of any impediment or crime" that should  prevent Williams from becoming a priest.  </P> <P> When two people spoke up, the bishop talked to them and continued the ceremony.  He said he had heard their arguments and saw no reason to delay the ordination.  </P> <P> Spong said the new priest had proven himself spiritually, emotionally and  pastorally, which sparked a burst of applause from the congregation.  </P> <P> Williams is the Episcopal Church's second openly homosexual priest. A lesbian,  the Rev. Ellen Barret, was ordained in New York in 1977 by Bishop Paul Moore.  </P></p>

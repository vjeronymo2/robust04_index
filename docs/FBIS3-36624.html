			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, Russian Federation deputy </F> foreign minister, by Yelena Kalyadina; place and date not given:  "Diplomacy Without Pomp or Bomb"]    [Text] It would be impossible to imagine Russian policy in  war-torn Yugoslavia without the modest and charming Vitaliy  Churkin, a diplomat of 20 years' standing. The deputy foreign  minister has studied the situation on the spot, and not just  from UN reports. For this reason the journalistic fraternity,  which is sincerely in sympathy with him, nicknamed him the  "Yugoslav shuttle." So it was him that we asked to comment on  the tragic events in Sarajevo and also to speak about the  initiative recently advanced by Russia for settling the Yugoslav  crisis.    [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, I remember how at a news  conference you answered a question about why Russia, which is  making a big contribution to the process of a Yugoslav  settlement, does not advance its own independent plan by saying:  "We are modest people." What now: Have we overcome our  timidity and decided to show ourselves?    [Churkin] No. That was said at the time rather as a joke.  During the war in the Balkans Russia has repeatedly advanced its  own initiatives. Precisely at critical moments in the  development of events, moreover. A real danger has now arisen  that all the tremendous work which the international community  has done in its attempt to resolve the conflict by political  means might be wrecked. If a settlement is not achieved on the  basis of the plan for creating unions [unii] of the republics of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the situation will exacerbate sharply and  could entail deeper world community involvement in the conflict  -- with an extremist approach, moreover.    To avoid such a development of events we proposed carefully  preparing and holding a session of the UN Security Council at  foreign minister level in Geneva and inviting representatives of  the three warring sides in Bosnia to it, together with  delegations from the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] and  Croatia. The idea in itself is simple. But any initiative can  look good, in my view, when it fits in with what has already  been achieved. This is the crux of our proposal: to continue a  more intensive joint search for a political settlement by  utilizing the authority of the United Nations.    [Kalyadina] Two chief questions in a Yugoslav settlement fit  in with the well-known "carrot and stick" policy. The  possibility of bombing strikes acts as the stick. The carrot is  the encouraging prospect of the lifting of sanctions from  Yugoslavia. According to our new initiative, Russia will  advocate their lifting in the very near future if an accord is  reached. And yet I remember you saying quite recently that  things will not get moving without compliance with sanctions.  Is this a fundamental revision of our position?    [Churkin] No, essentially our position has not changed. The  fact that on this issue we have succeeded in getting some things  moving is another matter. We have gotten an understanding with  the European Union that, once a peace agreement on  Bosnia-Herzegovina is signed, the sanctions will be lifted as it  is implemented. A different situation is also possible, whereby  the Serbian side will fulfill all the demands made of it, while  the others will be unwilling to undertake a political  settlement. In that case it will be necessary to find an  opportunity to lift the sanctions from Yugoslavia on carefully  stipulated terms. We must, after all, be mindful of the fact  that not only the FRY is suffering as a result of them -- all  the Balkan countries are incurring losses running into billions.    [Kalyadina] The United States also seems to be starting to  think about this. THE NEW YORK TIMES recently carried an  interesting item, namely CIA forecasts from which it follows  that the economic embargo against Serbia has outlived its  usefulness and will very soon be lifted. Assessments by such a  powerful organization as the CIA and published, moreover, in  such an influential newspaper represent a kind of trial balloon.  How realistic, in your view, is a revision of the U.S.  positions on the sanctions issue?    [Churkin] It is obvious to me and to many other observers  that the U.S. position is changing substantially. At first,  after acceding to power, the Clinton administration believed  that the events in Bosnia represented aggression by Serbia. But  now the United States is increasingly realizing that a civil war  is at the bottom of the conflict. It is interesting that,  whereas a year ago the Americans did not accept our approaches  at all, they now sometimes quote us when they speak of their  understanding of what is happening. In general there is  evolution. But I do not believe that it will quickly result in  the question of lifting the sanctions being raised, since the  U.S. internal political struggle over the "Yugoslav issue" is  even more complex than in our country.    Europeans frequently criticize the Americans for not taking  an active enough part in the Yugoslav business. But I believe,  and I try to prove this to them, that the conflict is taking  place in Europe, where primarily European interests are  concentrated, and the Americans simply do not want to get  involved.    [Kalyadina] The Belgrade newspaper POLITIKA, which reprinted  the article from THE NEW YORK TIMES, arrives at this remarkable  conclusion: If it revises its views on the Yugoslav crisis,  Washington could gain prestige by once again acting in the role  an omnipotent peacemaker, and the Europeans should reflect on  this. But maybe we should too? Is it not time for Russia to  take the "Balkan question" into its own hands?    [Churkin] When a problem involves many countries it is  essential to start by asking ourselves: Just what do we want?  A real solution to the problem, or a propaganda effect?    We have all emerged from the Cold War, when there was little  policy and a lot of propaganda. The main thing was to make some  kind of grand initiative. And it was not important that  everyone then forgot about it immediately -- the important thing  was to get in first. But if you require something real it is  sometimes more useful if the initiative is taken by your  partners. That is how, in my view, the Yugoslav crisis should  be seen. We are berated around the world for allegedly being  pro-Serb. And if, say, an initiative to lift sanctions was  proposed by us, it would stand little chance of success. When  the same thing is proposed by the EU, it is quite a different  matter. What is important here is that the proposal embody our  approaches. Look, after the failure of the Vance-Owen plan a  new European version of the plan arose. However, we were the  first in diplomatic contacts to talk about that plan's  inevitable failure... I believe that quiet diplomacy is far  more useful than noisy diplomacy.    And in general it is good when policy is made by those in  good physical and financial shape. Every initiative should have  material support. It is one thing if we propose a settlement  plan and have four divisions to implement it or several  billions, say, to restore Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Kalyadina] The question of sanctions can be put as follows:  By advocating the lifting of sanctions, will Russia not be  helpinmg to strengthen the internal political position of the  Belgrade authorities and President Milosevic?    [Churkin] That does not worry me at all. We would get even  more bogged down if in seeking a settlement we tried to harm  particular authorities. Moreover, there is, as the recent  elections showed, no alternative to Milosevic at the present  time. This has to be taken into account, as does the fact that  the president has recently been playing a very constructive role  in the talks.    [Kalyadina] How, in your opinion, will Milosevic's victory  help to resolve the conflict? After all, in the runup to the  elections he had to think not only about how to loosen the  sanctions stranglehold but also how to avoid being suspected, as  it were, of undue leniency toward the Muslims and Croats.    [Churkin] There is a general postulate here: the stronger  the authority, the easier it is to make compromises. But I  would not want my words here to be interpreted as meaning that  the Serbs have hidden scope for concessions.    [Kalyadina] Vitaliy Ivanovich, there was recently a verbal  duel between your chief, Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr. Zhirinovskiy.  Vladimir Volfovich threatened the minister with dismissal if he  did not very quickly alter the policy in the Balkans and side  unconditionally with the Serbs. In this regard the respected  newspaper IZVESTIYA made a dispiriting forecast of growing  conflict between the Foreign Ministry and the Duma. How  justified was this?    [Churkin] I have quite the opposite feeling. In terms of  foreign policy in general and the Yugoslav settlement in  particular we will, it seems to me, enjoy considerably more  constructive relations with the Duma than with the former  Supreme Soviet. There will be fewer attempts to introduce  domestic policy conflicts into foreign policy and more work will  get done. I, for example, can subscribe almost in its entirety  to the resolution on Yugoslavia passed by the Duma. I would  make only one addition. I would add the word "promptly" to the  phrase "Propose that the president raise officially the question  of lifting sanctions in the Security Council." And then sign.    Moreover, in my opinion, the Serbs have realized that  nothing  will come of trying to exploit our domestic political conflicts.    [Kalyadina] So has it now become irrelevant to ask "Whom do  you, our masters of diplomacy, side with -- Serbs or Croats?"  That, after all, is the way it was put to us at the start of the  conflict...    [Churkin] I consider the main problem in this conflict to be  the extremist approaches of all three sides, including the  Serbs. And those who state that as Slavs side we should with the  Serbs are unwittingly doing the Serbs a bad turn, as they are  giving support to those of them who are urging their own people  to commit suicide.    The conflict in general is so complex that it is impossible  to fathom without having been on the spot and gotten the feel of  it all.    [Kalyadina] You have been there, indeed many times. And,  incidentally, changes in your views are noticeable. Whereas  previously you reminded people more of a  professor-cum-theoretician of diplomacy, now, forgive the  comparison, you are more like a "city manager" of diplomacy.  Have you revised your stance fundamentally?    [Churkin] I would not say that I had a pro- or anti-Western  stance on the Yugoslav question. But I have always thought  that, if we confronted the United States and Europe, nothing  would be achieved either in terms of a settlement or in our  relations. We have achieved the main aim of pursuing our own  line but without falling out with anyone. We have won respect,  it seems to me, even among those who criticize us.    [Kalyadina] Given such esteem, perhaps a Churkin plan will  shortly replace the Vance, Owen, and Stoltenberg plans?    [Churkin] No, and do not get the idea that I am the author  of our entire policy in the Balkans; I merely maintain contacts.  As far as plans are concerned, as you can see, for the time  being nothing specific is coming from them. It is extremely  difficult to divide up a multinational country, where everything  was tightly interwoven until still quite recently.    [Kalyadina] What, then, can we do?    [Churkin] We can hope for improvement, including the success  of our initiative    [Kalyadina] Excuse me, but I do not somehow very much share  your hopes. In my view, the actual UN mechanism through which  Russia intends to implement its idea is considerably out of  date. The previous commander of the UN forces in Bosnia, the  Belgian General Bricquemont, submitted his resignation with the  words: "I am not reading any more Security Council resolutions,  because they do not help...."    [Churkin] But no other mechanism has yet been devised. So  we have to improve the existing ones. Moreover, it is not the  case that everything is bad. The United Nations used to be an  organization of ideological confrontation. Now times are  different.    As far as our initiative is concerned, we will be able to  talk about success if we manage to preserve the current  settlement plan. When the Vance-Owen plan failed and the "let's  bomb" proposal was made we managed to get everyone back to the  negotiating table. That situation is shaping up now.    [Kalyadina] So to recall the classic formula: It is one  step forward, two steps back...    [Churkin] That's the way it goes. In many respects  diplomacy is a Sisyphean labor.</p>

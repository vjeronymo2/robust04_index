			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / The Clinton-Yeltsin Summit: Clinton tries to lead out the cavalry THERE have been 25 summits between the inhabitants of the White House and the Kremlin in the 33 1/2 years since President Dwight Eisenhower entertained Mr Nikita Khruschev at Camp David in September, 1959. All of them, even President George Bush's valedictory trip to Moscow in January to sign the Start Two treaty, were dominated by the arms control and security issues that characterised the cold war. President Bill Clinton meets President Boris Yeltsin of Russia in Vancouver today with a different purpose in view. In the words of a senior administration official, 'economics have now replaced traditional security issues as the centrepiece of US-Russian relations'. 'Past summits,' he went on, 'were designed to minimise the harm each could do to the other. Now the intent is to maximise the good.' Mr Clinton himself made an eloquent pitch for the new partnership in a speech on Thursday aimed not only, in its call for 'a strategic alliance with Russian reform', at Americans and Russians but also at other industrialised nations. Implicit in it was the contention that, if past summits had seen the US take on the role of protector of its allies, Vancouver required that US leadership be followed by G7 action. Fine words and Mr Clinton will be laying before Mr Yeltsin a series of practical proposals to put flesh on the bones of this promised new 'partnership'. Conventional security considerations will be on the agenda, since there is unfinished nuclear missile business and regional conflicts to be addressed, but the US sees them as essentially secondary now. Mr Clinton has a lot riding on his first presidential foreign foray. There is little disagreement with his analysis that promoting the cause of a co-operative market-oriented Russian democracy is of immeasurable benefit to the US. Opinion polls demonstrate broad support for his approach, as did, in a statement this week, the four living former Republican presidents. His problems are twofold: first the US ability to determine the course of events in Russia itself is minimal. It may support, with words and some money, the reform process but it cannot ensure the survival of Mr Yeltsin, the embodiment of that reform, nor of other reform-minded leaders. 'Only the Russians can save Russian democracy' is the administration's invariable litany. Second, the president has his own money problem. Officials refuse to put dollar figures on what the bilateral offer to Mr Yeltsin will be, but concede that, initially, it will only be drawn from funds already approved by Congress for Russia in the last and current fiscal year, plus a little extra. Informed speculation suggests about a Dollars 400m total this year and Dollars 700m next, though these estimates may be low. This recognises the domestic political reality that there is not much of a constituency, in Congress or the country at large, for throwing large sums of money at Russia at a time when budget cutting at home is the order of the day. Within these limitations, however, the bilateral US programme is designed to be eye-catching. Officials say that three quarters of its value will be directed 'outside of Moscow' and to 'non-governmental partners.' Its elements are likely to include a Dollars 200m-plus privatisation support programme, an 'enterprise fund' for new business, starting small but growing, housing construction projects for returning Russian military officers and men, humanitarian asssistance in the form of food and medicines, the dispatch of US technological and management experts, additional grain credits, and assorted energy initiatives, including, possibly, an oil barter arrangement. But the bilateral proposals, according to senior officials, are also seen as 'a catalyst to multilateral action.' Vancouver, they say, is part of a continuous process, the next stage of which is the meeting of the Group of Seven's foreign and financial ministers in Tokyo on April 14. The US expects other nations to have announced their own individual assistance programmes by then and that the Tokyo session takes real decisions. Elements of the international package known to be under consideration, perhaps worth Dollars 30bn, include a Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund, as much as Dollars 9bn in loans from the IMF, World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, some Dollars 4bn in debt relief this year, and a large assortment of trading credits. A good portion of last year's Dollars 24bn package remains unspent and the US accepts that today disbursement of more depends on Russia meeting reasonable conditions, not least a responsible monetary policy. Thus Mr Clinton will be pressing Mr Yeltsin for some firm commitments to reform, to which, in Moscow's current political climate, the Russian president may find hard to respond. The sense of US confidence is guarded. But the alternative - sitting back and letting events in Russia take their course - is not an option while Mr Yeltsin is in office, nor may it be for as long as there is life in the Russianreform movement.</p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> Instead of amending the Constitution to make it illegal to burn or otherwise  desecrate the flag, I suggest enacting a law that would equate such desecration  with a voluntary renunciation of the perpetrator's U.S. citizenship. Those  individuals who choose to show such disrespect for our country's flag would  then no longer enjoy the benefits of citizenship, such as protection from  prosecution for acts of vandalism by appealing to the First Amendment.  </P> <P> Couldn't these non-citizens then be subject to deportation to a country whose  flag is more to their liking?  </P> <P> LORI JANOWSKI  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

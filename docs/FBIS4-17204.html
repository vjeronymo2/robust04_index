			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian and Ukrainian military officials have held  further behind-the-scenes talks in Sevastopol in an effort to  overcome the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet (BSF). Defence  ministers Pavel Grachev and Vitaliy Radetskyy met privately  before the two delegations went into a full-scale session.    Experts on both sides meeting later in the day on Thursday  had failed to reach agreement on the location of the  headquarters of Russian and Ukrainian parts of the Fleet, one  negotiator told INTERFAX on condition of anonymity.    Ukraine wants to hold back to Sevastopol as its naval  stronghold or share it together with Moscow.    The source believes that a sharing out of the Fleet is the  only issue the two sides are most likely to resolve. He said  Kiev might settle down for 18 pct of the BSF with the remainder  going to Russia.    Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk meeting in Moscow a week ago  had agreed that Ukraine's share of the Fleet would run at 15-20  pct.    Moscow has remitted more than 250 billion karbovantsy for  the  upkeep of the Fleet this week though the April bill runs at 257  billion, member of the Russian military delegation Vasiliy  Vorobyev told INTERFAX. He said Kiev had stopped BSF financing  since the end of last year.</p>

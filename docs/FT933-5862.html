			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Lloyd's underwriters earn over Pounds 100,000 despite losses AT LEAST 150 Lloyd's underwriters earned Pounds 100,000 or more in 1992, according to figures to be published today by the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest organisation of Names. The scale of remuneration - only marginally less than that paid in 1991 - is bound to increase controversy at the market, where many Names face ruin following losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years. Average earnings for the 150 best-paid underwriters were Pounds 143,673. Although the figures include an element of profit-related pay for 1989, in line with the market's three-year accounting system, the Lloyd's market as a whole made losses of Pounds 2.1bn in that year. Already one of the best paid underwriters, Mr Stephen Merrett, deputy chairman of the insurance market, who was paid Pounds 207,000 as underwriter of syndicate 418 in 1992, has been experiencing increasing difficulty in persuading Names to continue to back his syndicates. It emerged yesterday that members' agents, who handle the affairs of Names and channel them on to syndicates, can supply only about Pounds 50m of capital to the biggest of the Merrett Group's syndicates, number 418, for next year. That is about a third of the level with which it is operating in 1993. Syndicate 418, which underwrites US liability business, is one of the most important in the Lloyd's market. A second Merrett syndicate, number 1,067, has also suffered from a sharp fall in popularity among Names. As a result the Merrett agency is stepping up its efforts to attract corporate investors to support its business. Merrett is hoping to convert Bermuda-based Underwriting Capital (Merrett) - set up this year to provide reinsurance to its syndicates - into a fully fledged incorporated Name as soon as Lloyd's rules permit. JP Morgan, the bank, and Marsh McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, are the main supporters of the company.</p>

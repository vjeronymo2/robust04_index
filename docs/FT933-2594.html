			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (6): Euro-predictions go awry - Brian Bollen reports less, not more activity in the EC single market RECESSION is taking the brunt of the blame for the slowdown in European cross-border mergers and acquisitions. When the single market came into being at the start of this year, many merchant and investment bankers confidently predicted that there would be a renewed wave of activity as companies faced up to the market's competitive pressures. The evidence of the first few months shows that this has not happened. Indeed, current wisdom is that much M&amp;A activity executed under the banner of the single market was driven by other more traditional factors: the consolidation of mature industries, the search for global competitiveness or a quick increase in market share. Many bankers reason that activity will recover when Europe's recessions end and that volume will be increased by privatisation, the deregulation of industry sectors, and by restructurings and non-core disposals in the need to increase solvency. Euro-sceptics argue, however, that substantial acquisitions are taking longer to digest than first thought. Today there is a more realistic attitude towards the single market. One prediction that has been borne out is the change in the nature of international corporate activity. Hostile takeovers are out, and a more co-operative approach, characterised by mergers, alliances and joint ventures, is in. Underlining the effect of recession is the shift in the balance of power, from seller to buyer. On non-core disposals, you can kiss the old-fashioned auction approach goodbye, says Mr Francois von Hurter, co-head of European M&amp;A at the Credit Suisse First Boston group. Life in the new world requires more flexibility and imagination on the part of bankers. The recession contributed to a 40 per cent fall in the volume of cross-border M&amp;A activity worldwide in the first half of 1993, according to the Deal Watch survey carried out by KPMG, the international accounting firm. The survey recorded preliminary figures for cross-border acquisitions of Dollars 25.2bn in the first six months, compared with Dollars 42.2bn in the same period in 1992. French buying activity fell most, from Dollars 8.7bn to Dollars 428m. Although French companies have been the most enthusiastic buyers of companies in other EC countries (French purchases from 1988 to first half 1993 have totalled Dollars 35.7bn), the French recession dictates a cautious approach to investment. Survival rather than expansion is the priority. Italian purchases also fell sharply. Investigations into political and business corruption are cited as the significant factors - while companies and senior executives are under suspicion of bribery, it is difficult for them to focus on large-scale foreign expansion. The value of cross-border sales of EC companies nose-dived again in the first half of this year, to Dollars 12.3bn, after recovering to Dollars 42bn in the full year 1992, from Dollars 23.1bn in the full year 1991. Japanese purchases of EC companies have declined rapidly since the peak year of 1990, when there were 50 deals, worth almost Dollars 3.4bn. In the first half of 1993, KPMG logged just seven Japanese purchases, worth a total of Dollars 34m. The most popular target sectors for Japanese companies buying into the EC in 1988-93 were hotels and catering, electrical and electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, real estate and wholesale distribution. US buying over the same period shows a different pattern, with purchases peaking a year earlier, when there were 221 purchases worth Dollars 12.1bn. That figure slumped in 1990, but has been recovering steadily ever since. In the first half of 1993, KPMG recorded 88 US buys, worth a total of nearly Dollars 4.4bn. The main target sectors have been vehicle manufacturing, food, drink and tobacco, electrical and electronics, chemicals and pharmaceuticals and oil and gas. The UK has been everyone's favourite target EC country. Bankers like to remind one, however, that the European single market is a marathon, not a sprint; its requirements will feature as an important consideration in the long term, if only because the EC is a long way behind the US in industry consolidation. Large-scale consolidation is widely predicted, for example, in banking and financial services, whether through alliances, cross-shareholdings or acquisition. In five to 10 years there will probably be fewer independent banks and insurance companies in the UK, says Mr John Studzinski, managing director responsible for Morgan Stanley International's financial advisory business in Europe. The Bank of England agrees that the expected benefits of the single market programme have yet to be fully realised in banking and financial services. In its most recent quarterly report the Bank says it is perhaps more apparent that early expectations were themselves rather unrealistic, especially on timing and the extent of the transformation that could be achieved within EC financial markets. Institutions are continuing to make acquisitions and establish co-operation agreements, says the Bank. A number of factors could yet lead to a resurgence of activity. In the end, the single market programme may yet have a profound impact on the financial services sector within the EC. In food and drink, Philip Morris of the US has carefully built up its European core business since the acquisition of Jacobs Suchard in 1990, notes J P Morgan. It followed up with the acquisition of Norway's Freia Marabou last year and Terry's of the UK this year - important moves to fill gaps in its product portfolio and geographic coverage. Many medium-sized food companies will continue to be acquired and consolidated into the majors, says Mr Studzinski. Retailing is tipped as a possible candidate for consolidation, too, although there is uncertainty about whether retailing can work well on a grand scale, and whether retailing concepts can be exported successfully. Judgment is reserved on the French forays of Kingfisher and Tesco. Kingfisher's purchase of Darty, an electrical retailer, and Tesco's purchase of Catteau remain an intriguing exception rather than a new rule. The pharmaceuticals and personal healthcare sector has already seen large-scale international consolidation. Recent significant announcements were the joint ventures between the UK's Glaxo and Wellcome and Warner-Lambert of the US; but analysts say there are still too many medium-sized players. Heavy research and development bills will make it difficult for smaller companies to survive. There are likely to be further consolidating moves in the European pharmaceuticals sector, says Mr Stephen Brisby, head of UBS's European corporate finance arm, which advised Italy's Montedison on the sale. In deregulated growth industries, such as telecommunications, Bell Canada's purchase of a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications, a subsidiary of Cable &amp; Wireless, is used to demonstrate the need for larger international players to buy in Europe to build market share. The discussions between KLM, SAS, Austrian Airlines and Swissair are an example of much-needed industry consolidation, which has nothing to do with the single market, says Mr Rod Peacock, joint head of European M&amp;A at J P Morgan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEAGUE TABLE OF ADVISERS ON EUROPEAN CROSS-BORDER ACQUISITIONS COMPLETED BETWEEN JANUARY 1 1993 AND JUNE 30 1993, RANKED BY VALUE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 No. of deals     value in Pounds m  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  1.

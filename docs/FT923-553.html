			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Crisis revives Brazil's royalty: Support grows for return of the monarchy ONE HUNDRED and three years after the abolition of Brazil's monarchy, a growing band of citizens wants to see a return to the days of empire. Brazilians vote in a referendum next April on, among other things, whether to restore the monarchy. Helped by the public outrage over the corruption scandal surrounding President Fernando Collor and the country's stubborn 25 per cent a month inflation rate, a restoration campaign is gathering support. Political analysts think Brazilians are likely to vote for change, but in favour of a parliamentary system, with the president becoming a figurehead. However, many have been surprised by the growing support for the monarchy. In the most recent opinion poll, 23 per cent supported the restoration, compared to just 3 per cent a year ago. A member of the royal family lecturing the Rio Chamber of Commerce on the economic advantages of a monarchy received rapturous applause this month from Rio de Janeiro businessmen as he blamed the presidential system for inflation and corruption. Dom Bertrand Orleans e Braganca, a more charismatic speaker than most Brazilian politicians, spoke of the prosperity and international respect that marked the 48-year-reign of Dom Pedro II, the second and last emperor of Brazil - a title established in 1822 by his father, the son of the King of Portugal, who declared Brazil independent. Dom Bertrand was speaking for his older brother, Dom Luis, pretender to the Brazilian throne were it to be restored. There is, however, a flaw in the monarchists' campaign. The House of Braganca is divided: two of the emperor's descendants claim the throne. Dom Luis's rival is his uncle, 88-year-old Dom Pedro Gastao Orleans e Braganca, patriarch of the House of Braganca and brother-in-law to King Juan Carlos of Spain. Although Dom Pedro is directly in line as Dom Pedro II's great-grandson, Dom Luis argues that Dom Pedro's grandfather gave up his right to accession to the grandfather of Dom Luis in order to marry an eastern European countess who was not of royal blood. Characterised by his floppy grey Spanish hat, Dom Pedro divides his time between Seville and Petropolis, a mountain city above Rio which was the imperial summer capital. He has four sons and 14 grandsons, and his supporters say that Dom Luis, who is 52 and a bachelor, is not fit to be emperor because he has not produced an heir and has political connections. Dom Luis is a member of an ultra-conservative Catholic organisation, Family, Tradition and Prosperity, which he says is apolitical. Family feuding has not hindered the move for a return to the empire. Pro-monarchy propaganda has only been allowed since a constitutional revision in 1989, and proponents include congressmen, prominent businessmen, academics and even military officers. They can be spotted by tell-tale crown-shaped lapel pins or emblems on their ties. Much of the campaign's success is due to the achievements of Dom Pedro II. After taking power in 1840 at the age of 14, he oversaw a rapid expansion in the Brazilian economy, reducing dependence on sugar cane and diversifying into rubber, coffee, tobacco and cacao. A promoter of science and education, he was such an accomplished negotiator that US President Abraham Lincoln apparently said he was the only man he would trust to mediate between North and South in the American civil war. By contrast, presidentialism has a poor record in Brazil. A leaflet produced by the Parliamentary Movement for Monarchy (MPM) describes the republic as 'synonymous with lack of credibility of institutions' and catalogues its progress as 'seven different constitutions, 12 states of siege, 19 military rebellions, four deposed presidents and two long periods of dictatorship'. It points out that, in the last 67 years, only one civilian president finished his mandate. Mr Collor seems unlikely to improve the balance.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Board seeks resignation of Avonside chief THE BOARD OF Avonside, the housebuilder floated by Cannon Street Investments in March, has asked its managing director, Mr Gordon Carruth, to stand down amid signs that the group is seeking a change in management strategy. The group said yesterday that the decision to seek a new managing director was not linked to any misdemeanour, or the current performance  - it announced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.82m on a turnover of Pounds 25.9m in the first half of 1992. Mr Christopher Glynn, non-executive chairman of the Wrexham-based group, announced he would take over the role of managing director. 'The board have a very clear idea of what we want to do and where we are going. Gordon did a very good job but we didn't believe he was the man to lead us,' Mr Glynn said. City institutions were surprised by the decision just six months after Mr Carruth handled the flotation, which valued the group at Pounds 45.5m or 106p per share. They lost 10p on yesterday's news to close at 74p.</p>

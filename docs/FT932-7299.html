			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Union threatens Post Office sale THE UNION of Communication Workers, the postal workers union, yesterday voted at its annual conference to consider industrial action if the government moves to privatise the Post Office. The 700 delegates at the conference voted unanimously to take action if necessary. Mr Alan Johnson, general-secretary designate, said industrial action might be needed 'to protect pensions, jobs and services'. The government has yet to announce whether it will sell the Post Office as one unit, or split it into its constituent parts - Royal Mail, Post Office Counters and Parcelforce. Whichever option is chosen, the government has decided to delay privatisation until the 1994-95 parliamentary session at the earliest. Last week Mr John Major, the prime minister, ruled out making compulsory the payment of state benefits direct into bank accounts, in an effort to reassure Tory backbenchers over the future of rural post offices. The union, with 160,000 members in the Post Office, is mounting an anti-privatisation campaign. It yesterday said a survey of Conservative MPs showed more than 50 were opposed to Post Office privatisation. The union said the survey 'clearly reflects the concern that many Conservatives have over the threat to services, particularly in rural areas, if the Post Office was run purely for profit'. The union said most of the MPs who opposed privatisation also said there should be a relaxation of Treasury restrictions to enable the Post Office to operate more commercially within the public sector. The union wants to see post offices allowed to offer more services over the counter, such as selling theatre, travel and national lottery tickets.</p>

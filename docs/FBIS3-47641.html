The 26 Chinese were the first group to be sentenced among 78  people from China's coastal province of Fujian who were charged  with illegally entering Japan.    Presiding Judge Yoshimichi Takigawa handed down suspended  sentences, saying there was room for sympathy although they  entered Japan for the purpose of working illegally in the  country. Prosecutors had demanded prison terms of eight months.    The 78 Chinese were among a group of 104 who arrived in  Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture, on November 22 aboard a  Taiwanese-registered fishing vessel.    Prosecutors did not charge the seven crew members and 19  other Chinese were not indicted because they are minors.    The group left China on November 8 after paying about 30,000  renminbi (about 400,000 yen) to Chinese brokers.</p>

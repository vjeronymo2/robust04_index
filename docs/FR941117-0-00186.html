			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters across a broad range of market participants supported the goal of improved secondary market disclosure for the municipal securities market, but emphasized that flexibility is necessary, given the diversity that exists in the municipal securities market. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As adopted, the amendments to Rule 15c2&hyph;12 will further that goal by prohibiting underwritings unless there are commitments to provide ongoing disclosure, while, at the same time, providing issuers with significant flexibility to determine the appropriate nature of that disclosure. The amendments retain the requirement that a Participating Underwriter ascertain that an issuer or obligated person has undertaken to provide secondary market disclosure, including notices of material events, to information repositories, but rely on the parties to the transaction to establish who will provide secondary market disclosure, and what information is material to an understanding of the security being offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Joint Response; Letter of Chapman and Cutler; Letter of Florida Division of Bond Finance of the State Board of Administration; Letter of J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc.; Letter of National Association of Bond Lawyers (``NABL''); Letter of Orrick, Herrington &amp; Sutcliffe (``Orrick Herrington''); Letter of Public Securities Association (``PSA'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments build upon and reinforce current market practices that have provided, as a general matter, good quality disclosure in official statements, and extend those practices to the secondary market. As is currently the practice, under the amendments, the participants in an underwriting would continue to determine which persons are material to an understanding of the Offering. Information concerning those persons would be included in the final official statement. Financial information and operating data that is material to an offering at the outset generally remains material throughout the life of the securities. Under the amendments, that information would be provided on an annual basis. Put simply, the amendments reflect the belief that purchasers in the secondary market need the same level of financial information and operating data in making investment decisions as purchasers in the underwritten offering.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposed Amendments would have prohibited a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer from recommending the purchase or sale of a municipal security, unless it had reviewed the annual and event information provided pursuant to the undertaking. Commenters anticipated that such a prohibition would have a considerable negative impact on secondary market liquidity. Furthermore, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers considered the proposed recommendation prohibition to be problematic from a compliance perspective. The Commission has modified this provision to require instead that brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers recommending municipal securities in the secondary market have procedures to obtain material event notices. Because under existing law brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers are required to use information disseminated into the marketplace in forming a reasonable basis for recommending securities to investors, the rule does not impose mechanical review requirements on a trade-by-trade basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments contain an exemption to minimize the effect on small issuers. Offerings in which neither the issuer nor any obligor is obligated with respect to more than $10 million dollars in municipal securities outstanding following an offering will be exempt from the amendments, on the condition that there is a limited undertaking to provide upon request, or annually to a state information depository, at least the financial information or operating data they customarily prepare, and that is publicly available. In addition, the undertaking must meet the amendment's requirement regarding notices of material events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

A Participating Underwriter would, therefore, need to receive assurances from the issuer or obligated persons that such undertakings would be made before agreeing to act as an underwriter. A dealer could look to provisions in the underwriting agreement or bond purchase agreement that describe the undertakings for the benefit of bondholders made elsewhere, such as in a trust indenture, bond resolution, or separate written agreement. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In a competitively bid offering, such assurances also might be found in a notice of sale. Of course, representations concerning commitments to provide secondary market disclosure, like any other key representations by an issuer, are subject to specific verification, such that a Participating Underwriter has a reasonable basis to believe that such representations are true and accurate. Thus, investigation of an issuer's or obligated person's undertakings to provide secondary market disclosure would be an element of the Participating Underwriter's professional review of offering documents. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letter of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith (``Merrill Lynch'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As noted in the 1988 Release, the obligations of managing underwriters and underwriters participating in an offering differ. An underwriter participating in an offering need not duplicate the efforts of the managing underwriter, but must satisfy itself that the managing underwriter reviewed the accuracy of the information in the official statement in a professional manner and therefore had a reasonable basis for its recommendation. Underwriters participating in offerings, however, have a duty to notify the managing underwriter of any factors that suggest inaccuracies in disclosure, or signal the need for additional investigation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  1988 Release at n. 87. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the amendments prohibit Participating Underwriters from purchasing or selling securities in the absence of undertakings in a written agreement or contract, such agreement or contract would have to be in place at the time the issuer delivers the securities to the Participating Underwriter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed below, in conditioning the closing of an Offering on the existence of an agreement or contract, this provision of the amendments permits flexibility as to where undertakings for continuing disclosure are memorialized. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Letter of Kutak Rock; Letter of Section of Urban, State and Local Government Law, American Bar Association (``ABA Urban Law Section''); Letter of Colorado Municipal Bond Supervisory Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast to the requirement in Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(5) that Participating Underwriters reasonably determine that issuers or obligated persons have undertaken to provide secondary market disclosure prior to the time they ``purchase or sell'' municipal securities, Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(1) requires Participating Underwriters to obtain and review an official statement deemed final by the issuer (``DFOS'') prior to the time they ``bid for, purchase, offer, or sell'' securities. Thus, under Rule 15c2&hyph;12(b)(1), in a competitive underwriting, a Participating Underwriter must obtain and review the DFOS prior to placing a bid on an issue of municipal securities. Because the term ``offer'' encompasses the distribution of a preliminary official statement, as well as oral solicitations of indications of interest, in a negotiated underwriting, a Participating Underwriter is required to obtain and review the DFOS prior to the time it distributes the preliminary official statement to potential investors. If no offers are made, the Participating Underwriter is required to obtain and review the DFOS by the earlier of the time it agrees (whether in principle or by signing the bond purchase agreement) to purchase the bonds, or the first sale of bonds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon (April 4, 1990); Interpretive Release at Section III.C.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amendments to the definition of final official statement will affect the obligations of Participating Underwriters under Rule 15c2&hyph;12.

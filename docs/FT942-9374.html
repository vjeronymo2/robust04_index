			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Equity Markets: Bond market stability the key to growth - London Stock-market analysts are sounding increasingly frustrated as they watch the FT-SE 100 Share Index sitting on the 3,100 fence, unable to disentangle itself from the bond markets but unwilling to give any further ground. Most still take a bullish view on the market, but few can make a case for any dramatic move in the near term. S. G. Warburg bases its case on a shift of interest towards earnings estimates for 1996, admitting that 'a dull summer' may, meanwhile, be in prospect. There is considerable institutional support whenever the Footsie Index dips into the 3,100 area, mostly showing itself in the stock index futures market. But the stock market remains unable to decouple from the bond markets. Kleinwort Benson points out that, with equities yielding a prospective 4.2 per cent, cash ought to be burning in fund managers' pockets. 'Bond market stability would release it into the equity market,' it adds. This week may bring some movement on this front. It was clear on Thursday, when London had the European field to itself, that UK bonds are still moving in step with US Treasuries and waiting for the Federal Reserve to tighten policy again. However, some analysts argue that more determined action from the Fed would stabilise bond markets, and give UK equities the environment they need to respond more strongly to the improvement in economic and corporate news. Unfortunately, developments on Friday afternoon suggested that the UK markets now reckon the Fed may not act as strongly as they once feared. Setting aside the overall economic background, there are signs that attitudes towards some sectors are changing. BZW believes pricing sensitivity may be beginning to present a challenge to the bull run in manufacturing stocks. Its answer to this is to recommend focusing on manufacturers displaying superior pricing power and with exposure to Europe, a favourite BZW theme. The UK engineering and vehicles sector offers the highest (40 per cent) exposure to Europe on the manufacturing sector, according to BZW. Close behind is the printing and packaging sector, with 36 per cent exposure, and building materials and merchants, with 31 per cent. The same argument is applied by BZW to close its bearish stance on the domestic consumer service sectors. Pressures on pricing and profit margins have depressed these sectors, particularly food. But Sainsbury sounded more positive on gross margins last week, and BZW links its own more favourable views on sector margins to its faith in European exposure. On the consumer and services side, European exposure is less marked. Brewing has only a 4 per cent exposure, although the addition of spirits, wine and cider interests takes that figure to around 23 per cent. Pharmaceuticals have 27 per cent exposure but these stocks have yet to recapture investor confidence.</p>

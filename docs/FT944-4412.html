			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hicking Pentecost buys Dewey Waters Hicking Pentecost, the textile and industrial products group, is to acquire Dewey Waters, the Bristol water storage systems business, for Pounds 2.7m cash. The deal follows April's receivership of DW's parent, Bimec Industries, which bought the operation for around Pounds 11m in August 1991. Hicking Pentecost bought Barbour Campbell, the industrial thread manufacturer and a former Hanson offshoot, for Pounds 5.33m in May. The Cardiff-based business helped its parent increase half-year operating profit, before exceptional costs, to Pounds 2.48m (Pounds 2.04m). An exceptional item of Pounds 357,000 to reduce costs has been charged against profits. Pre-tax profits, after exceptionals, in the half year to September 30 were Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 1.98m). The company also announced its intention to keep hunting for manufacturing-related businesses, particularly those where operating efficiency can be improved, to add to its portfolio. It also pledged continuing organic growth. 'In the last six months we have continued to improve profits at our existing businesses and made excellent progress with our most recent acquisition, Barbour Campbell ..This acquisition has doubled our size and spread the group's activities across new markets,' said Mr Tudor Davies, chief executive. Earnings per share after exceptional items were 8.4p (8.8p). The interim dividend rises to 1.8p (1.55p).</p>

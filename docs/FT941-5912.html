A French embassy official in Yaounde said the surveillance frigate La Vendemiaire and its 90-member crew arrived in the port of Douala on Wednesday night on a 'routine visit'. Nigeria's military government had already protested on Wednesday after France sent a squad of paratroopers and two attack helicopters to Cameroon.</p>

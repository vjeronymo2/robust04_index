			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by the press center of the Belarusian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] In spite of the fact that the Defense Ministry has  repeatedly explained its position on the likely scenario of  events that might take place on 15 February, political brouhaha  and various kinds of speculation on this are continuing.  Indeed, there is not a single stupid thing left which  politically-minded journalists have not thought up by now.    The most vivid example of this is a commentary, featured in  the "Krok" [Step] television program on 12 February 1994, on a  visit by Defense Minister Colonel General Kozlovskiy with a  military unit stationed in Maryina Gorka. The meeting of the  minister with the personnel was blatantly and deliberately  distorted and pitched to the audience as some kind of  "instruction" to the unit on "how to combat strikers."    Meanwhile, the position of the Armed Forces at this  difficult  time remains constructive and clear: Stability and public  accord are the precondition for successful reforms in our  Republic and the bedrock for its well-being and prosperity. A  systematic training process is under way in the Armed Forces  now. Training events are to be conducted in subunits, units,  and staffs in the immediate future, and thereafter. The Defense  Ministry has no intention whatsoever of altering its combat  training schedule to suit the current political situation. Let  the politicians and journalists with too lively an imagination  have their speculations on their own consciences. No one will  manage to "bring the Army out of its barracks," out of the legal  space prescribed to it by law which it occupies today. The  Armed Forces have always been, and they will always be, the  guarantor of public stability and security.    The dangerous virus of civil strifes and political feuds has  not yet spread onto Belarusian territory. It is a strong  conviction of the Defense Ministry that no one today, too, will  manage to embroil the Belarusian people and their Armed Forces  in political adventures!"</p>

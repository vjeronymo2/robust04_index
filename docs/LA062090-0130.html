Directors own 54% of the company's 2.6 million shares,  with the biggest chunk, about 765,000 shares or 26.7%, owned by Viejo Bancorp  Chairman William T. Brady.  </P> <P> The company is riding a wave of high profitability as its banking subsidiary  was among the top 100 community banks nationwide in a key measure of financial  performance -- return on assets. It posted $2.4 million in net income last  year, earning a 2.2% return on assets. Most major banks do not garner more than  a 1% return.  </P></p>

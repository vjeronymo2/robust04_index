			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gungor Mengi: "Bad Habit"--all figures as </F> published]    [Text] Minister of Finance Atilla made a favorable  disclosure on the budget yesterday. He confirmed claims that  the budget deficit has been removed and budget spending is under  control. That has inspired hope for the future. However, the  hope must be supported by confidence, without which investments  and production cannot be increased.    According to Atilla's disclosure, the budget deficit, which  totaled 51.3 trillion Turkish lira [TL] from January to March  1994, decreased by TL4.3 trillion in April. The situation  further improved in May. The budget had a surplus of TL6.3  trillion. Meanwhile, compared with May 1993, tax revenues  covered an additional 6 percent of the budget spending in May  1994.    However, the footnote in the Finance Ministry's disclosure  has caused dissatisfaction. It said that the amount paid for  the interest on Turkey's foreign debts in May, which totaled  TL6.5 trillion, was not included in the budget spending for that  month. That amount should have been included in the  calculations because Turkey paid the interest on its debts in  cash. Why should the Finance Ministry resort to trickery?  Obviously, its objective was to exaggerate its success in  reducing the budget deficit. It would still have been  successful even if the amount paid for Turkey's foreign debts  was included on the balance sheet for May. A deficit of only  TL200 billion would have been seen on the balance sheet.  Obviously, the trickery was aimed at creating an opportunity  for the government to convince the people that its budget  incurred a surplus for the first time. That was not necessary.    Those who are aware of the situation will not be misled. If  the government wished to deceive the people, then that is  another matter. However, risking the loss of the people's trust  for the sake of undeserved appreciation is a stupid approach.</p>

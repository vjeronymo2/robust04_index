			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Lamont wilts under Community fire MR NORMAN LAMONT received a civic lesson in the new politics of the European Community yesterday. The British chancellor has become a hero among Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party after his pledge to follow a 'British economic policy and a British monetary policy'; but at the end of a bruising meeting of fellow EC finance ministers last night, he found out that this may not mean much if Britain intends to remain a member of the Community. In the face of a barrage of criticism, Mr Lamont retreated from earlier British calls for an overhaul of the Exchange Rate Mechanism following sterling's withdrawal. Now, it seems, he would be satisfied with a 'medium-term' debate on the ERM's weaknesses which would deal with 'technical' matters. This is well short of the fundamental reform which he and Mr John Major, his prime minister, set down as preconditions for sterling's re-entry into the ERM. Mr Lamont, who never disguised his discomfort with the restrictions which ERM membership imposed on British exchange rate policy, also signed up to a joint communique describing the European Monetary System as a 'key factor of economic stability and prosperity in Europe'. And, for good measure, he offered a qualified apology for some of the German-baiting followed in the British government and press. Clearly, a funny thing happened on the way to Brussels. The best explanation is that Mr Lamont discovered that the price of total isolation inside the EC on a matter of substance is something which no member is prepared to pay. Mrs Thatcher discovered this too when, in 1989, she reluctantly agreed to the conditions for ERM entry. For Mr Lamont, it was clear yesterday that Britain's criticisms of the ERM stuck in the collective craw of the Europeans. First, because of its high-handed decision to enter at an unrealistically high rate to the D-Mark in 1990; second, because its withdrawal was coupled with calls for a suspension of the ERM earlier this month. In response, all EC ministers mounted an emotional defence of the system as a bulwark of monetary stability, and promised to push ahead with ratifying the Maastricht treaty. All delegations committed themselves (on paper at least) to the path of fiscal and inflationary rectitude set out in the treaty as a pre-condition for entry into a monetary union. This solidarity produced some extraordinary scenes. Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary of the German finance ministry, offered fulsome praise for Irish efforts to prop up the punt with higher interest rates - prompting Irish press releases proclaiming Dublin's determination to join the putative fast-track ot monetary union. Other delegations rubbished real or imagined British plans for using Birmingham as a means of delaying ratification of Maastricht - an indication of how the ERM mess poisons relations on the major issue facing the Twelve. And here is the nub of the matter. Britain has never been entirely trusted by her EC partners. Its on-off relationship in the post-war era makes this inevitable. But whatever their suspicions, most believed that Britain talked sense. After the U-turn on the ERM and the outburst of Bundesbank bashing in Britain, some EC countries are no longer sure.</p>

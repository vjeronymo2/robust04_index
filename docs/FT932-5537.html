			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Arts: Good sense fights back - Cinema A MAP OF THE HUMAN HEART (15) Vincent Ward FALLING DOWN (18) Joel Schumacher FRAUDS (15) Stephan Elliot JAMON JAMON (18) Bigas Luna WIDE SARGASSO SEA (18) John Duigan What is humanity's position in Time and Space as we near the close of the 20th century? This is a large, possibly lunatic question; but it is not too large nor too lunatic for the cinema. Movies have always claimed the right to speak of all things for all people: whether through the globe- and decade-hopping sweep of a film like New Zealand's A Map Of The Human Heart or the flashpoint-apocalypse style of Hollywood, exemplified by Falling Down. In both films we are supposed to think: 'Ah, this is the way the world crumbles]' Cinema uses its native realism - living actors in living scenery  -to foist on us its eschatological mysticism. Push your characters through enough visceral, headline-plucked crises and the filmgoer cannot fail (hope the film-makers) to see the realism of the parts adding up to the judgment-day truth of the whole. But common sense always fights back. During 100 years of film history, audiences have invented their own defence against aesthetic hoodwinking. It is the notion of 'camp': the awareness that large gestures, far from indicating large thoughts, often betray pintsize ideas or emotions. 'Camp' is present in both these new films from opposite ends of the planet. A Map Of The Human Heart makes metaphors as vast, flamboyant and perishable as ice palaces. The main leitmotif is cartography. Eskimo hero Avik (Jason Scott Lee) begins as a map-maker, helping a British airman (Patrick Bergin) chart the Arctic wilderness in 1931; then becomes a lovelorn TB sufferer in Montreal, clutching the X-rays of his beloved like another, interior 'map'; then is enlisted by Bergin in a top secret mission to salvage maps from a wrecked German U-boat; then re-meets his adored Albertine (Anne Parillaud), who is working on aerial reconnaissance photos (more 'maps'); finally joins the dread flying mission over that network of doomed human souls called Dresden. We say 'finally'. But that merely concludes Avik's adventures in perfidious Albion and war-ravaged Europe. At the end - and throughout a film that bounces over the world's surface like a Mexican jumping bean with a flag in the top - Avik returns to the unmappable Arctic. Here a cold infinity at last laps him up, drowning the last illusory contours of human certainty. Director Vincent Ward specialises in throwing audiences into landscapes of pea-souper perplexity - see Vigil and The Navigator - and then saying 'Find your way out'. If he makes a film about maps, we know it is to mock them. If he makes a film about a hemisphere-hopping hero, it is to mock heroism and hemispheres and hopping. A Map Of The Human Heart can look and sound dazzling: from the early scene of the Eskimo boy trampolining into the sky as if to pluck down the plane that will change his life to the last aerial shot of waters swelling around his sinking ice-floe. But whenever narrative sense tries to creep in, realism and operatic resonance make daft bedfellows. Avik and Albertine entwined in passion atop a barrage balloon; Bergin spitting out literary arias of venom as sexual jealousy turns him from friend to fiend; and in the hospital scenes Jeanne Moreau as a vengeful, mad-eyed Catholic nun escaped from a Bunuel film. 'Camp' - that mismatch between the force of the underlying ideas and the billowing flamboyance of the surface - grows ever larger as the film grows longer. * * * Meanwhile, in another part of Hyperbole-land, Falling Down shows the state of urban crisis Los Angeles has now reached, and the state of storytelling crisis Hollywood has reached. The film begins grim - hedgehog-haired yuppie Michael Douglas stuck in a sweating, fume-polluted traffic jam and getting out to walk across town - and gets grimmer. Mr Douglas is a member of that endangered American species: the disaffected ordinary rightwing kinda-guy. You could call him 'dork' for short, though the movie prefers to call him D-Fens after his car number-plate. D-Fens used to work for a private defence firm but was laid off. Now, with a baseball bat, a bagful of guns and a panjandrum of grievances, he walks in the general direction of his estranged wife (Barbara Hershey), pursued by retiring cop Robert Duvall, whose last day on the force becomes a lulu. Can Duvall stop our hero punching, menacing or shooting almost everyone he meets? For D-Fens is upset by the incursions made on his life, liberty and pursuit of happiness by traffic jams, street delinquents, Korean corner-shops, feminists, and burger joints that stop serving breakfast at 11.30am. He also has sharp words for golfers and neo-Nazi homophobic shop-owners (Frederic Forrest). And he may bash up his wife and child - or so Hershey fears - once he reaches their pretty suburban nook in Venice, Calif. Based on the structure of Homer's Odyssey, but without Homer's flair for getting on with it, Falling Down is two hours of shamelesly repetitive hokum. Screenwriter Ebbe Roe Smith and director Joel (Flatliners) Schumacher clearly feel that if you are making a malcontent-on-the-run movie, you must include everything anyone could be malcontented about. The anger must be cross-party. If you offend Asians with a scene in which D-Fens breaks up a shop and derides the owner's accent ('There's a V in 'five']'), you must then hasten your protagonist to a golf course, where he can induce an 11th-hole cardiac by railing about misused parkland. 'Children should be playing here]' 'There should be zoos]' etc. Has ever such a bigot for all seasons ever existed? We doubt it. If flat-earthers and vegans are missing from the hit list, it can only be because something had to hit the cutting-room floor. Douglas plays the role with a clench-jawed, weapon-waving automatism and the only actor resisting the melodramatic flood is Duvall, whose low-key cracker-barrel homeyness is a relief in (too) short stretches. * * * Hollywood hyperbole ends unwittingly in Camp. Other movies, like Australia's Frauds and Spain's Jamon Jamon, go to that region deliberately. Gestural excess is their aim and design. In Stephan Elliott's Frauds semi-mad insurance investigator Phil Collins plays tricks on a young suburban couple (Hugo Weaving, Josephine Byrnes). Having caught them out in a fraudulent claim - they 'staged' a burglary of their own home - he teases them into a nervous breakdown. Stolen goods reappear; life-or-death games are played with dice; and fiendish Phil finally traps them inside the giant Avengers-style playroom, bristling with booby-traps, that passes for his home. You half expect Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg to come chortling out of the woodwork. Instead all the camping up is done by Collins: a humpty-dumpty joker with two pinprick eyes, several Swinging Sydney suits and a switch-on V-shaped smile to match his receding widow's peak hair. He could almost be one of his own toys. So could the film, though at 94 minutes it outstays its initially amusing appeal. Jamon Jamon - Spanish for 'Ham Ham' - is a large joint of exactly that. Half-a-dozen heated performers overheatedly perform in this comic passion play by director Bigas Luna. Since the death of Franco, Spain has discovered all sorts of previously hidden pleasures. Sex, underwear fetishism, nude bullfighting, urination contests: all here in the tale of young Jose Luis, his love for Silvia and his rivalry with hunky Raul. Luna's camera careers round the torrid landscapes and the torrid figures inside them, creating excess where he cannot find it. Seldom has a film that spends so much time below the belt seemed so over the top. As for Wide Sargasso Sea, pity poor Jean Rhys. Directed by John Duigan (Flirting), the novelist's haunting Caribbean-set prequel to Jane Eyre - the story of the doomed first Mrs Rochester - begins as Reader's Digest and turns slowly into Playboy. Soft-porn rompings ad nauseam in rockpools and bedrooms. The film would be camp if it had the energy to deserve the word. Instead it is more like a long night under soggy canvas.</p>

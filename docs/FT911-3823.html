			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / International Company News: Japanese group files for protection SHIZUSHIN Lease, a Japanese financial company with debts of Y255.5bn (Dollars 186m), filed for court protection from its creditors yesterday in a further sign of the pressures imposed by high interest rates and weak property markets. Shizushin, a medium-sized leasing company, will go bankrupt if its creditors fail to agree on a reorganisation plan. If it goes under, it will be the fourth-largest corporate failure in Japan and the second-biggest this year after Nanatomi, a property developer, which went bankrupt owing Y300bn. Shizushin would be the first financial company to fail during the squeeze on credit in Japan. It was founded in 1982 and began by financing the lease of office equipment. It subsequently expanded into property lending. Its borrowers include a company run by Mr Suemitsu Ito, a property developer connected with Itoman, the trading company which got into financial difficulties through investment in land. Mr Ito worked for Itoman for eight months until he resigned late last year. During that time, he was responsible for expanding its property investments. Shizushin, based in Shizuoka, a town west of Tokyo, was established with the help of the Shizuoka Shinkin Bank, a local institution. Shizuoka Shinkin has a 4.7 per cent stake in Shizushin, but it is not thought to be threatened by the leasing company's difficulties.</p>

We have learned that the Haitian Army will not participate in  this conference since the invitation was addressed to a senior  military officer, who is not recognized either by the  international community or by Father Aristide's own government.  This information was collected by the AFP from a well-informed  source.    Let us recall that this letter of invitation to this  conference was addressed to General Jean-Claude Duperval, the  Army second in command who President Aristide had appointed this  past December as Army commander in chief, while dismissing  General Cedras, the current commander in chief.    Prime Minister Robert Malval and the members of his  government had refused to hand over the letters of appointment  and of dismissal to their addressees, asking President Aristide  to reconsider his decision, which he did not do until now.    The international community, on its part, is still asking  for  the application of the general framework of the Governors Island  accord, signed in July 1993 by President Aristide and General  Cedras, who it still recognizes as chief of the Haitian Army and  a signatory, under that title, of this accord.    It also should be recalled that the Miami conference, which  at first was to deal with the problem of the Haitian refugees,  has been extended to discuss the general topic of the return to  democracy, following pressure from the United States, according  to diplomatic sources. These same sources specify that  Washington considered as an insult the inclusion of the question  of the boat people.    It is unknown if the other sectors in Haiti invited to the  conference will attend.</p>

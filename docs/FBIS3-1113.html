Speaking to about 200 people at an ANC meeting in  the coloured area of Pefferville, he said the latest Goldstone  report had made disclosures about the role of various police  officers in killing people.    He was sure that those involved in bringing weapons into the  country and deliberately sending out groups to attack people on  trains and at bus stops were bad people. "But I think the reason  they were able to act like that is because they were products,  they were representatives of a bad system.    "It is the system that we must change. The culprits no doubt  must be punished, but the system has to change."    The ANC wanted a new government not because it wanted new  faces, but because it wanted a new relationship between  government and the people. It was important that this new  government be responsive to what people were saying "and that's  not what we've experienced in the last 40 years".</p>

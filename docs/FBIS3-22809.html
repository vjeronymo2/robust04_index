			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington-based correspondent Sin Chang-uk] </F>   [Text] It has been learned that during inspection of  Yongbyon, which began 3 March, the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA] inspection team discovered that some seals, which  were installed by IAEA to confirm nuclear safeguards of nuclear  facilities in North Korea, were destroyed. As a result, it is  highly likely that considerable controversies will be touched  off concerning the guarantee of transparency of North Korean  nuclear development.    In the course of inspecting seven nuclear facilities in  North  Korea on six occasions in 1993, the IAEA inspected six  monitoring cameras, 40 seals, and three radioactivity sensor  facilities. In the event that damage of these facilities is  confirmed, suspicion that nuclear material was transferred from  North Korean nuclear facilities to some other place will be  raised. Thus, there is a possibility that the continuity of  safeguards of North Korean nuclear facilities may not be  recognized.    A source in Washington said that with discovery of such seal  damage, the conclusion of the results of IAEA's inspection of  North Korean nuclear facilities will be the focus of people's  attention. The likelihood that the third round of North  Korean-U.S. high-level talks slated for 21 March in Geneva will  be held as scheduled is doubtful.    It was reported that in the course of IAEA's inspection of  North Korean nuclear facilities, disputes arose between IAEA and  North Korea over the issue of continuing the inspection and the  damage to the seals.    The team has to leave Pyongyang on 14 March as the IAEA  inspection team was granted two-week entry visas upon its  arrival in Pyongyang on 1 March.    This being the situation, this week will likely be the  climax  of IAEA's inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities, and the  possibility of resolving the issue of the exchange of special  envoys between the North and the South before 21 March is very  slim because North Korea has continually showed an attitude of  rejection.    Another source observed that North Korea will likely drag on  the controversy surrounding the inspection and the issue of  North-South special envoy exchange even after 21 March when the  third round of high-level talks are scheduled to be held. Thus,  the possibility of high-level talks being held on the scheduled  date is slim.    Meanwhile, Christine Shelley, a U.S. State Department  spokesperson, on 9 March said that the U.S. Government regrets  the fact that the IAEA nuclear inspection of North Korea is not  proceeding smoothly and expressed the hope that North Korea will  keep its promise to sincerely allow IAEA inspections until the  inspections are concluded. Commenting on friction between North  Korea and IAEA over nuclear inspections, Shelley said that she  hopes the IAEA can settle the inspection issue and that the  inspections will be concluded. Shelley stressed that regardless  of progress in North-South working contact, the exchange of  North-South special envoys, with satisfactory nuclear inspection  results, are a precondition for holding the third round of  high-level talks agreed to by North Korea.</p>

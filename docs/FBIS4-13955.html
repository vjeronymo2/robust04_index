			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 23 Apr (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur,  member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party and  secretary general of the National Progressive and Patriotic  Front, today received a delegation from the Jordanian Islamic  Action Front [IAF] under [Jordanian House of Representatives  member] 'Abdallah al-'Akayilah.    Members of the Jordanian delegation expressed high  appreciation of Iraq's heroic, honorable stand under the brave  leadership of President Saddam Husayn. They stressed that the  aggression against Iraq is an aggression against the Arab  nation, because Iraq is the symbol of the Arab nation's  awakening and the leader of its struggle for the sake of  liberation and independence. They stressed the inevitable  victory of the banner of faith carried by President Saddam  Husayn.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Mun'im Ahmad Salih, minister of awqaf and  religious affairs, also received the IAF delegation under  'Abdallah al-'Akayilah.    During the meeting, the minister reviewed the dimensions of  the unjust blockade imposed on the children, women, and elderly  of Iraq. He said those who are besieging the Iraqi people are  exercising double standards and do not hesitate to select  oppressive resolutions to kill the lively spirit of the free,  proud Iraqi people.    'Abdallah al-'Akayilah praised the militant, nationalist,  and  faithful campaign led by mujahid President Saddam Husayn. He  said this campaign stresses the soundness of the Iraqi course,  because it provides youth with immunity and explains to them the  evil aggressive objectives targeting Arabism and Islam.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'DICK TRACY'- BEATTY'S ARRESTING SUMMER ADVENTURE  </P> <P> You gotta give it to the gumshoe: "Dick Tracy" is brash, irresistible fun.  Warren Beatty's vision of a comic strip on film comes in paint box-bright  colors with nicely irreverent dialogue, a gaggle of crisp performances and one  with million-dollar moxie.  </P> <P> It's a film of enormous style, with a sure sense of itself. You may not exactly  brood about the inner lives of these characters for days after you leave the  theater -- then again, for better or worse, that may be one of the definitions  of a summer movie. To take the words out of the mouth of another Tracy, "There  ain't much meat, but what there is is cherce."  </P> <P> Two-thirds of "Tracy" (opening citywide Friday) takes place in a sort of  ultra-stylized Chicago after dark, but for all its nighttime gorgeousness, it's  still a brighter film than "Batman"; it's sunny in spirit, not feverish, and it  leaves less of a copper-penny taste of nastiness in the mouth. What violence it  has is of an old-fashioned, '30s movie cops-and-robbers variety, a man with a  Thompson submachine gun against a slew of bad 'uns. While "Dick Tracy" has its  own glorious villain, his tone is entirely different from the leering excesses  of the Joker; Al Pacino's Big Boy Caprice has to be one of the screen's most  extravagantly funny creations.  </P> <P> In a struggle for control of the city between Big Boy and the mysterious  faceless mobster, The Blank, "Dick Tracy's" character villains look eerily like  cartoonist Chester Gould's own: Flattop, Pruneface, Mumbles, The Brow, even the  amazing Little Face are perfect down to the last freckle and groove. In  contrast, the romantic characters and/or good guys, Beatty as ol' tomahawk nose  himself, Glenne Headly's Tess Trueheart, Madonna's Breathless Mahoney, young  Charlie Korsmo's Junior (known for most of the movie as The Kid), Seymour  Cassel's loyal Sam Catchem and James Keane's Pat Patton, are, more or less,  undisguised.  </P> <P> Yet by some magic, none of the villains are immobilized by their elaborate  makeup; it seems to have liberated them. It certainly electrified Al Pacino,  because clearly, "Dick Tracy" is Pacino's movie, not Beatty's and not  Madonna's, individually or together. Madonna's performance, which in retrospect  seems to be songs, salty patter and a collection of artfully struck poses,  won't disappoint her fans, but it may not win her new ones -- her acting hasn't  caught up with her charisma. Pacino, on the other hand, is likely to wow the  world by pure, inspired, comic invention.  </P> <P> (The screenplay, thick with quotable wit, is credited to Jim Cash and Jack  Epps, Jr., the team responsible for the utterly unmemorable dialogue of "Legal  Eagles" and "Top Gun." Attention is called to the "special consultant" credit  given writer Bo Goldman, of "Melvin and Howard," and "Shoot the Moon.")  </P> <P> Who could have suspected that a performance of this hilarity lurked behind Al  Pacino's forbidding intensity all these years? "Dog Day Afternoon" may have  given more than a hint of it; in "Sea of Love" as Pacino fell all over himself  to get out of the way of a possibly murderous Ellen Barkin, there was a  shutter-quick glimpse of the funniness in the man. Beatty's direction -- or  even the sense of working behind Big Boy's disguise -- may have been the  liberating force. Whatever it was, something popped the cork and out spilled  this goggle-eyed mobster with a pencil-thin mustache, plastered-down hair and a  silhouette roughly like Quasimodo's.  </P> <P> Watching Big Boy coach Breathless and her klutzy chorines in how to sell a  numbah, dancing it for them himself, touching, tweaking, all the while running  a nonstop line of Malaprop quotes, "If you ain't for the people, you can't buy  the people . . . Lincoln!" there is the sense of an actor having the time of  his life. (Some of the same fun emanates from Dustin Hoffman's glowing cameo as  Mumbles.)  </P> <P> For his part, Beatty's Dick Tracy strides through his naughty world like a  yellow beacon light. He is a pillar of command in his work and a Hamlet of  indecision in what passes for his personal life and Beatty plays him with  owlish rectitude. As he had in the comic strip, Tracy has major problems with  the "m" word: marriage. Absolutely sticks crosswise in the man's throat --  making him the perfect hero now as well as in the 1930s. The original Dick  Tracy's engagement to Tess Trueheart lasted from 1931 to 1949; this one seems  headed in the same direction, in spite of the twinkle to Glenne Headly's sturdy  Tess.  </P> <P> If Tracy can't quite say yes to Tess, he can at least say no to the  indefatigable come-on of Breathless Mahoney. "No grief for Lips?" he asks her  sardonically, referring to her recently departed lover/ boss. "I'm wearin'  black underwear," she points out. She certainly is, and in the face of such  provocation, Tracy's morality is to be admired, unless you've come  for543650405Facing Breathless, Tracy is stunned but inert. (For a PG-rated  film, the brief, silhouetted nudity, steamy dialogue and amount of routine  violence is a little stunning as well.)  </P> <P> For fireworks, try the look of the film, under Vittorio Storaro's exquisite  lighting camera work, which renders all the prosthetic makeups of John Caglione  Jr. and Doug Drexler completely real. Richard Sylbert's production designs seem  to have distilled the essence of the '30s, without a jot of sentimentality.  They're clean, essential, vivid, yet marvelously theatrical, probably the  richest since "Blade Runner." They're matched by the playful exaggeration of  Milena Canonero's costumes, which assign a single, all-over hue to each  character. To see that hoary scene -- a clutch of reporters interviewing their  subject on the steps of a courthouse -- when one reporter is dressed in  electric blue from his shoes to the press card in his hatband, another is in  all-orange and another is all in plum, lifts a cliche into something  wonderfully witty.  </P> <P> As they invariably do, Stephen Sondheim's songs may grow on you by frequent  repetition -- something they're sure to have. They get their best innings in  the lovely duet "What Can You Lose," begun by Mandy Patinkin's lovestruck piano  player, 88 Keys, and joined by Breathless. Danny Elfman's soaring score, even  though it strikes a few "Batman" memories here and there, seems to be the  musical equivalent of Sylbert's darkly various sets.  </P> <P> So before the tsunami of merchandising hits us, and we can't stand the sight of  one more yellow Fedora or another two-way wrist radio -- the way we were  Batmanned and E.T.'d to death in stores -- let's have one moment to recognize  the pure fun of "Dick Tracy," the first clear joy of summer.  </P> <P> "DICK TRACY "  </P> <P> A Buena Vista release of a Touchstone Pictures presentation presented in  association with Silver Screen Partners IV.

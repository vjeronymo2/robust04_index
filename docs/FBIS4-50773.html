			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 20 (AFP)--North Korea was obliged to  begin extracting fuel rods from its Yongbyon reactor for safety  reasons and because of Washington's refusal to resume talks on  the nuclear issue, the North Korean ambassador to China said  Friday.    The United States had failed to honour pledges to provide  North Korea with a light water reactor and to hold a third round  of talks with Pyongyang following their last meeting in Geneva  in July, Ambassador Chu Chang-chun said. As a result  "replacement of the fuel rods could not be delayed any longer  because of safety considerations," Chu told a press conference.    Chu stressed that Pyongyang had, on four occasions, informed  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in advance of its  intention to replace the rods. It was therefore unfair for the  agency to criticise North Korea for going ahead, he said.    The IAEA said Thursday that its inspectors currently in  North  Korea had confirmed that replacement had begun in "serious  violation" of IAEA inspection terms, and said it would report  the action to the UN Security Council.    The agency called on North Korea to stop immediately any  further withdrawal of the rods, saying that as of Thursday it  would still be possible to implement required safety measures so  as to verify whether any fuel has been diverted. However, Chu  indicated that such verification would be dependent on a  resumption of talks between Washington and Pyongyang.    "We will keep the fuel rods in a safe place and seal them  for  the inspectors so they can verify that nuclear materials have  not been diverted for non-peaceful purposes," he said.    "When the next round of talks between North Korea and the  United States is held and a technical solution is realised, then  the agency can take measurements at any time."    Washington suspects the reactor, 90 kilometers (54 miles)  north of Pyongyang, is a nuclear bomb factory, and wants the  IAEA to check whether North Korea has been diverting  weapons-grade plutonium to manufacture a device.    In a further indication that Pyongyang had no intention of  immediately halting the replacement procedure, Chu said the  process "is under way and will last about two months."</p>

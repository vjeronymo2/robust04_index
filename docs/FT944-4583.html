			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Spending cuts loom as rates rise: Capital plans face axe to meet Pounds 1bn shortfall - Chancellor acts to retain confidence of financial markets with half point increase Mr John Major's government moved swiftly yesterday to hold the confidence of financial markets in the wake of its latest political crisis by pushing up interest rates 0.5 points to 6.25 per cent. The rise came ahead of an announcement today by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, of a package of possible tax rises and spending cuts to fill the Pounds 1bn gap left by the enforced scrapping of the second stage of value-added tax on domestic fuel. Ministers expect most if not all of the shortfall to be made up in spending cuts, with capital programmes a likely target. In an apparent olive branch to his party's right wing after the recent Tory infighting over Europe, the prime minister hinted also at a possible referendum on European integration. Moves towards a single European currency would represent a 'very significant decision', he said. Speaking on Channel Four news, he insisted that a referendum could not be used as a tactical device, but added: 'I have not ruled out a referendum but it is a long way away.' Amid undisguised jubilation in the opposition parties at the government's humiliation on Tuesday night, Mr Tony Blair, the Labour leader, said the Commons defeat marked 'a decisive turn in the political tide'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the government's position was now irrecoverable. Mr Major shrugged off renewed suggestions that the government had lost its authority. He dismissed speculation that his leadership was under threat but implicitly acknowledged that the government might not be able to see out its full term. But as the government struggled to contain the political fall-out from its most significant Commons defeat during 15 years in office, there were new divisions in the Tory party and signs of recriminations in the cabinet. Mr Major faced strong pressure from the Tory right to readmit to the parliamentary party the nine Eurosceptic MPs who played a crucial part in forcing the government to abandon its proposed increase in VAT on fuel from 8 per cent to 17.5 per cent. The calls for him to retreat over Europe found an echo in comments by Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary. Mr Aitken said he hoped soon to see some 'bridge-building', a view shared by other right-wing members of the cabinet. But the idea that the suspended MPs should be readmitted quickly was flatly rejected by the prime minister in talks with Tory party managers. He refused to give any timetable for the rebels' possible re-entry to the parliamentary party. Downing Street also slapped down suggestions that Mr Richard Ryder's position as chief whip might be in doubt in the wake of the VAT-on-fuel defeat. There were signs, however, of separate disagreements in the cabinet over the events of the past two weeks. Rightwing MPs said they had been told that Mr Major had misjudged the mood of the party. In separate criticisms of Mr Clarke's handling of the VAT issue, there were strong reports, denied by Downing Street, that the prime minister had been among a handful of ministers who wanted the chancellor to drop the proposed VAT increase. Outwardly Mr Major himself appeared unruffled. Speaking at a breakfast for businessmen, he insisted that the government would stick firmly to an overall economic strategy of low inflation and strong growth. The base rate increase, which pleased the City but caused dismay among industry groups and retailers, was decided in the morning by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, at his monthly monetary meeting with Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, and announced immediately afterwards. The City reacted positively to the rate increase but it drew criticism from industry and commerce. The main mortgage lenders, conscious of the weak housing market, held back from immediate rate increases. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said investment would be dearer. Mr Hugh Clark, trading policy director of the British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the UK retail trade, said the rise was 'exceedingly ill-timed and unwelcome', coming in the middle of the crucial Christmas trading period. The rate increase underpinned sterling, lifting the pound by  3/4 pfennig to DM2.4576. It also boosted bonds, with 10-year gilts adding 1/4 point. However, equities reversed early gains in line with Wall Street, with the FTSE-100 index closing at 3,012.5, down 3.6.

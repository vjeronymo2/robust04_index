According to some leaders of the United Workers Front (FUT),  peaceful marches will be held in several cities early on Monday,  but it is feared that extremists will take advantage of the  situation to create disorders.    Since Friday, one day before President Sixto Duran-Ballen  decreed the increase to obtain funds to deal with a growing  fiscal deficit of a little over $200 million, protests were  already anticipated. Students, workers, housewives,  transporters, and citizens in general have expressed their  disagreement with the increases, but the government said it had  no other choice in the face of its economic situation after it  had to grant a salary increase to 120,000 public school teachers.    The fact that the increases were announced on Saturday night  postponed the street protests, which are being announced for  Monday by labor federations, one of whose leaders, Edgard Ponce,  announced that a nationwide strike for an indefinite period  might be staged.    The Catholic Church has also indicated that the increases  are  very high and the bishop of Cuenca, the country's third largest  city, said the poor are the ones punished the most because, he  explained, the wealthy have cars and other means of  transportation. He said the peasants will have to "pay the  consequences" and he added that even though they produce food,  they have to sell their products at low prices because they do  not have the means to transport them to the cities.    "It is terrible to have to increase fuel prices or to have  to  create new taxes. This has caused much anguish for the  president," his daughter Alicia said on Sunday. She added that  "as a good father, he did not want to do so, but the Ecuadoreans  have to understand that it was necessary so the government can  fulfill its goals." "It is very hard to undertake the social  projects the people need if there are no funds," the president's  daughter explained to justify the increases.    After describing the measure as "a clumsy maneuver to  violate  the law," the Ecuadoran Socialist Party said the increase is "an  unbearable tax on the Ecuadoran people." It proposed that the  people go to the streets to show the government "their total and  increasing discontent." The wave of discontent was becoming  general in Quito, Guayaquil, and Riobamba.    Defense Minister General Jose Gallardo and General Guido  Nunez, the police commander, have warned that the Armed Forces  are ready to safeguard peace and they said that any person who  is found disrupting order "must take responsibility for his  actions."    Victor Granda, secretary general of the Socialist Party,  announced that a suit of unconstitutionality against the  increase will be filed on Monday "because it worsens the  Ecuadoran people's poverty." He indicated that "we will  struggle in the streets to organize a social movement that must  demand the trial and removal of Ecuadoran Vice President Alberto  Dahik. [no end quotation mark as received] Dahik, a conservative  economist, has been blamed for the economic policy of the  government of right-wing Duran-Ballen.    Even though the government has insisted it will not  authorize  increases in bus fares and intermunicipal transportation,  beginning Sunday some Quito taxi drivers have begun to charge up  to 40 percent more on their urban runs.</p>

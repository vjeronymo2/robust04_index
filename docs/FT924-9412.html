			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: Competition between Liffe and DTB intensifies COMPETITION between London and Frankfurt for D-Mark derivatives business is intensifying. Yesterday, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) announced plans to launch a medium-term German government bond contract early next year. The contract will compete with a similar one on the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB), and is a sign that competition between the rival exchanges is increasing. Liffe decided to launch a futures contract to meet demand from its members for a medium-dated futures contract. Both Bundesobligationen ('Bobls,' or five-year notes) and Bundesschatzanweisungen ('Schatz,' or four-year notes) will be deliverable into the Liffe contract. So far this year, a total of DM58bn of Bobls and Schatz have been issued. Liffe's announcement was warmly welcomed by bund market participants, who believe the new contract will help to improve liquidity. The London exchange already has a three-month Eurodeutschmark interest rate future (which has an average daily volume of 71,569 contracts), and a German government bond (bund) future, with an average daily volume of 60,922 contracts. 'To some extent we had a gap in the maturity range - but the new contract allows us to encompass the whole range of maturities,' said Mr Roger Barton, managing director of business development at Liffe. Mr Nicholas Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, said the new contract would provide greater hedging and spread trading opportunities. Mr Barton argues that the total volume of futures business is increasing, and that while Liffe is competing with the DTB, 'the overall size of the pie is increasing too'. According to Liffe, the monthly volume of bund contracts declined from 1.87m in January to 1.36m in June before rebounding to 2.1m in September. Liffe has 67 to 70 per cent against the DTB's 30 to 33 per cent share of the bund futures contract business, The DTB yesterday welcomed Liffe's decision to introduce a Bobl contract, saying it would broaden the market for such products. The DTB introduced its Bobl contract in October 1991 and after meeting with what the DTB calls 'some initial scepticism', it has found increasing favour with investors. In the past two months, average daily volume has exceeded 10,000 contracts. The DTB claimed its clearing facilities were much quicker than London's and would ensure it maintained a competitive edge. While market participants welcomed Liffe's decision to launch a Bobl contract, some point out that Liffe could lose market share with its 10-year bund future unless it amends the contract's specifications. Last Friday, the German Finance Ministry said there would be no further 10-year bund issues this year. The market interpreted this as a decision to halt Federal issues while leaving the way clear for further German agency issues, in particular from Treuhandanstalt, the agency charged with the privatisation of former eastern state-owned enterprises. The Treuhand launched a 10-year DM10bn bond issue in September which trades at a slightly higher yield than comparable Federal issues (see graph). This is because the Treuhand issue is less liquid and is seen as less secure than the Federal issues, even though it carries a Federal guarantee and has a triple-A rating from the leading credit rating agencies. While the Treuhand bond is deliverable into the DTB bund contract, Liffe decided to leave its bund contract specifications unchanged for the moment. Liffe says it is still considering whether to include Treuhand bond issues for delivery in its June 1993 and subsequent bund contracts. Bund market participants have suggested that if Germany temporarily stops issuing 10-year Federal issues, leaving the Treuhand free to tap this area, then Liffe's bund contract will become less attractive as the number of bund issues available for delivery declines. Liffe points out that about DM60bn of bunds are deliverable into its March 1993 bund contract, consisting of five separate Federal and Unity bund issues. The difference in the DTB and Liffe contract specifications has led to a widening of the price gap between the two contracts. Before the Treuhand bond issue, the contracts traded at similar levels. However, since the Treuhand issue has become the cheapest to deliver into the DTB contract, it means the DTB bund future is priced lower than the Liffe contract.</p>

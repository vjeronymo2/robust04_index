			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: King launches offensive against Labour - Defence MR TOM KING insisted yesterday that a fourth Trident submarine was essential to a credible British nuclear deterrent as the government continued its attempts to focus pre-election political exchanges on issues of its choosing. In a Commons debate designed to highlight Labour's perceived weakness on nuclear defence matters, the defence secretary also asserted that a sub-strategic nuclear capability was similarly indispensable. In spite of repeated Opposition prompting, he stopped short of announcing that a firm order for the fourth Trident had been placed, however, stating only that tenders were being evaluated and it was the government's intention to proceed. Authorisation to go ahead with certain long lead-time items had already been granted, he said. In a recent written answer, the government disclosed that approximately Pounds 142m had been spent on the fourth submarine to date. The government motion advocating that Britain retain a credible nuclear deterrent was carried by 320 votes to 49. Mr King claimed that Labour was 'split from top to bottom' on defence. Why did it publish policy papers on 'every subject under the sun' except nuclear defence, he asked. Citing the views of a former editor of Marxism Today magazine that Labour had 'virtually abstained' from the post-cold war debate, Mr King claimed that 16 of the 22 shadow cabinet members had 'an anti-nuclear background'. Mr Gerald Kaufman, shadow foreign secretary, responded by calling for Britain to take a lead in arranging a meeting of the eight nuclear powers to begin the next phase of the Start process. The elimination of 'all eight stockpiles' was 'the obvious and sensible goal' of such talks, although it was too early to say when that goal might be attainable. Mr Kaufman attacked the government for brandishing its nuclear weapons 'like some kind of macho symbol'. He argued that post-war Labour administrations had been 'as diligent in providing for this country's defence as any other government. 'Whenever the Tories know they are facing electoral defeat, they dive head first into the political sewer,' he said. Divisions within Opposition ranks were underlined, however, both by the presence of two Labour-drafted amendments on the order paper and by a statement from Mr Tony Benn (Lab Chesterfield) that he would not support the official Labour amendment. Summing up for Labour, Mr Martin O'Neill, shadow defence secretary, accused the government of being more interested in 'trying to foment an artificial debate about security matters' than addressing current domestic economic problems. For the government, Mr Douglas Hogg, foreign office minister, highlighted a promise made by Mr Kaufman to provide the Trident shipyard in Barrow with work equivalent to any defence cuts, branding it 'yet another undisclosed pledge' that was being brought to the electorate's attention. This elicited an intervention from Mr Kaufman who said that the promise dated from May 1989. Earlier, Mr David Howell, Tory chairman of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, said there could 'never be a worse time than now' to contemplate defence cuts. He added that the government would now have to consider beginning a spending programme on effective anti-missile systems.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Both sides claim victory in PM's libel tussle THE unexpected end to the libel action by Mr John Major, the prime minister, against New Statesman &amp; Society yesterday gave way to a war of words, with both sides claiming victory. Mr Major, who has accepted Pounds 1,001 in damages after the magazine reported rumours linking him with caterer Ms Clare Latimer, declared himself satisfied with the outcome. But the magazine simultaneously was claiming a clear moral victory. Once again distracted from international affairs by domestic issues - this time the New Statesman's unilateral announcement of a settlement - Mr Major said in Tokyo that the agreement meant the issue was 'dead and gone'. Ms Latimer, who has also agreed to the settlement, said she was happy with the outcome. But back in London, Mr Steve Platt, the magazine's editor, said the prime minister had accepted 'almost derisory' damages. For him, it was a moral victory, albeit a very expensive one given likely total costs of around Pounds 250,000 which left the magazine with enormous financial difficulties. Mr Platt insisted that acceptance of the damages by Mr Major without any attached apology or admission of liability on the magazine's part left his colleagues holding the moral high ground. In Tokyo, Mr Major remained equally adamant. The magazine had expressed regret for the injury and embarrassment caused. The size of the damages, he emphasised, had never been a relevant figure. Mr Major and Ms Latimer had already been awarded damages reported to be around Pounds 60,000 each against the printers and publishers - with an additional Pounds 100,000 in costs - which the magazine has to meet. It will now also have to pay Mr Major's and Ms Latimer's costs. Mr Major, told of claims of a moral victory, retorted: 'It's a curious moral victory, when they admitted it has cost them Pounds 250,000. They have admitted that what they said was unfounded, they can't repeat it. If this is a moral victory, it is not the sort of moral victory they would like every week.' Later in London, Mr David Hooper, the prime minister's solicitor, said: 'If they thought they were going to win the case, they could have sat back and said 'see you in court'.' That remained the message yesterday from Mr Simon Regan, editor of Scallywag, the satirical magazine, which is also being sued over the same subject. He dissociated himself from the New Statesman settlement and said he intended to see the case concluded in court. In the latest twist, today's editorial in the New Statesman further taunts the prime minister. It says Mr Major has won nothing which had not been available five months ago. Downing Street said it was not aware of what the prime minister had done with the damages award.</p>

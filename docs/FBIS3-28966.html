			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Teleconference by President Fidel Ramos with journalists in </F> the cities of Davao, Cebu, Baguio, and Bacolod and panelists in  the PTV-4 television studio, moderated by Ricardo Puno at the  PTV-4 studio in Quezon City -- live; passages in italics in  Tagalog]    [Excerpts] [Ricardo Puno] Mr. President it was  mentioned that you were in Subic yesterday, and that's the news  here in Manila, that you were in Subic because you went to meet  with the president of Taiwan, and some expressed apprehension  that the meeting will offend the People's Republic of  China. What really transpired in Subic, and what did you  discuss with the president of Taiwan?    [Ramos] [passage omitted] It was not an official visit; we  did not talk about political matters, but we concentrated on  trade and economic cooperation because that is allowed under the  one-China policy. And why shouldn't I take advantage of that  stopover, a very brief one about three hours, of the president  of Taiwan, in as much as they are the biggest potential  investors in Subic. They have already contracted for 300  hectares in which they will put up 150 factories, and we will  open up this area on 20 February. And for the purpose of  developing that industrial site area, the Taiwanese have  arranged for a soft loan to the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority  under Chairman Dick Gordon, amounting to $23 million dollars,  but that can be expanded to $100 million later on between the  next couple of years depending on how fast there's a need for  that loan. At the same time, we, on the part of the  Philippine Government, we are putting in our appropriations  there, which is called for there at the BCDA Law, the Bases  Conversion Development Authority Law which includes Clark.    Now, as for those investments in Subic, another  important matter we discussed is the joint ventures in  agribusiness. This is an offshoot of what we just discussed  with Ben Jochico [journalist in Bacolod City] in regard to  sugar. It was quite very clear to me that the Taiwanese would  want to contribute agricultural expertise as well as capital  into the Philippines to develop joint ventures in agriculture so  that at least they will have a nearby source of food products  coming out of this joint ventures, because joint ventures  allow them to produce at minimal cost. So I said that, by  all means, we have the land and the farm labor available, and  these are readily available in the northern part of Luzon, which  is nearest to your country. [sentence as heard] But they are  available elsewhere in the Philippines, and there is already a  very active Taiwanese business group here, they have their own  chamber of commerce. That could be the vehicle for the  acceleration of this kind of partnership. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN LEGACY  </P> <P> In response to Robert J. Samuelson's "Reagan's Legacy Needs No Slogan" (Op-Ed  Page, Jan. 11), I wish to suggest that he is wrong and that a very appropriate  slogan would be "Borrow and borrow, spend and spend." Given his statement that  the debt "nearly tripled since 1980 to more than $2.6 trillion" it seems fair  to ascribe about $1.7 trillion to the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> If one divides $1.7 trillion by 250 million, the present U.S. population, the  per capita increase in debt is $6,800 during the Reagan Administration. For a  family of four, this is $27,200 in the last eight years. I hope all of the  people who voted for Reagan feel that they have obtained their family's share  of this debt increase in either tax reductions or additional benefits.  </P> <P> I believe that there would be a certain poetic justice if Reagan were to be  remembered as "Big Red," the champion of deficit spending and debt increase.  </P> <P> HAL ENGEBRETSON  </P> <P> Yorba Linda  </P></p>

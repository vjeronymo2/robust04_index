			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Volatile organic compounds are regulated due to their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribution to the formation of ozone in the lower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmosphere. Ozone is a listed criteria pollutant. Exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ozone has been linked to both health and welfare impacts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health and welfare risks from these include impaired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respiratory function, eye irritation, deterioration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials such as rubber, and necrosis of plant tissue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential for VOC emissions from wastewater can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessed based on the characteristics of the wastewater at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its point of generation. Based on information and data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gathered on the concentration of organics in SOCMI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater streams and on the flow rate of these streams,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the VOC emissions from SOCMI wastewater streams are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to cause or contribute significantly to air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Selection of Affected Facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The choice of the affected facility for an NSPS is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on the Agency's interpretation of section 111 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Under section 111, the NSPS must apply to ``new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources''; ``source'' is defined as any building, structure,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility, or installation which emits or may emit ``any air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutant.'' Most industrial plants, however, consist of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous pieces or groups of equipment which emit air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollutants, and which might be viewed as ``sources.'' The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses the term ``affected facility'' to designate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, within a particular kind of plant, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chosen as the ``source'' covered by a given standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In choosing the affected facility, the EPA must decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which pieces or groups of equipment are the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units for separate emission standards in the particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industrial context involved and in light of the terms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of section 111. One major consideration in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination is that the use of a broader definition means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that replacement equipment is less likely to be regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the NSPS; if, for example, an entire plant were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as the affected facility, no part of the plant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be covered by the standard unless the plant as a whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were ``modified.'' Because the purpose of section 111 is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize emissions by the application of the best  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated control technology (considering cost, other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health and environmental effects, and energy requirements)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at all new and modified sources, there is a presumption that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a narrower designation of the affected facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate. This ensures that new emission sources within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plants will be brought under the coverage of the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as they are installed. This presumption can be overcome,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, if the Agency concludes that the relevant statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors (technical feasibility, cost, energy, and other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental impacts) point to a broader definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another factor considered in the selection of an affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility for the NSPS is the definition used in existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental rules. The application of these factors is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

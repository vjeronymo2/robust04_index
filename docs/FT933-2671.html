			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Observer: Jumping ship Greece's election campaign is only four days old but the government's senior economic advisers are already deserting. Their departure is taken by some as confirmation that prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy party faces defeat on October 10. Miranda Xafa, economic adviser to Mitsotakis, is returning to the IMF. She says two years of battling against politicians and central bank officials have sharpened her enthusiasm for dealing with 'difficult economies'. Nassos Zambaras, mainstay of the government's privatisation office, has signed on with N M Rothschild, the government's main adviser on privatisation. Peter Doukas, the fast-talking finance undersecretary, is returning to Citibank. George Alogoskoufis, a former London University economics professor, plans to combine a job at Athens University with some private consulting. All four are now headed for jobs paying considerably more than a Greek civil servant's salary.</p>

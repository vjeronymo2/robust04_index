			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Observer: Owls of a feather Washington ears cocked as the very senior Japanese diplomat began confessing over dinner who he'd ideally like to be US ambassador in Tokyo. It was 'Mike Mansfield, 20 years younger'. And lo] his wish has come as near true as possible with Walter Mondale taking up Bill Clinton's offer of the posting. Mansfield, from Montana, went from the majority leader's desk in the Senate to Japan, where memories of his tenure from 1977-87 are still venerated. Mondale, from Minnesota, served not only in the Senate but four years as Jimmy Carter's vice-president. Both are wise old owls with lots of friends in Congress, twin qualities that the frequently battered Japanese have come to value. There's nonetheless a little mystery behind Mondale's acceptance. After being variously tipped as a candidate for the London, Paris and Moscow embassies, he made some pretty dismissive remarks about the diplomatic life. Also, Tokyo had long seemed in the bag for Richard Holbrooke, the investment banker and Asian specialist from the Carter administration. Then last month Holbrooke's name suddenly dropped off the table, without explanation. Rumour was that the Japanese government was so upset with Clinton trade policies as even to threaten to deny 'agrement' to Holbrooke - who, the latest scuttlebut has it, is a leading candidate for Bonn. But now that Washington is making more emollient noises towards Tokyo on the trade front, no such resistance to the Mondale appointment can be expected. Mansfield, still going strong at 90, was already 74 when he took up the job and survived all attempts by subsequent Republican administrations to remove him. Mondale is a mere 65 and perfectly capable, if he so chooses, of serving longer in Tokyo than Clinton in Washington.</p>

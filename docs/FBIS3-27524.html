The charter also says the two countries will solve all  problems peacefully by adopting measures that are in keeping  with international law and the principles of the "partnership  for peace" plan of the conference on security and cooperation in  Europe and NATO.    If Kazakhstan is threatened by invasion or nuclear weapons,  the United States is obliged to appeal to the UN Security  Council for emergency measures to provide aid for Kazakhstan.    The charter also provides for regular talks between  Kazakhstan and the United States on security, cooperation in  defense, and increased military exchanges. The United States  will also assist in Kazakhstan's military training.    The charter, signed during Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's visit to the United States February 13-17,  symbolizes an important step for the two countries toward  establishing a strategic partnership.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: The high cost of damaged goods - General Motors was last week ordered by a US jury to pay punitive damages of Dollars 101m. Robert Rice on a civil liability problem slowly getting out of hand Two years ago when former US Vice-President Dan Quayle described America's legal system as 'a self-inflicted competitive disadvantage' costing Dollars 300bn a year, US lawyers accused him of making cheap political capital at their expense. Mr Quayle's remarks struck a cord with the American people and business; in recent years they have grown used to ludicrous law suits and unjustifiable multi-million dollar damages awards. A Connecticut man who sued a ladder maker for Dollars 3m after he fell off and injured himself because the manufacturer failed to provide a general warning of the dangers of using ladders is a case in point. Americans are undoubtedly litigious by European standards - 18.4m lawsuits were filed last year. But it is the size of awards, particularly awards of punitive damages for corporate misconduct, which is now causing concern in the US. Businesses claim the US civil liability system has itself become a liability to the economy. Excessive awards discourage innovation and curb competitiveness. Consumer groups say that the threat of lawsuits and awards of damages forces companies to make safer products. The clearest indication that the problem may now be getting out of hand came last week when General Motors was ordered by an Atlanta jury to pay punitive damages of Dollars 101m on top of compensatory damages of Dollars 4.2m to the parents of a 17 year-old boy who died in 1989 when his GMC pick-up truck crashed and burst into flames. Damages are high in America largely because they are still set by juries. Elsewhere, judges determine damages. US juries seem to side with the little guy suing the corporation, and, in setting awards, appear to be more influenced by what they feel the corporation can afford to pay than what would be fair compensation for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff. Large punitive damages are a recent phenomenon in the US. In 1930 awards of Dollars 50,000, Dollars 33,333 and Dollars 12,650 were described by a law magazine as 'startlingly large'. By 1955, the largest punitive damages award in California was still only Dollars 75,000. In 1991 and 1992 alone, however, US courts upheld at least 15 punitive damages awards in the range of Dollars 5m-Dollars 60m. Recent attempts by businesses to curb levels of punitive damages through the courts have come to nothing. The US Supreme Court has considered four constitutional challenges to punitive damages in the past five years but has yet to uphold a single one. Now, however, it has accepted for review a case from the West Virginia Supreme Court involving a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m which may prompt the Supreme Court 'to decide, at long last, that punitive damages in the US have gone too far' say Mr Leo Herzel and Mr Roy Englert, partners of Chicago-based international law firm Mayer Brown &amp; Platt. If they are right and the Supreme Court succeeds in setting constitutional limits for punitive damages, lawyers say it will be one of the Court's most important decisions affecting business for a decade. The West Virginia case involved a dispute between two businesses, TXO Production Corp, a subsidiary of US steel oil and gas giant USX Corp, and Alliance Resources Corp, over rights to oil and gas beneath a tract of land in the state. A jury decided that TXO's lawsuit claiming doubt about Alliance's title to the land was frivolous and awarded Alliance Dollars 19,000 in compensatory damages, equivalent to its costs of defending the action. The jury, however, tagged on a punitive damages award of Dollars 10m which was upheld by West Virginia's Supreme Court primarily on the ground that TXO had been 'really mean'. Punitive damages awards in the US are often based on the belief that large companies should be made to pay more than small companies partly because many courts feel this is the only way to impress on senior management the need for responsible corporate behaviour, say Mr Herzel and Mr Englert. In the General Motors case, for example, it appears that the jury's decision to award such a huge sum was because it felt this was the only way to force the car maker to recall nearly 5m of the same 'sidesaddle' trucks which prompted the original court action. Critics say the 'sidesaddle' trucks are unsafe because the petrol tank, which is fitted outside the frame of the truck, explodes on side impact. General Motors, which made the 'sidesaddle' trucks between 1973 and 1987, has always maintained they are safe. Some US courts take a different view, however. Judge Easterbrook of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, for example, believes that ultimately it is the stockholders, the most important of whom are institutions representing ordinary people, who will bear the burden of any punitive damages award against a company. It is wrong, he says, to view punitive damages as a means of punishing big companies. In the TXO case the Supreme Court will have to decide whether West Virginia's system, by relying heavily on the defendant's wealth in assessing damages, violates due process under the US constitution. More important, particularly in the light of the General Motors case, the Supreme Court will also have to decide whether an award of Dollars 10m for a wrong valued at Dollars 19,000, has crossed the line of 'constitutional impropriety'. The last time the Supreme Court looked at the issue, in a case from Alabama, it said a punitive damages award equal to four times the compensatory damages awarded was 'close to the line'. The Supreme Court ruling in the TXO case is expected in June. In any event, the political climate may be beginning to turn against large punitive damages awards. In Virginia, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals recently upheld the state's Dollars 350,000 cap on punitive damages. Other states have also introduced caps for non-economic loss and some require a proportion of the punitive damages to be paid to the state government rather than the plaintiff. For European companies with business interests in the US, the American damages system is both puzzling and worrying. In Europe, there is strong resistance within the courts to the type of punitive damages awards seen in America in recent years. Last June, the German Federal Supreme Court underlined this by ruling that American punitive damage judgments are not enforceable in Germany because they are contrary to public policy. In England, the Court of Appeal made it clear in the recent Camelford water pollution case that punitive damages will only be awarded in English law in very restricted circumstances. Mr David Higgins, a partner in City solicitors Herbert Smith who acted for the defendants in the Camelford case, says: 'The judgment makes it clear that the American example will not be followed here.' Until the punitive damages issue has been resolved in the US, Mr Herzel and Mr Englert's advice to large companies doing business in America is simple: guard against the risk of excessive damages by opting for settlement of disputes by arbitration or alternative dispute resolution wherever possible.</p>

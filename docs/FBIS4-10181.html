			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Berenice Gomez Velasquez] </F>   [Text] Most of the servicemen who have returned from Peru  have voiced their disappointment and puzzlement because the  pledges made to them have not been kept. They are anxious to  know their immediate fate since reality is very different from  what they were promised.    Lawyer Virginia Contreras has briefed the local press at  length on this situation on behalf of her clients. The  servicemen wish to resume their military careers, but they feel  a public statement constitutes another matter. Unofficially, the  servicemen indicated that when they were in Lima an agreement  was signed "and now nobody knows where it is," so that the idea  is to ignore the terms of the agreement. They specifically  agreed that in order to have the charges against them dropped,  they only needed to return to the country. Now they are also  being told to give statements accompanied by their defense  lawyers, something that was not planned.    Hugo Chavez' release proved to them that there is no need to  testify to have the charges dropped. He did not appear with the  law, did not read the records of the proceedings, and did not  even appear before a judge, maintained an attitude of contempt  of court, and was always making statements.    To be pardoned, an arrest warrant should have been issued.  Is  the president dropping the charges based on privileges of rank?  Is this hierarchical discrimination?    They protest the demand of prior request for discharge  because it is not legal and because they wish to return to the  Venezuelan Armed Forces. They charge that the authorities  request they limit themselves to appointing counsel for the  defense who would allow their defendants to request a discharge.    The officers regret the noncompliance of their commander in  chief, who had promised to drop charges once he gained power.  They question why they are told "the forces do not want them,"  when that statement can only be made by the High Command, the  majority of whom were detained or confined by the coupists who  were obeying superior orders.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 6 (BTA) -- The secretary general of  the Western European Union [WEU], Mr. Willem van Eekelen,  arrived on a five-day official visit here today. This is his  second visit to Bulgaria (the first one was in the autumn of  1991). He will meet with Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov,  National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Defence Minister  Valentin Aleksandrov, representatives of the Parliamentary  National Security Committee and Foreign Policy Committee and  President Zhelyu Zhelev. He will also deliver a lecture at the  Bulgarian Atlantic Club.    "I was invited by the Bulgarian Government to have  consultations on the relationship between Bulgaria and the  Western European Union," Mr. Van Eekelen said upon his arrival  at Sofia Airport. "At the May meeting, the 9th of May, when the  Bulgarian foreign and defence ministers will also be attending,  we hope to upgrade the form of consultations to allow your  country more participation in our activities and I would like to  hear the Bulgarian views on that new situation and new status,"  he said. When asked about Bulgaria's chances, he made the  following comment: "We already have close cooperation with your  country on the Danube embargo, so we have moved already from  consultation to cooperation (...) but I think it is important  that as Bulgaria is moving closer to European Union, you already  have a treaty of association with the Union, and also close  relationship with the Western European Union as the security  dimension of European integration, now, that means that we will  open up some of our meetings, some of our activities and as far  as I am concerned, the more, the better."    Later today Mr. Van Eekelen met with Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov to discuss Bulgaria's relations with the WEU.    "Our relations with the Western European Union are very  good.  Bulgaria's integration with WEU is among the priorities in  Bulgaria's foreign policy," Mr. Daskalov said after the meeting.  He added that Bulgaria hopes to be granted the so-called  "enhanced status" of a WEU associate member "which would provide  a new basis for cooperation". "I think we had a most  informative session; I explained to the minister (...) how we  are looking forward to a meeting in May where he and the defence  minister will attend and where we will enhance the form of  consultation and open up some of our activities, bring Bulgaria  close not only in terms of consultation but also in cooperation."    Mr. Daskalov said that they also discussed the crisis in the  former Yugoslavia and the role of the sanctions.    "I stressed the importance of the embargo (...) and I  expressed my appreciation for the role played by Bulgaria and  the sacrifices made by your country," said Mr. Willem van  Eekelen.    His visit to Bulgaria coincided with the visit of a  delegation of the WEU Assembly, led by its president, Sir Dudley  Smith.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Gazumping on repossessions rises sharply THE SLUMP in property prices has led to an increasing number of buyers being 'gazumped' by property developers making late bids for repossessed houses, the ombudsman for corporate estate agents said yesterday. The increase in complaints of gazumping on repossessions contributed to a 50 per cent increase in complaints about estate agents in the second year the ombudsman has operated. Complaints rose to 1,864 in the year to August, from 1,236 in the previous year. Mr David Quayle, the ombudsman, said he thought the anger of gazumped buyers was usually 'wrongly directed' at estate agents. They did not appreciate the risks of trying to buy a repossessed house. Mr Quayle said building societies and others holding repossessed properties had a legal duty to obtain the highest price. This often led to properties being advertised even after an offer had been accepted subject to contract.' Many buyers feel they have got a good bargain and they get upset when there is a late bid, especially when they have spent money on fees,' he said. Agents should explain that only a final contract ensured a deal. The highest single award made by the ombudsman this year was Pounds 4,000 to a property owner told by an estate agent that he had no hope of selling his property. This estate agent had a client interested in buying the property. Most awards were Pounds 100 to Pounds 500. There were only three of more than Pounds 3,000. The biggest group of complaints was over alleged maladministration. Mr Quayle said the complaints represented 'only a very small percentage' of the 315,000 successful residential property transactions in a single year. He suggested two changes to common practice. One is to charge dual commissions to sellers when an agent introduces a prospective buyer before the handling of the sale is passed to a second agent. He said this practice may not always be fair, even when contractually justified. He also said agents should draw up guidelines to make clear whether they are obliged to disclose information to a potential buyer which may be damaging to a sale. The government's pledge to abolish stamp duty on the transfer of shares should be postponed and the rate of duty doubled from 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday. It said the measure would bring in about Pounds 2bn which could pay for measures to boost the housing market. The Ombudsman for Corporate Estate Agents: Annual Report 1992.

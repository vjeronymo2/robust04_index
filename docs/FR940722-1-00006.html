			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 282 Model DC&hyph;10 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 175 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The currently required inspections take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the current inspection requirements of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $77,000, or $440 per airplane, per inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed modification would take approximately 12 work hours to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost between $3,730 and $6,730 per airplane, depending upon the airplane model. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed modification requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be between $4,390 and $7,390 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed post-modification inspections would take approximately 12 work hours per airplane to accomplish, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed post-modification inspection requirement of this AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $115,500, or $660 per airplane, per inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the current or proposed requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

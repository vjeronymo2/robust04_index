			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (4): Knocked about by Norman Lamont - Late payers become a political issue THE late payments issue has been transformed in recent months from a concern of the small business lobbyists to a mainstream political issue in Britain. Mr Norman Lamont, the Chancellor, announced measures aimed at speeding up the settlement of invoices in his budget last month while the two main opposition parties have unveiled strategies for dealing with the problem. The factoring industry stands on the sidelines convinced, in the main, that even if the payments performance of British business improves it will still have a significant role to play. Despite its refusal to change the law to improve payments behaviour, the government acknowledges that the problem is a major one for business. British companies wait on average 72 days for payment, 42 days longer than the terms they normally write into contracts. The cost of financing these delays eats up half of the average businesses pre-tax profit, which itself is only 4 per cent of sales, the government calculates. The government believes that payments performance will not be improved by the introduction of an automatic right to charge interest on overdue business debts - a scepticism shared by many factors  - though its policy of exhortation appears to have failed dismally. It has therefore opted for a series of less far-reaching measures. In his March budget the chancellor said he would: Require large companies to state in their annual report and accounts how quickly they pay their bills. Up to 9,000 companies could be affected according to the Companies Act definition of 'large': sales of more than Pounds 8m; a balance sheet of more than Pounds 3.9m and 250 employees. Simplify procedures for dealing with small claims and debt recovery cases in the courts. This will include dispensing with preliminary hearings in small claims cases; allowing judges to help litigants who do not have legal representation; and allowing claimants to be represented in court by someone who is not a lawyer. Make prime contractors to government departments include a clause in their agreements with sub-contractors to pay them promptly: usually within 30 days of receiving a valid invoice. These measures were welcomed by business groups though they did not go as far as some had hoped. The Federation for Small Businesses had been pressing for the courts to take automatic responsibility for enforcing debt payment judgments. At present plaintiffs must return to the court for a payment order if the defendant does not pay up. There is also some doubt about the ability of government to insist on prime contractors paying sub-contractors within 30 days when, according to some small business lobbyists, the payments record of government has worsened. But discussion of these issues will be academic if the Conservatives are not returned to power. Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have promised legislation to give businesses the automatic right to interest on overdue debts. The Liberal Democrats want companies to be required to make a provision in their accounts for any interest liability. This is intended to shame larger companies into adopting better payment practices. But even if these measures were brought in and businesses began paying more promptly there is likely to remain plenty of work for the factors to do. If a statutory right to interest were to be introduced the factors could play a role in collecting that interest.</p>

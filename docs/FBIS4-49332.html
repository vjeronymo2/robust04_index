			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Civil servants now  working for the Hong Kong Government may stay at their posts  after 1997 in accordance with the Basic Law, said a high-ranking  Chinese official here today. The official said that the  Chinese side will firmly abide by the Basic Law provision  regarding the issue, urging civil servants of the present local  government to serve the Hong Kong people before and after 1997.  Wang Fengchao, a member of the Political Affairs Panel of the  Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee for  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), made the  remarks after holding talks with two political parties in the  territory. The political affairs panel of the Preliminary  Working Committee (PWC) held separate talks here this morning  with the Liberal Party of Hong Kong and the Liberal Democratic  Federation of Hong Kong in order to solicit their opinions on  PWC's work. Wang said that the Basic Law has clearly  stipulated that civil servants in Hong Kong may stay at their  posts after 1997, adding that they do not have to state their  political stand. He said that if there were some servants who  wanted to quit their jobs, they should make a notice in advance  according to the present practices so that others could be  arranged to replace them to fill the vacancy. Wang said that  the Basic Law has also clearly stipulated that the senior  officials in the future government of the Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region shall be nominated by the chief executive  and appointed by the central government of China. Therefore,  he continued that there does not exist the consultation with the  British side in appointment of the senior officials in the  future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</p>

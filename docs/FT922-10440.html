			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Greek resentment rises as Macedonia seeks recognition THE TIDE of Greek resentment is rising as international recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia comes nearer. Greek possessiveness about the name Macedonia is manifesting itself in innumerable ways, most notably in a demand for rings, brooches and cuff-links with the insignia of Alexander the Great, the ancient king of Macedonia, which Athens jewellers are struggling to meet. 'We carry all sorts of reproductions of ancient coins but people ask specifically for the Macedonian ones,' says Maria Lalaounis of Ilias Lalaounis, a leading jeweller. Trucks, taxis and aircraft cabins, meanwhile, are plastered with stickers proclaiming 'Macedonia is Greek'. Even the post office is franking letters going abroad with a similar legend. In the past, ancient history was a powerful weapon for Greek leaders as they argued to be included as equal members of western European political and economic organisations. But Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, the prime minister, can expect an unsympathetic hearing tomorrow when he attempts to defend, at an informal EC foreign ministers' meeting, his country's refusal to recognise Macedonia under its present name. Mr Mitsotakis took over the foreign ministry two weeks ago after sacking Mr Antonis Samaras, who proposed that Greece veto EC recognition of Macedonia and close the borders with its northern neighbour. The Portuguese EC presidency has done some quiet diplomacy in an attempt at reconciliation. The Macedonian government is ready to make concessions, such as accepting a Greek demand to amend the constitution, to avoid implying a territorial claim on the Greek province of Macedonia, and promising to stop anti-Greek propaganda. But Mr Mitsotakis is unwilling to break the deadlock by accepting New Macedonia, the compromise name being suggested, for fear of provoking a rebellion in his party. Mr Samaras's hardline views have made him the country's most popular politician. Mr Andreas Papandreou, the opposition leader, endorses his position, and has called for a blockade of Macedonia. But many Greek politicians believe recognition is inevitable in the next few weeks, especially after Monday's proclamation in Belgrade of a new, truncated Yugoslav state. While there is little pressure on Mr Mitsotakis to exercise a veto, he will have to find a good excuse for not closing the border. In the year since civil strife erupted in Yugoslavia, Greek exporters have come to terms with paying higher transport costs to send goods to western Europe through Bulgaria or by ferry to Italy. 'There are compensating factors. The overall decline in trade with the ex-Yugoslav republics created a buyers' market here for hiring trucks. It also means more space available on ships and fewer delays at Salonica port,' a northern Greek businessman says.</p>

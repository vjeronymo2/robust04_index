			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Social Defense Secretary Mario Soliz admitted on 28  February that about 60 peasants who were growing coca were  detained in the 26 February clashes and subsequently released.  The peasants are under investigation by the Special  Antinarcotics Force (FELCN) over their alleged ties to drug  trafficking.    Soliz said the measure was taken after the intelligence  services determined that the peasant mobilization was headed "by  agitators," allegedly trained by drug traffickers who intend to  create problems for the executive branch authorities.    Soliz noted: "Yes, there obviously exists some type of link.  Records (of the detainees) have been prepared and the  intelligence services will surely determine who these people  are. If they have any ties to drug trafficking, these people  will be called to testify at FELCN."    He said the infiltration of drug traffickers in the  assemblies and meetings of coca growers aims to prevent the  growers from understanding the alternative development program's  benefits for Chapare's peasant communities.    He expressed optimism, however, that the interrupted  negotiations with coca growers will be resumed on 3 March. Soliz  added: "We understand they will attend the meeting, and in this  regard we want to use all our ability for dialogue to see if  they are sincere in resuming the dialogue and fulfilling the  law."    He said the task of eradicating illegal coca in Chapare will  continue in accordance with the plans of national officials and  in strict compliance with the law. He announced that the Social  Defense National Secretariat installed a permanent office in  that region with experts and under secretaries who will contact  the real producers at least five days each month to promote  alternative projects.    Soliz also reported that several coca growers' leaders are  constantly threatening the peasants who want to join the coca  replacement plan, and this clearly shows the political handling  of the coca problem.</p>

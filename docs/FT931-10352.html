			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Pressure mounts over reform of leasehold PRIVATE LANDLORDS and tenants with long leases will today renew their battle to swing the government's leasehold reforms in their favour, when all MPs have their first chance to discuss and vote on the details of the plans. Groups of Tory backbenchers on both sides of the argument have put down amendments to the Housing and Urban Regeneration Bill, which includes giving tenants the right to club together to buy the freehold of their block of flats or the right to extend their leases. Labour is unlikely to support changes to favour the landlords, so it is the moves on behalf of the tenants' lobby that threaten the government's 21 majority. Potential Tory rebels say up to 20 backbench Tories are sympathetic to their cause. The point on which ministers are most likely to give way - and most are reconciled to doing so - is abandoning the low-rent test provision. This is one of the proposed criteria to determine whether leaseholders qualify for the right to buy the freehold of the property, but the rebels argue that the rule is artificial. Ministers have argued that the purpose of the low-rent rule is to distinguish between long leases where the tenant pays a premium at the beginning and then pays a low ground rent, and the different sort of interest held by a tenant who is on a long lease but paying a market rent. Only properties with a low ground rent qualify under the proposals. The tenants' lobby is also renewing its pressure on the government to change the rule which means that tenants would not qualify if more than 10 per cent of the property was in non-residential use. On the landlords' side, Tory MPs led by former ministers including Sir Jerry Wiggin and Mr Kenneth Baker have proposed changes that restrict the new rights to flats which are the principal residence of tenants. However, ministers are unlikely to accept the change. In spite of the prospect of rebellions, government whips do not believe that the legislation itself is in jeopardy because it fulfils so many manifesto commitments. Instead, the landlords' lobby will simply step up their efforts to win changes in the Lords, where the bill will be discussed shortly.</p>

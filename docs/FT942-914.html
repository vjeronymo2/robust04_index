			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Bell Cablemedia Bell Cablemedia looks a little foolhardy to be pressing ahead with its Dollars 1.2bn flotation given the state of financial markets. Three other UK cable companies - TeleWest, Comcast and General Cable - pulled their flotations last month. But Bell has its own special reasons for seeking a listing. The company, which involves pooling the UK cable interests of Bell Canada, Cable &amp; Wireless and Jones Intercable, does not yet exist. Its creation is contingent on a public flotation. One might therefore be forgiven for expecting the shares to be sold cheap. But, if anything, the price sought looks a touch on the high side. Even at the bottom of the pricing range, Bell's franchises are valued at roughly Dollars 300 per home. Comcast, which came closer to flotation than TeleWest or General Cable, had to pull its offer when investors baulked at a valuation not much higher than that. Price per home is, of course, only a crude yardstick and there are differences between Bell and Comcast. Bell, for example, controls a greater proportion of its franchises than Comcast - a factor investors rightly appreciate. Unfortunately, other factors point in Comcast's favour. In particular, the company has invested proportionately more in its franchises than Bell. So it is not obvious that Bell deserves a premium rating. Given that, the flotation's success cannot be guaranteed at the current pricing range. If it flops, the chances of reviving the other three flotations will grow even slimmer.</p>

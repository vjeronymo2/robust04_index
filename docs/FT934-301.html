			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi companies to merge operations - Creation of Japan's biggest chemicals group could spark more consolidations Two Japanese chemical companies that belong to the Mitsubishi group of companies plan to merge their operations in a move that will create the largest chemical company in Japan. Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the largest domestic petrochemical company in which Shell Petroleum has a 12.6 per cent stake and Shell Japan a 5.7 per cent stake, and Mitsubishi Kasei, the country's biggest all-round chemical manufacturer, plan to merge next October on an equal basis. The new company to be formed by the merger, Mitsubishi Chemical, will have consolidated profits of more than Y1,000bn (Dollars 9.35bn) and a combined share of more than 15 per cent of the domestic ethylene market. The decision, aimed at increasing the companies' international competitiveness, comes in the midst of one of the most difficult times for Japan's petrochemical sector and is expected to encourage further consolidation in the industry. The country's chemical industry has not only suffered a prolonged business slump in the domestic market, as leading customers in the auto, electronics and construction industries have faced sharp declines in their businesses, but is also facing growing competition overseas. The problems of Japan's chemical manufacturers are not new. Overcapacity has plagued the industry since the early 1980s and there have been persistent rumours of consolidation for the past 10 years, according to Mr John Chanoki, chemical industry analyst at James Capel. After the first oil shock, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry encouraged companies to join forces in sales co-operatives that were able to control prices. Nevertheless, Japan's 14 chemical companies remained fiercely independent and have, until now, managed to avoid full-scale mergers. But as the Mitsubishi companies' merger reflects, the worsening business environment has made independence a luxury that many Japanese chemical companies can no longer afford. The slowdown of the domestic economy has hit Japan's chemical companies at a particularly difficult time. Overcapacity at home has been compounded by a loss of export markets in south-east Asia where the Japanese have faced growing competition from other countries, particularly from South Korea. At the same time, the move of their large customers in the automobile and electronics industries to increase production overseas has hurt the ability of Japanese chemical manufacturers, which have not followed their customers abroad, to compete with more low-cost overseas producers for their traditional business. Both Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei are expected to report pre-tax losses in the year to March, 1994. Furthermore, the increasing reluctance of the Japanese authorities to protect the chemical industry from outside competition makes their future look grim as well. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, Japanese chemical makers will face tariff reductions on imported chemicals of, on average, more than 50 per cent in five years' time. Against this background of increasing competition both at home and abroad, Japanese chemical companies are being forced to accept the necessity of consolidation to create larger, more efficient and internationally competitive businesses. The seriousness of the situation is underlined by the merger of the two Mitsubishi companies which, despite belonging to the same Mitsubishi group of companies with ties that go back to the pre-war zaibatsu business groups, were known for their intense rivalry. Mitsubishi Kasei, for example, has its own corporate symbol which its uses more prominently than the three-diamonds symbol of the Mitsubishi group. Mitsubishi Petrochemical, meanwhile, has not joined certain study groups on environmental issues in which Mitsubishi Kasei has taken leadership. Analysts expect the decision by the two Mitsubishi companies to ease the way for other mergers in the industry, with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals and Mitsui Petrochemicals, two companies in the Mitsui group, at the top of the candidates' list. Within the Mitsubishi group there are three more chemical companies, which are also likely candidates for further consolidation of the group's chemical businesses. Whether or not such mergers will strengthen the Japanese industry's international competitiveness, however, is open to debate. Unless the merger of the two Mitsubishi companies is accompanied by bold restructuring that includes personnel cuts, two bad companies will not make a good one, says Mr Chanoki. Furthermore, in an industry where scale is crucial, even the Mitsubishi merger which will create Japan's largest chemical company, will not bring Japan close to the ranks of the world's largest chemical companies such as EI du Pont de Nemours and Dow Chemical of the US, and the UK's Imperial Chemical Industries. By sales, Mitsubishi Chemical is unlikely even to reach the ranks of the world's top 10 chemical companies.</p>

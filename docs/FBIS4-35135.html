			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Members of Congress have expressed surprise at the  suspension of guarantees. The Democratic Action Party, National  Convergence, and MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] have announced  that they support the measures. MAS Deputy [Gustavo] Marquez  said the country was in need of forceful decisions.    Copei [Social Christian Party], however, has asked the  government to explain many issues that remain obscure.  According to Copei President Hilarion Cardozo, the government's  incoherence, the inconsistency of the measures, and the  extemporaneous manner in which they were disclosed have  intensified the crisis.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TREVINO OVERCOMES A SEVEN-SHOT DEFICIT  </P> <P> Lee Trevino, playing in his second Senior PGA Tour event, made up seven strokes  on the final nine holes Sunday to win the Royal Caribbean Classic at Key  Biscayne, Fla.  </P> <P> Trevino, whose share of the $400,000 purse was $60,000, trailed Jim Dent by  five strokes with three holes left but birdied Nos. 16 and 17 and parred 18.  Dent bogeyed 16 and 17 and double-bogeyed 18 to finish tied for second, a shot  back.  </P> <P> "I know how upset Jim must be," Trevino said. "I never should have won this  golf tournament."  </P> <P> Trevino's final-round 68 gave him a 54-hole total of 206, seven-under-par.  Dent, who shot a 68 on Saturday and started the final round eight under par,  ballooned to a 73 and finished at 207, tied with Butch Baird, who shot a 67.  Dent and Baird each won $32,000.  </P> <P> "I got a little careless with a five-shot lead, but Lee didn't sneak up on me,"  Dent said. "I just ran out of gas on the last three holes. Lee played well and  I went to sleep."  </P> <P> Trevino, who started the final round bogeying two of the first three holes,  shot a 36 over the front nine and trailed Dent by seven strokes. Trevino  birdied Nos. 10 and 11 to pick up two strokes over the next six holes, but he  said he didn't think he had a chance to win going to No. 16.  </P> <P> "I'm looking at Butch and just hoping I can catch him and finish second,"  Trevino said. "I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd catch Jim."  </P> <P> Trevino said he finally started thinking he had a chance to win when Dent drove  his ball into the water on No. 18 and Trevino put his drive straight down the  fairway to within 169 yards of the pin.  </P> <P> Pat Bradley birdied the first hole of a playoff with Dale Eggeling to overcome  the biggest collapse of her career and win a $300,000 LPGA tournament at Lake  Worth, Fla.  </P> <P> Bradley made a 25-foot putt to save par on the last hole of regulation to force  the playoff.  </P> <P> Bradley went without a bogey for 44 holes and led by 11 strokes before her game  fell apart midway through the third round. She shot four-over-par 76 and blew a  five-stroke advantage Sunday, but earned the $45,000 first-place check because  she was at her best with the tournament on the line.  </P> <P> Bradley tied Eggeling with a four-day total of seven-under-par 281 with the  dramatic par-saving putt after driving into a bunker on No. 18. They returned  to the 18th tee for the playoff, and Bradley hit her second shot 18 feet from  the pin before clinching her 24th career victory.  </P> <P> Eggeling, who shot three-under-par 69 and made up seven shots on Bradley,  rolled a 25-foot putt four feet past the cup on the playoff hole.  </P> <P> The victory moved Bradley within six victories of qualifying for the Hall of  Fame.  </P></p>

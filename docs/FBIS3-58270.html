			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Alternate Foreign Minister Theodhoros </F> Pangalos by correspondent Anna Panayiotarea; place and date not  given--ellipses as published]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] It is extremely  disturbing to read the most unlikely reports against our  country....    [Pangalos] I would start somewhere else: Let's correct as  much as we can, because we have responsibilities. From there  on, I share the common Greek view and the anger over the unjust  and unjustified attacks. Attacks against the country affect me  more than attacks against myself. I can endure personal attacks.    [Panayiotarea] What can we correct? We always appear with  our hand extended....    [Pangalos] The country's economy. Depend less on EC loans.  I don't mean the funds to which we have a right and I reject  the view that we get a lot of money from the EC. We receive a  lot because this is what the computer allocates. No one within  the Community makes gifts. In the future we must avoid EC loans  so that we may start a procedure that will improve the public  debt, budget deficit, and inflation.    [Panayiotarea] Do the reports represent EC views about  Greece?    [Pangalos] They are malicious.    [Panayiotarea] Do they have a particular direction?    [Pangalos] I don't know. They are malicious and don't  represent reality. Our problem is economic, not international  relations....    [Panayiotarea] This means we cannot raise our voice and at  the same time plead for a loan. Isn't that it, Minister?    [Pangalos] If I know that in a day or two I must ask the  same  people I confront today, either newspaper owners or governments,  to support me economically because I cannot do it myself, then  inevitably I have a weakness....    [Panayiotarea] Is Skopje another issue on which we  "inevitably" have a "weakness?"    [Pangalos] We handled Skopje very poorly, unskillfully. We  have gone backward. We were led to a deadlock. We must get out  of it. The government made a reasonable proposal: Skopje must  stop behaving in a provocative, expansionist, and irredeemable  manner. It must abandon its flag, which declares a war against  Greece by implying territorial pursuits. We will mutually  guarantee border inviolability and permanency. Skopje must  change that part of its Constitution that sets out as a goal the  freeing of...supposed Macedonians.    [Panayiotarea] What if your reasonable proposal is not  accepted? Will we be led to...unreasonableness?    [Pangalos] We have spoken. There is no need to run around  talking continuously, because it shows nervousness in our  diplomatic relations. It reveals insecurity, something that is  not my style. I have mentioned Skopje.    [Panayiotarea] Do you know that by saying  Bosnia-Herzegovina,  not Skopje, is a priority for you has created a painful  impression?    [Pangalos] ...But we cannot do anything we want in the  Presidency. We do what the Community wants. Every Greek must  realize that. The Presidency's role is not to turn the 12  states into a great Greece. We have made a proposal. Let  Skopje react. Let's be patient. One of the Greek's greatest  faults is that he finds it impossible to wait. We honk our  horns continuously even before the green light comes on. Let's  wait for the green light.    This is enough on Skopje. I want to say nothing else. You  keep asking: "What are we going to do next?" "Are we going to  start a dialogue?" My answer is: "I do not know. When it  happens, we will see."    [Panayiotarea] ...and if it does not happen?    [Pangalos] Obviously the atmosphere will change for the  better if it happens. If it does not, there is a great chance  that the climate will worsen. I can say that now. This is the  message Skopje receives. I have nothing else to say.    [Panayiotarea] Are we ready?    [Pangalos] I will answer nothing else. Excuse me for being  so absolute, but this discussion must close. You must stop  asking questions on these issues. We must maintain our position  to appear serious and constant. If you read about Skopje, you  will see that every two weeks the Greeks made a counterproposal  that contradicted the previous one. How can our partners or the  Skopjeans respect us.... [passage omitted]    [Panayiotarea] What are you going to do with the white paper  when average unemployment is 13 percent and the 17 million  unemployed in Europe are panicking?    [Pangalos] This is the main issue. The decisions of the  latest summit include these proposals.    [Panayiotarea] But it is a general framework....    [Pangalos] We will implement the specific Commission  proposals to secure the necessary concessions....    [Panayiotarea] Some European reports say EC expansion with  new members will be delayed because of the Greek Presidency.    [Pangalos] We have no reason not to support the  participation  of new countries. I will remind you that the Greek resistance  was united with these countries in brotherly relations during  the dictatorship. They were the only ones to support us. In  any case, the effort toward 1 March [when Community expansion  will be discussed] is superhuman. There will be difficulties  because the internal common view in some member states is  rejectionist. Anytime a new member is accepted, there is an  opportunity to settle the various relations on a new basis.  These are issues that we will handle in the best possible way.  But we can impose no decisions on anyone.    [Panayiotarea] ...What about Cyprus?    [Pangalos] It is an additional, national reason for which we  want the expansion. Cyprus and Malta are small countries that  will cause the Community no economic problem. Cyprus will even  finance the Community from its budget. [passage omitted]</p>

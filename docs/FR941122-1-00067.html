			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 17, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Silver Creek blind harvestman ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Calicina jungi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as an endangered or threatened species. The letter, dated July 14, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition stated that the Silver Creek blind harvestman is known only from rocky serpentine grassland, 0.9 miles southeast of the junction of Silver Creek and San Felipe Roads, near San Jose in Santa Clara County, California. The petitioners noted that urban development imperils this species and a pipeline was laid through its habitat on or before 1990. In a letter dated January 13, 1990, the petitioners stated they had searched for blind harvestmen and micro-blind harvestmen in the vicinity of Silver Creek and Metcalf Canyon Roads in the San Jose area during 4 days in 1966 and 1 day in 1983. The petition and supporting documentation indicate that the surveys of these other potential habitats for the Silver Creek blind harvestman were inadequate. Though the Silver Creek blind harvestman may be declining, additional adequate surveys are needed to assess its distribution. Beyond the information described above, the petitioner presented few data on the status of the animal. Therefore, the Service determines that the petitioners did not present substantial information that the requested action may be warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 31, 1989, the Service received a petition from Briggs to list the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Microcina lumi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as an endangered species. The letter, dated October 26, 1989, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the name, signature, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioner. The Fairmont micro-blind harvestman was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58804). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioner stated that the known distribution of the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman is limited to two serpentine outcrops on Fairmont Ridge, near the City of San Leandro in Alameda County, California. The petitioner stated that all other suitable habitats in this area have been searched without success. A proposed housing development and overgrazing by livestock were cited as the basis for the requested action. The Service reviewed the petition and supporting documents, including a scientific paper describing the genus  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Microcina <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and the species  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> M. lumi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (Briggs and Ubick 1989) and a map displaying the geological features of Fairmont Ridge and adjacent areas. This map, a 1:250,000 geological base map for the San Francisco quadrangle (California Division of Mines and Geology 1980), reveals other serpentine outcrops within the general vicinity of Fairmont Ridge. Some of these outcrops appear to provide approximately the same combination of geographic features as the known habitats on Fairmont Ridge. Though urban development and grazing remain a threat in the species' known habitat, other potential habitats remain unsurveyed for the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman. Moreover, no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this species to category 2. As a result, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the Fairmont micro-blind harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 22, 1990, the Service received a petition from Briggs and Ubick to list the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Microcina edgewoodensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as an endangered species. The letter, dated March 20, 1990, was clearly identified as a petition and contained the names, signatures, institutional affiliation, and address of the petitioners. The Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman was designated a category 2 candidate species on November 21, 1991 (56  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FR <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  58804). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the petitioners, the Edgewood Park micro-blind harvestman is known only from Edgewood County Park and a site west of Interstate Highway 280 in San Mateo County, California known as the ``Triangle'' (these two localities were cited as three sites in the petition). This species was described from three male specimens collected at these two locations (Briggs and Ubick 1989). The animals were found beneath rocks in serpentine grassland adjacent to scrub oaks. The threat cited by the petitioners is unspecified development at the Triangle. The Service is not aware of any development currently proposed for this specific area. In addition, serpentine grassland in this area is being protected due to the presence of the threatened bay checkerspot butterfly ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Euphydryas editha bayensis <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). A study commissioned by the County of San Mateo determined that it is not feasible to construct a golf course at Edgewood County Park (Thomas Reid Associates 1993). The County of San Mateo has designated Edgewood County Park as natural open space (Barrales and Huening 1993, San Mateo County Board of Supervisors 1993). In light of the above discussion and because no new information was received or available to the Service beyond that used to assign this species to category 2, the Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial information available regarding the present and future threats facing the Edgewood micro-blind harvestman and determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

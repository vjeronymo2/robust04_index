			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK News (Employment): Clarke's move to the right makes a wrong - The troubled course of the education secretary MR Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, was riding for a fall. His proposal to allow school governing bodies in England and Wales to choose and pay their own inspectors was condemned on all sides long before the House of Lords gave it the coup de grace. So was his plan to refuse local education authorities an automatic right to inspect their own schools. Mr Clarke blamed Monday's defeats on those issues in the Lords on heavy lobbying by unions, but a united front by the teaching unions is a rare event these days. Mr David Hart, the widely respected general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, described the Lords' action as 'introducing much-needed sanity into the inspection arrangements for schools, which were always fatally flawed'. Mr Clarke had already started to back down. Last week he accepted an amendment from the Tory peer Lord Renfrew, master of Jesus College, Cambridge, giving the chief inspector of schools a veto over an institution's choice of inspectors. The next question is why Mr Clarke lumbered himself with the dubious scheme at all. The answer is not difficult to find. Since becoming education secretary in November 1990 Mr Clarke has cultivated the Conservative party's rightwing. He succeeded Mr John MacGregor, who came under heavy fire from the right for failing to sustain momentum for Mr Kenneth Baker's Education Reform Act of 1988. On the left of the party himself, Mr Clarke was keen to be classed as a reformer. The plan for private, competing inspectorates originated with the rightwing Centre for Policy Studies. Suddenly last summer Mr Clarke set up an inquiry into the future of Her Majesty's Inspectorate. During its deliberations the CPS published a paper by Mr John Burchill, Tory-controlled Wandsworth's chief schools inspector. In a mere seven pages Mr Burchill called for HMI to be broken up, with a successor body 'concerned more with oversight of inspection arrangements by other bodies than with itself observing the process of teaching in schools'. The latter task, he argued, should lie with 'small consultancy teams not recruited solely from the teaching profession', and licensed by the new national inspectorate. Almost a carbon copy of that scheme appeared in the Schools Bill, introduced last November. It diverged in important respects from that recommended by Mr Clarke's own inquiry and was privately criticised by some leading inspectors. Reform of the inspectorate is not the only area where Mr Clarke has played to the right. Plans announced last year to reshape teacher training bear a marked CPS influence. Recently his willingness to allow grant-maintained schools to introduce selection was a clear sop. But even if the government were to leave the Lords' amendments intact, the parent's charter pledge of school inspections would be met and Mr Clarke's bold attempt at more would have earned him credibility with a section of the party crucial to his post-election prospects.</p>

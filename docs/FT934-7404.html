			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: ANI profits up 5.7% in first quarter AUSTRALIAN National Industries, the heavy engineering group which owns Britain's Aurora group, yesterday announced that after-tax operating profits rose by 5.7 per cent to ADollars 12.6m (USDollars 8.4m) in the three months to end-September, the first quarter of its current financial year. Revenues rose by 11.7 per cent to ADollars 345.3m. But the company warned that, while the Australian operations showed an improved performance, activity in the UK remained flat. 'Aurora's activity remains depressed,' it said, 'with no sign of sustained recovery. Margins continue to be under pressure as the group moves away from . . . defence and aerospace.' The upturn in profits, said the company, could be attributed to its distribution operations - Steelmark-Eagle and Globe - and the service businesses, which include Coates Hire and Container Care International. The environmental engineering operations also contributed profitably.</p>

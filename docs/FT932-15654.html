			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Your Peps are safe MY WIFE and I are now living permanently in the Netherlands, having left the UK in April 1991, but are still treated as being resident in UK for tax purposes. However, this residential assessment is due to be reconsidered in April 1993 when we expect to be treated as no longer resident. Both of us have several Peps taken out over a number of years. What will be the position when our situation changes and we are no longer required to pay tax in the UK? Will these investments in Peps be allowed to continue or must they be liquidated? All that happens (under regulation 8 of the Personal Equity Plan Regulations 1989) when a Pep investor ceases to be both resident and ordinarily resident in the UK is that he or she is not entitled to put any more cash into any Peps. The regulation says that the investor 'may retain the benefits of the plan (including the right to any relief or exemption due under the plan) subsisting at that time.' Ask your UK tax office for the free pamphlet IR89(1992) (Personal equity plans). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

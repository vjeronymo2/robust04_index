			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 2 June -- The visit of the head of the  Republic of Korea is symbolic, "because it is taking place at a  time when our countries are in the midst of socio-economic  transformations and the break-up of out-dated systems and  patterns of social development," State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin  said after his meeting with ROK President Kim Yong-sam at the  President Hotel today.    The chairman of the State Duma hoped that multi-faceted ties  will develop between the Republic of Korea and Russia and that  contacts between their supreme legislative bodies--the Federal  Assembly of Russia and the National Assembly of the Republic of  Korea--play a proper part in this.    In reply Kim Yong-sam said he was delighted to meet the  leaders of a parliament that was elected in free elections for  the first time in Russia.    He expressed gratitude to the State Duma for its adoption of  a legislative act rehabilitating repressed Koreans in Russia and  touched on the problems of nuclear disarmament on the Korean  peninsula and Russia's participation in the Asian-Pacific  Economic Cooperation program.    The Korean president expressed the hope that his "visit will  serve as a stimulus for shifting our bilateral relations onto a  qualitatively new and higher level of constructive and mutually  complementary partnership."</p>

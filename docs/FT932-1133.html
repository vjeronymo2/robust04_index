			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Catalans wary of links with Gonzalez SPAIN'S SOCIALIST prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, is facing difficulties in his attempt to form a stable government with the Catalan nationalists as junior coalition partners. The Socialist leader fell short of winning an overall majority in parliament in his fourth successive general election victory on June 6. Mr Jordi Pujol, the chief minister of the Barcelona- based autonomous government of Catalonia and the leader of the area's ruling Covergencia i Unio (CiU) coalition, said yesterday after talks in Madrid with Mr Gonzalez that the Catalan nationalists would support a central government headed by Mr Gonzalez only if the latter adopted CiU's electoral programme. Mr Pujol, however, stopped short of slamming the door on a coalition government by agreeing to set up a committee, made up of senior CiU members and executives of Mr Gonzalez's PSOE Socialist party, to examine the common ground between the two political groups. The committee will have plenty to disagree about, as the CiU, unlike the PSOE, supports a full overhaul of Spain's rigid labour legislation, sharp spending and tax cuts, and a far-reaching privatisation programme. The Madrid meeting amounted to a poker game in which the Catalan leader made an unexpectedly determined bid to increase self-rule in Catalonia. Mr Pujol said a precondition for any CiU support for Mr Gonzalez was Madrid's acknowledgement of the idea of fiscal co-responsibility with Catalonia. As a first step, Madrid would have to hand over 15 per cent of the income tax raised in Catalonia to the Catalan government. However, Mr Gonzalez's party draws its main support from the underdeveloped south and west of Spain where local Socialist leaders are wary of increased privileges for the wealthy Catalan region. PSOE suspicions of the Catalan nationalists are likely to emerge today when Mr Gonzalez meets the Socialist party executive committee to report on progress towards forming a new government. The left wing of the PSOE favours a coalition with the Communist-led coalition Izquierda Unida (IU), an option that Mr Gonzalez has so far discounted. The PSOE won 159 seats in the elections two weeks ago, 17 short of an overall majority in the 350-member Congress chamber. Mr Gonzalez could ensure a governing majority through a coalition with either IU, which won 18 seats, or with CiU, which won 17. The prime minister has until the middle of next month, when he faces an investiture debate in parliament, to form a coalition. If he fails, he will have to form a minority PSOE government which would be forced to do deals, law by law, with either the Catalans or IU.</p>

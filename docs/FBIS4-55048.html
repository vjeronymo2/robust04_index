			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Viktor </F> Krejci; place and date not given: "Exception Made With Regard to  Jewish Property Cannot Be Repeated"]    [Text] [Krejci] Why did the Civic Democratic Party [ODS]  back away from its position regarding the restitution of  property to Jewish physical persons and why did it allow that  communities be designated by law as dutiful persons [povinne  osoby], that is, those obliged to hand out property? After all,  it was clearly to be expected that the coalition partners would  use this as a precedent during the discussion on the restitution  of church property, which is exactly what has happened. Will it  not be difficult to explain, and defend, that a principle that  applies to one type of property does not apply to another type,  that is, to church property?    [Klaus] I and, I think, also the overwhelming majority of  ODS members consider the exception made with regard to Jewish  property not repeatable, singular, and unique. This exception  is due to the quite extraordinary suffering of citizens of  Jewish origin during World War II. It does not mean any  precedent, however, and nothing of this sort can be repeated.    [Krejci] The ODS is preparing a specific proposal for a  complete stop after restitutions. What will it look like and on  what will it be based?    [Klaus] The ODS Executive Council will deal with a complete  stop after restitutions this weekend and I hope that we will  make progress on this issue. It is precisely the variant of the  restitution of Jewish property that was approved by Parliament  last week that is causing the ODS to speed up the work on the  proposal for a complete stop on restitution.    [Krejci] The treaty on Palestinian autonomy has been signed.  On the one hand, there is the view that this process is really  leading toward peace in the region. On the other hand,  according to other voices, this is the beginning of new  conflicts with a potentially very tragic ending. What is your  opinion?    [Klaus] Such matters as this are very difficult to assess  from the outside. Czechoslovakia's partition is the best  example of that. We knew at that moment that partition was  unavoidable. I can exceptionally agree with [Deputy Foreign  Minister] Mr. Bratinka that it was a contribution toward calm  and peace in Europe. I remember well, however, that assessments  from the outside were quite different. Therefore, I really  would not dare predict whether this step, that is, the formation  of Palestinian autonomy, will contribute to internal peace  between Jews and Arabs and I believe that no one else should  dare make that judgment.    During my visit to Israel I spoke with Prime Minister Rabin  and Foreign Minister Peres, both of whom were pinning all their  hopes on this step. Those familiar with their past know that  the two had not always been such dovish characters, wanting to  make peace at any price. They had often sided with advocates of  a more vigorous solution to this issue. I believe, however,  that they have now arrived at a mature and balanced conclusion.    There can be no doubt that the signing of the agreement on  Palestinian autonomy will not bring peace overnight. In the  short run, unrest in these territories could even grow stronger  and the very first hours already suggest that this may very well  be the case. I do not think, however, that there is any other  path toward peace.</p>

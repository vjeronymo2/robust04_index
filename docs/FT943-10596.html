			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Concern on fall in grants to housing associations Government grants to housing associations to fund the cost of low-cost homes for rent or sale will fall next year, in spite of warnings that this will make it harder for them to raise capital. Mr David Curry, housing minister, yesterday announced the ceiling for housing association grants would fall from 62 per cent of the cost of a new home to 58 per cent in 1995-96. This is higher than the target of 55 per cent set two years ago for 1995-96. Lenders have warned that a fall in rates below the present level would make it much harder for associations to raise the balance of the cost on the capital markets. Nationwide building society, one of the largest lenders to the sector, said last night that it would have to look much more closely at the viability of lending to associations. It said: 'Whilst we are pleased that the government hasn't reduced the grant rate to 55 per cent we feel that at an average rate of 58 per cent many housing associations may find it difficult to secure their private-finance requirements.' Associations raise about Pounds 1bn a year to top up government grants to build subsidised homes. The lower grant rate could make many lenders reluctant to lend the 42 per cent needed to top up the grant. Tenanted homes are commonly valued at 50 per cent of their vacant value, with lenders wanting cover of 150 per cent of the loan. Associations are now having to pledge older properties as security for new loans, which in effect cuts many newer and specialist associations out of development. The National Federation of Housing Associations has warned that the cuts in the grant rate will reduce the number of associations that are able to borrow and build homes. Mr Jim Coulter, federation director, warned last night that the need to borrow a higher proportion of the cost would put up rents. 'On average rents for new homes at this grant level are likely to be 30 per cent higher in 1996 than 1993 rents,' he said. Mr Curry said that he was confident that associations would be able to maintain their building programmes at the new rate.</p>

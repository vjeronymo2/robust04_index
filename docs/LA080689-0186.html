			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: BUSTER POINDEXTER "BUSTER GOES BERSERK." RCA: ** 1/2: *****GREAT  BALLS OF FIRE:**** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S *** GOOD VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY *  AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> "Buster Checks His Bank Statement" might be a more appropriate title. This  second album from the former New York Dolls frontman shticks to the same  formula as his '87 debut: one part tropical-flavored punch-up ("All Night  Party"), two parts vintage rhythm 'n' booze ("Who Threw the Whiskey in the  Well?"), and two parts 100 proof aged in soul ("International Playboy"), topped  with a pre-rock standard ("Deep in a Dream") and dollops o' dry humor.  Nevertheless, this ice-breaking -- if scarcely ground-breaking -- disc is still  a purr-fect poolside party platter for too-hepcats 'n' snake-hipped kittens as  well as fine, fine, superfine grist for the live show's gin mill.

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Arts: Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra - Proms WHEN Germany was divided, some of the country's most venerable musical institutions were left on the other side of the iron curtain. As they take their place again on the world stage, it is becoming increasingly clear how conscientiously traditions in musical life there were upheld. The Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra is celebrating its 250th anniversary this year. That means it is older than most of the music which it plays  - a remarkable thought. The orchestra's conductors have included Mendelssohn, Wagner, Mahler and Richard Strauss. It never disappeared from sight during its four decades in the Eastern bloc, but reunification has enabled the orchestra to promote itself internationally and win the profile which its reputation would seem to demand. There have been several visits to Britain recently, not all great successes. Two years ago the orchestra gave a Brahms symphony cycle at the Barbican under Kurt Masur, its Music Director since 1970, and all its wealth of tradition was not enough to make up for drab performances dominated by the strings (the wind and brass players might as well have been left behind at the airport). This pair of Proms, in the Royal Albert Hall's more open acoustic, presented a different picture. The solo wind playing was one of the main pleasures at Monday's concert. Masur takes a sober view of Schubert's Unfinished Symphony, slicing up the endless thread of Schubertian melody into regular, four-square phrases; but when the solo oboe or clarinet played over hushed strings, the audience held its breath. The same effect opened Bruckner's Fourth Symphony - solo horn this time, sensitive, unwobbly, a magical opening to a symphony that makes romantic horn calls through a woodland of rustling strings its main motif. Masur had the brass blocked together in the middle at the back. From there they produced a well-contained sound, rather than an all-embracing peroration at the end. But that was the only drawback in a warm-hearted and approachable performance, Bruckner with a touch of the early romantic. That is the period of music at which the Leipzig players excel. In Tuesday's programme a selection of music from Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream smiled genially, the strings with a lightness of touch, the wind with a puckish grin, though brass and timpani were again not much in evidence. Masur has the warmth and affection for the music; the players supplied the sparkle of the ensemble. Earlier, in Brahms's Second Piano Concerto, there had been little sign of a spark at all. The soloist and conductor seemed to bring out the worst in each other. John Lill takes few risks, not so much technically (he has all the notes) as in expression, making this autumnal music fall like dead leaves to the ground; Masur responded by suppressing the orchestral part's impulse and fire. Not a golden autumn this, but damp, dank, grey. The Leipzig tradition may go back two-and-a-half centuries, but it seems to have lost Brahms somewhere along the way.</p>

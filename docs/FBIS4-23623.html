			<p>BFN     [Text] The fortress government of Jamba, which includes  areas under the control of the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Cuando Cubango Province, today  denounced the involvement of mercenaries whose nationalities  have not been identified in an extended operation of the  Government of the Republic of Angola jointly with the  neighboring Republic of Namibia along the border, in the  Caprivi-Mucusso strip. A press release issued by the fortress  government says that Luanda was involved in the operations of  various units led by Major Mario Antonio, an officer who had  been part of the UN Transition Assistance Group during the  Namibian elections. Major Mario Antonio has been assigned the  mission of destabilizing Jamba, neutralizing Vorgan [Voice of  Resistance of the Black Cockerel], UNITA's radio station, its  leadership, and the governor of the fortress. A Cuban spy  called Mariana Dirma, who had worked for the International  Committee of the Red Cross during the Namibian elections, is  also involved in the plot. The fortress government's document  says that these personnel have assembled in the Mukwe area,  which is located near Bagani, headquarters of the South African  Army before Namibian independence.    We hereby inform the Angolan and international community  that  clashes may resume in the southeast of Angola, because this is  the wish of the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] and the South-West African People's  Organization [SWAPO]. The communique, which appeals to both  governments to assume their responsibilities, warns that should  the clashes resume, the consequences will not only be felt  exclusively in areas controlled by UNITA, but in the entire  southern African region.    On the confused situation in the southeast of Angola, the  press office of the fortress government based in Jamba yesterday  once again accused the SWAPO-MPLA-PT of plotting to capture  Angolan refugees residing in Namibia. The press office says  that thousands of youths have been seized in Namibia and sent to  training camps in Angola, in violation of  internationally-recognized rights of the refugees. The fortress  government urges the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to  urgently inquiry about the situation which is still threatening  thousands of Angolan families residing in Namibia and which puts  at risk the constitution of that neighboring country. The  seizures are being carried out by secret police agents assisted  by elements of the Namibian Defense Forces who speak the local  languages of Kwangar and Diriko. Vorgan contacted a source from  the press office of the fortress government from whom it learned  that UNITA has always favored and will continue favoring a  policy of good neighborliness with all neighbors of Angola,  searching to solve all differences which may subsequently emerge  through dialogue. The source said UNITA will not fold its arms  in case of aggression and that security measures have already  been taken.</p>

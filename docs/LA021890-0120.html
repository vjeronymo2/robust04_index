			<p><P> February 18, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GAY APPLICANTS  </P> <P> I really want to believe that the government of the United States is great and  fair. But I am constantly bombarded by things such as Irvine's Measure N and  the Feb. 6 article concerning the upholding of the Defense Department's policy  of "subjecting all homosexual applicants for 'secret' and 'top secret'  clearance to more intense investigations than the other applicants."  </P> <P> How can we label some forms of bigotry morally wrong while supporting and  encouraging others? Why is being prejudiced against homosexuals accepted, while  prejudices against other groups are condemned?  </P> <P> All levels of government are contributing to the encouragement of this blatant  form of bigotry. If we accept discrimination against this one group, what will  stop us from discriminating against other groups? I don't understand how we  allow this outright discrimination in a country that prides itself on being  open to all people.  </P> <P> RENEE LION  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

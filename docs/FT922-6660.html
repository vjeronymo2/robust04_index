			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (10): The last tram from Stammersdorf - Ian Hamilton Fazey offers a visitor's guide IF THE British have to hear the first cuckoo to know spring has arrived, the Viennese need no such natural signal. Spring comes with the opening of the city's famous Eissalon at Schwedenplatz, Vienna's equivalent of Piccadilly Circus. The Wienerwald - the Vienna Woods - may be hardly in bud, but when the tables are set out on the pavement outside the ice cream parlour, that is the sign that winter has officially ended. Summer ends with similar ceremony on October 1: the Eissalon retreats indoors, while the hot chestnut and roasted sliced-potato sellers set up their cupboards and braziers by Schwedenplatz's tram and U-bahn interchange. Trams and tube trains pull away with happy travellers sustaining themselves on whichever is the appropriate seasonal fare: something to cool you down in the heat or warm you up in the cold. A time-and-temperature sign on a facing office block across the adjacent Donaukanal confirms whether you should feel comforted or guilty at indulging in yet another Viennese temptation. Vienna may be the archetypal cafe society, but the cafes are only a part of the temptation. The Heuriger is an equally dangerous place. While the cafe exposes the waistline to the perils of Torte and Kuchen - tarts and cakes - the Heuriger seduces the unwary with Gruner Veltliner. Heurigen are wine bars, sometimes found in cellars, and Veltliner is the grape that does best locally. The white, dry wine travels especially well between cup and lip, and comes by the viertel, or quarter-litre. It goes down like water. Most Heurigen are in the countryside around Vienna, near the vineyards, and are the closest thing Vienna has to the English country pub; but there are also others in the city centre, known as Stadt Heurigen. The Gigerl, 10 minutes' walk from the Opera and near the Stephansdom - St Stephen's Cathedral - is in a small cobbled street facing the back door to the British Bookshop and is always full of Viennese. It is a favourite for pre- or after-opera suppers. Bookings are usually necessary. They all serve modestly-priced hot food, sold and served over a counter, with dishes including schnitzel, roast pork, roast half-chickens, home-made meat, torte or mushroom, spinach or onion pie. In the autumn, the Heurigen hang wreathes of vine leaves over their front doors to announce the harvest is in and that the first pressings of new wine are available for tasting. The concoction comes in viertel mugs and is so cloudy it is hardly translucent, let alone transparent. In the Vienna suburb of Grinzing or nearby villages like Stammersdorf, Strebersdorf or Gumpoldskirchen, Heurigen come by the kilometre, packed side-by-side along high streets. Autumn evenings are filled with the sound of oom-pah bands and accordions as thousands of people give in to temptation  -if indeed they ever tried to resist it in the first place. If the prospect does not at first appeal to the visitor, a viertel or two soon produces remarkable conversions. A quieter time may be had in the cafes, possibly with a little Gershwin tinkling out from a baby grand in the corner. There is plenty of Veltliner on tap here, but you will pay more. You can also have a properly served meal, and most cafes usually have their own specialities on offer. The most famous cafes include the Central, in Herrengasse, Landtmann, near the Rathaus and Burgtheater, Demel in the Kohlmarkt - possibly the most mouth-watering cream cake emporium in the world - and the Griensteidl in Michaelerplatz, by the imposing portal to the Alte Hofburg palace. All are well-appointed, with tourist prices, but are worth it for the atmosphere. Cafe Hawelka, off the Graben near the Stephansdom, is rougher but still chic. However, if you want a comfortable hour away from city centre bustle, Cafe Schottenring, opposite the Borse, or stock exchange, is a cosy winner. Coffee is an art in itself in the cafes, where it is never referred to as such. An espresso is a kleine Mocha and a large one with milk, a grosse Brauner. A Melange has the cream whipped in, while an Einspanner comes with a huge dollop of whipped cream floating on top and should only be combined with a helping of Torte and cream if you really want to be sick. One overriding factor makes this recreational eating and drinking market possible - Vienna's size. The Habsburg empire may have ultimately got too big for its boots but the importance of Budapest and Prague to that empire helped ensure that Vienna as a city never did. Today, it is growing slowly but there are still only 1.5m people there - small for a capital city of such historical, if not modern-day political significance. The city centre remains entirely 'walkable', thanks to the walls which once hemmed medieval Vienna against the original course of the Danube at its confluence with the Wien. Across the river Wien, incidentally, is the Landstrasse, where, according to Napoleon, the Balkans begin. When the city walls were demolished in the 19th century to allow Vienna's expansion, the military advisers of the Emperor Franz-Josef insisted they be turned into a wide, circular boulevard with plenty of clear, open spaces. This was to give imperial troops clear lines of fire against the proletariat, should revolution ever threaten the Hofburg. The benefit today is that this policy created the Ringstrasse, Europe's first inner ring road. Combined with a middle ring road called the Gurtel, it helps keep the danger of gridlock to a minimum, even in the worst of weather and rush hours. It is, however, the combination of a small city with a superb, integrated, public transport that makes uninhibited enjoyment of Vienna possible in the age of the breathalyser. A combination of bus, train, tram and underground provide a possibly peerless network for getting about. Since 1967, the Austrian and Vienna authorities have spent nearly Sch42bn (Pounds 2bn) on a 41km, five-lines, underground network. Another Sch15.5bn (Pounds 740m) has been committed for extensions before the end of the century. This combines with nearly 250km of tramway, carrying 35 lines, and with a total of 991 stops dotted throughout the city and its environs. If evidence were needed that infrastructure begets markets, Vienna's figures provide it. In the decade to 1990, the number of passengers using Vienna's public transport system rose by 36 per cent from 450.7m to 611.8m. This was in spite of an increase in the number of cars in the city from 476,553 to 546,945 - up 15 per cent. A weekly season ticket - good for train, U-bahn or bus - costs Sch125 (a little over Pounds 6). Small wonder the last No. 31 tram on Saturday night, from the Heurigen of Stammersdorf to the Schottenring connection for Schwedenplatz, should always be full of mellow, happy people.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / HIV infects 1m women this year THE HIV virus will infect more than 1m women throughout the world during 1993. By the year 2000, 13m women will have been infected and 4m of them will have died of Aids, according to estimates yesterday by Dr Michael Merson, head of the World Health Organisation's global programme on Aids. 'A decade ago women and children seemed to be on the periphery of the Aids epidemic,' Dr Merson said at an international conference in Edinburgh on HIV in children and mothers. 'Today they are at the centre of our concern.' As more women become HIV-positive, the number of infections in their babies rises. WHO says on average a third of infants born to infected mothers are infected. To date 1m babies have been infected, of whom half developed Aids. In industrialised countries, HIV transmission is still often through homosexual contact or drug abuse, but in developing countries heterosexual transmission has been predominant since the start of the Aids epidemic 10 years ago. Dr Merson said women becoming infected with HIV now outnumbered men by six to five in sub-Saharan Africa. He suggested several courses of action to protect women, including 'top priority' research to develop a safe 'vaginal virucide' - a virus-killing chemical that would prevent infection during sex.</p>

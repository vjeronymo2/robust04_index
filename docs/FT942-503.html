			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Patten faces a close HK vote The vote today in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) on Governor Chris Patten's democracy legislation looks likely to be close and both the governor and his opponents will be lobbying undecided members right up to the end. The success or failure of Mr Patten's attempt to broaden the franchise for LegCo's 1995 elections will turn on the votes of one or two of the 60 legislators. 'Whatever the outcome it is not going to be good,' said one of the governor's opponents. The principal threat to Mr Patten's legislation comes from amendments proposed by the Liberal party, a 15-member conservative grouping of mainly appointed politicians, which wants to limit the franchise to Hong Kong's traditional plutocracy. They have attracted independent members of LegCo who point to strong support among the colony's business community. Where Mr Patten wants to enfranchise Hong Kong's 2.3m working population, the Liberals want to restrict the vote to 122,000 businessmen. And where Mr Patten wants an electoral college itself composed of 346 popularly-elected officials, the Liberals favour those elected by a restricted vote. The Liberals and their supporters believe a bill amended along these lines has a better chance of surviving under Chinese rule than does Mr Patten's. This is in spite of China's threat to annul the result of the 1995 elections when it resumes sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997. 'There is no other viable choice,' says Mr Howard Young, the Liberal who will move the party's amendments today. Mr Patten's advisers tell him that support for his legislation has improved from 26 votes to nearly a majority. 'Our assessment is that we have enough votes to win,' said one official.</p>

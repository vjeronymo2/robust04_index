			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PRC's Top Diplomat in Moscow"] </F>   [Text] Qian Qichen, deputy premier of the State Council  and PRC foreign minister, arrived on an official visit to Moscow  Monday evening. The main aim of the trip is to prepare for the  Russo-Chinese summit. It is planned that PRC Chairman Jiang  Zemin will be coming to Moscow in September.    "China and Russia," Qian Qichen stated at the airport, "are  neighbors with common borders. It is quite natural for us to  maintain constant contacts. I am confident that my current  visit to Russia will be very successful."    The 66-year-old Qian Qichen, who speaks Russian, English,  and  French, is no newcomer to the Moscow dimension of PRC foreign  policy. He made his "great leap forward" into big-time politics  in 1982, when he became China's special representative at the  intergovernmental political consultations with the USSR. Five  years later, a year before being appointed foreign minister,  Qian headed the delegation at the bilateral border talks. In  the memorable year of 1989 he was already quite at home in the  top diplomat's office -- and the process of normalizing  Soviet-Chinese relations was completed with his direct  participation.    Qian Qichen has displayed exceptional qualities in the field  of diplomacy, primarily a purposefulness and an analytical way  of thinking. He is given a lot of the credit for the fact that,  following the suppression of the student demonstrations in  Beijing's Tiananmen Square in 1989 and the introduction of  anti-Chinese sanctions by the West, the PRC nonetheless did not  remain internationally isolated, and the situation regarding  China did not turn into a new "cold war."    Any high-ranking Chinese leader's personal life is reliably  hidden from prying eyes. All we know for sure is that Qian is a  man of routine -- he never gets up later than 0600 and retires  precisely at 2300. He loves going for walks.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Salutary September - Risk management / Few systems respond well when the markets do something unexpected THERE IS nothing like a good old-fashioned crisis in financial markets to test just how good your damage-limitation policies really are. That's exactly what the European currency markets got in September - and the damage-limitation in many cases was inadequate. 'It focused the mind,' says Mr Gary Southern, head of capital markets at National Westminster. 'It reinforced the old story - how good are your systems, and how do you deal with a once-every-ten-years event?' Risk-management systems, into which certain assumptions have been fed about the way financial markets behave, do not respond well when the markets do something altogether different. That explains the discomfort experienced by many derivatives houses in September. First, the volatility in currency and short-term interest rate markets shot up. Most banks' risk-management models work on a 95 per cent confidence level: that is, they are programmed to expect the sort of behaviour that is usual most of the time. Anything outside that range - the once-every-ten-years event - is not planned for. The trouble is, when that event comes, the markets can move far from their normal ranges - as happened in September, when interest rates in some European currencies soared past 100 per cent. Any confidence level is likely to prove an illusory comfort. As Ms Marion Robieson, head of product risk at Bankers Trust, in New York, said shortly afterwards: 'In practice, you almost never reach this level - except when you grossly exceed it.' Second, liquidity disappeared in many markets as the crisis broke. That meant that any institution that was hedging dynamically - that is, adjusting its cover minute-by-minute to reflect market movements - could no longer find anyone to deal with. The only alternative: sit tight and wait for normality to return, by which time the institution could be sitting either on a big profit or a big loss. The lessons of September should have filtered through to most senior bankers by now. They have certainly not been wasted on banking regulators. Speaking at a conference at the end of November, Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, general manager of the Bank for International Settlements, criticised derivatives specialists for not making clear the real risks they were running on behalf of their banks: 'They fail to make explicit to their senior management (and on occasion even themselves) that the pricing and hedging models are based on historical volatility experiences which are not necessarily safe guides for the future.' He added: 'I have the impression that some of the volatilities experienced a couple of months ago were of a scale which were not incorporated in the models, and may have therefore led to an unexpected erosion of liquidity in some of the markets' While recent events in the markets have given the risk managers something to think about, trying to assess the risks in new financial instruments remains among their biggest concerns. Breaking a new financial product down into its component parts and hedging each bit each separately (interest rate risk here, currency exposure there and volatility somewhere else) does not always work. 'The problem with new products is that they sometimes involve risks that are not traded in the market,' says Mr Brian Crowe, in charge of risk management for Chase Manhattan's fixed income and treasury operations in London. An example is the 'diff swap", which allows an institution to swap the cashflows on an asset or liability in one currency for those in another currency. Such agreements became common with the sharp divergence of US and European interest rates, which has only recently begun to be reversed. Diff swaps involve what is known as 'correlation risk': an assumption that there will be there will be a correlation between an interest rate movement and that of the currency. Such tidy relationships do not always work in practice. Correlation risk cannot be traded or hedged directly, leaving banks potentially exposed. Judging by the rumours in financial circles about the losses on diff swaps, some banks have already learnt these risks to their cost. Understanding the risks inherent in new financial instruments may be exercising the minds of many bankers at the moment, but this is by no means the direction from which the biggest losses could come. 'One ignores operational risk, legal risk and tax risk at one's peril,' says Mr Barry Hamilton, head of risk management in the treasury division of Barclays Bank. Certainly, it is from these areas that some of the biggest publicised losses in derivatives markets have come. Banks which entered swap agreements with British local authorities, for instance, discovered to their cost that the authorities had no legal power to enter such agreements - but only after several years of doing business and a judgment from the House of Lords. And Westpac, the Australian banking group, demonstrated the pitfalls that can lie in international hedging operations a month ago when it was forced to pay an unexpected tax liability and penalties of nearly Dollars 80m in the US. The bill, which forced the group to halve its dividend unexpectedly, arose from what Westpac said was the conflicting tax treatment in the US and Australia of swaps and forward contracts. The ability of settlement systems around the world to cope with large volumes of transactions - and concern about what would happen if a system collapsed - also appears high on the worry list of many risks management executives. As Mr Philip Guy, head of treasury at Hill Samuel, says: 'It's the bits at the edges that are going to catch us out. You can know about the risks, but it's difficult to set up controls to protect yourself against them.'</p>

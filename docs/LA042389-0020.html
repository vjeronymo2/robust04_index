			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: LIGHT-RAIL ROUTE  </P> <P> Pasadena's Board of Directors -- the city's name for its City Council -- has  selected the Foothill (210) Freeway as the route for an east-west light-rail  line through the city.  </P> <P> The action discards two routes that have attracted strong opposition from  property and business owners on Green Street. One of the routes would have  turned Green Street into a transit mall and the other would have put rail cars  on both Green Street and Colorado Boulevard.  </P> <P> City Director Rick Cole said choice of the Foothill Freeway corridor was  dictated by the technology being used by the Los Angeles County Transportation  Commission, which is building a light-rail line from Long Beach to Los Angeles,  with plans to extend it to Pasadena.  </P></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Thais in Manila airport project Italian-Thai Development, Thailand's largest construction company, confirmed yesterday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Philippines government for a Dollars 3bn project to turn the former US Clark airbase north of Manila into an international airport. The project would be a 'build-operate-transfer' scheme to convert the airbase into a passenger and cargo airport with an aircraft maintenance centre by the end of 1997; to develop a 'mass transit' railway system from Clark to Makati, the Metro Manila business district, and on southwards to the industrial zone south-east of the capital; and to expand and improve road links to Clark. It is not clear, however, how the plan to redevelop Clark will fit in with a similar and further advanced project for nearby Subic Bay, the former US naval base, which also has a big airport.</p>

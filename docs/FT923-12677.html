			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): How going by the book drew order from chaos - Bernice Cohen is a theorist whose main portfolio holds barely half a dozen shares, which she is prepared to trade regularly to keep up her profits / Serious Riches A BUTTERFLY flapping its wings in Tokyo could create a hurricane in Honolulu,' says Bernice Cohen. This is one of the principal claims of chaos theory, a modern discipline which attempts to explain how unpredictable events can be caused by chance circumstances, and how small changes in one area can cause massive reactions in areas which are apparently unconnected. The theory is central to Mrs Cohen's investment strategy, which over the past year has successfully found plenty of order in the chaos of the equity markets. These theories are also, indirectly, responsible for her entry into the market in the first place. Her interest in chaos theory, and related disciplines of systems analysis and human sciences, led her to write three books, The Seamless Web, The Origin of Civilisation and Global Perspectives, which set out an ambitious holistic theory of human behaviour. In 1987, just as they were about to go to press, her publisher was taken over, and the new owners decided not to print it. Nothing daunted, the Cohens remortgaged their house to fund a private publication for the three volumes. They did not make a profit. Then the economy began to turn down, and Mrs Cohen decided on the strategy she has now adopted. They sold their old house, and moved to a considerably smaller one. She then invested the profits in equities in an attempt to restore the money lost on the books in time to allow her husband to retire two years early, as he had originally intended. That means that all her investment targets are aimed at the end of next year. So she does not have the luxury to look to the long term. She also lacks large resources of capital. This dictates her strategy, she says. She trades regularly, as long-termism is not possible, and keeps diversification to a minimum. But she is not distressed unduly by this. Chaos theory suggests that, as she puts it: 'You can't have long-term forecasts on the stock market.' This can be tempered by the recurring patterns, or 'fractals' in the jargon, which can be identified; but the example of the butterfly's wings leaves her with a deep cynicism about long-term planning. And in any case: 'Diversification can be a bad idea, because it limits your profits.' She quotes Peter Lynch, former manager of Fidelity's phenomenally successful Magellan mutual fund in the US, in defence of this view. He had problems with companies which diversified into areas in which they were not experienced, and she has extended this to the management of her entire portfolio. Apart from a tax-efficient 10-year insurance plan from Skandia, which the couple bought in 1984, and which allows frequent trades between different unit trusts, the couple hold no collective investments. Hence Mrs Cohen's main portfolio, which she administers using Fidelity's share-dealing service, holds barely half a dozen shares, which she is prepared to trade regularly to keep up her profits. She finds the Fidelity service 'fabulous', as it is quick, efficient, and holds easily accessible computer records of all previous trades. She keeps a small portfolio, even though her early experiences might have pushed her in another direction. Her first equity investment, made in April 1990 following a recommendation from Barclayshare, was Polly Peck. Within months, she read a report in a Sunday paper which suggested the company was heading for trouble. She left a message with her broker's telephone answering machine, and was able to sell first thing on Monday morning. As a result, she escaped with a loss of 'only' 25 per cent. Many Polly Peck shareholders will have lost everything. Unit trusts and other collective investments seem so cosy because they minimise just this risk, but Mrs Cohen carried on investing in shares. She just decided to do her own research, rather than rely on the analysts. That has made managing her portfolio a full-time job. Her daily routine is based around the markets - it starts with the FT, which she reads in the morning. Normally several articles will be cut out and filed away. She also uses the FT to revalue her portfolio (a task performed each week) and update her charts, which are the key to playing the market. 'People who say charts are voodoo investing are denying themselves a very powerful analytical tool to help them in their investment success,' she says. Like one of the previous subjects of this feature, Mrs Cohen subscribes to Investment Research of Cambridge. When she sees a stark variation from a stock's long-term trend, the time has come to trade in it. How successful have the methods been? Last year, the largest stock in her portfolio was Glaxo, the star stock market performer of the year. By the end of the 1991, her holding in Glaxo made up 90 per cent of one of her personal equity plans, and she decided it had peaked. Thus, on Boxing Day, she left a letter with her Pep manager instructing him to sell. Glaxo, in common with the rest of the pharmaceutical sector, has gone off the boil this year, and this appears to have been the right move. Now, the Pep is split between British Airways and Clarke Foods. She describes BA as a recovery stock which is cutting its costs, and has also noted a trend for Americans to buy cyclical recovery stocks. In her main Fidelity portfolio she holds Airtours, which benefited last year from the collapse of its main competitor, ILG. She doubled her money in 'about six weeks', and then sold her holding in three lots. Each successive lot gained a higher price, as the shares were still going up. The trend continued. Eventually, Mrs Cohen decided it was worth ploughing back in to Airtours, but she chose to do so through the geared investment vehicle of a warrant. The price of the shares has doubled again since she bought the warrants, each of which allowed her to buy four shares. She has now exercised the warrants, and is sitting on a massive profit. However, she chose warrants because they were a cheap way to buy exposure to the stock, rather than for the particular speculative advantages of gearing. The rest of the Fidelity portfolio holds more BA, more Clarke Foods, Laird, Psion, and Rathbone Brothers. Mrs Cohen's diligent valuations allow her to pin-point the low point of her portfolio, which came on July 1 last year. At that point it was down 6.8 per cent on her initial capital. 'I first went into profit on October 5, which is the date I first met my husband. By March 5 this year I was up by 21 per cent, or by 31 per cent on the lowest point.' This is good going. It has even been recognised by Analyst magazine, a trade publication which recently ran a lengthy article explaining Mrs Cohen's methods to investment professionals. Unlike many private investors, Mrs Cohen has the benefit neither of great inherited wealth, nor of funds from entrepreneurship. She was born 55 years ago in Hackney, East London, and went to the local state school. It took much hard work to travel from the East End to King's College, London, where she was awarded a place to study dentistry. At that time this was a particularly difficult feat for a poor, Jewish woman. She met her husband, now a general practitioner, at King's and they now have three sons, aged 30, 26 and 24. Her career began to take its own idiosyncratic course after she left dentistry, for health reasons, in the mid-1970s. She now spent two years studying for an HND (Higher National Diploma) in business studies at a local further education college. This introduced her to archaeology and to systems analysis. From there she was launched into the 'seamless web' of human sciences, and her exploration of how humans learn by common processes, and then come to react to events in the same way. For the future, she is looking forward to the retirement her investment efforts are helping to fund. She might even try to raise the money to publish another book, which synthesises the first three and adds in her new discoveries in chaos theory. Whatever she does, she is unlikely to let either money or conventional wisdom get in her way.</p>

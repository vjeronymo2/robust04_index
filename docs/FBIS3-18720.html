			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Jach: "Descent of the Climber; Volker </F> Ruehe Is Falling Out of Favor--No More `Crown Prince' Talk; His  Courting of the SPD Is Provoking the Chancellor"]    [Text] Volker Ruehe feels as though he were in a fairy  tale--once upon a time there was a prince. He wanted to test  whether an old saying is true: insolence seldom does any good.  He recently found the answer. The latest amputation of billions  from the German military budget brought it to light. The defense  minister no longer has any allies in the party, parliamentary  group, and cabinet.    "Commander in chief" Helmut Kohl is leaving him hanging and  is hoping for a pedagogical effect. The Bundeswehr is grumbling  about a lack of guidance in the chaos of financial straits,  authorized strength, the question of compulsory military  service, and an uncertain future mission.    But Ruehe is not giving up. His next move to continue his  ambitious career would be a grand coalition under the leadership  of the SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany]. That is what he  believes--and this in an election year.    His star has fallen rapidly. Just two years ago at  Christmas time, it seemed to be rising in a big way. At the 1991  party congress of the CDU [Christian Democratic Union] in  Dresden, Kohl allowed General Secretary Ruehe to take the lead.  Over a period of several months, Ruehe had elbowed the oldtimers  of the CDU-east out of the field of vision and now in Dresden he  presented the finale of the reformer play. Kohl was pleased to  read the heading in DIE WELT: "The Second Crown Prince Is Volker  Ruehe." The Union, short on new blood, had another hope in  addition to Wolfgang Schaeuble    Three months later, he rose to the cabinet and became chief  of the Hardthoehe [Defense Ministry]. He thereby saw himself  closer to the dream that he had never denied: to become foreign  minister one day. Any other office appears merely as an  intermediate stop.    The man with the broad shoulders of a former handball player  felt as strong as an ox. Before the 1992 party congress in  Duesseldorf, he let it be known that after his election into the  circle of Kohl's four deputies, of which he was certain, he  wanted to stir up the musty party presidium. Sole ruler Kohl  pricked up his ears. Ruehe experienced the first stage of  disillusionment in Duesseldorf. He was unsuccessful.    To this day those who interpret moods argue about whether  Kohl had lowered his thumb then or whether the unyielding man  from Hamburg, whose deplorable CDU land association offers no  local power, had failed on account of his greatest weakness,  namely his unwillingness to seek allies in the party as well as  in the parliamentary group, not to mention in the public. "He  has no need to wonder why he stood alone and lost" in defending  the defense budget, say Bundestag colleagues.    Ruehe turns to defiance: "They need me more than I  need them." As a matter of fact, no party friend would dispute  the fact that he is the head of the Union for foreign policy  with no competition in sight who could be in the cabinet. This  is indispensable for a profile that Konrad Adenauer's successors  have long neglected.    But sports friend Ruehe likes to take the ball to the wrong  goal. What he sneeringly perceives to be the escapades of a  grown-up kid others see as boorishness. His colleague Klaus  Kinkel in the Foreign Ministry and his FDP [Free Democratic  Party] complained bitterly that without consulting with anyone  the defense minister stretched the limits of his office in  matters concerning NATO's strategy for the East and during his  trip to East Asia.    And Kohl did not find anything funny about it either. It is  "unwise," according to the word in the chancellorship, to  display Kinkel in this way, who is loyal to the coalition but is  not sure of himself in the FDP and in the footsteps of  Hans-Dietrich Genscher.    This is especially so when the real enemy is being  systematically protected and courted. At the military science  conference in Munich at the beginning of February, Ruehe lost  his ability to speak when SPD chancellor candidate Rudolf  Scharping knew of "no serious differences with the foreign  policy of the government."    Does this also apply to foreign operations of the  Bundeswehr,  possibly with a combat mission? Ruehe, the Union grumbles,  allowed Scharping simply to talk past the constitutional suits  of the SPD and its valid party resolutions.    There is obviously a method behind the general silence. On 1  February, Ruehe explained to the defense specialists in the  Bundestag how and where he would cut from the defense budget the  1.2 billion imposed by his colleague in the Finance Ministry,  Theo Waigel, from the CSU [Christian Social Union]. He  subsequently stated with a wink that he informed the SPD with  the same degree of detail immediately after the Union. It was  apparent in both meeting halls that "the same maps hang on the  walls" and that "the clocks also run the same."    The comparison of the clocks had its effect: the  chancellorship had had enough. In Kohl's eyes, Ruehe's  nonchalant courting of the election campaign opponent SPD must  nearly border on treason. Ruehe puts on his poker face and lets  it be known that Kohl and Waigel had broken their past guarantee  to him and the defense budget: "That was an operation on a  living person, almost without anesthesia." Party circles feel  reminded of father-son novels, in which defiance and anger turn  into family crises.    Old sins are doubly burdensome. Kohl has not forgotten that  right after taking office Ruehe wanted to shoot down the  European Fighter-90 and the German-French helicopter projects.  And not only because it was the first kiss for the SPD. More  important was the fact that the brash secondary foreign-policy  man from the Hardthoehe had caused the chancellor unplanned  vexation with England's Prime Minister John Major and French  President Francois Mitterrand.    There is already a rumor circulating that Kohl will punish  Ruehe if the coalition survives the Bundestag election. On the  other hand: Who else could he have for the Hardthoehe? The  Christian strategists know that the Union cannot afford to have  both the Foreign and Defense Ministries in the hands of the FDP.    Ruehe has little latitude. The desired Foreign  Ministry plus office of vice chancellor might be possible only  if the SPD were the strongest force in a grand coalition. But  Ruehe makes himself "culpable" if during the election campaign  he speculates on a slump of his own party. After a marriage of  elephants with reversed proportion of forces, Ruehe must expect  the tough competition of Florian Gerster, the SPD's candidate  for the office from Mainz. The Foreign Ministry would go to the  SPD in any case.    And if the CDU has to abdicate? On the bench of the  opposition, Ruehe would probably find himself set back 12 years:  vice chairman of the parliamentary group for foreign policy. It  would be out of the question that he could supersede Wolfgang  Schaeuble in the chairmanship. This is certainly so for an  individual fighter from Hamburg.    Ruehe is steeling himself with stoic calm, listlessness, and  gloating sarcasm: "I have time, I can wait. I am taking it all  calmly." That is supposed to mean that at the age of 51 he sees  his time as still ahead of him.    Well-intentioned party friends are dampening such insolence:  he should guard dissipating himself. The long-delayed change of  generations in the CDU, especially under the conditions of being  in the opposition, will "sweep over quite a few people in the  middle years." In the end, Ruehe will have had his time and  wasted it.    And his little prince's crown as well, just as in the fairy  tale.</p>

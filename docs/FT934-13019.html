			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Institutions concerned about trust expenses INSTITUTIONS are worried about escalating costs in the investment trust industry, driven by managers' eagerness to attract private investors. NatWest Securities, which surveyed 23 institutional investors for its 1993-94 investment trust annual, discovered a massive increase in expenses over the past eight years. Of the 31 trusts in the FT Mid-Cap index, all have doubled their expenses over that period and 12 have quadrupled their expenses. The RPI has risen by only 60 per cent. One investor surveyed said: 'I would like to see more quality control on new issues, especially on expenses which have risen too fast. The industry must demonstrate quality with low costs. Management fees of 1.5 per cent or more will damage the industry.' One reason for the increase in expenses has been the cost of running savings schemes and personal equity plans. Since these have helped to narrow the discount on which shares trade, institutions may have seen the benefit. However, NatWest has found no correlation between the extent of growth in expenses and the narrowing of the discount. NatWest said that institutions were also concerned about 'cosy' boards, too many new issues and a lack of consultation about important corporate charges. Nevertheless, 12 out of the 23 institutions surveyed remain net buyers of investment trust shares. They usually hold generalist trusts, as a means of buying assets at a discount, and specialist trusts, as a means of subcontracting management in areas where they lack expertise.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Today's news conference in the  Seimas held by Seimas Deputy Chairman Aloyzas Sakalas focused  its attention on foreign policy and international relations.  [passage omitted] I asked him to describe our foreign policy    [Begin Sakalas recording] Lithuania's foreign policy must be  based on some main principles. There must be a foreign policy  concept containing some main principles. [passage omitted]  Unfortunately, I do not at present see such a concept in our  foreign policy based on principles. These principles should be  as follows: Relations with the closest neighbors, relations with  other countries.    In relations with the closest neighbors I would put in the  first place relations with Russia. Russia, as is known, has  taken over the rights of the former USSR, it has only taken over  the rights of the former USSR. If only rights, then why not  responsibilities, too? And if responsibilities, then such  issues as compensation and others may be discussed. If it has  taken over rights only, then on what basis? So much about  relations with Russia. In addition, we must evaluate the  Russian military doctrine that has been published and is well  known. We must respond correspondingly to this doctrine. There  has been no such response so far. [passage omitted] We must  evaluate this doctrine. [passage omitted] We must support all  democratic forces in Russia and evaluate statements by the  Liberal Democratic Party. We have not done this so far.    When we have all such criteria, our evaluations, we will be  able to conduct our diplomacy in relations with Russia.    As for other neighbors, for instance Poland, are concerned,  we have no treaty with Poland, we have no treaty with Belarus.  [passage omitted] We must evaluate on what basis we are prepared  to sign a treaty with Belarus. [passage omitted] The trouble  with Poland is the Zeligowski action and the Suwalki Treaty that  was broken, and it seems to me that we must say whether we  adhere or refuse [as heard], but there must be a decision, and  not like it is now -- diplomats travel to Poland and back and  there is no order. Either we firmly say that until this is  evaluated we do not intend to sign the treaty, or give up some  things and sign a treaty that does not mention history and deals  with the present only.    As far as Germany is concerned, there are many people who  have suffered from the Nazis, were deported to Germany and were  lost there. The Bundestag is examining the issues of  compensation and we should say something and not wait for  something to happen.    And lastly, Latvia and Estonia. Either we integrate in a  common economic zone with some common political obligations, or  each country remains separately. We must think about this.  [passage omitted]    We must not find ourselves under the influence of a single  foreign state. [passage omitted] It must not happen that 60  percent our economy is linked with some specific country that  can later dictate its economic and political conditions.  [passage omitted]    I do not think our statement on joining NATO will result in  a  positive decision. I think that there has to be an additional  incentive for the West to think, as soon as possible, about the  possibility of admitting us to NATO, but not yet as the solution  of such possibility.

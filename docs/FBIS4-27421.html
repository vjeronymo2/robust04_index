			<p>BFN     [Text] In connection with the DPRK's (North Korea)  suspected development of nuclear devices, the Japanese  Government is again distressed by the deadlock in negotiations  between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) on the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon  experimental nuclear reactor, because it has been counting on a  better atmosphere for dialogue after the third round of  high-level talks between the United States and North Korea was  scheduled to be held in June.    Under the circumstances, Japan will have to continue to take  a two-pronged stand for some time by "closely watching future  developments while studying various necessary measures to  prepare for a contingency" (according to a top Foreign Ministry  official).    In the past few days, senior Foreign Ministry officials have  been emphasizing the "dominant trend of dialogue" to leaders of  the ruling and opposition parties, saying: "Things are moving  toward a solution right now. There should be no  misunderstanding concerning this." The ministry is concerned  that if "frightening discussions" on questions such as sanctions  or legislation to deal with an emergency come to the fore, this  may provoke not only the DPRK but also the ROK and the United  States.    The working-level meeting between Japan, the United States,  and South Korea in New York on 24 May which agreed on continuing  the policy of dialogue and coordination between the three  nations if sanctions are imposed on the DPRK was a cooperative  gesture in line with the U.S. policy of continuing the dialogue.    However, after the North Korea-IAEA talks broke down, a  pessimistic view is again gaining ground inside the government.  Some say: "We have been betrayed by North Korea so many times.  This time, although we have not been optimistic, we were hoping  for at least some progress" (according to a Foreign Ministry  source).    Some government officials now take the view that the  high-level talks between the United States and North Korea will  inevitably have to be postponed. Even in the United States, the  prevailing view is now in favor of sanctions, claiming, "If  U.S.-North Korean talks are held without verifying the existence  of nuclear arms in the DPRK, this will just be falling into the  North Korean trap."    If no improvement is seen in this situation, UN economic  sanctions will inevitably become the focal issue. The Japanese  Government may also be forced to make a major decision.    Even if the third round of high-level U.S.-DPRK talks are  held as scheduled, it is entirely possible that North Korea will  continue to play the nuclear card in the future. It is believed  that "sooner or later, there will have to be a solution to the  basic issue of whether inspections will be permitted at two  facilities, which were not opened to IAEA and are highly  suspected of holding nuclear devices," according to a Foreign  Ministry source. Days of anxiety are expected to continue for  the Japanese Government.</p>

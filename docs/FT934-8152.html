			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Closer tutoring's edge CLOSE PERSONAL attention seems to be one of the keys to higher exam results. That is certainly the finding at Charters School in Berkshire, the third-placed local authority-maintained comprehensive at A-level according to a recent FT survey. This year 61 per cent of its pupils managed five GCSEs or more at grades A to C - comfortably ahead of the national average. But the school's head, Mr Barrie Mitchell, remains deeply sceptical of league tables and has concentrated instead on introducing the National Record of Achievement. This presents pupils with folders in which all their achievements in both extra-curricular as well as academic fields can be assessed. Keeping the folders up to date requires teachers meeting pupils individually and regularly. It also helps ensure that pupils are kept on track. St Paul's school in Barnes, west London, the top A-level school in the FT survey, has a similar approach to ensuring that every pupil is known very well by at least one tutor. Tutor groups include equal numbers from each year of the school. Every boy at the school will keep the same tutor throughout his career. With that kind of attention, St Paul's says, its teachers can build an almost unerring ability to spot boys that have the most potential, and those that need the most help. A study looking at generally more deprived schools in inner London boroughs, produced for the Association of Metropolitan Authorities by London's Institute of Education made a similar finding, suggests that factors such as these must make a difference. Once factors such as background, school selection policy and gender had been taken into account, a variation between the best and worst pupils from an average 51.6 GCSE points to 12.4 points (where an A is seven points and a G is worth one) was transformed into a variation of from 9.8 points above average to 8.2 points below. The improvement shows the importance of social factors, but also suggests that some schools were able to deliver the equivalent of two more GCSE grade As for their pupils than others, even when other factors were held equal.</p>

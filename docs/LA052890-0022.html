			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADOPT-A-GRAVE REVIVES TWO CEMETERIES  </P> <P> People all over America adopt children. In this East Bay city, they adopt  graves.  </P> <P> Not just any grave, but final resting spots in the community's two historic  cemeteries -- Alhambra, dating back to 1851, and St. Catherine's, established  in 1870.  </P> <P> The "Adopt-A-Grave" program is the linchpin of a volunteer effort that has led  to the restoration of the cemeteries. And hundreds of people in Martinez, as  well as various civic organizations, have responded to it.  </P> <P> "Adoption" papers for each grave come with a biography of the person buried in  it. More importantly, with the adoption comes responsibility.  </P> <P> A person or group adopting a grave promises to care for the burial site. As a  result, the nearly 4,000 graves in the two cemeteries are immaculate. Instead  of weeds, there are flowers. Tombstones are upright and in place. And burials,  which once had ceased at both cemeteries, have resumed.  </P> <P> Indeed, the program not only has transformed the two cemeteries into sources of  community pride, it has led to major celebrations on Memorial Day and Veterans  Day. This year, all of the city's veterans' organizations are to gather for a  special service at Alhambra Cemetery.  </P> <P> It hasn't always been like that.  </P> <P> Ten years ago, the two cemeteries were choked with underbrush and high weeds.  Tombstones had been toppled by vandals and were hidden from sight.  </P> <P> At St. Catherine's, a retaining wall had given way, loosing the dirt next to it  and exposing several caskets and human remains. "It was horrible," recalled  Charlene Perry, 67, the city's historian.  </P> <P> Funerals were no longer conducted in either cemetery because of the sad state  of affairs. And as the cemeteries sat neglected, their future appeared in  doubt.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church, which owns St. Catherine's Cemetery, was preparing to  remove the tombstones, relocate the graves and sell the land to developers.  </P> <P> Across the street, a similar fate apparently awaited Alhambra Cemetery. Members  of the association that owned it had died and no one had paid taxes on the land  for years. The state scheduled a tax sale to dispose of the property; the  likely buyers were developers who planned to build expensive homes and  condominiums on the choice graveyard property high on a hill overlooking scenic  Carquinez Strait and Suisun Bay.  </P> <P> That's when Perry and several other Martinez residents went into action.  </P> <P> "Some of us got to thinking, 'Hey, wait a minute. This is sacred ground, the  final resting place for nearly 4,000 men, women and children who spent their  lives in Martinez,' " the historian said.  </P> <P> It was Perry who came up with the idea for the Adopt-A-Grave Program. The  Catholic Church and the Martinez City Council, which assumed ownership of  Alhambra Cemetery and paid its delinquent taxes, agreed to the proposal.  </P> <P> The council also created a cemetery commission and named Perry and four others  as members to serve as caretakers for the burial site, as well as coordinate  efforts to restore St. Catherine's.  </P> <P> Records of burials at both cemeteries were lost. Cemetery commissioner Phyllis  Wainwright, 73, spent a year copying names from each tombstone in Alhambra  Cemetery, alphabetizing them, noting grave locations and transcribing them to a  directory at the cemetery entrance. Cemetery commissioner Margaret Silva, 62,  spent a year doing the same at St. Catherine's.  </P> <P> The cemetery commissioners then spent months scouring history books, city and  county records, newspapers and interviewing local residents to develop  biographies on all the deceased for adoption papers.  </P> <P> When the Adopt-A-Grave Program was announced, the cemetery commission was  swamped with volunteers. "We had some weird calls, too," recalled Perry. "Like  how do you adopt a dead person?"  </P> <P> In a gratifying development for the commissioners, many of those participating  in the program are youngsters. "Getting the children involved is very  important. We wanted them to have a feeling for history, to have a reverence  for what has gone on before," said Wainwright, lifelong Martinez resident and  retired teacher.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church has spent money upgrading retaining walls, cemetery  walkways and roads in St. Catherine's Cemetery. The City Council, meanwhile,  now includes the Alhambra Cemetery in its annual budget for the same type of  work.  </P> <P> Both cemeteries contain the remains of several well-known California pioneers.  Dancer Carolyn (Papinta) Holpin, who lived from 1867-1907 and in her heyday was  the toast of European capitals, is buried in Alhambra Cemetery. She was called  the "Flame Dancer," a reference to the erotic dance she performed with 33 yards  of red chiffon.  </P> <P> Also buried in Alhambra is Joseph Reddeford Walker, who in 1833 became the  first non-Indian to see Yosemite Valley. He was characterized by author  Washington Irving as "one of the bravest and most skillful of mountain men."  </P></p>

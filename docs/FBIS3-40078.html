			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Excerpts from article by Lu Keng (7120 6972): "General </F> Chiang Wei-kuo Discusses Bicoastal Relations"]    [Text] General Chiang Wei-kuo was on his way to the United  States to visit the 92-year-old Madame Chiang Kai-shek when he  made a short three-day stop in San Francisco on 1-4 October.  [passage omitted]    During those three days, he attended two public meetings  and was specially interviewed by reporters on two occasions.  During the interviews, he maintained his characteristic  style--very open and sincere. What was different this time from  past encounters was his carefully crafted comments--no speech  that would hurt others, and few or no argumentative remarks.  Even so, he still met some difficulties.    The "Open Window Discussion" sponsored by the Overseas  Chinese Hsing-Chung Hui of San Francisco was attended by more  than 400 persons. When Wei-kuo arrived at the door, someone  stealthily requested him to "talk a little more about Taiwan."  As 90 percent of those attending the meeting were from Taiwan,  most being retired officials and their families, their concern  for Taiwan was quite understandable. However, in his talk,  Wei-kuo not only did not say much about Taiwan, he said very  little. He set aside the political strife on the island, and  focused instead on bicoastal relations, a topic of much greater  import--"divided for too long, we must come together; together  for too long, separation must occur."    Someone asked: "There is a certain opinion afoot in Taiwan  at present which says there is `no hurry for unification, nor  any hurry for independence.' This seems to be quite a fair  remark. We understand there is no urgency for unification, but  does no urgency for independence mean a slow evolvement toward  independence?"    Wei-kuo replied: "Of course unification is not easy, and  it needs to evolve slowly. But it should not be slower than  independence." This answer again demonstrated his witty use of  language which won warm applause from the audience.    General Chiang Wei-kuo's widely acclaimed book  "Reunification of China," published in Chinese and English, has  received the attention of authorities on both sides of the  Taiwan Straits. In his book, he proposed three common  denominators or points of understanding:    1) We are all Chinese, so we only need one China. Since we  need only one China, all who do not admit themselves as being  Chinese, and want to partition up our territorial sovereignty  become our common enemy.    2) All Chinese must be able to have a good life, or at  least, the opportunity to have a good life. All thinking,  theories, systems, and laws that prevent people from enjoying a  good life must be overthrown (by us).    3) We must respond to an ideal new China, one that will be  respected by the international community. Toward this end, we  must cooperate to become strong, to be able to carry out our  international obligations.    When HSIN-TAO JIH-PAO reporter Li Ge [6849 2047]  interviewed Chiang Wei-kuo, I was only a bystander who noted  Wei-kuo's careful answers. Li Ge used the Palestinian-Israeli  peace talks as an example and asked: "Isn't Taiwan's refusal to  discuss matters an unreasonable act?" Wei-kuo's reply was: "I  had proposed three common points of understanding. If we truly  have these three common denominators, discussions will not be  necessary, for all we need will be working units to carry out  the work. On the other hand, if there are no common  understandings, what is there to discuss? As for the three  denominators that I have proposed, the other side has recognized  all of them, but I have not heard a sound from the Taiwan side."    That very clearly illustrates the absence of a common  understanding between both sides of the Taiwan Straits. The  Kuomintang authorities have shown no response whatsoever to  Wei-kuo's three common points of understanding.    However, CH'IAO PAO, an overseas Chinese newspaper with a  Communist Chinese background published in the United States,  reported on the interview with General Chiang in its 4 October  issue. It had questioned the points of common understanding  between both sides of the Taiwan Straits; but at the same time,  Wei-kuo expressed approval of Deng Xiaoping's "Socialism With  Chinese Characteristics," because it agreed with one of Sun  Yat-sen's "Three Principles of the People," the one promoting  the people's livelihood. This view evoked crticism by certain  quarters on Taiwan. I surmise that the CH'IAO PAO reporter  mis-stated what he had heard to create this problem for Wei-kuo.  For a similar problem can be answered in two ways after a lapse  of a day.    In San Francisco, whether in public or in individual  interviews, people have asked: "What are your views, General  Chiang, on the CPC's (Communist Party of China) refusal to  abandon force with respect to Taiwan?" His answer has been: "The  CPC considers itself the central government and will not agree  to any territory being separated from it, for the function and  responsibility of the central government is to preserve the  sovereignty of its territorial integrity. Under this premise,  how can it say it will abandon force? Mainland China has four  approaches to this unification problem: political, economic,  psychological, and military. When the first three approaches are  not effective, can you allow that it will not use the military  one? These four approaches make a complete whole. To begin with  the military approach is not appropriate. It does not matter who  wins or loses, it is not good for the country."    In discussing the use of military force, it is only  natural that Wei-kuo understands the brutality and danger of  war. This is fully reflected in his interview with Li Ge. Even  this writer who has no military experience fully appreciates  this.    The young reporter Li Ge is a product of Beijing's  Institute of Journalism. His father, now retired, had  participated in many battles against the Nationalists in the  Shenyang Liaoning region in earlier days. When he heard that his  son was going to interview General Chiang Wei-kuo, he asked him  to extend his greetings and bring up a question that many people  are concerned about--will his generation ever see the day of  unification?    Wei-kuo replied: "Absolutely possible, for everything is  in an idea. Conflict or war appears suddenly. So does peace. We  just wish that the politicians are smart enough not to make  those of us in the military to suffer some more. We are some of  the best citizens. The selfishness of the politicians creates  difficulties for the military who have no choice. There are none  who love peace, await the nation's dignity, and care about the  well-being of the people more than those in military service. A  government that can accomplish this is a good government,  regardless of its color." [passage omitted]</p>

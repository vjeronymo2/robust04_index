			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / BR talks fail to avert rail strike BRITISH RAIL chairman Sir Bob Reid last night warned railway unions that more strikes would result in job cuts and lost business. But his talks with union leaders failed to lift the threat of another 24-hour strike on Friday, although Sir Bob invited the union officials to return for discussions today. The BR chairman told the RMT, the main rail union, that it risked causing severe damage to the industry if it went ahead with the stoppage. He told RMT general secretary Mr Jimmy Knapp: 'Jobs are threatened if there are further strikes. Strikes damage our reputation at a time when we are trying to get freight off the road and on to the rail.' Sir Bob spent nearly three hours with union leaders trying to reassure them that their anxieties about possible future compulsory redundancies were groundless. 'We made it clear there can be no question of jobs for life but also there will be no compulsory redundancies as a result of contracting out work,' he said. He added that he had explained to officials from the RMT and the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU) - who have members in the rail repair yards - the proposed timetable for rail privatisation and how it would work. Mr Knapp said Friday's strike was still going ahead as planned and that much more work needed to be done on the issues in contention. Even if the RMT and the CSEU accepted BR's assurances this would not end the prospect of a shutdown of the whole network on Friday. Aslef, the drivers' union, also plans to strike then over a separate issue. It wants BR to guarantee existing national agreements over the deployment of drivers in the transition to privatisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The independent MEDIAFAX publication reported today  that in December of last year four foreign nongovernmental  organizations [NGO's] in Mozambique protested to UN Special  Representative Aldo Ajello that UN Operations in Mozambique  [Unomoz] personnel were allegedly involved in child prostitution  in this country.    MEDIAFAX reports that the four NGO's come from the United  Kingdom, the United States, Denmark, and Norway. Those  organizations believe they have good reason to believe that some  Unomoz soldiers are sexually exploiting children. Those  organizations also noted that if such behavior is proven, then  it is in violation of Article 34 of the Child Rights Convention.    Those organizations have called on UN Special Representative  Aldo Ajello to take measures to investigate the matter and act  to protect the children.</p>

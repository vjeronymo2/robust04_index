			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / People: Low-profile choice for WDA The long-awaited successor to Gwyn Jones as chairman of the Welsh Development Agency, probably the most public of public posts in Wales after that of the Welsh secretary himself, was announced yesterday as David Rowe-Beddoe, a 55-year-old businessman. Rowe-Beddoe, a surprise choice who passes the first test by being born in Cardiff, was for five years, until 1976, chief executive of Thomas de la Rue, the security printing company. He has been a president of Revlon and for 10 years was a board member of Morgan Stanley GFTA. At present he is chairman of Cavendish Services, a financial and corporate consultancy which is based in Monaco. Of his new post, he said yesterday: 'It is very clear to me that the overriding priority is the creation of jobs, and of quality jobs.' While he admired the WDA's success in attracting inward investment, he envisaged an increasing emphasis on business services and help for indigenous businesses. He will take over the three-year post, which pays Pounds 43,455 for two-and-a-half days a week, on July 1. Rowe-Beddoe, a graduate of Cambridge and Harvard School of Business Administration, has Welsh credentials which include involvement in Wales 2010, an upbeat report on the country's prospects recently published by the Institute of Welsh Affairs, and vice-presidency of Crawshays Welsh RFC. He also has a house near Monmouth. The choice of Rowe-Beddoe, who hitherto has had a low public profile, is likely to be seen as a further move away from the era of Peter Walker, who when Welsh secretary appointed the entrepreneurial Jones as chairman in 1988. Jones, still only in his mid-40s, had wanted to resign in the new year to pursue business interests, but was persuaded to continue until now because the choice of a successor proved so difficult. The post had been advertised and is believed to have attracted over 70 applicants but David Hunt, then Welsh secretary, apparently thought none of them was the right calibre to run an agency with an annual budget of Pounds 171m. Speculation then began to run rife with such names as Sir John Harvey-Jones and Neil Kinnock being put in the frame. The WDA, which was set up in 1976, has enviable success in attracting inward investment and in promoting public and private joint ventures, but it has also drawn criticism for previous lax internal management. One of the new chairman's first hot potatoes will be responding to what is expected to be a withering report due to be published soon by the Commons public accounts committee. Rowe-Beddoe, at least, will be able to say that that is all water under the Severn bridge.</p>

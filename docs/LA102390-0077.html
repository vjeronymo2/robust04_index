			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: BOARD TO CONSIDER PAY RAISES FOR 50  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors will consider raising salaries for about 50  county employees today in a move that would cost about $350,000 a year.  </P> <P> County Personnel Director Ronald Komers said he is recommending salary  adjustments in a variety of departments.  </P> <P> In some cases it is to recognize the specialized nature of positions, he said,  and for others it's to remain competitive to attract job applicants or to  change job classifications.  </P> <P> He said nearly all the positions are covered by the Public Employees Assn. of  Ventura County, and the increases were budgeted.  </P> <P> The biggest increases will go to pharmacy and radiology employees, according to  a report Komers prepared. The increases for both departments total $189,000  annually with benefits and affect 26 employees.  </P> <P> The county has difficulty recruiting pharmacists because of a general shortage  and because county pharmacists earn 30% less than those at other local  hospitals, according to Komers' report. The proposed increases are as high as  19.5% for some pharmacists.  </P> <P> The radiology department also has had numerous vacancies despite extensive  advertising, the report says. The senior X-ray technician's position pays 20%  below what other area hospitals pay. Under the proposed increases, salaries for  some radiology positions will jump as much as 18.5 %.

That's all well and good but you need  to tell the employer."  </P> <P> Dorsett is the league's No. 2 all-time rusher with 12,739 yards. He sat out  last season after undergoing knee surgery as a result of a training camp  injury. It was his second season in Denver after 11 years with the Dallas  Cowboys.  </P></p>

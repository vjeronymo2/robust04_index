			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / International Company News: Elsevier confident on prospects ELSEVIER, the Dutch publisher, reported a 20 per cent rise in 1991 trading profit and forecast a rise in both net and operating profit in 1992, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Trading profit, which does not include contributions from associated companies or interest income, totalled Fl 466.3m (Dollars 249.3m), compared with Fl 387.5m in 1990. Net profit fell to Fl 384.8m from Fl 506.9m the year before, when results were swollen by extraordinary gains from Elsevier's sale of a 33 per cent stake in fellow Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer. Operating profit, as earlier predicted by the company, was up 11 per cent at Fl 380.3m. Net turnover rose by 10.6 per cent to Fl 2.27bn. Elsevier said it would raise its 1991 dividend by Fl 0.15 to Fl 2.25. It forecast that net profit will grow by a minimum of 25 per cent in 1992. The company said its purchase in 1991 of Pergamon, the UK-based scientific publisher, from Maxwell Communication Corp was a significant factor behind last year's profit gains. Another major event in 1991 was the disposal of its minority cross-shareholding with Pearson, the UK publishing and banking group which owns the Financial Times.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> IN A HOLDING PATTERN;  </P> <P> COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER CANYON QUARTERBACK KEN SOLLOM TOOK HIS GOLDEN ARM TO  MICHIGAN WITH HEROIC ASPIRATIONS, BUT THUS FAR HE HAS HAD TO SETTLE FOR AN  ANONYMOUS ROLE ON SPECIAL TEAMS.  </P> <P> Anyone who watched quarterback Ken Sollom buzz footballs onto the chests of his  receivers three years ago at Canyon High will not be surprised to learn that on  New Year's Day he will don his University of Michigan uniform and march into  the Rose Bowl prepared to do battle with USC.  </P> <P> As a senior in high school, Sollom passed for 2,720 yards and 28 touchdowns. At  6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, he is now considerably bigger and stronger than during  those prep days when his coach said simply, "Ken Sollom has a golden arm."  </P> <P> Days before the Rose Bowl, Sollom must be a proud young man.  </P> <P> "Sometimes, I'm embarrassed," Sollom said.  </P> <P> He is somewhat sheepish because he no longer stands tall in the pocket and  sends laser beams downfield with that golden arm. As a matter of fact, his new  job in football doesn't involve throwing anything. Nor, come to think of it,  does it even allow him to stand.  </P> <P> In his new role, Sollom lines up behind the center, one knee planted on the  turf. He takes the snap, just like in the old days, but now he simply takes the  ball, delicately places one end of it into the grass and puts his right index  finger atop the other end to prevent the ball from toppling.  </P> <P> Then, teammate J. D. Carlson takes a few quick steps and crushes the ball with  his foot, missing the fingers at the end of the golden arm by scant  millimeters.  </P> <P> "When I went to Michigan, I always figured I'd return to play in the Rose  Bowl," said Sollom, who will be making his second appearance for Michigan in  that postseason game. "But somehow I always figured it would be as their  quarterback, not as the holder for the placekicker."  </P> <P> The holder for the kicker? Sollom? The same kid who was, after his brilliant  senior season in high school, named Golden League Player of the Year and who  attracted waves of scholarship offers from across the nation? The same kid who  opened his final high school season by passing for 708 yards and 10 touchdowns  in just three games?  </P> <P> "It's the same guy," said Canyon Coach Harry Welch, who visited Sollom during a  Michigan practice in Newport Beach earlier this week. "I watched four very good  quarterbacks throwing for Michigan at practice, and none of them threw the ball  as well as I know Kenny Sollom can. He is a beautiful passing machine."  </P> <P> Who is, however, in cold storage.  </P> <P> Sollom, who was wooed heavily by, among others, USC, UCLA, Stanford, Arizona  and BYU, redshirted as a freshman. Last year he played at quarterback for  Michigan for brief stints in two games. He completed two of three passes for 13  yards but played in every game as the holder.  </P> <P> This year, his passing statistics improved dramatically. He completed two of  three passes for 28 yards. And he was the holder in nearly every kicking  situation.  </P> <P> He has two years of eligibility remaining, but there are indications that his  stock as a Michigan quarterback may never rise much above its current value.  </P> <P> The reasons are threefold: Elvis Grbac, Wilbur Odom and Doug Musgrave, fellow  underclassmen quarterbacks who, in the eyes of the Michigan coaching staff, are  at least the equal of Sollom.  </P> <P> Grbac, a freshman from Ohio, has vaulted to the head of the list of likely  successors to senior Michael Taylor. When Taylor went out with a back injury  after a season-opening loss to Notre Dame, the 6-foot-5 Grbac stepped in and  led the Wolverines to four consecutive impressive wins.  </P> <P> Grbac is considered to have a virtual lock on Michigan's quarterback job for  the next three years. And close behind him could be Musgrave, a freshman from  Colorado who earned consensus All-American honors as a senior, passing for  3,147 yards and 44 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Sollom might be left to fight it out with Odom -- who will be a senior next  year -- for the third-string job.  </P> <P> Sollom is confident that he can compete with his three rivals.  </P> <P> "After this year, with Taylor gone, there will be a lot of competition," he  said. "I figure I'll be right in it."  </P> <P> But the driving ambition to be a roaring collegiate success that he had when he  left high school seems to have waned.  </P> <P> "If I never become the starting quarterback, it will be a disappointment to  me," he said. "But I came here because of the college, too, not just for  football. I'm on my way to getting a communications degree from the University  of Michigan and that's very important to me now. When I left high school, I  wasn't thinking about a degree. But now, I see the possibilities."  </P> <P> And so the best quarterback Canyon High has ever seen, and one of the best prep  quarterbacks California has ever seen, may simply fade away into the real world  with a communications degree in a few years.  </P> <P> But in the change, his former coach sees a shining example of perspective.  </P> <P> "Kenny could transfer," Welch said. "A lot of schools would kill to get this  kid. He could whine about what's happened to him at Michigan and just pack up  and go looking for a different football team. But I'm glad he has decided to  stay.  </P> <P> "So often today we criticize athletes for ignoring their education, and now it  seems people are putting pressure on Kenny to consider just the opposite. He  knows he could transfer and play football, but he has said no. He has made a  commitment to the University of Michigan and he's going to honor it. I admire  that. It's a breath of fresh air."  </P> <P> And in a collegiate career that has given Sollom just six opportunities to  crank up the golden arm, he says he still has found highlights. One came early  this year against UCLA when Carlson, the Michigan kicker, banged a 24-yard  field goal with one second remaining in the game at the Rose Bowl to give  Michigan a 24-23 victory.  </P> <P> "I saw a picture of J. D. kicking that field goal," Sollom said. "The ball was  just leaving the ground. And I said, 'Hey, that's my finger.' "  </P> <P> The young man with the rocket arm smiled. He knows he is capable of more. He  knows what strength lies coiled in that right arm. And he also knows he might  never get a chance to unleash it again.  </P> <P> But even though he said he has accepted that possibility, he sometimes wonders  what went wrong.  </P> <P> "In two years, I might be the starting quarterback in another Rose Bowl," he  said. "Maybe. Or maybe not. I know now that to get to that point, you have to  be a lot of things, and one of them is lucky.  </P> <P> "A few years ago I had it all planned: Go to Michigan, star in a few Rose  Bowls, get drafted by the NFL. I really thought it would be easy. I really  figured it would just go like that if I was willing to put in the effort. Well,  I put in the effort. And now, I'm the holder for the placekicker. And I'm  disappointed."  </P> <P> Some of his biggest supporters from his glory days, however, have not lost any  of their admiration for him.  </P> <P> "This kid could throw the football like no high school quarterback I have ever  seen," Welch said. "He was just so gifted. And because of that gift, he got a  chance to obtain a great education and to meet some really great people.  </P> <P> "If he never again becomes a star in football, it was still that golden arm  that has allowed him to chase a fuller and richer life. And he has honored his  commitment to that. For that, I am exceptionally proud of Ken Sollom."  </P></p>

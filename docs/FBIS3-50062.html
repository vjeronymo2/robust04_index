In  December 1993, the Slovak Statistical Office put this question  to 1,272 respondents representative of the adult population of  Slovakia in terms of sex, age, nationality, education, size of  community of residence, and geographical part of Slovakia.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Respondent's expectations             |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Have mostly been fulfilled            |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Some have been fulfilled, some not    |22                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Have mostly not been fulfilled        |44                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Did not have any expectations         |26                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Do not know                           |4                                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A look at the structure of the sample of respondents  regarding replies to individual questions shows that the most  satisfied with developments in our society after 17 November  1989 (that is, those whose expectations have been fulfilled for  the most part, or at least partially) are those sympathetic  toward the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (45 percent) and  respondents in the 40-49 (32 percent) and 18-24 (31 percent) age  groups. The relatively most disappointed with the post-November  developments are citizens who are currently unemployed (61  percent) and those who do not sympathize with any political  party or movement (51 percent).    No expectations regarding the development of society were  harbored, in particular, by citizens showing sympathy for the  Party of the Democratic Left (32 percent).    The respondents were asked, furthermore, to reply  spontaneously -- that is, without any possible replies being  indicated -- in what specifically their expectations have or  have not been fulfilled. Among the most frequently cited  positive replies were the feeling of greater freedom and  democracy in general (8 percent), as well as the freedom of  movement and the possibility to travel. The freedom of  enterprise and the possibility of self-realization were cited by  7 percent of respondents. Negative replies were more frequent,  particularly those referring to the lack of an improvement in  the living standards of the population (30 percent), in the  economy (12 percent), in the sphere of political life (10  percent), and in unemployment (10 percent). A general turn for  the worse was noted by 16 percent of respondents.    In view of the fact that the smallest number of fulfilled  expectations was in the sphere of the economy and living  standards, citizens were asked to deliver their opinion on tasks  in the economic sphere. In the respondents' view, in the  interest of economic recovery the government should, above all,  draft a comprehensive concept of economic policy (38 percent),  support small and medium-sized businessmen by means of tax cuts  (24 percent), extend financial benefits to employers creating  new jobs (23 percent), support the development of  future-oriented branches (20 percent), support the creation of  socially useful jobs and the organization of work beneficial to  the public (17 percent), and create suitable conditions for the  influx of foreign capital (16 percent).    The completion of large-scale privatization figured last  among the required measures, with 9 percent of respondents  noting the necessity of completing it by means of the coupon  method and 6 percent by means of standard privatization methods.</p>

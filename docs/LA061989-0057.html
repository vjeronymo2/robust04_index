			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL MEETINGS;  </P> <P> SOVIET GOALIE TRETIAK VOTED INTO HALL OF FAME  </P> <P> Goaltender Vladislav Tretiak became the first Soviet player voted into the  National Hockey League Hall of Fame Sunday in a selection committee meeting  described as "one of the most spirited" ever.  </P> <P> Also voted in was center Darryl Sittler, who played more than 12 seasons for  the Toronto Maple Leafs, two with the Philadelphia Flyers and a final season  with the Detroit Red Wings.  </P> <P> But the committee failed to make an allowed third selection, passing on Bill  Barber, Ted Green, Steve Shutt and Ed Westphal. It was the first time since  1977 that the committee had not agreed upon three inductees in the regular  player category.  </P> <P> Herbie Lewis was also voted in, as a veteran player.  </P> <P> Although there was some anticipation that the selection of a Soviet would be  met with animosity, especially in light of some of the players passed over,  there was no second-guessing on Sittler.  </P> <P> Sittler was out for a Father's Day game of tennis with his son in Amherst,  N.Y., when his wife was sent to give him the news of his selection and get him  to a telephone for a conference call to the NHL meetings.  </P> <P> He was thrilled, of course, with his own induction, and seemed pleased to be  inducted with Tretiak.  </P> <P> "One of the questions I'm asked most often when I'm out is who's the best  goalie you ever played against," Sittler said. "I say I never saw a guy in  international hockey play as consistently as he did.  </P> <P> "With the way the Soviets are getting involved with the NHL, now, I'm not  surprised. The world's getting smaller all the time. My congratulations to  Tretiak."  </P> <P> Scotty Morrison, president of the Hockey Hall of Fame, said that there had been  a motion a year ago to consider a separate category for "non-North American"  players. But the feeling was that anyone deserving of induction into the Hall  of Fame should be judged against the best in the game.  </P> <P> Morrison said the discussion of Tretiak centered not on his nationality but on  whether he had had to play, game in and game out, under the same intensity of  competition that NHL goalies faced.  </P> <P> Said Morrison: "It came down to a question of whether he was a good player, or  whether he was a great player. The selection committee considered him to be a  great player."  </P> <P> Tretiak, 37, played on 10 world championship teams and three Olympic gold  medal-winning teams in his long career with the Soviet National Team. He was  also named MVP of the 1981 Canada Cup tournament.  </P> <P> Sittler said that his own selection was "icing on the cake," after listing his  game-winning goal in overtime of the first Canadian Cup as his most thrilling  time as a player, his outstanding season with the Flyers (43 goals and 40  assists in his second year there) as the most satisfying, and his failure to  win a Stanley Cup in his 15-year career as his biggest disappointment.  </P> <P> Lewis, now 85, played in the first All-Star Game in 1934. He was a standout  left winger for the Red Wings from 1928-39 and led the Red Wings to their first  Stanley Cup victory in 1936.  </P> <P> The players will be inducted at a dinner in Toronto Oct. 3. And Lewis promised:  "I'll have a group of about 40 -- every relative in the world is looking  forward to it."  </P> <P> Among the rule changes announced Sunday to be tried in the preseason and voted  upon by the board of governors in September was a statute of limitations on  supplemental discipline. That is, when an offense occurs in a game that calls  for the NHL to review the films, hear testimony and, possibly, hand out fines  and/or suspension time, the clubs and the league itself will have to initiate  action within 72 hours of the end of the game.  </P> <P> A source close to the Kings said that Pittsburgh offered to trade veteran  defenseman Paul Coffey to the Kings for Steve Duchesne and Luc Robitaille, but  the Kings weren't interested.  </P> <P> Goalie Robb Stauber's contract with the Kings reportedly is a five-year deal  (four years and an option year) worth $1 million, with a $125,000 signing  bonus.  </P></p>

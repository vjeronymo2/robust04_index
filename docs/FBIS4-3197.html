			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Leading dissident Bao Tong has been transferred to  a hospital for treatment, but friends and relatives are losing  hope for an early release. An informed source said the family  of Bao, the principal secretary of ousted party chief Zhao  Ziyang, had petitioned the Ministry of Public Security and the  Justice Ministry for permission to see his doctors.    The source said, although he was admitted to hospital in  Beijing last month, it was not an indication that the senior  member of the Communist Party's liberal faction would be granted  "parole for medical treatment".    The news came despite hints by Chinese officials that in  return for unconditional Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status from  Washington, Beijing might grant "medical bail" to a number of  dissidents in April and May.    A source close to the family said Bao, the former political  secretary of the Politburo who is serving the second half of his  seven-year jail term for alleged offences, including "leaking  state secrets", had recently undergone treatment for a serious  thyroid gland complaint. "Six tiny tumours have been detected  in his thyroid glands by doctors in the downtown hospital to  which he was transferred from Qincheng Prison," the source said.  "The doctors told Bao the tumours do not appear to be malignant  but a further period of observation is warranted. No plans for  surgical removal of the tumours have been made."    The source said it was unlikely Bao would be moved back to  Qincheng, which is in the outskirts of Beijing, in the near  future. It is understood, however, that relatives had expressed  dissatisfaction about the "inadequate medical attention" Bao was  given. They feared that since a few tumours had shown signs of  fusion, the abnormal growths might be a symptom of cancer.    Moreover, according to a relative, Bao's face was swollen  and  he could no longer speak clearly because of problems with his  vocal cords. He added that immediately before he was taken into  hospital, Bao was in severe pain suffering from inflammation of  shoulder joints. The relative added that, while medical  facilities food, and general living conditions were slightly  better in the hospital than in Qincheng, Bao's overall physical  condition continued to deteriorate.    Sources in the dissident community in Beijing said, in view  of China's confidence in securing MFN, it was unlikely the  authorities would grant medical bail to high-profile prisoners  of conscience including Bao. Meanwhile, the authorities have  stepped up surveillance of dissidents suspected of organising  protest activities in the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the  Tiananmen Square massacre in June. For example, relatives said  Liu Nianchun, a labour activist who organised a petition for  improvement in workers' rights in the spring, had been under  virtual house arrest since last month.</p>

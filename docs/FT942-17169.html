			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Company News: Canadian pension fund boosts 1993 rate of return to 19.7% Quebec's Caisse de Depot, Canada's biggest pension fund with assets of CDollars 47bn (USDollars 33bn), earned a rate of return of 19.7 per cent in 1993, well up on 1992's 4.5 per cent. The 10-year average return is 11.9 per cent. At the year end, the Caisse held 48.2 per cent of its assets in bonds and 38.1 per cent in shares, including 26.1 per cent in Canadian stocks. It is Canada's biggest equity investor. Mr Jean-Claude Delorme, president, said the 1993 performance was below average for North American pension funds, but the Caisse holds a larger proportion of bonds. It holds CDollars 16bn of Quebec's public pension plan assets, CDollars 15.9bn of provincial civil servants' pension assets, and also manages the portfolios of the Quebec car insurance board, workmen's compensation and construction industry board. Some of the latter organisations require a large percentage of fixed interest investments. The Canadian portfolio yielded 26.2 per cent last year, against a gain of 32.6 per cent in the Toronto 300 stock index. The Caisse had large exposure to Northern Telecom and Laidlaw, two Canadian stocks which fell sharply in 1993. The bond portfolio yielded 18.4 per cent, in line with other pension funds. The Caisse says it plans to become more vociferous in the management of the 350 companies in which it holds investments. It is already represented in the boardrooms of some Quebec companies. Univa, Canada's second-biggest food distributor in which the Caisse is the biggest shareholder, lost CDollars 108.2m, or CDollars 1.33 a share, in the year ended January 31, against profit of CDollars 32.5m, or 30 cents, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 6.2bn, against CDollars 6.7bn. The latest period includes restructuring charges of CDollars 167m.</p>

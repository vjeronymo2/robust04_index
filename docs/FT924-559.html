			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Schlesinger hint on German rate reduction sparks rally PRICES in most of Europe's government bond markets jumped sharply yesterday as Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, appeared to hold out the hope of substantial further reductions in German long-term interest rates. The thinness of the pre-holiday markets accentuated the movements, which were widely seen as an over-reaction. Mr Schlesinger's reported comments that long-term yields in Germany could fall to below 6 per cent in the current interest rate cycle helped to push prices on 10-year bunds up by as much as two-thirds of a point. Yields have fallen by 15 basis points, to 7.25 per cent, over the past week. However, it was difficult to find widespread belief in sub-6 per cent yields. Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Montagu, pointed out that German yields had fallen to that level only briefly in the mid-1980s, when commodity markets were depressed and German inflation stood at about 2 per cent. OTHER European markets prefered to look on the bright side of Mr Schlesinger's comments, creating a favourable background for a discount rate cut in Italy and talk of a possible rate cut in France. Italy's 1 percentage point rate cut, to 12 per cent, was timed to coincide with the passing of next year's budget through parliament. The BTP futures contract on Liffe advanced from 93.45 on Monday to 94.67. THE UK government bond market joined in the general rally, with longer-dated gilts making up about one-third of a point. Prices were held back partly by two tranches of tap stock overhanging the market, both of which were brought into operation late in the afternoon. An earlier tap stock, of 8 per cent gilts due 2002-06, was exhausted during the day. These gains were outstripped by index-linked gilts, which jumped by over a point thanks to foreign buying and the fact that the tap stock has not placed a ceiling on the market. US Treasury prices continued to post solid gains at both ends of the maturity spectrum yesterday. The benchmark 30-year government bond closed up at 103 15/32 , yielding 7.331 per cent. The short end of the market was firmer in the wake of a successful note auction, with the two-year issue up  5/32 at 100 5/32 , yielding 4.521 per cent. Yesterday's downward revision in third-quarter gross domestic product figures was good news on the inflation front. The widely-watched third-quarter implicit price deflator showed the smallest rise since 1967.</p>

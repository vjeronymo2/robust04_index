			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> "Driving Miss Daisy," a prize-winning American play about an elderly white  woman and her black chauffeur, has opened in Johannesburg to rave reviews from  critics delighted by its low-key handling of racial friction. With the  exception of one critic who found the script too bland, black and white  reviewers from pro-government and opposition newspapers praised the play and  the production, which opened last week at the Market Theater. For the past  decade, the theater has been Johannesburg's main showplace for multiracial  drama and has featured many militantly anti-apartheid works. ALEENE MacMINN and  Shauna Snow  </P></p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / World Trade News: Talks fail on banana quotas to EC TALKS in Geneva between the European Community and a group of Latin American banana producers over proposed EC import barriers to bananas ended in failure yesterday. The talks were a first step under the disputes settlement mechanism of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), which could lead to the establishment of an arbitration panel. The seven exporters involved - Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador - claim existing national trade barriers are discriminatory and that the EC plan, which extends import quotas and customs duties to all 12 member states, could halve their existing exports to the Community of some 2.5m tons a year. Mr Roberto Rojas, trade minister of Costa Rica, which led the delegation, said afterwards that the group would raise the issue at the next meeting of Gatt's governing council on September 29. It would also be asking Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt's director-general, to call an urgent meeting of the surveillance body of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks to rule whether the EC proposals violated a commitment not to introduce new protectionist measures. Gatt procedures do not allow panels to be established until the rules being challenged have been adopted. Thus a request for a panel on the new proposals would have to await their endorsement by the council of ministers. The plan drawn up by the executive European Commission would impose a basic banana import quota of 2m tons next year, with a 20 per cent tariff on bananas from the so-called 'dollar region'. Higher-cost bananas from Africa and the Caribbean would enter duty-free under the EC's Lome Convention. Mr Rojas said yesterday the scheme could cost the seven exporting countries about Dollars 500m a year in lost foreign exchange earnings over 10 years. The EC plan has aroused concern among other participants in the Uruguay Round, including the US, because it runs counter to proposals in the Round to convert all import quotas into tariffs. If the EC gets its way on quotas for bananas, this could create a precedent for others, especially Japan and South Korea which are opposed to tariffication of their restraints on imported rice.</p>

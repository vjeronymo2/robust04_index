			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Europe 1993: Roman emperor Caesar Augustus founded Europe's first single market, stretching from north Africa to Britain. Since then, Europe's political boundaries have ebbed back and forth with the tides of the continent's turbulent history. On this page, the FT presents the latest reshuffle of the Euro-pack Jacques Delors is not the first European leader with grand ambitons. Uniting Europe economically, as well as politically, has been a goal of the powerful for centuries. Charlemagne, Barbarossa, Charles V, Napoleon and Hitler all belong on the list of continental European rulers who have tried to build and maintain a trans-European empire, although using more coercive methods than today's politicians. Yet few have managed to translate their conquests into an integrated economy within which trade flows freely. And, so far, nobody has succeeded as well as the Romans. Octavian, heir of Julius Caesar, the conqueror of Gaul, is the true father of Europe's single market. After his victory over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium in 31 BC, it was Octavian, as the Emperor Augustus, who consolidated Rome's vast European empire. Stretching from Egypt in the south-east to Britain in the north-west, the empire of Augustus and his successors was an economic, as well as a military, triumph. 'The Roman Empire created a vast area, with a single currency and low customs barriers, in which commerce was hindered by neither pirates nor frontiers and was aided by an elaborate network of roads and protected harbours', the Times Atlas of World History declares. Yet no single market can be trans-European without the Germans. Only following the barbarian invasions of the 5th and 6th centuries, which brought the Roman empire to an end, could modern Europe emerge. Many subsequent conquerors have tried to create an integrated European economy along Roman lines. None has succeeded. Only the second half of this century, after ruinous conflicts among the European Great Powers, have aspirations to build a new Roman Empire begun to look realisable. Jean Monnet was the French architect of this new Europe. He was the inspiration behind the Schuman Plan, which led to the European Coal and Steel Community, formed in 1952 by Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, France and Italy. This laid the foundations for the Treaty of Rome, ratified in 1957, and the European Economic Community. The EC has grown in memberhsip, scope and ambition over the last 40 years. It is still some distance from creating a politically integrated community. The Maastricht treaty's plans for a monetary union and greater defence co-operation envisage a united Europe. Yet the goals of Maastricht are still aspirations. The EC's greatest tangible achievement to date is the Single European Act. Nurtured by EC Commission President Jacques Delors, it forms the legislative basis for Europe's second single market.</p>

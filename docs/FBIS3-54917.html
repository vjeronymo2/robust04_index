			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly </F> Supports Early Elections"]    [Text] The Executive Committee of the Central Council of  the Belarusian Social Democratic Assembly [BSDH] has adopted a  declaration regarding the report delivered at the recent Supreme  Soviet session by members of the temporary committee for  investigating the activities of commercial structures.    The declaration emphasizes that Deputy Lukashenka's report  provides facts already known to the public. The accompanying  report by S. Antonchik was more principled because it revealed  the major causes of corruption -- the preservation of the old  political system, an absence of economic reform, and chaos in  the legislature. These factors provide favorable conditions for  the ruling nomenklatura's embezzlements.    The BSDH Executive Committee believes that the three-day  debate on the issue demonstrated that all echelons of power,  from village soviets to the Supreme Soviet and from local  executive committees to the Council of Ministers, are involved  in corruption.    The Latin meaning of the word "corruption" is bribery, and  it  is no exaggeration to say that our officials are corrupt. This  is the only explanation for the reign of crime, especially  organized crime in the Republic. Officials and deputies bribed  by dealers of the shadow economy cannot adopt appropriate laws  and take practical measures to put an end to evil. On the  contrary, they are interested in disorder and confusion, for  this gives them a chance to grow rich at the expense of the  people.    The data on corruption in all echelons of power force us to  draw practical conclusions -- both the Supreme Soviet and the  Council of Ministers should resign. The demands for a coalition  government and for holding early elections, voiced by democratic  parties and movements, remain as urgent as ever.    To ban people access to information on corruption in the  organs of power, the Supreme Soviet majority made a decision to  continue the session behind closed doors. The rest of the  session turned into an ordinary row aimed at answering one  question -- who stole more.    At the session, some deputies insisted that the Supreme  Soviet rescind its resolution adopted in October 1992. At that  time, disregarding the demand of 380,000 electors to hold a  referendum, the Supreme Soviet promised to expeditiously adopt a  new constitution and hold early elections in spring 1994.  Clutching to their posts, the communist majority in the  legislature is ready to annul this decision.    The closed session on 16 December was used for attacks on  Stanislav Shushkevich and to voice further demands for his  resignation.    The BSDH Executive Committee calls upon all Belarusian  residents to demand early Supreme Soviet elections in spring  1994 and support the initiative of strikers' committees to form  a coalition government.</p>

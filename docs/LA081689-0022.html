			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR: THE WAR GOES ON  </P> <P> There has been much talk of peace in Central America following the summit  meeting where the region's presidents agreed on a plan to end the Contra war in  Nicaragua. While such talk is welcome, it must not obscure the fact that an  even longer war, one perhaps more intractable, continues in El Salvador.  </P> <P> October will mark the 10th anniversary of the military coup that sparked El  Salvador's civil war, a conflict that has already claimed more than 50,000  lives and displaced a quarter of the country's 5 million people. And the recent  election of a hard-line rightist president, Alfredo Cristiani, has exacerbated  the political alienation that tore the country into warring factions. Since  Cristiani's election, there has been an upsurge in assassinations, bombings and  other acts of terrorism aimed at government officials and leaders of his Arena  Party. Recently, Times correspondent Marjorie Miller reported that many  conservative Salvadoran businessmen are reluctant to accept jobs in Cristiani's  government, despite their ideological affinity for him and their financial  support for Arena, because they fear for their safety.  </P> <P> One of the more worrying aspects of Miller's report is the fact that  investigations into the most widely publicized assassination -- the murder of  Cristiani's presidential secretary, Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth -- have come  up with very different factions that had reasons to kill him. They include  urban commandos aligned with the leftist guerrillas fighting the Salvadoran  government, right-wing death squads who distrusted the president's secretary  for being a political pragmatist and supporters of an ambitious military  officer who blamed Rodriguez for blocking their man's appointment to a top  government job.  </P> <P> El Salvador has been a violent, dangerous place for the last decade, but the  wide spectrum of possible suspects in the Rodriguez killing points up just how  complex the political struggle there has become. And it explains why some  analysts wonder aloud if El Salvador is not slipping towards a more chaotic,  almost tribal, warfare. In their darkest scenarios, these analysts warn that El  Salvador could become Central America's Lebanon if the crisis there is not  resolved soon. For now such a parallel seems a bit strained -- but for how much  longer?  </P></p>

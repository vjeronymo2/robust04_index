			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> NOT-GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN SLAYING  </P> <P> A 27-year-old Oxnard tile-setter pleaded not guilty Friday to murder and  robbery charges in the July 3 beating and strangulation of a 62-year-old Port  Hueneme man.  </P> <P> Anthony Eugene Diaz entered the plea in Ventura County Municipal Court two days  after police arrested him in the slaying of Bruce Eugene Pope, a self-employed  free-lance business consultant.  </P> <P> Pope was taking care of two condominiums in a guarded complex in the 300 block  of Lighthouse Way in Port Hueneme where the robbery occurred, police said. A  renter who lived with Pope returned home to find the condo ransacked and called  security guards, who later summoned police.  </P> <P> Police said Pope had been severely beaten with household objects and then  strangled. Missing items included a television, videocassette recorder,  computer, camera and cash.  </P> <P> Police believe that Diaz and Pope met by chance and that Diaz apparently  decided to rob Pope after he had been invited to the condominium.  </P> <P> Police received a tip in August that helped them identify Diaz and link him to  evidence at the scene, but Deputy Dist. Atty. James Ellison would not  elaborate.  </P> <P> Diaz was held until Friday in lieu of $517,000 bail. Judge Steven E. Hintz,  however, ordered Diaz held without bail because the district attorney's office  had accused him of the special circumstance of murder during a robbery, a  potential death-penalty charge that allows no bail.  </P> <P> Ellison said his office will decide after the preliminary hearing, scheduled  for Nov. 5, whether to seek the death penalty in Diaz's case.

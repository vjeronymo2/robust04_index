			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE 100 Index reaches for the 3,100 mark - Market Report The closure of the New York markets for the Thanksgiving Day break left UK equities free yesterday to respond to factors closer to home. A change of view in the options and stock index futures sectors, backed up by favourable company trading news, was enough to send the FT-SE 100 Index in search of the 3,100 mark. At best, the index was within seven points of its target, finally closing 25.9 up at 3,093.1. The December future on the Footsie succeeded in breaking through 3,100 in late trading. Traders took a cautious view of the sudden recovery in share prices, stressing that the big institutional investors were still unwilling to deal ahead of next Tuesday's Budget speech from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Marketmakers are keeping dealing books closely trimmed and a wave of arbitraging operations from the stock index futures market caught them by surprise yesterday morning. However, Seaq volume increased to 696.3m shares, from 483.5m on Wednesday, with several basket trades marching across the trading screens. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.36bn on Wednesday, indicating that underlying activity remains healthy, if not as high as a few weeks ago. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 14.5 at 3,445.2. Weakness in oil shares, following a heavy fall in crude prices after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to cut production levels, contrasted sharply with the rest of the stock market. Turnover in oil stocks was very heavy as New York's holiday closure put London in the front line. Some analysts suggested that the oil price collapse, while not good for sterling, would benefit the industrial economies and might bring a stronger trend on Wall Street when it re-opens today. UK traders, who had assumed that Wall Street would remain out of the market equation until Monday, moved quickly into the blue chip international stocks yesterday afternoon. The lead was taken by ICI as a leading UK investment bank switched to a highly bullish stance on the shares. Not everyone in the City agreed with Warburg's reasoning but, nevertheless, the jump in ICI shares was worth two points on the Footsie at the end of the day. Reuters moved up smartly on hopes of strength on Wall Street. Pharmaceutical stocks were relatively cautious although Glaxo found some supporters. The building sectors found a strong lead in excellent trading results from BPB and, encouraged also by this week's half point reduction in domestic interest rates, moved up sharply. While realising that this week's rate cut has effectively ruled out the likelihood of a cut in the Budget, UK equity strategists are convinced that there is still room for base rates to come down to 4 per cent, or even lower, during 1994. But retail and store shares, still wanting to see genuine signs of an upturn in both consumer confidence and spending patterns, made little improvement. However, there was a good deal of activity in the brewing sector where hints of a large inter-corporate deal have been circulating. Traders were inclined to see the performance in the market yesterday as a reminder that, with trading books tight and heavy defensive positions built up in both traded options and stock index futures, share prices can turn very sharply on any change in confidence.</p>

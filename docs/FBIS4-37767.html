			<p>BFN     [Text] Rabat, June 23 (MAP) -- Iran's Embassy here denied  Thursday involvement in the arms seized lately by Moroccan  police and which were destined to the Algerian banned Islamic  Salvation Front (FIS).    The Government of Iran has nothing to do with the arms case,  the Iranian Embassy said noting that Iran in line with its  foreign policy principles does not interfere in domestic affairs  of other countries.    An eight-member ring (including six Moroccans and two  Moroccans) [as received] were dismantled lately by Moroccan  police while attempting to smuggle arms purchased in Europe to  FIS via Morocco.    The ring members were sentenced to imprisonment terms  varying  from 5 to 20 years.</p>

The European Commission and the private steel companies have  reached a draft agreement on the restructuring of the European  Union's (EU) steel industry, a spokesman of the European  executive announced on Thursday [24 March]. The steelmakers  have committed themselves to new capacity reductions of 8  million tonnes in order to reach a global reduction of 19  million tonnes in the crisis-ridden hot-rolled product sector.  But they asked for a delay to agree on the practical  implementation of the reductions. "There is a time problem, but  no problem on the fundamental issue," the spokesman said after a  dinner on Wednesday which brought together the private managers  with European Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann and Karel  Van Miert, his colleague responsible for competition. The  Commission has decided to ask the EU's industry ministers, who  are to meet on 22 April, to extend the Community support  measures accompanying the restructuring of the sector until  November. In early 1994, exasperated by the refusal of the  steelmakers to accept capacity reductions, it threatened to  suspend the release of the planned aid, some ECU500 million, for  the social part of the plan.    To the great relief of the Commission, the steelmakers  promised to not request help from their national governments in  order to stabilize their accounts between here and November  1994. And even if the managers of British Steel stayed away  from the dinner on Wednesday, the Commission emphasized that  Eurofer [European Steelmakers Association], the association  which gathers the steelmakers together, said it also spoke in  the name of the British company.    However, the global restructuring plan has yet to be  completed. And, even if it is completed next autumn, after a  delay of one year which is not without consequence, industry  experts point out that the figure of 19 million tonnes  represents the minimum necessary to achieve a durable  stabilization of the sector. The Commission estimated last  year, when it presented a catastrophic assessment of the sector,  that hot-rolled capacity would have to be reduced by between 19  and 25 million tonnes to restore balance in the market. The  private steelmakers had already committed themselves to reducing  their capacity by 5 million tonnes, while the public groups  agreed to do the same for 6 million tonnes in exchange for a  final aid package of ECU7 billion to stabilize the companies,  often before their privatization. So 8 million tonnes still  have to be found, and the private steelmakers have said they are  prepared to give half of that, thanks to closures in Bresciani  in Italy. The rest will be obtained via mergers or  specialization agreements between the steelmakers. It is a  delicate operation, and the Commission has warned that it will  watch to see that competition is strictly respected to avoid the  formation of dominant groups in this sensitive sector.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The 11th ministerial conference of the non-aligned  countries resumed its meetings today with the heads of  delegations at the conference hall in Madinat al-Nasr in Cairo  under the chairmanship of Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa.    The General Ministerial Committee resumed its discussion of  the items on the agenda: disarmament, international security,  the double standards from which developing states are suffering  at the international level, and the possibility of expanding  membership of the UN Security Council to include a larger number  of Third World states.    The political and economic committees began their meetings.  The Economic Committee will discuss the impact of GATT on  developing countries' economies and the problem of African debt.    Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa stated that at its morning  session, the conference discussed a report by the Non-Aligned  Movement's chairman on the political and economic problems  facing the movement. He added that the afternoon session will  discuss the UN role, its reorganization, and the international  economic situation, with emphasis on GATT and its impact on  Third World economies. He added that the conference will also  discuss the social development of the non-aligned states as well  as the venue for the next non-aligned summit. He said that a  Latin American state will probably host that summit. Musa  revealed that the conference will also discuss the setting up of  a mechanism to handle disputes among the movement members.    Asked about differences emerging during the present meeting,  Musa said that there are no disputes other than that between  Iraq and Kuwait. He said that he met with the Saudi, Syrian,  and other Arab foreign ministers today and discussed  developments in Yemen, since events there affect the entire  region. He added that the continuation of military operations  is of concern to all Arabs.    Musa said that Egypt will certainly approve the resolution  that the UN Security Council will issue. He explained that this  resolution will call for an end to the fighting and for  dispatching a fact-finding committee to Yemen. He noted that  Egypt was among the cosponsors of that draft resolution.</p>

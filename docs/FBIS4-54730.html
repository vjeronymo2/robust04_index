			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 3 -- Strikes at 16 coal and 3 zinc and  lead mines were continuing on Tuesday. The strikes are  "absentee" strikes which means the miners are not at their  places of work.    The chairmen of Solidarity factory committees in the mines  and power stations met on Tuesday evening to discuss the forms  further strike action would take. According to one of the union  representatives who wished to remain anonymous Solidarity will  be escalating the strikes in mining. The source said a decision  to this effect would be taken on Wednesday during a meeting of  the Slasko-Dabrowski regional Solidarity leadership in Katowice.    The strike at Poland's lignite (brown coal) mines was  suspended on Saturday. Power stations are not limiting  electricity supplies.</p>

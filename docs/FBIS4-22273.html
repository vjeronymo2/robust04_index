			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Simonov, under the "Situation Involving </F> Currency Bonds" rubric: "Vneshekonombank Bonds May Become a Bone  of Contention"]    [Text] The process of redemption of the bonds of the  USSR Vneshekonombank [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] which  were issued to cover its domestic debt will apparently  contribute to a string of financial scandals around this  legendary institution. As the date of the first payments draws  closer, many of the reluctant creditors of the VEB [Bank for  Foreign Economic Relations] have finally grasped that all of  them have been granted far from equal rights during the  repayment of the debt and have snapped out of the state of  preholiday euphoria. For example, the clients of the VEB itself  are now wondering why commercial banks that have kept the funds  of foreign economic associations similar to their own have been  granted the right to unfreeze their savings 14 years sooner. The  commercial banks themselves are guessing at the mechanism for  transferring real money to their clients, which is not known to  anyone.    While the Ministry of Finance, the VEB, and the Central  Bank of Russia keep silent, the most impatient organizations  have begun to make preventive attempts to "enliven" the money  through commercial banks. As was to be expected, given the state  of a legislative vacuum, this could not but cause incidents. A  conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks became the  first such incident; arbitration proceedings between the two  will begin on Thursday.    In the opinion of KOMMERSANT, the foundation for future  conflicts was laid by the authors of the government decree of 15  March 1993. Let us recall that according to this document, the  repayment of the currency debt of the VEB must be effected in  five stages over time. In the process, commercial banks were  granted the most preferential terms: The government resolved  fully to redeem bank bonds, making the first payments in an  amount of about $100 million as early as 14 May 1994. The  situation of foreign economic association-clients of the VEB  itself turned out to be the least attractive. Their debts will  be paid back only from May 2003 on; the government is planning  to fully settle with the associations as late as the year 2008.  Besides, commercial banks were to receive bonds for the entire  amount of the debt, whereas, in keeping with the letter of the  Central Bank of 14 February 1992 "On the Legal Succession of the  Russian Federation With Regard to the Obligations of the Former  USSR by Virtue of Currency Accounts at the USSR  Vneshekonombank," organizations that had accounts with the VEB  itself may count only on some of the "frozen" funds less debts  to foreign creditors (by now, these funds constitute the foreign  debt of the state).    It is noteworthy that the funds that the authors of the  decision, specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the VEB,  view as debt to commercial banks are nothing other than the  funds of their clients, primarily the same foreign economic  associations. Under the circumstances, the actions of some VEB  clients involving the sale of their "frozen" accounts to private  structures from among the commercial banks under their tutelage  are easy to understand. On the contrary, the principles from  which the authors of the regulations proceeded, whose official  obligation it is to resolve the issues of the foreign debt of  the state, are completely unclear.    As "X-hour" drew nearer, it became clear that the process of  "enlivening" the money would not be easy for anyone. The point  is that in the already mentioned chain "the VEB--the commercial  bank--the client," the government document regulates only the  relations between the VEB and the commercial bank in whose  correspondent account the money was frozen. The document does  not at all touch on how much the clients of the bank should  receive and in what manner. As stated by Mr. Gatsenko, the chief  of the currency department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia,  a commercial bank that has received VEB bonds "can either  distribute the bonds to its clients or allocate currency to them  out of its own resources." At the same time, Deputy Minister of  Finance Igor Selivanov explained that the bank should discuss  the principles and terms for the placement of bonds directly  with the clients, "proceeding from the contract on settlement  services." As a poll of bankers engaging in bond operations  revealed, the Mezhekonomsberbank and the Inkombank have taken  full advantage of such advice; they have embarked on  distributing the bonds of the first tranches to clients  (proceeding from a logical discourse).    At the same time, following such explanations many banks  came  to feel like unattached travelers lost in the woods by night.  Having received bonds in the total amount of the debt to their  clients, they still do not have official data on the amount of  the debt of each organization to the state. If such information  is announced after the fact, but the bonds will have already  been received by the legitimate owners, the banks may possibly  have to pay the state debt of their clients.    A conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks may  very well be considered an illustration of the above.  Proceedings involving them will begin tomorrow at the Moscow  Arbitration Panel. A client of Imperial, the foreign-economic  association Tekhnopromiport, sold $15 million "frozen" at the  VEB to a certain commercial structure-client of the Lefortovskiy  Bank in April 1993 at the rate of R100 [rubles] to the dollar.  Some time later, Lefortovskiy, which in turn is a holder of a  blocked correspondent account at Imperial, suddenly demanded  that this amount be transferred to its correspondent account  abroad, but this time in "live" form. It does not make sense to  engage in polemics about the logical flaws in these  instructions, especially given the fact that at present, the  debt of the Tekhnopromimport to the state comes to about $400  million, according to some data. Imperial, which refused to  transfer funds for reasons that are quite easy to understand,  was slapped with a "desperate" lawsuit for $15 million by  Lefortovskiy.    Commenting on this "transaction," Chairman of Imperial Bank  Sergey Rodionov stated that, regardless of the outcome of the  proceedings, the bank intends to return to the VEB the bonds  issued by the government in an amount equivalent to the debt of  the bank to Lefortovskiy. Imperial intends to postpone the  distribution of securities to other clients until the issue is  settled legislatively. It has come out that the Stolichnyy and  Russian Credit banks have also resolved to wait for a precise  legal interpretation of the issue.</p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Poland to sell 60% of Bank Slaski POLAND is to offer 60 per cent of the equity of Bank Slaski for sale in the second privatisation of the country's nine state-owned commercial banks created in 1989. The planned disposal of the 5.6m shares comes after the sale earlier this year of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy (WBK), in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development took a 28 per cent share. Now the EBRD is expected to bid for a share of the 'large investor' tranche making up 45 per cent of Bank Slaski's equity for a which a tender is to be announced on September 14. The share price agreed under the tender will then be treated as a marker for the remaining 15 per cent of the equity which is to be offered to 'small' investors later in the year. Mr Leslaw Paga, head of Poland's Securities Commission, which approved the public offer, said the price for small investors would be 'no higher' than that for large investors, but could be lower. The procedure is designed to avoid controversies which accompanied the WBK privatisation, where the offer price was set before a boom on the Warsaw stock exchange giving investors handsome profits and leading to charges that the bank had been underpriced.</p>

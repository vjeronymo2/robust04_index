			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: GOLDBERG LEAVES FOX AFTER A TWO-YEAR STRING OF HITS  </P> <P> Leonard Goldberg, who for more than two years has presided over a resurgence in  movie hits at 20th Century-Fox Film Corp., said he is leaving the studio soon  to return to "the entrepreneurial life."  </P> <P> The company indicated that no successor has been picked to succeed him as  president and chief operating officer.  </P> <P> The news surprised some Hollywood industry observers. The 55-year-old veteran,  who for 10 years had produced network television series such as "Charlie's  Angels" in partnership with Aaron Spelling, had overseen Fox's theatrical film  program since he joined the firm in December, 1986.  </P> <P> Last year Fox ranked No. 3 in domestic box office share, rising from No. 5 in  1987 and No. 6 in 1986. The company's biggest hit was "Big," which last year  was the first Fox movie to gross more than $100 million since a "Star Wars"  sequel in 1983.  </P> <P> Other Fox films during his tenure included "Die Hard," "Broadcast News," "Wall  Street" and "Working Girl."  </P> <P> Goldberg, whose three-year contract has more than six months to run, said:  "Although I've enjoyed my experience enormously, I felt it was time to return  to the entrepreneurial life that I enjoyed before I joined Fox."  </P> <P> A Fox insider commented: "One of the tricks in this business is to quit when  you're ahead."  </P> <P> Barry Diller, who is chairman and chief executive of Fox Film as well as its  parent, Fox Inc., was quoted in the announcement as saying that Goldberg has  done "a wonderful job in his too short tenure . . . stabilizing and  revitalizing our film production activities."

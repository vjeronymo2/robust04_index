			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO EXPAND PORTS MEETS WITH PUBLIC CRITICISM;  </P> <P> HARBOR AREA: ABOUT 150 PEOPLE, MOST VOICING OPPOSITION, CROWDED A HEARING ABOUT  $4.8-BILLION EXPANSION OF L.A. AND LONG BEACH PORTS BY 2020.  </P> <P> Harbor-area residents packed a public hearing this week to strongly criticize  the proposed $4.8-billion expansion of Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors,  fearing the project's environmental consequences would outweigh its economic  benefits.  </P> <P> But the community concerns over air quality, traffic, marine life and other  issues were not shared by local politicians and port businesses, who touted the  so-called 2020 project as a model to accommodate the inevitable growth of the  harbors -- already the nation's busiest.  </P> <P> In the first and only hearing on the project's massive environmental report,  about 150 people met Tuesday night at the Los Angeles Harbor Department's  headquarters in San Pedro. And although the two dozen speakers addressing the  report were almost evenly split among supporters and opponents of the project,  the standing-room-only crowd was clearly behind the project's opponents,  interrupting several times with applause.  </P> <P> "I understand the necessity for growth and development but we are doing it here  for reasons that don't make any sense to me or my quality of life," said Larry  Roteman, an electrical contractor from San Pedro.  </P> <P> Added Tony Kay of the Wilmington Home Owners: "The conclusion seems to be  (that) if it is economically beneficial for the ports, to hell with local  communities."  </P> <P> The two-hour hearing was aimed at garnering public input on the project's  recently released 8,000-page environmental report -- a study that details how  the harbors would be dredged for shipping and to provide landfill to expand  Terminal Island. The hearing was conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers,  which is expected to recommend that the federal government contribute $141  million to the project.  </P> <P> The environmental report, prepared by the ports and the corps of engineers,  focuses on the project's first phase, a $3.5-billion undertaking that would add  1,444 acres of landfill to Terminal Island and dredge the harbors for deeper  channels. That work, the report concludes, would aggravate already poor air  quality in the region, disrupt marine life in the harbors and adversely affect  commercial fishing and public recreation.  </P> <P> At the same time, the report argues that the explosive growth in the ports'  business demands some expansion of facilities. Otherwise, the report says,  even-greater environmental problems could occur as the harbor becomes too  crowded for shipping, forcing trains and trucks to carry the goods demanded by  Southern California's ever-growing population and commerce.  </P> <P> The impacts "do not appear to outweigh the benefits of the project to the  nation and the region," Col. Charles S. Thomas, the corps' district engineer,  told the crowd Tuesday night in reviewing the environmental report.  </P> <P> The project and the report's findings were applauded by area politicians --  including Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San  Pedro) -- as well as corporations doing business in the ports.  </P> <P> Given the inevitability of growth in the harbors and the 2020 project's plans  for meeting that growth, Richard Holdaway, president of Kaiser International  Corp. told the hearing: "I can't believe anybody who lives in San Pedro would  oppose this project."  </P> <P> He was wrong.  </P> <P> "I hate to see the loss of 1,600 acres" of recreational waterways, said Martin  Hochman of San Pedro, referring to the harbor waters that will be taken over by  landfill and commercial ships. "The loss of that cannot be mitigated," Hochman  said.  </P> <P> Bob Seaborne, who heads the Fisherman's Cooperative Assn. in San Pedro, said he  was afraid that expansion of the ports would accommodate cargo ships at the  expense of commercial fishing.  </P> <P> And Ken Malloy, a Los Angeles city environmental commissioner, voiced concern  that the project would destroy the foraging and breeding areas of the  endangered California least tern.  </P> <P> "I've seen the least tern come and go, mostly go," Malloy said, skeptical that  the ports will successfully relocate the species to new habitats. "You just  can't say to a tern, 'You are moving over here,' " Malloy said.  </P> <P> Port clients and elected officials, however, countered that the 2020 project  was a vital and adequately studied solution to nearly 20 years of federal and  local discussion of expanding the ports.  </P> <P> "The further growth of the Port of Los Angeles is vital to the continued  dynamics of international trade between this country and others worldwide,"  Mayor Bradley said in a letter read at the hearing. "Certainly the demands for  diversified goods and services by the Los Angeles area's 14 million residents  today, as well as similar needs for an estimated 18 million by the year 2020,  dictate that the port must prepare now for the next 30 years."  </P> <P> Similarly, Rep. Anderson offered a prepared statement on the project that  praised it as one that holds "enormous" economic importance for the region and  the country. Today, he noted, the ports' trade and shipbuilding account for  about 250,000 jobs in the region and contribute an estimated $25 billion to the  area's economy.  </P> <P> "I am keenly aware of environmental, transportation and other related problems  that are associated with this project," Anderson said. "I am confident that all  parties can continue to work together to mitigate these concerns prior to  completion of the project."  </P> <P> After the hearing, officials with the ports and the corps of engineers said  they expect most of the environmental consequences of the ports' expansion to  be minimized through the use of new technologies and other projects related to  the 2020 plan. Those other projects include a new rail and truck corridor  between the ports and downtown Los Angeles that would ease traffic elsewhere in  the harbor area.  </P> <P> Further, officials argued that the 2020 project would improve safety in the  ports and surrounding communities. The deeper channels, they said, would more  safely accommodate today's larger vessels. And the expansion of Terminal  Island, they added, would allow the relocation of hazardous fuel tanks now near  Wilmington's residential neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Not all of the project's impacts could be offset, however. The loss of some  recreational areas within the harbor, for example, would have an unavoidable  impact on area residents, officials said.  </P> <P> But overall, they argued, the 2020 project would provide the ports with the new  land and terminals they need with minimal disruption to the coastline.  </P> <P> The environmental report will now be revised, with Tuesday's comments, for  presentation to the federal government. Meanwhile, the project faces a series  of reviews by state and local agencies, including the California Coastal  Commission and the South Coast Air Quality Management District.  </P></p>

Following that, Israeli forces shelled the al-Hamra farm and  the area around Qal'at al-Shaqif, where the resistance has  positions, using 155-mm shells, as our correspondent in the  south reported. The Israeli shelling was accompanied by  warplane and helicopter overflights of the region; the planes  dropped flares. Two Israeli helicopters raked the valleys of  the al-Hamra farm and the area near the attack, for which  Hizballah claimed responsibility. There were no reports of  casualties.    Earlier, Israeli forces sporadically shelled the hills of  Iqlim al-Tuffah, particularly Jabal Safi, Luwayzah, Mlita, and  Sujud.</p>

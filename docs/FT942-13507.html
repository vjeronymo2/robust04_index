			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / RUC acts on Stalker disclosure Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, goes to the Northern Ireland High Court this week to try to head off disclosure of the Stalker Report's allegations that the security forces operated a shoot-to-kill policy against terrorist suspects in the early 1980s. Sir Hugh is to apply on Friday for an order to set aside a subpoena to produce the report at an inquest. The subpoena was issued by coroner Mr John Leckey to help him at three inquests that were due to resume in Craigavon, County Armagh, last Friday. The inquests were adjourned pending the outcome of Sir Hugh's application, which will be heard by a High Court Master sitting in private. He may decide to refer the matter to a judge.</p>

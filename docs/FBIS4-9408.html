			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 25 Apr--The miners are intensifying their  strike action, reducing deliveries of lignite to power stations,  Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol reported at a news  conference today. He noted that for three days now he has been  inviting the protesting miners for talks with representatives of  the government and the employers, and he is awaiting their  response. The department is not setting any preconditions,  Minister Pol declared.    The minister reported that Decision No. 30 [setting up  holding companies] of 23 March has not been in force since its  suspension by the department. According to him--and the trade  union confederations are aware of this--an unconditional  annulment of Decision No. 30 could be perceived as an indication  that nothing will change in the sector for many years to come.  "I do not want to give such an indication because that would  mean that the attempt to carry our reform in this sector has  failed," Pol said, adding that the organizational structures in  the lignite mining sector are based on obsolete legal  provisions, while decisions about the functioning of the  industry are still being made by the central administration.    It seemed to us, the minister stressed, that, during our  earlier talks with the trade unions and employers, we had  reached a consensus on the general form of transformations in  the lignite sector. "I would be willing to use the word `annul'  if the unions expressed their readiness to get down to talks and  their will to carry out structural transformations," he added.    Minister Pol denied rumors that restructuring will mean  redundancies. "No one is going to eliminate jobs in the lignite  mining industry because it is the source of generating the  cheapest energy in Poland," he said. He also added that no  other work enterprises have the two-year employment stability  guarantee received by this sector.    Asked by a PAP journalist whether the minister knows the  contents of the letter from the striking miners to Prime  Minister Pawlak, in which the miners maintain that any further  correspondence between them and the department is pointless, Pol  said he learned about the letter from the media.    Pol reported that, although the current power generation  factor is 20, no exports of electric power have been stopped  because this would incur very high contractual penalties. On  the other hand, for several hours now, we have been importing  electric power from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary  within the so-called natural exchange, which means that we will  have to return this power in the future.    Jerzy Tabaka, director of the National Power Control Center,  told the journalists that, under the current power-generation  factor of 20, some work enterprises will have to reduce their  electricity intake by powering down installations that are not  directly involved in their production processes. "The national  power system is operating without reserves," he added.</p>

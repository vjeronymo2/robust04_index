			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Moncef Mahroug: "Secrets of the Congress"; first </F> paragraph is REALITES introduction    [Text] The LTDH [Tunisian Human Rights League]  Congress--which ended better than it began--was a bitter battle  both on the rostrum and behind the scenes.    "I am deeply moved by what we have just experienced at the  opening of the congress. The sincere elite, which took the  initiative 16 years ago in establishing the first human rights  movement not only in Tunisia but also in the Arab world, in  Africa, and beyond--that elite would never have thought that one  day we would be experiencing moments like those we have just  witnessed. It was my duty to say this to you because that is  what I deeply feel." That was how Hassib Ben Ammar, president of  the Arab Institute of Human Rights and one of the LTDH founding  fathers, addressed members and congressional delegates from the  rostrum of the fourth LTDH Congress. In a trembling voice, he  expressed and showed his emotion and pain at the distressing  spectacle the LTDH made of itself before its members and  everyone else during the first few minutes of a congress that  was supposed to have marked the organization's rebirth.    Flashback: In an electric atmosphere and in the presence of  24 other members of the LTDH Managing Committee--their faces as  tense and somber as his own--Moncef Marzouki, the organization's  president, stepped before a microphone and, surprisingly, began  singing the national anthem. The audience hesitated a moment  before singing along with the LTDH president--whose action  seemed intended as a response to those who, in his own words,  say that he is "a tool of foreign interests"--but join in it  did. Then Marzouki said: "With head held high, I open this  congress, the fourth congress of the Tunisian Human Rights  League." He immediately launched into a severe indictment of the  government's policy on individual and collective freedoms and  human rights. In passing, he responded to the criticisms leveled  at him by certain people and their accusations concerning  him--including the charge, which he himself mentioned, that he  had not sought consensus.    The speech by the LTDH president was not to the liking of a  great many people, and among his colleagues on the Managing  Committee, Vice President Khemais Chammari was the first to show  his displeasure and express it loudly. As soon as it became  evident to him that the LTDH president--who had long been  complaining to anyone who would listen that he was being  "deprived of the right to speak"--was not going to simply  welcome the key personalities invited by the LTDH to the opening  session of its fourth congress, Khemais Chammari stood up and  went to sit in the second row on the rostrum. It was a way of  expressing his reservations about the speech being delivered by  the LDTH president, and Hichem Gribaa soon followed suit by  leaving the rostrum altogether.    "So many hardships endured by this league...." When he  realized that the LTDH president was going to take his sweet  time, Khemais Chammari let his anger burst into the open and  began protesting Moncef Marzouki's attitude. That is what he and  other members of the Managing Committee had threatened to do if  Marzouki did not prepare his speech--supposedly to be delivered  in the name of the Managing Committee--and submit it to the  other committee members for their approval. Their vain attempts  to get him to do so had been evaded by Marzouki on various  grounds during the three weeks preceding the congress.    In Amilcar on Day "J-1," the members of the Managing  Committee returned to the attack. This time Moncef Marzouki  flatly refused to comply, then changed his mind and promised to  prepare a text and submit it on Saturday just before the  congress opened. But the congress was scheduled to open at 1000,  and the LDTH president did not arrive in Amilcar until 0940.  That made it impossible for the Managing Committee to meet and  pin down the text of the opening speech. It was on the steps of  the hall where the congress was to meet that the president of  the LTDH let a member of the Managing Committee in on the  contents of the speech he prepared. But that member realized  afterward that the league's president had, in fact, read only  the first two or three pages of the speech to him, and there was  almost nothing offensive in those pages.    The speech of the LDTH president antagonized not only his  colleagues on the Managing Committee but also some of the  guests, especially Yadh El Ouedreni, minister-adviser to the  chief of state for human rights; Minister of National Education  Mohamed Charfi; and Hatem Ben Othman, deputy secretary general  of the Constitutional Democratic Rally, all three of whom left  the congress auditorium as a sign of protest against the speech  by the LDTH president.    At that point, chaos broke out. An infuriated Khemais  Chammari was less and less able to control his anger. For his  part, Moncef Marzouki began translating his own speech from  Arabic into French--even though three interpreters hired by the  LTDH were in the auditorium. Then, imperceptibly, the LDTH  president began speaking more in French and giving only a  condensed translation in Arabic, as though the ambassadors and  the representatives of international organizations became, as  Hassib Ben Ammar put it, his main audience and the congress  delegates merely a secondary group of listeners.    Following a brief interruption, Moncef Marzouki resumed the  reading of his speech after Taoufik Bouderbala, LDTH  secretary-general, stepped in to ask the audience to stop  interrupting the speaker. In a voice hoarse with emotion, the  LDTH president offered "the apologies of the league, because I  was a man prevented from speaking for months." That brought  another interruption by Khemais Chammari: "My brothers and  sisters, the problem is simple: up until this morning we had not  read the text. Moncef refused. This has been going on for five  years. Unfortunately, he rejects collective action."    There was a second attempt by the LTDH secretary-general to  calm a number of delegates standing up for Moncef Marzouki: "No,  no, please; our work is not going to progress normally and be  profitable if this keeps up. Please let him finish. This is not  the way the league is in the habit of opening its congresses. We  have only one objective, and that is to preserve the league,  preserve its unity and independence, and make the congress a  success."    The LTDH president resumed his speech, but again he was  interrupted by several members of the Managing Committee, who  reminded Marzouki that there was no need for him to translate  his own speech. Suddenly the LDTH president changed his tone and  attitude. He dropped a bombshell: "In order to help the league,  I am informing you officially and definitely that I have decided  to withdraw my candidacy for the Managing Committee and the  presidency of the league, and the reason is what you have just  witnessed in this auditorium. I am withdrawing from this  congress, and I call on you to continue the struggle." Before  carrying out his decision, the outgoing president of the league  made a gesture intended to give the thumbs up to his friends and  allies, calling on the congress to support "the militant,  progressive, and independence-minded league" and to elect "a  leadership made up of the most courageous men and women in order  to face up to this difficult situation."    Some of the delegates halfheartedly opposed Moncef  Marzouki's  decision, but a Managing Committee member shouted to him that:  "there is not going to be a plebiscite." While refusing to speak  himself, Taoufik Bouderbala offered the opportunity to those  members of the Managing Committee who wanted to say something.  Frej Fennich accepted that responsibility and the risk it  involved. He spoke mainly in response to Moncef Marzouki.    Unlike the outgoing president of the LTDH, who spoke in the  first person singular, Frej Fennich spoke on behalf of all the  members of the Managing Committee. So while Moncef Marzouki  claimed to have his "head held high," Frej Fennich claimed that  "with heads held high and on behalf of the LTDH Managing  Committee, we collectively welcome the congress delegates and  guests." Frej Fennich directed another shaft at Moncef Marzouki  when he proclaimed that "the league is the league of all  Tunisians," that "we thought we had left the era of personal  power behind," and that "the congress delegates are sovereign."    Helped by Hassib Ben Ammar, the members of the Managing  Committee were able to restore calm in the auditorium. After  first announcing, it is true, an effort to persuade Moncef  Marzouki to come back into the auditorium. The LTDH president  eventually agreed. But once back on the rostrum, he stated  firmly: "I am not withdrawing my decision to withdraw my  candidacy. And I do not take back a single thing I have said."    At the end of the opening session, Moncef Marzouki left the  congress auditorium and the hotel. And he did not set foot in it  again. His absence when deliberations resumed intrigued his  friends. Worried by his prolonged absence, they briefly  considered informing the delegates of "Moncef Marzouki's  disappearance." Most members of the Managing Committee opposed  the idea. Some of them, including Hassib Ben Ammar, contacted  several members of the government by telephone. The latter  informed them that the authorities concerned did not know where  Moncef Marzouki was. His whereabouts were learned early that  evening: he had simply gone back to his home in Sousse.</p>

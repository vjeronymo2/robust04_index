'We're determined to run a campaign to make sure there is the maximum pressure on the government to make the next Budget a Budget for jobs and for economic recovery.' Mr Smith underlined Labour's commitment to an intensive campaign to force the government to act on unemployment. The campaign may help draw the party together and take the emphasis away from likely areas of tension and division.

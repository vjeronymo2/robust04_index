			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM wins friends and influences people - Ralph Atkins sees paths to business eased in India A CONTINENT or two away from home, a million miles from balance of payments or unemployment figures, Mr John Major has found it is possible to win converts to his style. 'I thought until the weekend like the average voter - that Major was grey. But we're terribly impressed,' said a director from one of Britain's larger companies as he circulated in the marquee at the high commissioner's residence in Delhi. Perhaps it was a sign of how neglected UK industrialists have felt, that just by listening to the business delegation accompanying him, the prime minister won friends. 'The French and the Germans are so able here that we had to do something,' said the same director, who heaped praise on Mr Major, perhaps by his comments betraying a touch of fatalism. The trip is about micro-economics, not macro-policy. At a cocktail party on the flight Mr Major heard of individual problems with India's cumbersome labour laws, import tariffs and repatriating the profits of subsidiaries. The flight was intimate and chummy. The 13 invited businessmen included chairmen and executives from British Gas, Rolls-Royce, National Power and ICI. A group talking would turn to find the first lord of the Treasury brushing past down the aisles to find officials or talk to the press. 'When I chatted to him on the plane he was asking detailed questions about what our priorities were,' said Mr Douglas Gadd, chairman of GEC Alsthom, the manufacturing group which is looking for a deal in the electricity transmission industry. 'His presence has certainly opened doors that wouldn't otherwise have been opened.' That extra access has been easy to see. The business delegation met eight of India's most senior civil servants for tea on Sunday afternoon. Yesterday they met ministers for commerce, defence, economics, industrial development, power and home affairs before reporting to a session headed by Mr Major and Mr P V Narismha Rao, the Indian prime minister. India made clear its priorities were investment in infrastructure - matching the Department of Trade and Industry's focus on energy, telecommunications and heavy manufacturing, as well as the banks needed to arrange financing. Beneath the expression of public support, however, many of the businessmen were not prepared to admit that overseas trips could be anything but an adjunct to the central thrust of economic policy. Lower UK interest rates and extra money for export credit guarantees remain prime concerns - particularly for Mr Howard Davies, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, who has balanced his enthusiasm for the trip with barbed jokes about government policy. He told Mr Major that industry wanted to see government officials more receptive to industry in the UK - and not just in India. The Whitehall public-relations machine has worked hard against Indian bureaucracy - or perhaps genuine reluctance by the country's government and businessmen - to set up a handy series of announcements to help ease criticism of the trip by Mr Major's political opponents at home. But not until long after Mr Major has returned to domestic politics will trip's real value, in terms of export and investment orders won, be apparent.</p>

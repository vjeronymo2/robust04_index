			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE UPHOLDS RATE FREEZE ON AUTO POLICIES;  </P> <P> INSURANCE: AN AMBIGUOUS SUPERIOR COURT RULING LEAVES INSURANCE COMMISSIONER  ROXANI GILLESPIE'S CAP ON THE COST OF CAR COVERAGE INTACT FOR NOW.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge left Insurance Commissioner Roxani  Gillespie's freeze on auto insurance rate increases in effect until at least  the end of November on Tuesday, telling the Farmers group of companies not to  raise its rates on Nov. 1 as the company had planned.  </P> <P> But Judge Miriam A. Vogel, in an ambiguous decision that left Gillespie and  Farmers attorneys disagreeing over what had been ordered, said that on Dec. 1,  or a later date she may set, Farmers will be free to implement its 5.9% rate  increase -- subject to Gillespie's review.  </P> <P> Gillespie, saying that she will review the increase immediately and that she  has the power to strike it down the day it is implemented, said the court  decision had left her rate freeze, announced on Oct. 2, "alive and well."  Gillespie told reporters, "Basically we won. The freeze is intact."  </P> <P> Farmers representatives disagreed. The lead Farmers attorney, Leonard Venger,  said that Farmers will be free to raise its rates by 5.9% on the date  eventually set by Judge Vogel, and that the review by Gillespie will have to  follow due process, meaning it could take weeks or months of hearings, and that  any such review will be subject to a court appeal by Farmers.  </P> <P> Meantime, a Farmers spokesman announced that the company will notify all  policyholders who had received notice of the rate increase that it is being  delayed about a month beyond the original Nov. 1 implementation date.  </P> <P> As the two parties quarreled before a battery of news cameras on what the judge  had done, Vogel's clerk said the judge's order was not so much a decision by  her as an agreed-upon stipulation by Gillespie's special counsel, Karl  Rubinstein, and Farmers attorneys as to what would happen.  </P> <P> The clerk said the judge's formal order did not state Vogel's understanding of  what would happen but simply referred back to the transcript of the hearing and  cited what the two parties had agreed to.  </P> <P> The clerk said the transcript would not be available for 24 hours.  </P> <P> During the actual court session, Vogel had asked several times for the two  parties to express their understanding of the stipulated agreement. However,  each time she did so, the parties were in wide disagreement on what the  agreement contained, and the judge's attempt to clarify the matter apparently  was unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom, neither of the parties could agree on the ultimate  effect of the decision, except that it allows Gillespie's freeze to remain  intact through the end of November.  </P> <P> The judge set a Nov. 21 status hearing at which she will review the situation  and set a precise date for Farmers to try to implement its rate increase.  </P> <P> The effect of Tuesday's proceedings on other companies, and their possible  desire to raise rates despite the Gillespie freeze, was unclear. Consumer  representatives who were present at the hearing, meanwhile, questioned whether  Vogel could properly accede to any rate increase that will take place after  Nov. 8, the date Gillespie gains formal authority under Proposition 103 to  approve or disapprove all rate hikes.  </P> <P> The consumer representatives, such as Steven Miller of the Insurance Consumer  Action Network, said it appeared that Vogel was ready to allow Farmers to  eventually raise its rates after Nov. 8 without the prior approval of  Gillespie, even though subject to Gillespie's later review. They said this  contravenes Proposition 103 and questioned whether Vogel had realized that.  </P> <P> Quite a bit of time was taken up during the hearing with questions by the judge  to Rubinstein, Gillespie's counsel, on how long the insurance commissioner  thought it necessary for the freeze to endure.  </P> <P> Rubinstein said that Gillespie is trying to make a deal with the insurance  companies for expediting progress at hearings she has called to begin Oct. 30  on major Proposition 103 implementation issues, including new methods of  pricing auto insurance that will give less emphasis to where a driver lives.  </P> <P> If the insurers agree to cooperate, Rubinstein said, Gillespie hopes the key  issues of insurance pricing will be settled by the end of November, and that  the freeze could be lifted by that time.  </P> <P> However, even after that, Proposition 103 states that all rate increases by  insurers are supposed to be subject to the prior approval of the commissioner,  a process that could take months.  </P> <P> Vogel said she did not believe that it was right to prevent Farmers from  implementing the 5.9% rate increase for many months.  </P> <P> So, she said, she wanted to allow it to go into effect after the hearings had  resolved the pricing issues, probably around Dec. 1, but subject to Gillespie's  review.  </P> <P> Vogel said she was calling the Nov. 21 status hearing so that she could  ascertain whether the hearings were making progress, and if they were not, who  was to blame. She said she reserved the right to come down hard on whatever  party, the insurers, the consumers or Gillespie, was to blame for any lack of  progress.  </P></p>

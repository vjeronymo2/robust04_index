			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Greek power deal may violate trade sanctions GREEK purchases of electricity from Bosnia-Hercegovina have come under US scrutiny as a possible violation of the UN-led international embargo on trade with Serbia. According to the state-owned Public Power Corporation, Greece receives up to 200 MW of electricity daily, mainly in peak consumption hours, from a power station at Trebisnyica in Hercegovina. The power is transferred to Greece through the Serbian and Macedonian grids. The PPC is liable for transport charges of over Dollars 20,000 monthly for use of the Serbian grid, payable to Belgrade. The US embassy in Athens has asked for clarification of the arrangement on the grounds that it could amount to sanctions-breaking by Greece, according to foreign ministry officials. The Greek view is that power supplies should not be affected by the embargo since international transit traffic across Serbia is still permitted. President Ion Iliescu yesterday fended off press allegations that Romania had broken the embargo on Yugoslavia, by saying his country did not have total control over River Danube traffic in its domain, Reuter reports from Bucharest. 'We can control only what is on Romanian territory and loading points in Romanian ports,' he said. Several Western news agencies have reported recently that Romania was breaking the UN embargo by allowing oil and other commodities to slip into Yugoslavia along the river.</p>

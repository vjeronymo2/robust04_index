			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Profits taken in gold shares Heavy profit-taking wiped part of the gloss off gold shares as cautious investors cashed in some recent sharp gains, in spite of the stronger price of bullion. Golds lost 58, or 2.3 per cent, at 2,476 in what dealers said was heavier than expected trade as investors sold into bullion's morning strength above Dollars 391 an ounce. Industrials ended well down as weaker overseas bourses put pressure on sentiment amid a lack of fresh impetus in a highly-priced market. The industrials index shed 39 to 6,639 and the overall index receded 46 to 6,007. Running contrary to the rest of the market, the steel sector continued to gain ground on improved market prospects. Iscor finished 4 cents stronger at R4.89 after hitting a record R5 earlier in the session.</p>

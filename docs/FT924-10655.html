			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Digital announces cuts in US operations DIGITAL Equipment, the struggling computer manufacturer, is to close two US manufacturing operations with the loss of 670 jobs in its latest move to reduce costs and stem losses. Digital recently reported heavier than expected first-quarter losses of Dollars 260.5m, following losses of Dollars 2.8bn for the fiscal year that ended in June. Since 1989, Digital has cut 27,000 jobs. The plants to be closed are in Springfield, Massachusetts, where Digital assembles personal computers and Burlington, Vermont, a minicomputer systems production site. The plant closures are not expected to be the last for Digital. 'The movement of computing power to semiconductors; the shift in demand to high-volume, low-margin commodity products; and the decreased demand caused by a soft worldwide economy has left Digital, and other companies in our industry, with excess worldwide manufacturing capacity,' said Mr Edward McDonough, vice-president for manufacturing and logisitics. Digital has been restructuring its operations for the past three years to reduce production capacity and eliminate redundancies.</p>

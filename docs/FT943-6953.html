			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / China faces exodus from countryside to cities China faces an urban explosion in the next two decades with a massive population shift from rural areas to cities and new townships, according to a study prepared by one of the country's most respected academic institutions. China's Academy of Social Sciences forecasts that by 2010, the country's urban population will grow from 27.6 per cent of the total population to 50 per cent. The startling urbanisation projection suggests that China, which has hitherto been predominantly an agrarian society, is undergoing a sociological revolution even more profound than has been recognised. Entitled 'Policy Choices of China's Economic Development', the study calls for a rapid small town development programme to provide homes and jobs for peasants leaving the land 'as cities have reached their limit in taking farmer-migrant workers'. Such rapid urbanisation would clearly have serious consequences for the environment in the world's most populous country, and would also suggest a revolution in consumer habits and lifestyles throughout China. The academy, which frequently acts as a 'think tank' for the government, predicts that China's economy will grow by an average 8.25 per cent a year to 2010 and will become 'one of the world's largest'. Government officials are wary of claims that China is becoming the world's biggest economy. They are concerned that such recognition may jeopardise trade and other benefits accruing to a developing country. This has been one of the central issues in negotiations over China's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The government-commissioned study expects that, if average annual growth of 8.25 per cent is maintained, China's gross domestic product will more than quadruple by 2010. But, as the study makes clear, the country will need to maintain exceptionally high growth rates to cope with surging demand for new jobs. 'Each year,' it says, 'China needs to create 17m-18m new jobs, 3m-4m annually more than in the 1980s.' The study, prepared by the Institute of Qualitative and Technical Economics within the academy, estimates surplus rural labour at between 100m and 120m. The bloated state-owned sector employs 140m, many of whom are believed to be surplus. Cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Tianjin have already been overrun with migrant labourers from the countryside. The influx has been blamed for an increase in crime and has stirred fears within the government about social unrest. The study predicts that the gap between the prosperous coastal regions and the hinterland will continue to widen, but it also forecasts a 'wave effect' of new foreign investment into more remote areas. The academy predicts that China's population will rise from 1.17bn at present to 1.3bn in the year 2000, 1.4bn in 2010 and 1.6bn in 2050, which it predicts will be the peak.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Press Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  [BSP] has announced that Zhan Videnov, chairman of the BSP  Supreme Council, who is a member of the Consultative Council on  National Security, has sent a letter to President Zhelyu Zhelev  in which he sharply protests the fact that the problem of the  transshipment of the UN Protection Forces equipment has not been  discussed in the Consultative Council of National Security.    The letter points out that the president has once again  proven his intention to turn the council into a declarative  organ or a curtain behind which machinations are conducted.    Similar actions cannot be described as a manifestation of  concern with the country's security, the protest letter of Zhan  Videnov to the president of the Republic points out.</p>

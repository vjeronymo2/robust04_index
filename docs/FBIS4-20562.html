			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yutaka Miyata, VICS Promotion Council] </F>   [Text]  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   If you were driving in your car and got caught in a traffic  jam, you would not know whether there was a detour route  available. If that detour could get you to your destination  faster, you would not hesitate in taking it.    Furthermore, if you always knew when there was an available  parking lot nearby where you could park your car, you would not  have to worry so much about fighting for parking places, and not  have to be pay for expensive parking tickets.    The basic functions of a car is not only the driving part  but  also getting to your destination safely, reliably, and quickly,  so the route that you take has important implications. Avoiding  illegal stops along the highway also has direct links to keeping  traffic volumes down on the roads.    The Vehicle Information and Communication System  (hereinafter  VICS) is a system that provides this type of essential  information to the driver and assists the driver in  decision-making.  <H5>  2. Purpose and Benefits of VICS </H5> <H5>  2.1 Background of VICS Research </H5>   The automobile is preferred by people for its convenience,  so  this means that the demands on the roads will steadily grow.    The roads receiving this traffic are supposedly being  widened  and improved, but it will not be long before we reach the base  of this demand, resulting in severe congestion and calling into  question the basic role of the automobile.    There is also a serious concern about the rising number of  traffic deaths over the past few years that could be reduced by  having more driving safety programs and more traffic safety  equipment.    The Vehicle Information and Communication System (VICS) is a  system that provides people with information they need when  driving. That information is used to keep traffic flows moving  in the right direction, and not the least, to make driving  smoother and safer.  <H5>  2.2 Aim of VICS </H5>   This system offers drivers information on the time certain  basic things take when traveling.    These for the most part include information such as whether  a  road is open or not due to accidents or construction, the origin  and destination of a trip, degree of traffic congestion, and  also travel time on each road.    A driver in his car gets this information, and using his  judgment, selects the fastest route available to get him to his  destination. The use of this system will bring about a  redistribution of traffic.    For quite some time, the over-concentration of traffic has  accelerated the reduction in the ability of the roads to handle  this traffic capacity, a phenomena that has come to be known as  a traffic jam. On the other hand, however, there is a growing  recognition that a redistribution of traffic will quickly  restore the ability of the roads to handle this traffic, and  ease or get rid of these traffic jams.    In other words, drivers seeking more convenient routes that  give them a faster alternative to their destination will help  make better use of the road networks, and will, secondly, help  ease or eliminate traffic congestion.    Furthermore, the easing and reduction of traffic congestion  decreases driver irritability and frustration because the  driving time is shorter and the arrival time is known. Putting  drivers more at ease also helps prevent auto accidents due to  driver carelessness. In Figure 1, we show the benefits of the  system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-08A>      Figure 1. VICS Benefits </FIG>    The opposite is often the case. For example, parked cars  along the road which are there tending to their own immediate  needs have a negative effect in that they dramatically reduce  the ability of the roads to handle traffic.    The VICS system seems too good to be true in that trying to  accommodate the needs of the individual in turn benefits society.  <H5>  2.3 Infrastructure Enables Japan To Take World Lead </H5>   In addition to the social aspect, the infrastructure already  exists in Japan to erect such a system easily.    The first part of this is that the information the system  requires has already been collected for administrative purposes  and is available for use. A big advantage that we have over  other countries is that traffic information is systematically  gathered by a public safety commission and traffic authorities  (Table 1).    Table 1. VICS Information (In Planning)    1. Road and Traffic Information        -  Traveling time (areas, times, etc.)    -  Traffic congestion  (areas, times, etc.)    -  Accidents (locations, causes, etc.)    -  Traffic laws (areas, particulars, etc.)    -  Other information       2. Road and Traffic Related Information        -  Parking sites (locations, availability, etc.)    -  Other  information [end table]       The second area that we already have in place here in Japan  is that research has been almost completed on another system  that was used to confirm the technical feasibility of this  system.    The third factor is the sophistication of the on-board  equipment used in automobiles and the progress being made in  building cars with more advanced features. Car navigation  systems, in particular, have shown remarkable growth since  manufacturers started coming out with these systems after the  Japan Digital Road Map Association began offering digital road  maps. There are now more than 300,000 car navigation systems in  use today (Figure 2).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-09A>      Figure 2. Car Navigation Systems </FIG>  <H5>  3. VICS Promotional Activities and Research Organizations </H5> <H5>  3.1 VICS Promotional Activities </H5>   In introducing a new traffic information system for moving  vehicles, the National Police Agency (NPA), the Ministry of  Posts and Telecommunication (MPT), and the Ministry of  Construction (MC), recognizing the need to synthesize those  traffic information systems in which companies have been doing  R&amp;D in order to achieve safer and smoother traffic flow,  came up  with a single system called the Vehicle Information and  Communication System, and in March 1990 set up the VICS Liaison  Committee.    Later, in December of that year, a group of companies united  to form a VICS company and business center, but before putting  it into operation, quickly established the VICS Promotional  Council with cooperation from the above named ministries and  agencies.    In October 1991, the Vehicle Information and Communication  System (VICS) was established with over 200 participating  corporations and groups, with most new VICS members joining by  prearrangement from the break-up of the AMTICS Promotion Council  and the RACS Promotion Council (Table 2).    Details Surrounding Formation of VICS Promotion  Council        -  March 1990: VICS Promotion Council started by National  Police Agency, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and  Ministry of Construction    -  December 1990: Interim report released  by VICS Liaison Committee       (1) Three ministries/agencies work jointly toward  realization  of VICS    (2) VICS Promotion Council formed by private corporations as  preliminary organization to VICS company        -  September 1991: VICS Promotion Council meeting  convened       Council Promoter: Koichiro Toyoda, president, Toyota Motor  Corp. (chairman at that time)        -  October 1991: Establishment of VICS Promotion Council       Goal: Quickly put Vehicle Information and Communication  System (VICS) into operation, and expedite business side.    Chairman: Hiroshi Inose, director, Gakujitsu Joho Center    Members: Oki Electric, Sumitomo Denko, Toyota, Nissan, NEC,  Hitachi, Matsushita Electric works and 207 other corporations  and organizations    Thus, VICS was added to the list of traffic information  system projects being carried out around the world as shown in  Figure 3. The aim of the projects is the implementation of such  systems.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-10A>      Figure 3. Vehicle Communication System Related Projects Around the World </FIG>  <H5>  3.2 VICS Research Organizations </H5>   In studying how to implement VICS, we organized a study  group  to look at each of the items that needed to be researched, and  brought these items up in a committee format.    The study group was divided into three committees, and these  were further divided into subcommittees in order to deal more  effectively with both specialized and comprehensive studies.    First, there is the "business committee." This committee is  made up of a "systems subcommittee" which is studying the  implementation of VICS and what needs to be done with regard to  commercializing VICS as well as the business side including  income and expenses, a "safety subcommittee" which is doing  studies to make sure that VICS information does not present  problems in terms of safe driving and yet is marketable, and a  "database subcommittee" whose aim it is to satisfy the needs of  the user. The job of the safety subcommittee is to absolutely  avoid the side effects that take place when VICS is used as a  specific remedy to make traffic flow safer and smoother. This is  an important item that supports the implementation of VICS from  the side.    The "research committee" is divided into a "beacon  subcommittee," an "FM multiplier subcommittee," and a  "teleterminal subcommittee" that have been formed to look into  each of the media which VICS uses, how the media should actually  be used, and the compatibility with VICS.    A proposal was also received from the National Police Agency  on whether an optical vehicle sensing device that they planned  to implement, and which also has a two-way communication  feature, could be used in the VICS system as a light beacon, so  in April 1993, a "light beacon subcommittee" was formed.    The "testing committee" is made up of a "demonstration and  testing subcommittee" which was formed in the fall of 1992. This  subcommittee is in the process of speeding up preparations to  demonstrate and test the system in order to gain a better  understanding of the effectiveness and necessity of the system.  <H5>  4. VICS Outlined </H5> <H5>  4.1 Designing a User-Oriented Product </H5>   We believed that the first conditions that VICS must meet  are  availability, ease of use, and cheap enough for users to afford  because this product has yet to demonstrate its usefulness in  the world.    The VICS system is made up of four different systems  according to function, namely, an information gathering system,  a data processing and editing system, an information  broadcasting system, and an information utilization system (cf.  Figure 4).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-10B>      Figure 4. System Overview of VICS </FIG>    In studying each of these systems, the first things we  considered was whether to use something that was already  available on the market as basic infrastructure, or whether to  share infrastructure as needed in the future, and secondly, to  make sure that the user could bear the overall cost burden.    Next, we emphasized the real time properties of data from  the  view of being useful to the driver, and set an upper limit of  five minutes on the time it takes for data to be sent from an  information source to the on-board navigation equipment. As  policy, we tried to avoid having the system equipment be too  unnecessarily complex, and looked at ways of configuring the  systems so that data was received and stored efficiently and the  information mainly used as links (segments of numbered roads).  This also helped compress the overall volume of information,  thereby making more information available with the same amount  of data transmitted, and moving the system one step closer to  the goal of "anytime, anyplace."    The third thing that we considered was one-source processing  and information broadcasting. One area that the user is  completely unaware is that the different broadcasting sources  and broadcasting media differ according to the contents of the  data and the road type the car is traveling. For that reason, we  made it conditional that VICS cover the information sources  needed by drivers, and that the information be processed and  broadcast by a single source as traffic information or  traffic-related information.    In order to promote widespread use of VICS, the data  processing and broadcasting system were looked at in terms of  how it could be designed to meet the needs of the user (Table 3).    Basic Requirements of VICS    1. Efficient infrastructure    (1) Use existing infrastructure    (2) Share new infrastructure    2. Real time information    (1) Time performance of system    (2) Usefulness of information    3. Single-source processing and broadcasting of information    (1) Cover necessary information sources    (2) Consolidate management configuration    4. Ensure product diversity    (1) Utilize media characteristics    (2) Broadcast configurations compatible with use  <H5>  4.2 Using Government Collected Data </H5>   Various public safety commissions and traffic authorities  are  collecting for administrative purposes assorted traffic  information on things such as traffic accidents and traffic  jams, and VICS is being given this information through the Japan  Road Traffic Information Center which is a joint government  organization run by the National Police Agency and the Ministry  of Construction. For example, there are 74 traffic control  centers set up in cities throughout Japan. That means that  traffic signals are now generally controlled according to  traffic information collected by vehicle sensing devices. A  portion of this information is given as ordinary traffic  information through traffic information display boards, or  through radio or television, but behind that, there exists an  enormous amount of stored information.    This is how a basic data collection system has been built in  Japan, but before VICS can be put on the market, there needs to  be more study done including standardizing the definitions and  units of measurements that differ slightly between each traffic  authority.    In addition to that, we also have to find a way to collect  other traffic-related information such as relates to parking in  an effective and systematic way.  <H5>  4.3 Center System and Database </H5>   The VICS Center will be the central place that processes and  edits the data to make it easier for drivers to make effective  use of the data in terms of "anytime and anyplace."    The basic aim of the VICS Center is to receive and  efficiently store data as information which VICS can use to  bridge links, but to do that, the center's systems must have  databases combining link management configurations for each  information source so that all the information forms a network.  In specific terms, an information source will make no difference  to a driver wanting to use a high-speed route to his destination  if he cannot get through on either the high-speed route or  regular routes.    This is particularly true in terms of travel information.  VICS is not a road network made up of units of distance, but  ideally is a network made up of units of time, and this time  reflects the traffic conditions occurring at those times in real  time.    For the user, the most practical piece of usable information  is the "fastest route" to one's destination, which is displayed  on the on-board navigation equipment in the car.    This is simply because the traffic congestion problems  mentioned in the opening section would not get too far out of  hand if drivers had indications of such congestion.    Furthermore, in considering the use of on-board navigation  equipment, it is essential that the links used in navigation  system databases now on the market be compatible, and that the  equipment be built so that it can withstand new links being  added in the future corresponding to roads in which traffic  authorities have gathered data, or to the expansion of those  roads. We also have to devise some way of guaranteeing continued  use of existing systems now being used in vehicles. A study of  VICS links in support of VICS databases is being done with this  very point in mind (cf. Figure 5).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-11A>      Figure 5. Link Conversion Configuration </FIG>    The compatibility between VICS links and other individual  on-board map database links will hopefully be resolved by a  digital road map database bridge being offered by the Japan  Digital Road Map Association.    In coming up with the on-board map display, consideration  was  given not only to displaying information based on links, but  also to direct use of data and to having relatively inexpensive  "simple graphics display" or "character display" for data  processing or editing.  <H5>  4.4 VICS Media Promoting Product Diversity </H5>   (1) FM Multiplier Broadcasting    In order to achieve the goal "anyplace/anytime," we must not  only widen the areas being served but we must be able to  transmit large volumes of data instantly covering all types of  information (cf. Figure 6). The media best suited to do this is  FM multiplier broadcasts. So this past May, the Electricity  Utility Industrial Council issued the technical standards for  characters, graphics, and data for a mobile vehicle, but VICS  also contributed to this study.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-12A>      Figure 6. Example of FM Multiplier Transmission Format </FIG>    The unique feature of FM multiplier broadcasts is that it is  cheaper and covers a wider service area than can be obtained  with the existing broadcasting equipment being used. The degree  to which cost can be lowered, however, is based to a certain  degree on the advances and technical progress made in the  processing functions of on-board equipment, and on the way that  information is selected from the large volume of data received,  which has tended to place quite a load on the on-board equipment.    For example, the map display selects information  automatically by displaying the place where one's car is  located, but judging by the current cost of equipment, it would  take quite a long time before any social benefit was born out of  that.    That is why an FM multiplier system has an area code added  to  the information being broadcast. If the on-board equipment is  provided with some sort of auto-positioning detection feature,  it will enable data to be filtered out automatically.  <H5>  (2) Beacon </H5>   Beacons provide users in the middle with data by filtering  out that data which is unnecessary, and by doing so they lighten  the load on the on-board equipment. The biggest feature of a  beacon system, which receives data on the road intermittently,  has to do with the location where the car receives data.  Accordingly, if only filtered information is received from  beacons at the spot where it is received, the on-board equipment  will basically only have to display that information which it  receives.    This information could include nearby parking lots, or the  driving time required from there to certain main points. In  addition to traffic information, we are also considering beacons  offering road information such as places that make the present  location obvious, place names, shapes of traffic intersections,  and destinations.    Beacons will also be able to form service areas out of the  places where traffic information is needed.    Studies are now being done on using both semi-microwave and  infrared radiation as an information medium of this beacon  system.  <H5>  (3) Teleterminals </H5>   As far as what is in store for information broadcasting in  the future, thought is being given to individual driver requests.    Teleterminals are the media best suited to achieve this with  VICS.    Teleterminals themselves have already been put to commercial  use, and being very similar in construction to a portable  cellular telephone, are effective two-way data communication  devices. A broadcasting-type teleterminal is the kind used in  traffic communication systems. The teleterminal was fully tested  in the AMTICS pilot experiment, and in practical experiments  conducted during the Osaka Flower and Garden Show.    In order to have a request-based VICS information  broadcasting system, we must first take a hard look at the needs  that exist, and then study information access methods that  specialize in requests made by drivers, and the databases that  correspond to those methods (Table 4).       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 4. Characteristics of VICS Media                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Beacon            |FM Multiplier     |Teleterminal      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Service Area (cha-|Min zone repetiti-|Wide area (depend-|Med zone repetiti-|  |racter)           |ons (optional)    |s on FM broadcast |ons (depends on b-|  |                  |                  |area)             |usiness)          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Broadcasting Meth-|Sharp distinction |Large batches (br-|Optional (request |  |od                |between beacons (-|oadcast type)     |type)             |  |                  |unidirectional)   |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      The teleterminal is thought to exhibit great utility when  equipped with audio recognition as a standard feature, but  studies have shown it not to be inefficient in its present stage  of development, so we decided to do a study to see what was  missing after setting it up to offer simple directions.  <H5>  4.5 ...Good Products Amid the Competition </H5>   The last are the on-board systems that utilize information.  We believe that the fierce competition between major  manufacturers has provided us with an inexpensive good-quality  product without it ever having been manufactured or sold.    A manufacturing company bases its decisions on whether a  market is tilting toward the high end with an emphasis on  features and performance, or whether it is tilting toward a  large market by having simpler features and lower prices, or it  bases its decisions on which media or product type to target  given the competition.    For that reason, the aim with regard to VICS is to disclose  which type of information can be broadcast using what type of  format. By doing these types of study in a committee format, we  are hoping to come up with on-board equipment that reflects the  needs of the user and can be put into operation.  <H5>  5. Commercializing VICS </H5> <H5>  5.1 VICS Cost and Efficiency </H5>   When we looked at what it would take to develop an efficient  VICS broadcasting system throughout the country, we found that a  centralized system would be cheaper than a decentralized system  having centers in each of the prefectures.    To be more realistic, however, it would seem to be better to  have several centralized blocks throughout the country because  we have to make sure we have a back-up system in case of  emergencies.    In a typical case such as this, the working expenses needed  over a 10-year time period are estimated to be &yen;390 million  with the largest portion of that amount, &yen;300 million, going  toward plant and equipment costs (&yen;288 million for  information broadcasting equipment, and &yen;12 million for  center equipment), and &yen;90 million going toward management  and operating expenses (&yen;26 million for items associated  with center).    When a market survey was done to estimate how far-reaching  the use of on-board equipment will become, the results indicated  more than 18 million units in operation within 10 years.    If we include the &yen;500,000 in expenses for existing  navigational equipment and radios as additional on-board  equipment, that total rises to &yen;820 million.    When we calculate the benefit to society of implementing  VICS  on this basis, we find that the time saved by shortening driving  time and the reduced fuel consumption that results produces a  savings of roughly &yen;5 trillion.    Accordingly, the cost of operating VICS over a 10-year  period  is estimated at roughly &yen;1.2 trillion, but it has a &yen;5  trillion return benefit.    When we consider the combined use of both a radio beacon  system in which traffic authorities build the information  broadcast infrastructure and an optical vehicle sensing system  installed by the safety commission, and also consider the  on-board equipment costs excluding those costs absorbed by the  user, we find that VICS will cost an additional &yen;38 million,  but that the benefit to society will actually be more than 100  times greater at roughly &yen;5 trillion.  <H5>  5.2 VICS Beneficiary </H5>   The dilemma that VICS finds itself in is that although the  benefits outweigh the financial risks, the system cannot be  installed and put into immediate service.    In studies undertaken earlier, it was found that it was too  much of a burden for a VICS business unit to have an  infrastructure for providing information, and that such a  company could not be formed into a business. Accordingly, after  an infrastructure of sorts has been built, the business side of  VICS will have to be set up jointly.    The most important thing is how to obtain revenue. Excluding  the safety, environmental, and market-creating advantages of  VICS, the economic effect alone of smoother traffic is greater  than the cost of the system, so the question of who should bear  the burden of costs is really the major question.    Ideally speaking, the costs of the system should be born  fairly between those who benefit from the system. Those who  benefit from the economic effects resulting from smoother  traffic include all the people driving on the roads. In that  regard, there are more cars without VICS systems than there are  cars with VICS, which are the information users. Moreover, the  users of cars equipped with VICS are already having to bear the  equipment costs associated with bringing this system up on-line  for society's benefit.  <H5>  6. Conclusion </H5>   It takes quite a bit of money to build and operate VICS.  Since VICS uses information collected by public officials and  benefits society as a whole, it should not be made into a  typical profit-making business.    In determining the beneficiaries of the system and who  should  pay for the cost of installation, it will be important in the  future to determine how much of an effect broadcasting  time-keyed information has, and what effect equalized driving  times will have on actual traffic volumes on the road, and  subsequently, to determine how, where, and when this can be  achieved.    For people who have the system in their cars, VICS provides  more flexibility in the routes that they can take, and in  selecting those routes, is not the type of equipment that issues  commands or instructions from the outside, but rather more than  anything else, is user-friendly in the fact that it allows the  driver of a car to make his own decisions based on position and  availability. It is a system that makes effective use of road  resources which are quite limited, and contributes toward safer  and smoother traffic on roads and highways.    This fall, we are planning to hold a public demonstration of  VICS in hopes of gaining wider public support and understanding  of the system. Having received more cooperation than ever before  from the government, we hope to have the VICS system up in  operation soon.</p>

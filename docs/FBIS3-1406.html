			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At least four people have been killed and several  others injured in violence apparently connected to the return of  people from an ANC [African National Congress] march in Durban.  Three people, two of whom were young children, were shot dead  in the Bhambayi squatter camp near Durban yesterday, and several  shacks were set alight. In Empangeni several people were  injured in attacks on people returning from the march, and in  Stanger an ANC supporter was stabbed after a march. The ANC has  blamed the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] for the violence.    Meanwhile, the IFP has dismissed as a failure yesterday's  ANC  march through the Durban city center. The IFP accused the ANC  of busing in Xhosas from the Transkei and the Eastern Cape, and  said many of the protesters had been too young to vote. The ANC  said the rally proved that tens of thousands of Zulus supported  participation in the election.</p>

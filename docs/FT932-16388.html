			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: A polished mirror Mirror Group Newspapers' ability to generate headlines in other people's publications remains undiminished. But while its management has been loudly lambasted for its rough handling of cherished columnists, it has been quietly winning a following in the City. The stock market has scented a real recovery story beneath the drama. Since being relisted, MGN's shares have more than doubled. They rose 11 per cent after yesterday's annual results. With operating profits up 16 per cent to Pounds 97.5m and margins widening from 18 per cent to 21 per cent, the appeal is easy to understand. A 9 per cent growth in advertising revenue this year and suspiciously large exceptional reorganisation provisions of Pounds 116m suggest there is further growth to come. The administrators doubtless hope this will help them dispose of their 54.8 per cent holding at a handsome price, possibly through a placing. The trouble is that MGN's trading improvements may simply reflect the smack of firm management following its unfortunate distractions. Once the immediate recovery story has run its course, doubts may resurface about the group's debt, dividend and long-term direction. It will be difficult for MGN to reduce year-end borrowings of Pounds 395m, suggesting another passed dividend this year. The task will be made all the harder by the fall in the Daily Mirror's circulation following last July's price rise. Given the current hostilities in the tabloid market, it will be difficult to recover sales.</p>

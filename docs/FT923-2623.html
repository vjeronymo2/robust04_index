			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / International Company News: Heinz seeks stake in Wattie Foods H J HEINZ, the large US foods group with extensive overseas operations, is holding talks with Australia's Goodman Fielder Wattie about the purchase of a strategic stake in Wattie Foods, the GFW subsidiary which is New Zealand's biggest producer of canned goods. Wattie Foods became part of GFW through the merger of Australian-based Goodman Fielder and New Zealand's Wattie group in 1987. Besides producing canned goods, Wattie Foods also manufactures a range of other products, including frozen food and ice cream. The talks came to light when the New Zealand Commerce Commission revealed that Heinz has applied for clearance to buy up to 100 per cent of Wattie. Yesterday in Pittsburgh, the US food group acknowledged that the application had been filed, although it said that matters were at a fairly preliminary stage. Heinz declined to state whether it was aiming for an outright purchase of Wattie Foods or whether it would consider a smaller equity stake. Only last month, Mr Tony O'Reilly, Heinz's chairman, said that his company was looking for acquisitions worldwide, but particularly in Asia. The US company has a well-established subsidiary in Australia that produces a range of products from baby foods to baked beans, but it has no operations in New Zealand. About 40 per cent of Heinz's Dollars 6.5bn annual sales already come from outside the US. GFW has been looking for a shareholder to buy around 25 to 50 per cent of the Wattie Foods subsidiary, in line with its plans to float the rest of the shares later this year. Mr Michael Nugent, GFW chief executive, said in Wellington on Tuesday that directors wanted to find 'strategic shareholders' to bolster the public float, which is expected to raise close to NZDollars 500m (USDollars 280m). GFW said yesterday talks with Heinz were proceeding, but no offer had been received. It added that Heinz was one of a number of parties interested in buying into Wattie. GFW said: 'We don't think anyone is close to making an offer.' It added that it had a 'fairly inflexible' timetable for the float, with a prospectus due to be released in the middle of next month. GFW intends to reinvest proceeds from the Wattie disposal in expanding its role in the Australian cereal business.</p>

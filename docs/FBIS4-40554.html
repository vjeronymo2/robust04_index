			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Manki Ponomarev: "Fear Is Receding, but the </F> Threat Still Exists"]    [Text] A truly symbolic fact. Today not one of the many  hundreds of our strategic nuclear missiles located in silos, on  mobile systems, and on board submarines is any longer aimed at  any target on U.S. or British territory. Nor do the United  States and Britain now target their strategic missiles on  targets in Russia or on any other former Soviet territory.    The abandonment of reciprocal missile targeting confirms  that, for all the complexity and ambiguity of the international  situation and despite all the conflicts, including armed  conflicts, which are poisoning the atmosphere in the world, the  threat of nuclear war is receding. It is doing so slowly,  getting held up time and again on the intervening borders, but  nonetheless increasingly noticeably even to the naked eye. At  the same time fear of the possibility of such a threat is also  receding.    More and more evidence of this is coming to light. KRASNAYA  ZVEZDA said not so long ago that the United States had adopted  the decision to abandon the "Doomsday" program, which provided  for the creation of underground shelters for the purpose of  ensuring the continuity of the country's political and military  leadership in the event of a nuclear conflict. This program,  which, so THE NEW YORK TIMES writes, had recently appeared  merely "a pale shadow of the concept approved by President  Reagan in 1983," has now been deemed to have lost its urgency.    The FRG Government intends to follow suit and take a similar  measure. A shelter designed to accommodate top government  establishments in the event of a nuclear war had been  constructed back in the sixties near Bonn -- between the towns  of Ahrweiler and Dernau. It was reckoned that this would enable  3,000 people to survive such a war. Galleries many kilometers  long, with working and living premises, storehouses for food and  other supplies, and even a cemetery-crematorium, were tunneled  at a depth of over 300 meters beneath the slopes of a mountain  covered with vineyards.    The question of ending further funding (more than 10 million  marks annually) to maintain the government shelter and its  defenses in working order is now at the decision stage. At the  same time supporters of such a measure recall that nuclear  shelters are already being sold off in Britain, and  approximately 800 of them have already acquired new owners, who  use them as wine cellars or mushroom farms.    Russia, incidentally, is also starting to take the same  path.  The majority of Yaroslavl's 200 shelters, constructed in the  past to save its residents in the event of war, are now being  fitted out as offices, stores, sports halls, production shops,  warehouses, and even auditoriums. At the same time the lessees  are obliged to maintain the shelters' equipment in working order  and to vacate them if an emergency should arise.    There is also, of course, far weightier confirmation of the  fact that the nuclear threat and also, at the same time, the  fear of it are increasingly receding into the past. It is  possible to recall that Britain has also recently begun to take  measures to reduce nuclear armaments by approximately 25  percent. In particular, the British Ministry of Defence has  abandoned plans to fit nuclear warheads to the 50 Tomahawk  cruise missiles being purchased from the United States and  earmarked for installation on Trafalgar-class attack submarines.  As for France, whereas only quite recently it was planned to  build six nuclear-powered submarines with nuclear ballistic  missiles, Paris has now decided to stop at four.    These are just a few examples which show, in fact, that the  fear of the possibility of a nuclear missile war being  unleashed, which hung over mankind for long years like the Sword  of Damocles, is gradually beginning to recede. But it is still  too soon to bang the drums -- suffice it to recall the grave  misgivings aroused by the situation taking shape on the Korean  Peninsula in the nuclear sphere. The threat of the uncontrolled  proliferation of nuclear weapons still seems real. No way can  this be disregarded.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 25 (CNS) -- Inflation rate generally  tends to move downwards this year but it may still stand at a  relatively high level, according to "Outlook of China Finance"  issued by the People's Bank of China which will cover prediction  of price trend for this year. [sentence as received]    The report by the central bank revealed that there were  several reasons to affect the price level for this year.  [sentence as received] First, the exchange rate for the  renminbi was unified effective on January 1 in the restructuring  of the foreign exchange system. As the gap between the market  exchange rate and the official exchange rate was rather great in  the course of the financial reform, prices for imported  commodities rose to some extent resulting from a rising  comprehensive exchange price on average following the  unification of the exchange rate for the renminbi.    Second, during the taxation reform, the general tax revenue  increased to a certain extent following the curbing of an  unauthorized practice in which localities made their own  decision to carry out tax reduction and exemption. As the  taxation restructuring was not fully understood by basic units  which resulted in inevitable mistakes, some price setting  entities capitalized the value added tax to raise commodity  price which directly led to a price hike. [paragraph as received]    Third, measures including a proposed price rise in crude oil  will be adopted within the year. A large-scale price  fluctuation for some corresponding commodities will appear  around the time when such measures are about to be implemented.    Fourth, rising prices for grains resulted in a climb of  prices for non-staple food, processed food products and poultry  eggs.    The central government has recently made clear that it was  determined to stabilize the economy and to lower the inflation  rate. The report said that such practice by the central  authorities was very important because it had influence on views  held by enterprises, local governments and individuals on the  economic development as well as on the inflation rate for this  year. [sentence as received]    The report also elaborated on the upholding of high interest  rate, strict restrictions on issuance of currency and the supply  of credit by the central bank for the first half of this year.  [sentence as received] Effects from such macro-economic  regulation will appear gradually which will in turn make the  inflation rate go downwards during the year.    The report, which will be issued late this month, therefore  expected that the inflation rate tended to go lower generally  during the year but there would be apparent fluctuation to some  extent which might see a comprehensive relatively high inflation  rate on average for the entire year.</p>

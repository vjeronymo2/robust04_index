			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Jose Ignacio Moreno Leon, the adviser to the finance  minister, has stated that the suspension of economic guarantees  is temporary. He also referred to objections raised by the  World Bank and explained that these are not a result of the  steps taken by the national government.    Moreno Leon said the measure to eliminate the VAT  [value-added tax] cannot be described as confusing because, no  matter what, the government will submit to Congress in the next  few days a bill establishing a tax on luxury items and wholesale  goods. These are measures that will replace the VAT while the  implementation of the VAT on wholesale goods continues.    Moreno Leon added that the idea is to establish a modern tax  structure that will allow the nation to close the fiscal gap,  put an end to the spiraling inflation rate, and, ultimately,  reduce the inflation rate. In terms of rates for bank debits,  the idea is to implement a 2-percent rate, but with a 31  December time limit because the rate would eventually be  replaced by a rate outlined within the new income tax law.    He concluded by noting that the state will fulfill its role  of safeguarding the common good, which is a duty that cannot be  delegated. The government views economic development as a goal  of social justice.    [Begin Moreno Leon recording] The government has been given  greater flexibility to continue to modernize the economy, while  attempting, as its main objective, to help the country as a  whole, rejecting the creation of special privileges. The  government must fight those who distort the market in order to  make the development that results from modernization one based  on social justice. [end recording]    In conclusion, the adviser said that currency control has  been ruled out completely.</p>

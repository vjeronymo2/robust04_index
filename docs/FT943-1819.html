			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Joking Apart - Theatre Watching Alan Ayckbourn's plays today prompts an increasingly two-pronged reaction. On the one hand, as soon as the curtain rises, you still feel that you have been watching this kind of play all your life. The middle-class English milieux that Ayckbourn puts onstage feel so normal, the kinds of remarks his characters make sound so ordinary, and the social satire involved is so classic. On the other hand, there is the peculiar fact that virtually no one else has been writing plays of this ilk for years. Ayckbourn today is becoming as isolated as Coward did in the 1950s: a virtuoso of an old but no longer fashionable school. Well, fashion be damned: the Greenwich Theatre has launched its new season with an old Ayckbourn play, Joking Apart, and the main emotion I felt on the opening night, returning to Ayckbourn, was blessed relief. A real play] - with characters and dialogue crafted from the first moment to the last; and without being reinterpreted by latterday concepts. A good Ayckbourn is sheerest tonic. Joking Apart (1979) is about a genuinely happy and fortunate couple, Richard and Anthea; but they themselves are not funny. All around them, however, are old friends who are increasingly unhappy and unfortunate, and who increasingly realise how unhappy and unfortunate they are. There are the useless new vicar Hugh (who falls in love with Anthea) and his nervous wife Louise (who winds up between stimulants and tranquillisers); and Sven (one of those people who is never wrong, until he is grimly forced to learn that he is usually wrong) and his wife Olive (who lives vicariously through him, though by the end she is learning that it is not worth it); and Brian (who fell in love with Anthea years ago, and can conceal this fact neither from her nor from his succession of subsequent girlfriends). And it is the disasters of their lives, as contrasted against the generous serenity of Richard's and Anthea's, which Ayckbourn makes so dreadfully funny. Yes, dreadfully funny. By the last scene I repeatedly found that no sooner did I guffaw with laughter that I had to clap my hand over my mouth in appalled embarrassment. A little of Sven's old self-assurance surfaces, as he watches Richard fixing some lights, and he tells him 'You'll never do it if you do it that way', at which point Richard proclaims: 'That's done it]'  -and, lo and behold, the lights work. Sven, crushed again, looks away in silence; he has grown resigned to defeat. Finally he makes an address to Anthea's daughter Debbie, 'on behalf of life's losers'. The pain through which you laugh at all this is Ayckbourn's special feat. It is a tribute to Ayckbourn's mastery that, even though I always remembered what would happen next, I still followed everything with wholly fresh delight. It is also a tribute to this Greenwich revival, directed by Robin Herford. All the players are good, and two are outstanding. John Arthur completely catches the difficult Sven, smouldering with barely hidden aggression; and has the brilliant timing whereby the simple repetition of 'Yes' (pause) 'Yes' (longer pause) 'Yes' sums up all his dawning sense of perpetual defeat. And Liz Crowther is uncannily fine as Louise, awkward and tense and brittle with her husband and everyone else. Looking someone in the eye and talking to them at the same time is too much for her; so she does one or the other. Greenwich Theatre, until October 29.</p>

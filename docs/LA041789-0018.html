			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> URBAN, RURAL UNITE FOR A NEW WATER ETHIC  </P> <P> Water policies for California remain as uncertain and tumultuous as they were  during the bitter 1982 Peripheral Canal referendum. Northern-Southern  California divisions, conflicts between environmentalists and the water  industry and growing tensions between urban and agricultural users all reflect  the lack of consensus.  </P> <P> Part of the uncertainty is based on the erosion of water industry clout --  exercised by a longstanding coalition of public agencies and private interests.  This coalition recently has demonstrated a declining aptitude for setting the  water agenda. Water-industry lobbying groups, such as the Assn. of California  Water Agencies, continue to argue the need to build and expand. But the cost  and the environmental consequences of constructing new, large-scale water  development projects no longer generate automatic support from the Legislature,  the media or the public.  </P> <P> Even with the turmoil of current water politics, we see the possibility of a  new type of alliance based on the development of emerging social movements in  both urban and rural communities. These are movements concerned with the  quality of daily life, growth and development issues, the continuing expansion  of the urban megalopolis and the agribusiness empires of the Central Valley and  the need for a new ethic of respect for the land and for community or  neighborhood. The hazards of chemical-intensive agricultural production, urban  expansion and water development are key issues for a new urban/agricultural  water alliance.  </P> <P> Such an alliance can play a crucial role in establishing what the staff of the  state Water Resource Control Board has called "a new water ethic." Such a water  ethic would consist of the following guidelines:  </P> <P>  -- The greater the use, the higher the price. The current pricing structure in  the state and federal water systems is neither fair nor efficient. The big  price breaks given large-scale farm businesses encourage industrial-like  farming operations, heavy pesticide use, farming of marginal lands and  employment of farm laborers working under serf-like conditions. In urban areas,  the prevalent approach is to charge the same rate to everyone -- including new  users such as developers in outlying areas and big users such as industry and  owners of large-estate homes.  </P> <P> A more equitable and efficient system would operate on the principle of the  greater the use, the higher the price. In agriculture, water subsidies would be  strictly limited to 960 acres or less to protect and encourage smaller,  residential family farmers, while larger water users would be charged a  substantially higher price. These would include farm-management arrangements  that have been used to mask larger farm holdings. In the cities, small  residential water users would be protected while the largest and newest users  would pay higher fees, reflecting the additional costs they bring to bear on  the system.  </P> <P>  -- A rural community betterment fund. In the last several years, talk of water  transfers or sale of water by agricultural to urban users has become popular.  Such a proposal often benefits the major owners who control most of the land  and thus the water rights to the land. But there has been little discussion of  how to protect the people and communities whose livelihoods depend on  agriculture. Water transfers from agriculture to urban users can depress rural  communities by eliminating jobs and taking lands off the tax rolls. A community  betterment fund established through transfer or sales proceeds and controlled  by local rural communities would be a good starting point to address those  impacts.  </P> <P>  -- Water quality as a priority. The issue of water quality has become a  dominant concern of urban residents. Less known is the pollution of water  supplies in rural areas, where thousands of wells have been contaminated by  pesticides. The water agencies, in the business of development and expansion,  have to reorder their priorities to place water quality at the top. That  requires a major effort aimed at reducing or eliminating the use of high  volumes of pesticides, industrial solvents and industrial and commercial  chemicals that are the major culprits of our deteriorating water quality.  </P> <P>  -- Greater accountability: opening up the water industry. Water agencies are  some of our most unaccountable and inaccessible public decision-making bodies.  Elections are undemocratic, decisions are made without public input, and the  water agencies function in a kind of "clubby" atmosphere with their  private-interest counterparts. The inner workings of water agencies have to be  opened to the public, the media and the Legislature. Water agency elections  with one person/one vote would be a good starting point. Such a system would  replace current practices, such as one acre/one vote for many irrigation  districts and the appointment, instead of election, of urban agency directors.  </P> <P> Due to the turmoil in water policy today, certain urban environmentalists and  legislators have called for a Northern California-Southern California urban  water alliance against the Central Valley. That is a mistake, one that is both  polarizing and shows a lack of sensitivity to rural issues and agriculture.  Many small family farmers are at the forefront of a new land ethic, farming  without chemicals in an environmentally sensitive manner. Urban residents share  some of these same values placed in an urban context. A dialogue has to be  established, creating a new understanding: The interests in protecting the land  and those who work it are compatible with protecting communities and the people  who live there and drink the water. We all want to be safe.  </P></p>

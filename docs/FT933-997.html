			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Sport: The Big Blue of the deep blue sea - Sailing THE Farr Hegemony. It sounds like a third-rate historical novel set in Nepal. In fact, Bruce Farr is a shy New Zealand yacht designer. His hegemony is among the Whitbread Round the World Race fleet which leaves Southampton today. Three of the five 80ft maxi yachts are from Farr; all but two of the new W60 class are from his drawing board. Statistics alone make it likely that a Farr yacht will win the 32,000-mile Whitbread race. Even the great Olin Stephens, patriarch of the New York firm Sparkman &amp; Stephens, never achieved this kind of dominance in the sport. Rival designers understandably chafe at the presumption that there is only one choice for a skipper who wants to win. Rob Humphreys, a top British designer, is responsible for the W60 entry Dolphin &amp; Youth, points out that his boat gave the Farr-designed Winston a neck-and-neck match in the New York / Southampton race earlier in the summer. The sport, he thinks, has an ethos like the one which once prevailed in the computer world ie 'No one ever got fired for buying IBM'. To compete in big professional races such as the Whitbread requires millions of dollars in sponsorship. Large corporations may not know much about sailing, but for IBM read Farr. His business, based in Annapolis, Maryland, employs just 12 people and 10 of them are yacht designers. Each year it controls race boat projects worth nearly Dollars 100m, a startling position for such a small business headed by a 44-year-old. Farr says he is uninterested in the money. 'It is much more important to be the best in the world than the richest,' he says emphatically. One story says a lot about Farr's style. In 1988 he was responsible for the New Zealand challenge for the America's Cup in a 130ft sloop. American skipper Dennis Conner responded with a rule-busting catamaran and the US kept the trophy after an ill-tempered Cup that featured more lawyers than sailors. At a news conference after the race, a tired and emotional Conner insulted Farr in front of the world's media. But the icy Kiwi regained his self-control and the moment passed. Fast forward five years to the current Whitbread race. Conner has the dollars of RJ Reynolds and its Winston cigarette brand at his disposal to give him the easily the best-funded campaign. Without hesitation Conner chooses Farr to design the boat. In England recently Farr admitted that the two had not met, or even spoken about the project. Farr's people talk to Dennis's people. But the yacht is real enough and is one of the favourites to win the race. Bruce Farr is one of a generation of New Zealanders now at the top wherever one goes in world yachting. During the late 1970s his boats would continually break new ground within the design limits of the International Offshore Rule which covered most racing and win every prize in sight. The IOR would then attempt to close off a particular route, only for Farr to find another design avenue. At that stage of his career it was probably the quality of his imagination that was unusual. What was to make Farr special was the willingness to channel the income that comes to a 'hot' designer into endless generic R &amp; D. Around 20 per cent of Farr Associates practice earnings is still spent, year in, year out, on pure research. He is the biggest customer of the Wolfson Unit at Southampton University, a tank-testing and wind-tunnel facility that is regarded as the world leader in hull and foil evaluation. The quality of the Farr computer Velocity Prediction Programmes is legendary. Before deciding whether to build a maxi or a W60, Grant Dalton, skipper of New Zealand Endeavour, commissioned a Dollars 50,000 study from Farr on which of the two classes would be fastest around the world. The VPP gave the bigger boats and advantage of perhaps half-day - probably statistically invalid, given weather variables - but Dalton had enough faith to commission a maxi. Perhaps the most extraordinary thing is that when the Farr fleet sails today, for all the millions of dollars invested by bitter rivals, there will not be a single complaint that perhaps one client has had better service or benefitted from technology developed for another. Integrity comes with the Farr label. The 'Chinese walls' between one design and another are unclimbable. As the yachts leave on the 5,000-mile first leg dash to Uruguay, this race is probably already over for Farr. He is thinking about hulls and keels for the 1995 America's Cup.</p>

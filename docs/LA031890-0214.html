			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY THE CRITICS: MARRIED TO THE MOB  </P> <P> In this hilarious and stylish 1988 Jonathan Demme comedy, Mafia widow Michelle  Pfeiffer finds herself on the run, pursued by Dean Stockwell's lecherous don  and aided, more or less, by Matthew Modine's sweetly square FBI agent.  </P> <P> Sunday 5 p.m. TMC  </P> <P> The Postman Always Rings Twice  </P> <P> This is the steamy, guilt-ridden 1946 Tay Garnett version with Lana Turner,  always in white, most memorably in a two-piece bathing suit, and John Garfield.  </P> <P> Wednesday 10 a.m. KCOP  </P> <P> Some Like It Hot  </P> <P> Billy Wilder's 1959 classic may just be the funniest movie since the advent of  sound. Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are Chicago musicians who have the bad luck  to witness the St. Valentine Day's Massacre and wind up in drag with an  all-girl band heading for Miami. Its vocalist is, of course, Marilyn Monroe.  </P> <P> Wednesday 8 p.m. KTTV  </P> <P> Seven Samurai  </P> <P> The great 1954 Akira Kurosawa classic stars Toshiro Mifune as one of seven  samurai hired by a small village to protect it from bandits. For all its  innovative and dynamic battle scenes, it is a richly contemplative, reflective  experience.  </P> <P> Friday 9 p.m. KCET Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

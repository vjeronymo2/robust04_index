			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / M&amp;S extends its retailing lead: Pre-tax rise of 16% at lower end of forecasts - Pounds 1bn expansion planned Marks and Spencer yesterday extended its lead as the UK's most profitable retailer, announcing a 16 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 851.5m. The company also said it planned to spend more than Pounds 1bn in the next three years on stepping up expansion in the UK, continental Europe and east Asia, and was looking at opening stores in China and Japan. Last year, Marks and Spencer's profit of Pounds 736.5m was only just ahead of J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer. But with Sainsbury this year reporting only Pounds 369m after exceptional charges - or Pounds 777m before these - M&amp;S's lead was unchallenged. 'We have shown we can deliver profitable growth in this country and overseas, consistently,' said Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman. 'If we can do that in the kind of recession we have been through, we think we are in good shape for the years ahead.' But M&amp;S shares fell 12 1/2 p to 412p on what was seen as a cautious results statement - warning that cost inflation might re-emerge later this year - and disappointment that profits were at the lower end of expectations. They were reduced by a Pounds 16m increase in pension costs. Group turnover increased 10 per cent to Pounds 6.54bn, and operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds 873.4m. Sir Richard said the improvement resulted from M&amp;S's strategy of offering 'outstanding value' by improving product quality and trimming some prices, particularly in food. That had been made possible by cutting costs and investing in information technology, which allowed the group to cut its gross margin while maintaining its net margin. Resulting volume increases had benefited both M&amp;S and its suppliers, which were able to operate at maximum efficiency. UK clothing sales had increased 7.5 per cent in a market which grew only 4.5 per cent, and food sales had increased 7.1 per cent, against growth in the market of 5.9 per cent. Total UK turnover grew 9.5 per cent to Pounds 5.48bn, and operating profits 18 per cent to Pounds 809.9m. The group's financial services business also showed double-figure increases in sales and profits. Growth rates outside the UK were even faster. Total sales in north America, continental Europe and east Asia increased 16 per cent to Pounds 852.3m, and profits 13 per cent to Pounds 63.5m. Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 20.9p, and the company is recommending a final dividend of 6.7p, giving a total of 9.2p - a 14 per cent increase.

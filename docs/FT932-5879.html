			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK will challenge EC rule on 48-hour week THE UK for the first time faces having to legislate to guarantee British workers' mandatory time off, after its 11 EC partners yesterday voted through the Community's working time directive, the so-called 48-hour-week law. But Britain said it would challenge the directive at the European Court of Justice and would not start putting it on the UK statute book until that ruling came through. After blocking the measure for nearly three years, Britain abstained yesterday, in the face of its partners' determination to force through what they regard as a much-needed gesture towards reinforcing workers' rights. The UK is challenging the legal basis of the directive, proposed by the European Commission as a health and safety measure and thus requiring a majority vote rather than unanimity. This deprived the UK of its national veto. But over the past 15 months, Britain has negotiated assiduously to dilute the impact of the measure, while making light of its possible impact, which would be mostly in the UK. Both British and Brussels officials privately concur that the UK's legal challenge is unlikely to succeed. Mr David Hunt, the new employment secretary, claimed the Commission had abused its treaty powers and said: 'I am confident we will win' in the court. But he was keen at the same time to emphasise that 'we have drawn most of the teeth from this directive', which in its original form would have been 'inflexible, extremely damaging, and placed enormous burdens on British industry'. The UK secured a 10-year grace period before it might have to introduce the 48-hour week, which its partners must implement within three years. After the additional seven years, there will be a 'review' of the derogation, leaving open the possibility that it may be extended. British workers who want to work more than 48 hours a week will be able to do so; those who do not will have the protection of the law. Employers will have to keep records of both categories, for inspection by national health and safety authorities whose job it will be to ensure no discrimination. But workers in the UK will for the first time have the legal right to: A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours. Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours. At least one day a week off. No more than eight hours a shift on average for night work. Four weeks' annual paid holiday, although the UK would have to guarantee only three weeks for the six years after the directive is formally adopted, probably in seven months' time. There are exemptions on the working week rules for transport, agriculture, fisheries, all work at sea such as the offshore oil industry, and - at UK insistence - for doctors in training. Ireland and Denmark are the only other countries affected by the 48-hour week limit. Germany, Italy, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal will have to extend guaranteed paid leave; and these countries, plus Greece and the Netherlands, will have to modify laws on time off. The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the government's undertaking not to implement the directive in the UK until its legality was determined by the European Court. But Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: 'Once again Britain is the odd one out in Europe. It will send the signal to potential investors that it is less committed to Europe than our competitors.' Observer, Page 17</p>

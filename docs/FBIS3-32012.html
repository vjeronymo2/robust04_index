They were trying to go to the United  States.    On the morning of 28 January, a group of five who reached  land in the vicinity of Nuevitas explained that they had wrecked  off the north coast.    The rapid mobilization of vessels of the Border Guard Troops  and other institutions permitted us to rescue another five  people, two of whom had to be hospitalized quickly. An infant  just a few months old was also hospitalized, and his life is in  danger.    The individuals who risked their lives and those of innocent  children were attracted by the criminal propaganda from the  United States that encourages them; now, in addition to whatever  legal responsibilities may befall them, they will have on their  consciences the tragic results of their actions.    This is the result of the work of those in the United States  who are doing everything possible to encourage an illegal exodus  and who welcome as heroes those who, risking their lives, take  to the sea -- while the U.S. authorities apply an ever more  restrictive policy in granting visas to people who take steps to  travel legally.    It has also just been reaffirmed in Havana that the United  States has repeatedly failed to comply, by a big margin, with  the agreement signed with Cuba in 1984 under which they were  supposed to authorize the legal immigration of up to 20,000  people each year. Therefore, Washington must shoulder its share  of responsibility for incidents such as this.</p>

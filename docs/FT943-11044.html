			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Cost of government promotions attacked Advertising campaigns promoting official government policy - and often coinciding with the aims of the Conservative party - cost the taxpayer Pounds 73m in the last financial year, Mr Matthew Taylor, the Liberal Democrat MP for Truro, said yesterday. He called for an inquiry into the usefulness of government advertising and the need for effective monitoring to deter waste. Mr Taylor, who is in charge of his party's campaigns and communications unit, said it was a 'scandal' that it had cost Pounds 1,007 for each response received to an advertising campaign encouraging people to work in the health service. Market research had shown that a Pounds 400,000 campaign encouraging tenants to become owner-occupiers through the rent-to-mortgage scheme was not successful. Mr Taylor also attacked the Department of Employment for the advertisement campaign for its Jobfinder grants which, in the case of the west Midlands, cost Pounds 49 for every Pounds 100 grant eventually awarded.</p>

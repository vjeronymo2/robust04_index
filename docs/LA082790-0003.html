			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE CALENDAR: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> PEEK INSIDE A MAYAN TOMB  </P> <P> The Rio Azul archeological project in Guatemala is considered one of the finest  examples of early classic Mayan culture, encompassing the period from about AD  250-600. "Rio Azul: City of the Storm God," highlighting discoveries from the  excavation, will be at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County  beginning Saturday.  </P> <P> Archeologists began excavating the site in 1982, but found that many of the  burial sites had been sacked by looters. Artifacts from unlooted sites,  however, proved to be an invaluable source of new information about the Mayan  people and will be on display. A highlight of the exhibit is a replica of a  tomb re-creating the scene at the moment it was discovered by archeologists.  </P> <P> "Rio Azul" continues through Nov. 11.

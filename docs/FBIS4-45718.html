			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown, environment correspondent: "Pit </F> Closures Fuel Optimism Over Cuts in Acid Rain"]    [Text] The closure of pits and coal-fired power stations  will dramatically reduce the effects of acid rain on the United  Kingdom, although more than half the country still suffers its  effects, government scientists said yesterday.    Its cost in damage to buildings, crops and trees is hard to  calculate, but they believe curbing it will save between &pound;1  billion and &pound;2.3 billion.    Pending European agreements will cut British sulphur  emissions by 80 per cent by 2010, stopping further damage in all  but 5 per cent of the country and allowing lakes, rivers, trees  and heather to start recovering.    Scientists have been studying "critical loads" -- the point  at which acid rain begins to kill or injure plants, animals, and  fish. But damage to buildings is also severe and some ancient  cathedrals have been irreparably eroded. In chalky areas, where  the acid is neutralised as it falls, there is virtually no  effect on soils. In areas of granite, peat or sand where there  is natural acidity, the extra acid falling as rain kills fish  and plants and damages trees.    The Government has already overseen a 30 per cent reduction  in sulphur dioxide emissions from the 1980 level. Last week  officials agreed to take this to 50 per cent by 2000, 70 per  cent by 2005, and 80 per cent by 2010. Ministers are expected to  agree the new protocol in the next few days.    Although the targets appear drastic, the Government is  likely  to achieve them by closing the coal mines and switching from  coal to gas-fired power generation. Gas does not produce the  sulphur for acid rain.    Maps produced by scientists show that 121,000 square  kilometres of the UK is being damaged by acid rain out of a  total of 250,000 square kilometres. This will be reduced to  14,000 square kilometres if the targets are met.    Even so, the ceasing of acid rain does not guarantee the  reversal of the process of damage. In some areas it may be 20  years or more before the biological life begins to recover, and  in many the soil structure has changed so much that the plant  and fish life which recolonises will be different from the  original.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] Moscow hopes that soon after the Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev signs the Partnership For Peace program in  Brussels on Wednesday yet another program "Russia-NATO" will be  signed.    As a senior foreign ministry official has recalled in an  interview with INTERFAX, the "Russia-NATO" program was submitted  to NATO's Headquarters just a month ago. "This substantive  document mirrors our vision of relations with NATO, Russia's  role and place in Europe and elsewhere. It would certainly be  lovely to sign two programs at once, but the men at NATO will  apparently need time to study the Russian proposals. So, we do  not dramatize the situation, nor do we intend to spur events  deliberately," the diplomat said.    He did not rule out that in Brussels Kozyrev and NATO  leaders  might sign a declaration of intent to promote cooperation and  partnership. "We feel the Russia-NATO program could be the  platform for that," he said.</p>

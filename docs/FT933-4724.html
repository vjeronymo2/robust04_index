			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Gore pledges Dollars 108bn savings with US government overhaul MR AL GORE, US vice-president, yesterday promised savings of Dollars 108bn (Pounds 71.50bn) over five years from his proposals to cut waste, purge rules and streamline bureaucracy in the federal government. Mr Gore's report offers a recipe for creating 'a government that works better and costs less' by scrapping cumbersome federal rules for buying equipment or hiring staff and cutting 252,000 government jobs. The vice-president has been regaling Washington for weeks with the elaborate regulations he found in government purchasing manuals. These include the 10-page specifications for 'ash receivers, tobacco, desk type' which, to qualify for government offices must break into no more than 35 pieces when smashed on a maple plank, or the specular reflectance required for federal floor wax. 'We found that government really does not work very well in ways that will take a long time to fix. It is government using a quill pen in the age of WordPerfect,' he said. The report also tries to take a second bite at a number of programmes that President Bill Clinton tried and failed to kill in his budget proposals earlier this year, such as subsidies for producers of mohair and honey. Standing in front of two fork-lift trucks piled high with government rules and regulations, Mr Gore said his review could produce results, despite opposition in some quarters of Congress to many of its suggestions. Around one-third of the suggestions in the Gore report would require legislative action. For the remainder, which could be accomplished by executive order without any change in the law, Mr Clinton promised to take the necessary action. 'This is one report that will not gather dust in a warehouse,' Mr Clinton said. While members of Congress appeared reluctant yesterday to criticise a report whose general theme of cutting government waste commands wide popular support, many are already rallying to oppose efforts to cut programmes that fall under their jurisdiction or benefit their constituencies. Some of Mr Gore's proposals cut across the entire federal government. They include phasing out the federal personnel manual, a code of practice on hiring and firing which requires 40,000 people to enforce it, coupled with greater leeway for agencies and departments to set their own employment rules. Agencies would also be freer to buy equipment without going through laborious government purchasing processes that mean the taxpayer pays more for equipment than a private company would pay. The report proposes merging or consolidating a number of government departments. The Federal Bureau of Investigation would take over the responsibilities of the Drug Enforcement Agency, and possibly also of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The air traffic control system should be spun off into a government-owned corporation funded by user fees. Branch offices would also be slashed among several organisations and agencies. The report would require all agencies to review their regulations over the next two years with the aim of eliminating half. Page 6 Reinventing government is not easy</p>

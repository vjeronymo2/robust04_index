			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / China's Investment Revolution: Many chins make light work of razor sales targets FOR Gillette, the Boston-based razor manufacturer, China has switched from being a possibility to a reality in three years. The groundwork was laid in the early 1980s. The US company entered mainland China ten years ago, via a small 50:50 joint venture, called Shenmei Daily Use Products. This operation was negotiated with the Chinese authorities in Liaoning province, to the north-east of Beijing. It comprised an existing plant in Shenyang, which - with expertise from its US partner - has produced double-edge blades and razors under the Rhino brand name for a decade. Gillette says the venture has been consistently profitable, and 'sells everything we can make'. But it remains small: annual production is around 60m units, in a market which absorbs 1bn units a year. Mr Gaston Levy, head of Gillette's international group, says the northern location is not ideal. 'It became a regional issue, but, as a pilot project, Shenmei did allow us to understand the Chinese mentality.' So, in about 1988, Gillette began to look at central and southern regions. The crushing of the pro-democracy movement in Tiananmen Square in 1989 caused the group to put plans on hold, but then it began talking to the authorities about setting up a joint venture with China's leading blade manufacturer in Shanghai. Negotiations, spanning layers of officialdom, took two years. Mr Levy remembers that his counterparts insisted on talking only after dinner. Typically, the Chinese would then retire, to discuss their bargaining position, in the early hours. When they returned, the US side would also politely bow, hold its own caucus, and respond. By three or four o'clock, a negotiating point might be resolved. This laborious process was, he thinks, an indication of the Chinese distrust of foreigners: 'They're very, very careful - caution is much greater than anywhere else in the world.' But, last August, Gillette had a deal. A joint venture with the Shanghai Razor Blade Factory was agreed, setting up a new company called Gillette Shanghai. Gillette obtained a 70 per cent share in the business and management control, while the Chinese retained 30 per cent. All of Shanghai's plant was taken over by the new company, and the joint venture agreement called for 'first phase' capital investment of Dollars 60m. Gillette would find Dollars 45m. Today, about two-thirds of this money has been invested and the operation employs more than 1,000 people. Gillette, meanwhile, has seven expatriates - some of Chinese origin - working there. The business, says Mr Levy, is profitable. The deal took Gillette's share of the domestic blade market from about 10 per cent to over 70 per cent. Mr Levy admits that China is not the most compelling of markets in terms of 'shaving usage'. The former Soviet republics, for example, have a much higher 'shaving frequency' and associated blade demand. But China's appeal is partly its sheer size - a population of 1.1bn means a lot of blade sales, even if shaving is not ubiquitous - and partly the potential it offers for pushing more advanced products. At present, basic blades sell for the equivalent of three US cents. By nudging consumers towards more sophisticated shaving products, Gillette sees scope for initially doubling this, and eventually raising it five or six-fold. Already, the Shanghai plant is being geared up for production of disposable razors. Mr Levy does not make light of the problems. Language is an obvious one, causing the US company to station interpreters on site. Marketing is another. The joint venture is required to supply the Chinese government with a minimum number of blades for export, but can then sell its remaining output as it wishes. The operation had previously depended on the government purchasing network, but Gillette is trying to develop its own wholesale distribution system. Outside of the Shanghai area, says Mr Levy, this is still a tough task. The much-feared overheating of the Chinese economy is a background concern. 'Inflation would worry us,' says Mr Levy, noting that it has reached double-digit figures in some areas. Against these negative factors, there is the relative flexibility which the Chinese system offers, and the deep-rooted commercialism of its people. Gillette is free to remit profits if it wishes, and to choose how products are marketed and sold. Meanwhile, the much-vaunted 'trading mentality', in Mr Levy's eyes, differentiates China hugely from parts of eastern Europe. Certainly, Gillette's commitment to China seems to be increasing. The company is now edging into the toothbrush business. Last month it set up a small joint venture plant in Shanghai, employing under 100 people and producing Oral-B toothbrushes - both for sale in the Chinese domestic market and for export. Again, China does not look the most promising of markets: there is reckoned to be one dentist for every 77,000 people, and the 'average' Chinese buys one toothbrush every four years. But the market is huge, and the government is anxious to improve healthcare. Demand for better-quality dental products, Gillette argues, can only increase.</p>

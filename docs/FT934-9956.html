			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / International Company News: Akzo eyes most of Nobel WHEN AKZO of the Netherlands and Nobel Industries of Sweden unveil the outcome of their 'merger' talks today, there is little doubt they will effectively be disclosing a takeover by Akzo of all or parts of Nobel, write Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm and Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam It could just involve coatings businesses of the two speciality chemicals groups. But it could be something much broader, embracing all of Nobel's operations, except possibly its high technology unit, Spectra-Physics. Coatings is the obvious area of overlap. Akzo's coatings activities account for Fl 4.1bn (Dollars 2.2bn), or 25 per cent of group sales, while Nobel generates SKr6.7bn (Dollars 840m) of sales in paints, coatings and adhesives out of total turnover of SKr21.5bn. A merger would enable Akzo to rival ICI's world dominance in coatings and to emerge clearly as the European number one. ICI and Akzo each have 6 per cent of the fragmented European market, with Nobel just behind them at 5.5 per cent. The view that the merger could be more extensive is based on the fact that Nobel is majority-owned by the Swedish state, through a 'bad bank' unit called Securum which would like to sell off as much of the company as possible 'I wouldn't be surprised if pretty well all of Nobel was involved in the deal,' says Mr Alastair Kilgour, chemicals analyst with BNP Capital Markets in London. 'Securum would rather sell it as a package, than bit by bit.' At the very least Akzo could also be interested in buying Nobel's pulp and paper chemicals unit, with annual sales of SKr4.3bn. Ironically, Nobel was near to finalising a deal to buy Akzo's much smaller paper chemicals operations before news of the broader merger talks emerged. There are also possible synergies between the groups' biotechnology and pharmaceutical activities. Analysts say Nobel's main problem is its debt, amounting to some SKr16bn at the end of last year, compared with shareholders equity of SKr8bn. Heavy interest payments on the debt are the main reason the group was only able to record a SKr237m profit last year, when its operating profit amounted to SKr1.3bn. Akzo's readiness to contemplate a full or partial takeover of Nobel marks the Dutch company's return to the field of major acquisitions. This follows an absence of several years in which it has concentrated on digesting the big takeovers of the mid-1980s and on streamlining its internal structure. Since 1990, Akzo's acquisitions have been few, but have included two in the coatings sector. It has swapped its engineering plastic business for the powder coatings activities of fellow Dutch chemicals group DSM, and has acquired the UK paint company Macpherson, challenging ICI in its home market. In the 1980s Akzo undertook big acquisitions in coatings in Europe and the US, more than doubling the share in group sales from just 11 per cent in 1980. It also reduced the importance of the fibre sector to below 25 per cent of sales from 35 per cent in 1980, partly through divestments. Some analysts believe Akzo may pay for the latest transaction with its own shares. If so, the deal's timing would seem to be calculated to benefit from the 60 per cent rise in its share price over the past 12 months.</p>

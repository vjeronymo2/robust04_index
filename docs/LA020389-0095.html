			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: VENICE  </P> <P> Art either confronts us with entropy and vanitas, or -- like the paintings of  Santa Barbara's Rick Stich -- reassures us that there is still beauty and truth  in spite of the spots on the rug and the six o'clock news.  </P> <P> For years, Stich has made loosely abstracted paintings from plein-air studies  of shimmery koi, reflective ponds and idyllic gardens at Santa Barbara's Alice  Keck Park. He's in the tradition of nature abstractionists from Monet to Dove  to our own David Hockney whose pockets of color turned to light are formal  cousins to these schematic, graceful ripples and plump fish. Besides koi,  paintings show dense florals, water careening over smooth rocks, birds in  flight. All are done with an ungainly roughness that's needed in paintings that  are almost too pretty for their own good. The huge three-paneled "Swim in the  Light" carries us from the poppy yellow of sunset over water to the transparent  blue-grays and squiggly shadows of dusk. Stich may paint the best of all  possible worlds but always with an eye to the expressive and compositional  potential of light, color and shape.  </P> <P> A rare, don't-miss sampling of quality Indian miniatures is concurrently on  view at the gallery's Venice Boulevard space. Dated from the 16th-to-18th  centuries when royal houses in India prized and cultivated tiny scenes of  mythology and court life, the works are pristine jewels in the usual brilliant  opaque pigments and fastidious detail of illumination. Show-stoppers include a  prince caressing his favorite consort as dozens from his harem (each a minute  individualized portrait) watch, serve, dance, converse. A gorgeous isolated  portrait of a prince hints at the sort of stuff that took Manet and modernism  by storm. Borrow the magnifying glass to really canvas one after another of  these charming scenes.

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers move early to beat the September rush THE international bond market was active yesterday as borrowers sought to beat the traditional rush for funds at the start of September. Syndicate managers said they expected further offerings in the coming week since many borrowers were asking banks to bid for mandates. 'The markets are in great shape and investor demand is good,' said one syndicate manager. Yesterday's offerings came in a variety of currencies. The Bank for Dutch Municipalities raised Fl 1bn in two equal tranches, one with a seven-year maturity which appealed more to international investors, and the other with a 15-year maturity which was aimed at the domestic market. Lead manager ABN Amro Bank said that the issuer had chosen those maturities because the 10-year area of the yield curve was out of favour with investors. Foreign borrowers are not expected to tap the Dutch market in the near future because of the lack of opportunities to swap the proceeds into other currencies. SNCF, the French state railway, established a new benchmark in the French bond market with its FFr3bn, 20-year issue. An official at the lead manager, Societe Generale, said investor demand for long-dated bonds enabled SNCF to achieve favourable terms. The issue's relatively tight pricing was offset by the generous discount. Many French long-dated bonds are trading at a substantial premium. SNCF's bonds, which have a coupon of 6 3/4 per cent, were priced to yield 18 basis points above the 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT bond due December 2012. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly. Another large issue was launched in the sterling market as Woolwich Building Society raised Pounds 200m through an offering of five-year Eurobonds. The five-year area is seen to be the cheapest part of the yield curve for borrowers. CSFB, the lead manager, said there was a lot of demand for the bonds outside the UK. The bonds were priced to yield 65 basis points over the 7 1/4 per cent UK government bond due 1998. When the bonds were freed to trade they were quoted at 99.47, below their re-offer price of 99.57, reflecting the weaker UK market. Sweden raised L200bn through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds, encouraged by the success of Rabobank's Eurolira offering on Wednesday. Sweden's deal was more generous than the Dutch bank's, reflecting its lower credit rating. The proceeds of the deal were understood to have been swapped into floating-rate lire. Halifax Building Society made its first public offering in the Swiss franc market, raising SFr150m through an issue of five-year bonds. The bonds were quoted at less 1.75 bid, from an issue price of 102.3. The Halifax said the proceeds had been swapped into sterling. Banca Nazionale del Lavoro chose the dollar sector for its first Eurobond offering since 1990. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, took the bank off its Creditwatch list last week and affirmed the bank's rating of A2.</p>

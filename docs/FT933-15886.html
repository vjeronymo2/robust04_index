			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Nafta jitters cut US-Mexican trade imbalance THE uncertainty over passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement through the US Congress has led to a narrowing of the US trade surplus with Mexico and a fall-off in US exports to its southern neighbour, economists say. The so-called 'Nafta jitters' may prove the Clinton administration's argument that a strong Mexico is a better market for US exports, they add. In April, the last month for which the US Commerce Department has figures, the US trade surplus with Mexico fell to Dollars 264m (Pounds 176m), from Dollars 299m in March and Dollars 591m in March 1992. US exports to Mexico in April dropped from Dollars 3.7bn to Dollars 3.6bn. According to an analysis produced by First Chicago Bank, the tightening in Mexican monetary policy, which began about 14 months ago, has eased demand for imported goods, 'while the fitful recovery in the US is increasing the demand for Mexican exports'. Since December the rate of growth of Mexican exports to the US had been higher than imports - for the first time since March 1990, said First Chicago. A Mexican official said: 'When people are ready to jump the ship because of Nafta, because of a worry about devaluation, the government is forced to tighten the ship.' Interest rates have risen to more than 15 per cent, depressing demand. 'The rate of growth in Mexico is slowing,' said Mr Chip Brown, an economist with Salomon Brothers. 'The slowdown in the Mexican economy means slower demand for US products.' The Clinton administration has been arguing - without much success - that 200,000 American jobs gained in the past few years would be lost if Nafta failed. Most US voters are sceptical of such claims; they are more conscious of jobs lost when factories shut down to relocate in Mexico. According to First Chicago the current trade trends will be sustained by continued slow growth in Mexico and economic recovery in the US.</p>

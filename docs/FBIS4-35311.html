			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Sandarusi: "Algeria: 70 Military </F> Slaughtered in Sidi Bel Abbess Barracks"]    [Excerpt] Washington, Algiers, AL-HAYAH -- The United  States yesterday expressed deep concern over the deterioration  of conditions in Algeria, reiterating its support for making  "serious political changes." This coincides with information  AL-HAYAH has received in Algiers to the effect that the security  situation has witnessed rapid deterioration in various parts of  the country, and that 70 of the military have been slaughtered  in a massacre carried out in an Army barracks in Sidi Bel Abbes  province (west of the capital).    Reliable Algerian sources told AL-HAYAH that military units  supported by aircraft moved the day before yesterday to the  suburbs of Tlemcen, west of the capital, following information  they had received about the presence in the area of armed groups  which participated in the attack on the barracks on the eve of  'Id al-Adha and seized large quantities of arms. Eyewitnesses  told AL-HAYAH that they had seen helicopters moving between the  barracks and Oran Hospital.    The reliable Algerian sources said that two officers from  the  barracks are thought to be implicated in the attack. It is  believed that they assumed the task of impairing the guards'  arms (by emptying their magazines) before the gunmen launched  their attack on the barracks, massacring the soldiers. About 70  soldiers were slaughtered with cold steel. Soldiers who escaped  the massacre said the two officers fled with the gunmen.    A week after the operation, security forces succeeded in  locating the gunmen's whereabouts and are currently besieging  them in Tlemcen suburbs. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Katri Peltola: "Feelings Heat Up in the </F> Parliamentary Debate on Drugs"]    [Text] The opposition would have preferred lighter  penalties for drug use than at present. During the plenary  session on Friday [19 November] 173 members of the Eduskunta  absented themselves from the vote.    The Eduskunta wants to retain drug use as a punishable act,  but a heated debate was engaged in during the plenary session on  Friday on the penalties prescribed by law. During the return  debate two bills were proposed, through which drug violations  would be transferred to the penal code.    The government essentially wants to preserve the present  penalties. Some members of the opposition would be willing to  lighten the maximum penalties prescribed by law because they are  simply not applied under current practice.    The members of the the Parliamentary Laws Committee engaged  in such a thorough debate on drugs that the other members of the  Eduskunta managed to beat a hasty retreat to their home grounds.  Fully 173 of the 200 members of the Eduskunta were absent from  the last vote of the plenary session at 1635 hours.    The vote related to the question as to whether the disputed  agriculture fund should be taken up for preliminary debate on  Monday or Tuesday. Some members of the Eduskunta would have  preferred to postpone debate on the issue until Tuesday so that  they would have time to obtain even more information on the  matter. However, the Speaker's Council proposal that it be  debated on Monday won out by a vote of 14 to 12.    The government is proposing that the illegal manufacture,  importing, exporting, transporting, distribution, possession,  and use of drugs be written into the revised penal code.    At the same time the minimum penalty for a drug felony would  increased to one year in prison.  <H5>  Origin of Illegal Money Must Be Reported </H5>   So-called money laundering would become a crime. Among other  things, banks would be obligated to report to government  officials if they suspect that a client is trying to conceal the  origin of money obtained illegally.    Justice Minister Hannele Pokka (Center Party) maintained  during the debate that the kind of maximum penalty for drug use  that is to be written into law is not a matter of indifference.  In her opinion, former Justice Minister Tarja Halonen's (Social  Democrat) "approach" to lowering the maximum penalty would be a  clear message to international criminals, among others. She was  supported by Conservative Kari Hakamies. "I am not willing to  accept the proposition that a faulty sentencing practice is a  good one," Halonen contended.    In agreement with Halonen's position was the Greens' Satu  Hassi, according to whom Pokka "is feigning ignorance" of the  fact that the intent, in connection with revision of the penal  code, is to write into law those penalties that are actually  applied. According to Hassi, there are no differences of opinion  on that point. On the other hand, according to him, there should  be a sharper distinction between penalties for using and selling  drugs.    During the debate concern was also raised over whether drug  users know that they can seek treatment without fear of being  caught.    Vesa Laukkanen, representing the Alternative for Finland  group, thought that the threat of punishment influences those  who are not using drugs. Users, however, can, of course, seek  treatment if they want to.    The government was also encouraged by the Eduskunta to look  into how a stage of treatment could be included in sentences.    Members of the Eduskunta representing the government parties  and the opposition were united in their concern over the  widespread use of drugs in prisons. [passage omitted]</p>

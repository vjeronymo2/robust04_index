			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Why provision of motorway service on M40 was delayed Sir, The letter from Miss Pirie (November 26) highlights the absence of services on the M40. I would like to make clear that my department proposed three motorway service areas for the M40, intending to open them at about the same time as the road. All three schemes, however, provoked objections which led to lengthy public inquiries and substantial delays in provision. Planning clearance was eventually refused for one of the sites, but it was granted for the other two and construction is now under way; both are due to open next year. In the meantime temporary facilities, open 24 hours a day, are signposted from the motorway at Junction 10 and between Junctions 13 and 15. Following a commitment in the Citizen's Charter, future motorway service areas will be promoted by the private sector rather than the department. I understand that at least three planning applications for further service areas on the M40 are currently under con-sideration. Robert Key, minister for roads and traffic, Department of Transport, 2 Marsham Street, London SW1P 3EB</p>

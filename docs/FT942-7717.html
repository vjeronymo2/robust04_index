			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Right connection for European expansion - Andrew Bolger on a US purchase that changed the horizons of Senior Engineering Flexible couplings and expansion joints may sound unglamorous, but these products have transformed the strategy and prospects of Senior Engineering Group. Until recently, Senior was best known as a solid if rather unexciting supplier of boilers and ductwork. Yet the last two years have seen it withdraw from the mining equipment business due to the shrinking of the UK coal industry. It has also stopped competing for large turnkey power projects because of the consequent reduction in coal-fired power generation. More significantly, Senior has acquired a US business with a commanding position in the US automotive market - a base from which the UK group has started to expand into the European motors market through heavy investment. Flexonics, which Senior bought for Pounds 28m in 1992, has a dominant position in the US automotive market for flexible couplings and expansion joints, used to reduce exhaust vibration and cut emissions. It will invest a further Pounds 28m over the next two years in this business, which is benefiting from tougher pollution controls. Senior has won a contract which will be worth Dollars 75m (Pounds 50m) over four years to supply General Motors' fleet of light trucks with exhaust gas returns (EGRs), pipes which reduce vehicle emissions by channeling fumes back into the engine to be reburned. Encouraged by Ford, one of its main customers, Senior has invested Pounds 8m in building a factory in south Wales. The chart shows Senior Flexonic's planned growth in production of exhaust connectors and EGRs, which is expected to triple between 1993 and 1996. Mr John Bell, who became Senior's chief executive in 1992, said: 'Flexonics is the thing that has changed our horizons over the last two years. We need to be influential in the markets we are in. We also need to be international  -the world today requires that.' Senior now has three divisions: Engineered products, which includes Flexonics, made operating profits of Pounds 10.6m on sales of Pounds 168m last year; Thermal engineering, which made Pounds 8.5m on sales of Pounds 160m; Construction services, which made Pounds 6.2m on sales of Pounds 63m. The thermal engineering division supplies boilers and heat transfer components for main power generation contracts. Mr Bell says the group 'has stopped pretending' it is big enough to compete as a turnkey contractor with the likes of Asea Brown Boveri and GEC Alsthom. Instead, 'we will concentrate on components, and on being thermal engineering experts.' Mr Bell says construction services is wrongly named - it really should be called engineered air services. The business cannot be international in the same way as Flexonics and thermal engineering, not least because it faces huge international players at the smaller end of the air-conditioning market. He says: 'We have niche businesses, tailor-making big thermal systems for customers such as hospitals. We need to find sustainable niches.' It is, however, the opportunity that Flexonics has brought to the engineered products division which mainly accounts for the outperformance by Senior's shares against the market. Flexonics, based near Chicago, was the creation of a single entrepreneur. Mr Bell said of the owner: 'The reasons for the sale are now becoming clearer - there is no way he would have been able to invest in the business in the way we are now doing. There is luck in things. The opportunities have turned out to be even greater than when we first bought it.' One such opportunity was the close relationship which Flexonics had already forged with Ford. When the US motors giant decided it was going to use exhaust connectors in Europe, it wanted a partner to work on the design. Ford talked to German and Japanese competitors but chose Flexonics, which is sole supplier of connectors in the US to Ford and GM. The Pounds 8m factory which Senior has built in south Wales was due to begin production in 1995, but Senior opened it earlier than intended principally to supply Ford's Mondeo. Senior can supply other manufacturers from the plant, and Volvo and Saab are currently talking to the group - Volvo's connectors are currently made by Flexonics in the US. One advantage which Senior found from being a truly international player was that the factory's location in Europe was genuinely 'mobile'  - so the group attracted competing offers of investment aid from Ireland and the UK. The Welsh plant opened early last year and now employs 60 people. By the time it reaches its maximum employment level of 250 jobs in 1996, Senior will have received a grant of Pounds 2m from the Welsh Development Agency - a quarter of the total cost. Senior emphasises that Flexonics has a broader product base than automotive, even although that sector has grown from nothing to 36 per cent of its output in the last five years. Mr Bell said: 'Flexonics' roots are many and varied and our strength is because of our expertise in pipework and connective services. That is what gave us our opportunity.' Senior Flexonics, which now includes the group'existing UK hose and flexible tube businesses, also supplies the industrial, aerospace and medical sectors. Mr Bell said recent acquisitions were designed to maintain the balance of the group, even although automotive was forecast to grow so rapidly. In March, Senior launched a Pounds 65m rights issue to fund the expansion of Flexonics and two simultaneously announced purchases. The group paid Pounds 10m for Metal Bellows, a US maker of welded diaphragm metal bellows for the aerospace, semiconductor, medical and industrial markets. It also acquired Christian Berghofer, a German manufacturer of flexible hoses and expansion joints for Pounds 8m. Senior is also on course to achieve another strategic aim: decreasing its dependence on the UK market. Albert E Sharp, the stockbroker, estimates that by 1995 only 50 per cent of the group's sales will be UK by origin - down from 71 per cent in 1991. The acquisition of Flexonics has given the group a great opportunity - not only domination of the US automotive market, but pole position in the race for the European market, where stricter environmental legislation is likely to increase demand for similar products. Mr Bell says: 'We are not short of opportunities. You do have to be courageous - but you also have to keep your eye on where you are going.'</p>

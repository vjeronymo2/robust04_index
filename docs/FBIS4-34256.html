			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rodolfo Rojas-Zea] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis  said there are two alternatives for definitively resolving the  unresolved Chiapas conflict: "One, the position that the  Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) has presented, and two,  the position which, from my point of view, should be  strengthened -- the reinforcement of national policy but within  republican institutions, the branches of state, and civilian  society."    "There will be nuances, differences and contradictions, but  I  believe that as the pace of the national political debate picks  up, as solutions and proposals are established, and as specific  progress is made in the area of democracy, pressure will  naturally decrease and we will make a direct contribution to the  consolidation of peace."    Camacho Solis admitted this issue "has been quite complex  from the beginning because it linked national policy to issues  of justice in Indian communities in Chiapas and the entire  country." That is why "we had to merge agendas into one in  which we made a specific proposal that referred solely to  Chiapas and to two points of national policy."    "The Chiapas issue has been linked and tied to the national  political situation at all times. The political institutions  have been responding with positive steps in this direction."    By seeing matters in this light, "we are able to explain  why,  with great responsibility, the candidates to the Presidency of  the republic and the political parties were able to sign the 27  January Peace, Justice, and Democracy Agreement, which reduced  the pressure in Chiapas and continued the initiative to  implement new changes."    This thing, "call it the evolution of local and national  aspects whereby national aspects are reactivated within the  sphere under their control as part of the justification of the  Chiapas conflict, is what will pave the way for a final solution  to the problem," he affirmed.    Interviewed by Jose Gutierrez Vivo on Radio Red, the peace  commissioner said the Zapatists "are not asking for material  things in exchange for not attacking the Army but, rather, for a  new pact with the government."    The EZLN "is offering this possibility to maintain a  situation of calm, but we have to admit that as long as there is  no commitment, accidents could occur, accidents that could  complicate the negotiations."    The peace commissioner expressed optimism regarding "a  10-day  war and five months without any deaths," a war in which the  Mexican Army and the EZLN "have kept their commitments and  backed a political solution to the conflict without firing one  single shot."    Gutierrez asked Camacho if he accepted the opinions given  by several sectors that he had failed in his mission to find  peace. The commissioner said: "At this time, there is no other  instance in the world in which a war has been interrupted so  quickly and where a situation of nonaggression has prevailed for  so long."    "The first option, he explained, was to move from a  belligerent situation; the second, to maintain the truce; and  the third, which we have considered optimistically, to attain  additional advances that would allow us to consolidate the  truce."    He admitted that "it is not foreseeable within the  prevailing  situation that the peace accords will be signed, but what is  important are the events that occur."    Based on those options, "we sent a letter to the president  of  the republic to report on the situation since it began, trying  to describe with all clarity the ideology, that is, the origin,  of the conflict and the options available to the Mexican  Government in light of the decisions the EZLN could possibly  make."    "We have also prepared," he disclosed, "a letter to the EZLN  requesting clear evidence of its nonbelligerence because this is  what is really important, and I want to state here, with all  clarity, that all the evidence and accounts I have requested  from the EZLN in this respect were accepted, explicitly or  tacitly, and, it seems to me, this is of utmost importance."    Camacho said that "confronted with those events, the  tendency  of public opinion was to say nothing was being done. This is  quite a sensitive issue because we are complying with our  commitment."    That is why, he added, "we have to make a clear-cut  distinction in the EZLN communiques, between the political  issues and their contents regarding security and military  topics," because "concerning the national political issues, they  present hard, even radical positions. I cannot complain,  however, about their compliance with the promise of maintaining  peace in Chiapas. In this regard, they have proceeded seriously  and with responsibility."    "Of course, this would have never been possible without the  meetings with the president of the republic who allowed the  dialogue to further harmony, and this led to the interruption of  the war, greater calm in Chiapas, and the consolidation of the  truce under the prevailing conditions up to now."    Gutierrez asked if Mexicans are still threatened by this war  and how will the situation be resolved completely. The peace  commissioner replied: "The EZLN has explicitly declared it will  not take any offensive actions, and this has a political value  and is also significant because, logically, the Zapatists must  justify their movements before national and international public  opinion."</p>

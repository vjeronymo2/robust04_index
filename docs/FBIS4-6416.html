			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 19 KYODO -- Justice Minister Akira  Mikazuki on Tuesday [19 April] described as "very ironic" the  money scandal-induced resignation of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa, who has championed the cause of political reform.    Mikazuki made the comment at a news conference after 20  cabinet ministers wrapped up a meeting that is expected to be  their last get-together under the short-lived Hosokawa  administration prior to the imminent selection of a new prime  minister.    Mikazuki said Hosokawa's fall from grace is due to mounting  parliamentary criticism over Hosokawa's "money scandal," in  which Hosokawa was blasted by the opposition for receiving 100  million yen as an unreported political donation from a  mob-linked trucking group.    "It is a very ironic thing" that Hosokawa, who had swept to  power on the strength of his public image as an anti-graft  crusader, was forced to quit over a string of money scandals,  the justice minister said.    However, Mikazuki, who is expected to retain his justice  post  under a new coalition government, vowed to bring to a successful  conclusion the ongoing investigation into a spate of bribery  scandals involving the nation's top construction firms and  politicians.    "My mandate is to crack down on money-related political  corruption on the basis of laws and evidence, namely to settle  the general contractors' bribery scandals in a manner that could  win public understanding," he said.    Former Construction Minister Kishiro Nakamura is under  indictment on a charge of accepting a bribe in exchange for  using his influence to deter the Fair Trade Commission from  filing a criminal accusation against an alleged bid-rigger.    Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  encouraged the ruling coalition to wage a successful "restart"  on the basis of "reflections" over some blunders committed over  the past eight months.    He criticized some political forces in the coalition for  pushing a proposal to amalgamate all coalition parties into a  unified large party or parliamentary group to win an upcoming  general election "with an eye to single-seat constituencies."    "Momentum to keep the unity of the coalition parties had  been  in place until the (common) goal of accomplishing political  reform was attained," he said at a news conference.    Takemura noted that such momentum dissipated quickly as  "momentum to disintegrate the coalition rapidly came to the  surface" following the enactment of the political reform bills.    Posts and Telecommunications Minister Takenori Kanzaki told  a  separate news conference the Social Democratic Party is chiefly  responsible for the squabbles that provisionally threatened to  blow up the unity of the coalition.    "The solidarity of coalition parties was undercut as the  Social Democratic Party started a race without any training and  became short of breath midway," Kanzaki, of Komeito [Clean  Government Party], said.    The minister was apparently referring to gaps in the  coalition between the socialist-led camp and the Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party]-led conservative camp over such key  policies as tax system reform and Japan's stand on the proposed  economic sanctions on Pyongyang over its suspected nuclear  development program.</p>

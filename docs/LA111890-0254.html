			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MARKETPLACE;  </P> <P> MARKETS;  </P> <P> AL TAYEBET'S WONDERFUL THINGS: SOUR CHERRIES AND SUJUK  </P> <P> Al-Tayebat Middle Eastern Grocery, 1217 S. Brookhurst St., Anaheim, (714)  520-4723. Open Monday-Saturday 9 a.m.-7 p.m.  </P> <P>  In Arabic, Al-Tayebat means wonderful things. It's a fitting name for a market  with butchers who make lamb sausages studded with pine nuts and hand-cut shish  kebabs to order from fresh sides of halal lamb.  </P> <P> "We don't buy precut meat," says Al-Tayebat's owner, Sami Khouraki, who comes  from a family of Syrian merchants.  </P> <P> Al-Tayebat carries the fresh seasonal herbs, fruits and vegetables used in  Middle Eastern cooking: eggplants the size of your thumb, 2-foot-long  pale-green English butter gourd and the tart, unripe grapes and sour red  cherries used for flavoring Iranian meat dishes.  </P> <P> But you don't have to cook Syrian, Lebanese or Iranian food to appreciate the  store's conventional produce. I found Spanish saffron, shimmering green  Lebanese extra-virgin olive oil and sour cherry preserves from a Belgian  company, thick with whole fruit. And on the day I was there, five kinds of  pears were displayed. One flaming scarlet variety was fully ripe and juicy -- a  rare occurrence these days. There were also huge red grapes the size of walnuts  and pencil-thin yellow wax beans.  </P> <P> Each morning at 3:30, Khouraki, a former manager for the K mart Corp., drives  downtown to the Los Angeles Central Produce Market, although his store is  located in Anaheim. He prefers to select the produce himself rather than having  it delivered sight unseen.  </P> <P> And he has the butchers in Al-Tayebat's modest meat department prepare kufta to  each customer's specifications.  </P> <P> "Some people like their kufta seasoned with hot pepper, others prefer sweet  pepper or cinnamon," Khouraki says. "And though lamb is traditional, we also  get calls to make it with beef."  </P> <P> Culinarily speaking, the Middle East begins in the Balkans and extends right up  to the edge of India, dipping down to Northern Africa. And though each country  has its distinct cuisine, Al-Tayebat caters to them all. These countries use  similar ingredients, and their tables have long been a product of cultural  exchange prompted by the comings and goings of pilgrims, trade caravans and  invaders. Certain staples are widespread, such as lamb, wheat, rice, eggplant  and olives.  </P> <P> So the plump, fresh walnut halves behind Al-Tayebat's counter might end up in  Lebanese baklava or a Georgian satsivi (cold chicken with a spicy walnut  sauce); the filo dough may wrap Greek tiropita or Yugoslavia's meat borek, and  the small eggplants could be stuffed with walnuts and then pickled to make  Syrian beitinjan makbus or sauteed for a Turkish rice pilaf.  </P> <P> When you shop at Al-Tayebat, take a shopping basket rather than try to  manipulate a cart through the store's narrow aisles -- although carts won't be  a problem much longer. Khouraki has acquired the adjoining property, and the  remodeled store will nearly double the space for Al-Tayebat's wonderful things.  </P> <P> SHOPPING LIST:  </P> <P>  Halal lamb: The fine-quality lamb carried at Al-Tayebat is halal -- which  means it has been butchered according to Islamic religious prescriptions. You  can purchase whole or half lambs for roasting and perhaps to stuff in the  traditional Greek or Armenian way.  </P> <P> If you need less meat, the butcher will bone a leg of lamb with a pocket to  hold stuffing. Each country has its own stuffing recipes. In Syria and Lebanon  it's likely to be a simple combination of garlic and herbs or a more elaborate  one of chopped figs, raisins and prunes (about 2 ounces each) with 1/2 teaspoon  each of dried thyme and sage and sprinkled with a little melted butter. The  stuffed pocket must be tied shut before the meat is roasted.  </P> <P> Another specialty Al-Tayebat's customers might have the butchers prepare is  meat for Chelo Kebab: lamb cut into wide strips, to be marinated in yogurt or  lemon juice and olive oil. After a charcoal grilling, the meat may be served  with rice that has been cooked so that it has a crisp crust at the bottom.  </P> <P> Lamb is also the main ingredient in many of the famous Iranian stews known as  khoresh. The ingredients in a khoresh, which can include fruit and nuts or  pomegranate juice, make a lush sauce. And the khoresh is always served over a  huge mound of fragrant basmati-style rice to absorb it.  </P> <P> Ma'ani: These lamb sausages are made in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent (the  pronunciation of the name varies from region to region -- in written Arabic  it's naqaniq). Khouraki is justifiably proud of the shop's small, finger-length  ma'ani scented with a seasoning that includes allspice, cloves and pine nuts.  </P> <P> Sujuk: This is the Turkish- and Armenian-style cured beef sausage. Most  Armenian-Middle Eastern delis sell commercially made sujuk. Al-Tayebat's  butchers prepare their own, which is not cured as long. As a result, the  sausage is pleasantly moist. Saute chunks of the sujuk and toss it with cut  tomatoes for an appetizer, or use it in scrambled eggs and omelets.  </P> <P> SPECIALTY PRODUCE:  </P> <P> Before the days of hydroponic gardening and international fruit imports, the  seasons dictated what was put on the table. This seasonality still rules  Al-Tayebat's produce department. Items come and go according to their growing  time. Off-season, just as in the Middle East, you'll find some fruits and  vegetables dried.  </P> <P>  Fresh dates: If you've eaten only dried dates, the subtle perfume-like flavor  of the fresh ones will surprise you. Fresh dates come to market in September  for only about 10 days, and Al-Tayebat sells them in bunches just as they come  from the tree.  </P> <P> Green almonds: These are picked while the outer shell is still green and before  the nut has ripened. The immature almond is a faintly flavored jelly. Green  almonds are available in June.  </P> <P> Young fava beans: The mature and dry fava beans so often called for in Middle  Eastern recipes need to be shelled and then have the skin of each bean removed.  But in the fall, when young favas are in season, cooks rejoice for they can  serve the tender beans unpeeled either raw as mezzeh (appetizers), or lightly  cooked.  </P> <P> Molukhia: This exotic green leafy vegetable gives its name to an Egyptian soup.  "Similar to spinach," is how some describe molukhia, but its properties are  quite different. The leaves release a viscous liquid as they cook, rather like  okra, which thickens soups and stews. Fresh molukhia is only available in the  summer, but it is always dried for winter cooking. In Egypt the molukhia soup,  which some families eat every day, is served sprinkled with ta'leya, a paste of  crushed garlic and coriander fried in clarified butter. The soup is always  consumed with lots of rice on the side.  </P> <P> Quinces: Golden in color and shaped like lumpy, slightly elongated apples,  quinces are a mainstay in Middle Eastern confectionary and a popular ingredient  in Iranian meat stews. Because they yield abundant pectin, the fruit can easily  be cooked up into the conserves, fruit leather and the jellied confections so  popular there. The fruit isn't sweet enough to eat raw, but when cooked slowly,  as in a Moroccan tajine, it develops a delectable fruity taste.  </P> <P> Fresh sour cherries: Also known as alubalu, these are another fruit often  cooked with meat. Until recently, they've only been available dried or as a  preserve, but now Al-Tayebat carries this particular type of cherry fresh  during the summer. Iranians stew them with lamb and lentils or use them in  their famous alubalu polo, a cherry-studded rice dish cooked with chicken. The  cherries make a superlative jam that is served with thick cream for dessert. It  also makes a delicious drink mixed with ice water; you eat the cherries from  the bottom of the glass when you've finished drinking.  </P> <P>  Unripe grapes: The sour liquid pressed from unripe grapes is available all  year long in bottled form, but for a few weeks in the late summer, the unripe  grapes themselves are available at Al-Tayebat. The taste of their juice is much  sharper and more astringent than lemon or lime juice. It adds sparkle to rich  meat and cooked fruit dishes such as an Iranian khoresh.  </P> <P>  Karg: In her book "The Cuisine of Armenia," Sonia Uvezian observes, "the  Armenian enthusiasm for stuffing foods reaches its zenith with vegetables and  fruits that can be hollowed out." The long, narrow karg, also known as opo or  English butter gourd, is a perfect vehicle for those famous Armenian stuffings.  These are elegantly seasoned mixtures of ground meats with rice or bulgur and  sometimes nuts.  </P> <P> Traditional cooks simmer the stuffed vegetables in broth with lemon juice and a  little olive oil, but you can also microwave them in a lightly covered glass  dish. The broth, when poured into the cooking implement should reach about  three-quarters of the way up the side of the squash.  </P> <P> Butter gourd is also delicious simply steamed and buttered or mixed into stewed  dishes or soups.  </P> <P> Kusa: Another squash good for stuffing or just eating plain. It resembles a  pudgy green and white pin-striped zucchini with wavy stripes.  </P> <P> Middle Eastern cucumbers: These are so good that they are often eaten like  fruit. They inevitably turn up in the ever-present bowl of salad vegetables  that is placed unadorned on the Middle Eastern mealtime table; everyone simply  slices off pieces to munch.  </P> <P> When you taste the pale green moqti (the cucumber with raised lengthwise ridges  also known as Armenian cucumber or ghoota), you'll understand the appeal of  this custom. Moqti is one of the most delicate and fruit-like cucumbers I have  ever tasted. Another delicious cucumber sold at Al-Tayebat is the midget, dark  green khiar.  </P> <P>  Fresh herbs: Al-Tayebat has wonderful bushy bunches of fresh tarragon, various  mints, dill, tarragon, cilantro, chives and the garlic greens known as garlic  chives.  </P> <P> STAPLES:  </P> <P> Middle Eastern olives: The importance of olives in the Middle East is summed up  with the Lebanese saying, "Wheat and oil are pillars of the house and olives  are the sultan of the table." The Syrians, who grow an astounding variety of  olives, cure them at all stages of ripeness to produce an even larger variety.  Unfortunately, most are only sold domestically.  </P> <P> Al-Tayebat, however, carries Aleppo and Kura olives, two seldom-seen varieties  from the region. The black, dry-cured Aleppos seem mostly pit but their intense  flavor is habit-forming. They resemble somewhat the wrinkly dry-cured Moroccan  olives which the store also carries. A popular way to serve Aleppos, Khouraki  says, is to marinate them in lemon juice with a little olive oil, a hint of  Middle Eastern cumin and Aleppo pepper. The Aleppo olives are in the dairy  cooler case sealed in plastic, not with the other olives in the butcher's case.  </P> <P> The green, cracked Kura olives look almost identical to Greek nafplion olives,  but have a crisp, slightly bitter taste, different from the tart lemony flavor  of the Greek olives. Al-Tayebat also carries Greek kalamata olives.  </P> <P> Remember that when a dish calls for cooking with olives, it's best to add them  at the end of the cooking time so they will just warm through.  </P> <P> Pickles: Even in the modern Middle East, torshi (all kinds of pickles) are made  and sold in old-fashioned specialty shops. These places are full of color and  you can always smell the aroma of curing turnips, eggplants and other  vegetables amid the lively banter of bargaining in process. At Al-Tayebat there  is a long, well-stocked pickle shelf. There are the ridged moqti cucumbers, hot  red pickled peppers, leeks, whole baby eggplants and even Italian giardinera.  </P> <P>  Pomegranate molasses: This unsweetened concentrate of pomegranate juice is  used when a dish needs the flavor of the fruit, but not too much liquid.  Muhammara, a spicy dip for mezzeh, is an example. Many recipes call for  pomegranate juice instead, however, which is also available bottled.  </P> <P> Jibna Khadra: The name of this fresh, bland cheese literally means green (that  is, uncured) cheese. It isn't an eating cheese but rather a basic ingredient in  dessert pastry fillings and savory pies. Jibna khadra can also be made into  string cheese by heating and kneading it -- the longer the kneading, the  stringier the cheese. For Aleppo-style cheese it is kneaded with black caraway  seeds and mahleb, the fragrant kernels of cherry pits, and then formed into  patties and stored in brine. Al-Tayebet also sells Aleppo-style cheese ready  made. You'll find it in jars in the cooler case.  </P> <P> Licorice ramzy: This dried licorice plant is made into a popular iced tea-like  drink. You simply let it steep, strain it and chill the infusion.  </P> <P> Baba ghannouj: Anyone who has ever prepared this creamy puree of roasted  eggplant pulp knows what a tedious chore roasting and peeling the charred  eggplants can be. At Al-Tayebat I came across a brand of canned baba ghannouj  imported from Lebanon. Al-Wadi baba ghannouj has a nice smoky flavor that many  commercially prepared brands lack. When you add fresh garlic and olive oil to  this puree, as the label suggests, your baba ghannouj will taste almost  homemade.  </P> <P> Sumac: This staple in all Middle Eastern cooking is made from dried, crushed  sumac berries. You often see in shakers on the tables in Middle Eastern  restaurants, where it is used to add a tart flavor.  </P> <P> Middle Eastern cumin: Basically the same variety that we see in supermarkets,  this has a stronger flavor. It comes ground and packaged in plastic bags in  Al-Tayebat's spice section.  </P> <P>  Like hummus and baba ghannouj, this spicy mixture is designed to be eaten with  plenty of pita bread and many other small appetizers of the mezzeh table.  </P> <P>  For hot red pepper paste Khouraki uses Indo-European brand, for sweet red  pepper paste use Adriatic brand.  </P> <P> KHOURAKI'S MUHAMMARA  </P> <P> (Syrian Appetizer)  </P> <P> 2 cups hot or sweet red pepper paste  </P> <P> 1 cup pomegranate molasses  </P> <P> 1/2 cup plain dry bread crumbs  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground Middle Eastern cumin  </P> <P> 1 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> 1/4 cup olive oil  </P> <P> Combine pepper paste, pomegranate molasses, bread crumbs, sugar, cumin and 3/4  cup walnuts in large bowl. Blend well and place in wide shallow serving dish or  on platter with rim.  </P> <P> Make shallow well in center of muhammara and pour in 3 tablespoons olive oil.  Drizzle remaining oil over dish and sprinkle with remaining walnuts. Makes  about 6 servings.  </P> <P> KHOURAKI'S SYRIAN SAFARJALIYA  </P> <P> (Quince and Lamb Stew)  </P> <P> 2 pounds lamb shank, cut into cubes  </P> <P> 4 cups water  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 6 to 8 unpeeled quince, cored and quartered  </P> <P> 4 cups pomegranate juice  </P> <P> 1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar  </P> <P> 4 cloves garlic, crushed  </P> <P> 2 teaspoons dry mint leaves  </P> <P> 6 ounces tomato paste  </P> <P> Rice or kibbeh  </P> <P> Place lamb, water and salt in heavy pot. Simmer uncovered 1 hour. Add quince,  pomegranate juice, sugar, garlic, mint leaves and tomato paste. Simmer 1 hour  longer until meat breaks apart easily with fork. (Stew will be quite soupy.)  Serve over rice or kibbeh. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> CHELO KEBAB  </P> <P> 2 1/4 pounds lamb cut for Chelo Kebab  </P> <P> Marinade No. 1 or Marinade No. 2  </P> <P> Hot cooked rice  </P> <P> Butter, optional  </P> <P> 6 egg yolks, optional  </P> <P> Sumac  </P> <P> 1 onion, cut into rings, optional  </P> <P> Yogurt  </P> <P> Salads  </P> <P> Place meat strips in shallow dish. Add marinade. Turn meat strips until  well-coated. Cover and refrigerate at least 24 hours.  </P> <P> Grill meat over very hot coals fairly quickly, turning frequently to prevent  drying.  </P> <P> Serve each portion with large mound cooked rice accompanied by pat of butter  and 1 egg yolk. Serve sumac in shaker or small bowl and onion rings for garnish  in side dish.  </P> <P> To eat, mix rice, butter, egg yolk and sumac. Garnish with onion rings and  serve with yogurt and choice of salads. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Marinade No. 1  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 1 large onion, finely chopped or grated  </P> <P> 1/4 cup lemon juice  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Mix oil, onion and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes  about 1 cup.  </P> <P> Marinade No. 2  </P> <P> 1 cup yogurt  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> 1 large onion, finely chopped or grated  </P> <P> Combine yogurt, salt, pepper and onion. Makes about 1 1/2 cups.  </P></p>

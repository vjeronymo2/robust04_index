			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / EC promises more troops for Bosnia peacekeeping role EUROPEAN Community leaders pledged yesterday to provide more troops and money for the United Nations peacekeeping operation in Bosnia. The decision defuses an internal row over whether to support a US-German call for lifting the arms embargo on the Bosnian Moslems. The Community goal is to reinforce protection for the Bosnian Moslem civilian population stranded in six UN-designated 'safe areas'. However, it is unclear which countries will send the troops, as none of the principal Community members came forward with fresh commitments. At the end of a two-day EC summit in Copenhagen dominated by Bosnia and the Community's unemployment and economic growth crisis, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, Danish prime minister, declared that the meeting would end a long period of uncertainty over the direction of Europe. Mr Rasmussen, who chaired the summit, described the commitment to send money and troops as a 'decent reply' to the escalation of fighting in Bosnia. He predicted that commitments from EC and other governments to supply about 7,500 troops could be met within a matter of days or weeks. EC diplomats expressed hope that the imminent dispatch of reinforcements could encourage the Serbs, Croats and Moslems to narrow their differences in the Geneva peace talks which resume today. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany expressed disappointment that other EC leaders had rejected his plea for a partial lifting of the arms embargo against former Yugoslavia during a tense session on Monday night. Mr Kohl's intense lobbying effort followed contacts with US president Bill Clinton, who has long advocated a policy of arming the Moslems and possibly launching air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to force them to accept international peace plans. President Francois Mitterrand of France, Germany's closest ally, said if the EC was not ready to send troops 'within the next few days' then the arms embargo should be lifted. Mr Mitterrand's intervention galvanised the Twelve into making a fresh commitment to provide ground forces. But it revived the dormant debate over whether to lift the arms embargo. Mr John Major, UK prime minister, ruled out arming the Moslems 'at present', calling the policy a 'counsel of despair'. But echoing other leaders' reservations, he ruled out dispatching more British troops to Bosnia. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister of Spain, which also has troops in Bosnia, opposed any increase in the Spanish contingent. The impression that EC leaders were lukewarm about their compromise was strengthened when Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, said the main proportion of new troops for Bosnia should come from outside the Community. 'But the EC must make a gesture,' he said. Mr Kohl made little effort to disguise his outrage that nothing was being done to prevent the Serbs and Croats from hanging on to their territorial gains in Bosnia-Hercegovina, a state recognised by the EC in the early phases of the civil war in former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Albert Fisher to spin off Charles Sidney through flotation next month ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, is to spin off Charles Sidney, its Yorkshire-based Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle and passenger car dealer, through a full stock market flotation next month. The move is the latest step taken by Mr Stephen Walls, Albert Fisher's new chairman, to refocus the group on its core activities - the processing and distribution of fruit, vegetables and seafood. It also represents an opportune time to launch a publicly quoted vehicle group since the luxury car market is now showing signs of recovery, and the motor dealers' share prices have been buoyant over the past year. Charles Sidney was one of the first postwar dealerships established in Britain by Mercedes-Benz in 1953. Since then the group has become one of the largest distributors of Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Britain and had estimated sales in the year to August 31 of about Pounds 55m (Pounds 41m). The group holds the Mercedes-Benz franchises in Bradford and South Yorkshire (Sheffield and Doncaster). It operates Mercedes-Benz commercial vehicle dealerships in Bradford and Sheffield - trading under the name Northside Trucks - passenger car dealerships in Bradford and Doncaster, together with after sales servicing, parts and repair facilities. Northside Trucks also includes a rentals division with a fleet of 400 commercial vehicles. In 1992, 40 per cent of turnover came from new and used commercial vehicle sales, 40 per cent from new and used car sales and 20 per cent from servicing, spare parts and commercial vehicle body building. Vehicle sales in the latest year were split evenly between commercial vehicles and passenger cars. Mr Raymond Edwards, Albert Fisher's director responsible for the European food processing division including Charles Sidney, will leave the group to become Charles Sidney's executive chairman. Mr Edwards joined Albert Fisher when it acquired Northside Trucks in 1983.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Lesotho king backs down Lesotho's King Letsie and ousted prime minister Ntsu Mokhehle reached an accord on their power struggle yesterday - and the premier said his government would be reinstated. The king sparked a constitutional crisis in the tiny southern African mountain state on August 17 when he dissolved Mr Mokhehle's government, saying it no longer enjoyed popular support. The ousting of Lesotho's first democratically elected government in two decades drew widespread condemnation abroad. Three regional neighbours - South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe - gave the king until September 5 to rescind his decision. South Africa completely surrounds Lesotho and has a stranglehold on its economy. 'It was agreed the process of restoring the government should start immediately,' Mr Mokhehle said after a meeting with the king.</p>

During the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress [NPC], the comrades in charge of various ministries and  commissions under the State Council have successively held  discussions with deputies from Tibet, Xinjiang, the Inner  Mongolia, Guangxi and Ningxia Autonomous Regions; seriously  listened to their comments and suggestions; and discussed with  them how to accelerate development in the ethnic minority  regions.    Several State Council officials have separately visited the  Tibet delegation and sought the deputies' opinions. They  included Chi Haotian, state councillor and minister of national  defense; Wu Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic  cooperation; Liu Bin, vice minister of the State Education  Commission; and Song Defu, minister of personnel. During the  discussion, Chi Haotian briefed the deputies on the situation of  unity among nationalities, the army- people unity, and efforts  to strengthen border defense, and discussed other questions  which are of interest to the deputies. Wu Yi pledged to support  Tibet's foreign trade and economic cooperation and to help Tibet  overcome difficulties in work. Liu Bin and Song Defu answered  the deputies' questions regarding compulsory education,  educational institutions, and teachers' wages, and put forward  solutions to some problems. The deputies said: The visits to  the Tibet delegation by the department heads of the State  Council show the attention and support given by the Party  Central Committee and the State Council to the work of Tibet.  The departments concerned under the State Council have been  very considerate of Tibet in many things. For instance, Tibet  recently submitted to the State Education Commission an  educational plan which overlooked vocational education  expenditures, the State Education Commission on its own  initiative added the vocational education funding in its  educational appropriation.    Those who successively visited the Xinjiang delegation  included Ismail Amat, state councillor and minister of the State  Nationalities Affairs Commission; Han Zhubin, minister of  railways; and Xiang Huaicheng, vice minister of finance. The  deputies of various nationalities fully affirmed the  achievements made by the railroads in recent years in transport  and railroad construction and put forward suggestions on  acceleration of railroad construction and the promotion of  economic development in Xinjiang. Han Zhubin pledged to support  Xinjiang's economic development by accelerating railroad  construction there, and particularly by ensuring the transport  of cotton, chemical fertilizer, and other capital goods.    Yang Changji, executive vice minister of the State Economic  and Trade Commission, and others have visited the Inner Mongolia  delegation to seek the deputies' opinions. They answered the  deputies' questions regarding the change of operational  mechanisms at large and medium state-owned enterprises, debt  chains, and reform of the foreign trade system. Three deputies  from the Inner Mongolia delegation who asked some questions in  their letters to Minister of Personnel Song Defu will receive  detailed answers from him soon. The comrades in charge of the  Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate  answered Inner Mongolian deputies' questions on public order,  anticorruption measures, and the strengthening of the public  security and judicial forces.    The comrades in charge of the State Planning Committee, the  Ministry of Finance, the State Education Commission, the  People's Bank of China, the Ministry of Public Security, the  Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate  attended the small group discussions of the Guangxi delegation.  They listened to the deputies' views and suggestions on the  education, finance, taxation, and comprehensive efforts to  improve public order in ethnic minority regions.    When Ningxia deputies were examining and discussing the  government work report and the reports on national plans and  finance, they were joined successively by Minister of Justice  Xiao Yang, Vice Minister of the State Nationalities Affairs  Commission Tudao Doje, and Vice Minister of the State Planning  Commission Luo Zhiling. The deputies pointed out that since  1982 great achievements have been made in the special  help-the-poor project in Gansu's Dingxi, Hexi corrider, and  Ningxia's Xihaigu region. In Ningxia's Guyuan Prefecture, the  basic needs of 80 percent of the population in food and clothing  have been met. However, 240,000 people there remain in poverty  and difficulty. The deputies suggested that the state improve  infrastructure, such as transport and energy sources, and solve  the people's food and clothing problems in a planned way in  ethnic minority regions, and that state organs provide support  relevant to their functions to poor regions. Xiao Yang, Tudao  Doje, and Luo Zhiling pledged to convey the deputies' views to  the relevant State Council departments, carry out the  help-the-poor plan effectively, and help narrow the gap between  the ethnic minority regions in western China and the country's  eastern part.</p>

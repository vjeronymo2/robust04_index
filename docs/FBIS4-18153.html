			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- Defense Minister Mehmet Golhan said that  reports that military service in Turkey would be extended to 19  months were groundless, the ANATOLIA NEWS AGENCY reported on  Friday [25 March]. Speaking at a press conference Golhan  discussed the reports of an extension of military service that  had appeared on television and in newspapers.    Golhan said, "There was a potential threat that led to the  decision to extend military service by four months for those  soldiers who were supposed to be discharged in February and May.  Apart from this it is out of the question for military service  to be extended to 19 months." The reason for extending service  for the two groups was explained by Golhan:    "Our struggle against terrorism would have been adversely  affected if these soldiers had been released just when they had  become fully familiar with the area of operations. New soldiers  would not know the conditions and structure of the region. This  is why we chose to extend their service.    ``Our government was planning to totally wipe out the  vicious, outlawed Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK), a party  which smuggles drugs and is enslaved to Armenia. Thus we had to  plan operations aimed at finishing off the PKK, a group which  does its training in the winter months and attacks in the  summer, by the summer of 1994. Furthermore, we also had to take  security precautions in the region for the local elections due  to take place on March 27. And as things stand, with the  operations they carried out, our brave soldiers have broken the  backbone of the organization. They suffered heavy casualties.    ``We have reached pretty far with our operations. I am not  insinuating that we have put an end to PKK terrorism, but we are  nevertheless half way there.'' Stressing that the PKK terror  would be brought to an end in the summer months, Golhan said  that an "economic terror" was also prevalent in Turkey. Golhan  noted that it was now time to prevent economic terror, and said,  "Turkey has a bright future ahead. Let's not be pessimistic  about it. It is said that the automobile sector is currently  undergoing a crisis. But, I watched the news on TV last night,  and it was said that there has been a great increase in  automobile sales.    ``I don't understand how there could be a crisis when sales  are increasing. As for the increase in the dollar, it is no  more than a result of having kept it under pressure for many a  year. All of these problems will be overcome. Terror in the  economy will also be eliminated.''</p>

			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AGING PIPES MADE SEWAGE SPILL WORSE  </P> <P> Deteriorating sewer pipes, a large blockage and a shortage of repair parts  caused leaks that spilled about 800,000 gallons of raw effluent into Arroyo  Conejo Creek in Thousand Oaks over the weekend, city officials said Monday.  </P> <P> A 12-mile stretch of the creek from Thousand Oaks to its terminus at Point Mugu  has been posted as unsafe for swimming by Ventura County health officials. The  ban is expected to last about five days until the bacterial concentration is  diluted by creek waters, said Elizabeth Huff, a county environmental health  specialist.  </P> <P> City officials said the spill, which occurred in municipally owned open space,  did not pose a public health risk. The nearest housing is about a quarter of a  mile away.  </P> <P> About four dozen fish have died so far as a result of the spill. Damage to  wildlife is not expected to be significant because the discharge occurred  downstream of deep pools where green perch, arroyo chubs and catfish breed,  said Greg Smith, the city's environmental planner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leak Started Saturday  </P> <P> The sewage -- in volume the equivalent of about 160,000 toilet flushes -- began  leaking Saturday afternoon from the first of two breaks in an aging eight-inch  steel pipeline in the northwest corner of the city, said Kurt O. Reithmayr,  principal engineer with the city Utilities Department.  </P> <P> Problems began when an obstruction in a 30-inch pipe nearby built up pressure  and cracked the smaller line, Reithmayr said. The cracked pipeline is 25 years  old and was scheduled for replacement this year, he said.  </P> <P> The leak was spotted Saturday afternoon by a security guard patrolling the  adjacent MGM Ranch property, Reithmayr said.  </P> <P> To reduce the pressure, city crews opened the smaller line Saturday but  couldn't recap it because they did not have a large enough plug and could not  get one from nearby agencies, Reithmayr said. As a result, thousands of gallons  of additional sewage leaked from the line before it was sealed Sunday, he said.  </P> <P> "It's like you have a hose and you're trying to make the darn thing stop  gushing, but you can't," Reithmayr said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2nd Leak  </P> <P> A second leak sprang open in the line Sunday a short distance from the first.  Both breaks were clamped and sewage stopped leaking into the creek Sunday. City  crews also opened a bypass pipeline to reduce the pressure, Reithmayr said.  </P> <P> Workers were still working Monday evening to remove the blockage in the larger  line, which Reithmayr said could be rocks, wood or even a bicycle.  </P> <P> The larger line flows west through Wildwood Canyon to Hill Canyon Wastewater  Treatment Plant north of Newbury Park. The smaller line flows north from the  Ventura Freeway through Arroyo Conejo Canyon to the plant.  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board will investigate the spill and  could levy fines if it finds the city was negligent, said David Gildersleebe, a  supervising engineer for the agency.  </P> <P> The city discharges about 10.5 million gallons of treated waste water daily  into Arroyo Conejo Creek. In 1978 and in 1981, flooding from winter storms  resulted in minor spills of untreated sewage into the creek, city official  said.  </P></p>

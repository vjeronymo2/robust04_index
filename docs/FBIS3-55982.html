We have done too little to  attract the interest of the NATO," head of the Riigikogu  [parliament] defence commission Rein Helme said.    He added that Estonia has problems with regional cooperation  and pointed out the border issues with Russia. Admission to the  NATO is impossible in case of such problems, which will have to  be either solved or frozen, Helme said.    As for the appeal of the Lithuanian president, Helme  commented that consultations between parliaments and governments  would have been necessary, since the issue concerns the entire  nation.    The Riigikogu foreign affairs commission is waiting official  documents from Brussels, commission chairman Vello Saatpalu  said. Saatpalu expressed his amazement at Prime Minister Mart  Laar's announcement that Estonia is ready to appeal to Brussels  in the nearest future, complaining that the foreign affairs  commission had again been excluded from the making of vital  decisions. Saatpalu added that this and other incidents  indicate a movement from the rule of law to a state of  administration.</p>

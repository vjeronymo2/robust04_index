			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Jobs shed in Tory seats 'Why pick today?' This was the reaction of Mr Robert Sturdy, Conservative candidate for the Cambridgeshire Euro-seat, to yesterday's announcement by Anglian Water that it is to shed up to 900 jobs within three years. It must have been shared by Conservatives throughout the constituency. The announcement coincided with news from the Hampshire by-election town of Eastleigh, which the Liberal Democrats are expected to win from the Conservatives, that Pirelli, the cable maker, is to axe 136 jobs. Mr Sturdy, standing in a seat the Tories should win and which contains Mr John Major's parliamentary constituency, said he was worried about the timing of Anglian Water's announcement, which came as the company announced pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March of Pounds 132.2m. 'Why have they decided to say something today when the job losses are over two to three years?' he said. 'One wonders if it is political. It makes me wonder.' Anglian said almost all the job cuts would be among administrative workers - it is to close one of its two headquarters buildings, one of which is in Huntingdon, the other in Cambridge. At Eastleigh, Mr Stephen Reid, the Conservative candidate, said Pirelli's decision was 'a fact of life'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the job losses were 'likely to be as a direct result of the government's failure to invest in training and infrastructure'. Pirelli said the timing of the announcement had nothing to do with the by-election. 'That is incidental to the running of our business,' it said. 'But we do expect some possible criticism.'

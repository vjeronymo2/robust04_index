			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / G7 nations split over strategy to aid world growth: Meeting gives go-ahead to Dollars 6bn rouble stabilisation fund for Russia THE WORLD'S leading industrial countries welcomed Russia and the other former Soviet republics into the fold of market economies yesterday but continued to show signs of internal dissent over how best to foster world economic growth. After an unusually long 11-hour meeting in Washington, the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven countries issued a cautiously phrased communique that papered over their differences. Although it underlined the importance of strengthening consumer and investor confidence and restoring sustained non-inflationary growth in the G7 countries, it did not, in contrast to the previous G7 statement issued in January, detail what individual countries should do. It was understood that much of the delay in the talks was caused by Japanese resistance to US calls for increased public spending and lower interest rates. Before the meeting began, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, said he was 'not going to be put in the dock' because of Germany's high public borrowing requirement following unification. He rejected US claims that Germany's overall fiscal deficit was as high as 6 per cent of gross domestic product and insisted that there would be a moratorium on the level of state spending until the mid-1990s. Hopes of an early cut in German interest rates were dashed when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said that the bank had no room to lower rates in view of the rapid growth in Germany's monetary aggregates and inflationary pressure on the wages front. However, Germany saw no reason to raise rates or tighten monetary policy. A number of countries, including Britain, have backed the US argument that Germany's large deficits lie behind the Bundesbank's high interest rates, and so have exported slow growth and unemployment to Europe and the rest of the world. Reflecting this concern, the final communique underlined 'the need to reduce fiscal deficits in all countries with large budgetary imbalances through credible medium-term consolidation strategies'. Welcoming the former Soviet republics into the International Monetary Fund, the G7 gave the green light to a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) rouble stabilisation fund for Russia. The meeting was joined by Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, yesterday afternoon. It heard details of Russia's economic reform and stabilisation plans, including a forecast from Mr Gaidar that Russia would reduce its fiscal deficit to 5 per cent of gross domestic product in the first half of this year, from around 20 per cent last year. The G7 - comprising the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - recommended that an emergency IMF financing facility, known as the General Arrangements to Borrow, should be activated to give the IMF the financial backing needed for the stabilisation fund. It is expected that another club of industrial countries - the Group of Ten  -will activate the Gab today so that the IMF can draw funds from it when required. The formalities needed for Russia and most other former Soviet republics to join the IMF and its sister organisation, the World Bank, should also be completed today, paving the way for detailed talks on the rouble fund, a Dollars 4bn IMF standby credit for Russia, and World Bank loans to the former republics. Mr Schlesinger indicated that Germany was less than enthusiastic about the planned activation of the Gab. He and British officials suggested that the rouble stabilisation fund could be subject to tougher conditions than the stand-by credit that Russia will negotiate with the IMF.

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONN OFFICIAL AGREES U.S. MUST PLAY ROLE IN EUROPE  </P> <P> West Germany's foreign minister Wednesday endorsed a Bush Administration  proposal to assure continued U.S. influence in a post-Cold War Europe, even  though America's military power may be overshadowed by the economic might of  the 12-nation European Community.  </P> <P> After meetings with President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III,  Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called for a new transatlantic  partnership between Washington and Europe after the Common Market completes its  scheduled political and economic integration next year.  </P> <P> "We should try to get a declaration defining the common objectives, the common  tasks and challenges of the European Community and the United States," Genscher  told reporters at the White House. Later, he told a press conference that  U.S.-EC cooperation would strengthen the worldwide influence of the democracies  on both sides of the Atlantic.  </P> <P> In a speech last December, Baker said the United States is determined to  continue to play a role in European affairs even if changing circumstances  diminish the importance of U.S. military power.  </P> <P> Baker said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should evolve from a  primarily military alliance to a political grouping. And he called for regular  cooperation between the United States and the European Community. Genscher  supported both proposals.  </P> <P> Genscher also said that the foreign ministers of West and East Germany, the  United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union will probably meet before  the end of the month to discuss German reunification. This meeting, dubbed the  two-plus-four talks, brings together the two German states and the four Allied  victors of World War II.  </P> <P> West Germany and the United States want a unified Germany to be a member of  NATO, while the Soviet Union has said that the country should be independent of  any military bloc. But at his press conference, Genscher expressed optimism  that Moscow would eventually agree to German membership in NATO.  </P> <P> "A neutral Germany would increase instability," he said. "It would introduce a  degree of unpredictability in Germany and in Europe."  </P> <P> He added that "opinion in the Soviet Union has not been finalized," while  Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have expressed support for German membership  in NATO, something that "will affect the opinion of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> Genscher added that the Soviet Union "is no longer an aggressive country."  </P> <P> He said Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev "do not consider the  country of the other to be a threat. We think this is a realistic assessment."  </P> <P> Under these circumstances, Genscher said, the plan to modernize and upgrade  NATO's short-range nuclear arsenal is dead. The plan was once the subject of  heated controversy between West Germany, which opposed it, and the United  States and most other NATO members, who favored it.  </P> <P> When asked about the modernization proposal, Genscher said: "That is an issue  of the past. We should only discuss matters of the future."  </P></p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Argentine debt crisis ends with bank deal ARGENTINA'S 11-year foreign debt crisis was formally ended yesterday by the signing of a debt reduction plan with creditor banks in New York. The government calculates the agreement will reduce by a third the burden of servicing Dollars 19.29bn in debt principal. The debt reduction mechanism, similar to that for other Latin American countries, was devised by Mr Nicholas Brady, former US treasury secretary. Under this formula banks concede a debt reduction in exchange for bonds collateralised by US Treasury zero coupon bonds. Argentina yesterday handed the banks Dollars 16.97bn in 'Brady bonds' and banks transferred foreign debt certificates covering principal and a further Dollars 8.3bn in interest arrears. Arrears are covered by separate 12-year floating rate bonds not backed by collateral. The 30-year Brady bonds come in two varieties, allowing banks to choose between preserving principal or interest. Par bonds represent the full value of debt principal but pay low, fixed interest of 4 per cent a year, gradually rising to a maximum 6 per cent in seven years' time. Discount bonds represent only 65 per cent of principal, but pay floating interest of  13/16 per cent over Libor.</p>

			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW YORK;  </P> <P> EYEWITNESS INDICTED IN FATAL ATTACK CASE  </P> <P> An eyewitness in the killing of a black teen-ager who decided at the last  moment not to testify against his friends was charged with 2nd-degree murder in  the slaying.  </P> <P> John Vento, 21, was charged with intentional murder and showing a depraved  indifference to human life in the August, 1989, slaying of Yusuf Hawkins in  Brooklyn. Vento's decision forced a postponement in the trial, and it was seen  as a major blow to the prosecution's efforts to build cases against the seven  others charged. Hawkins and three others had gone to the predominantly white  Brooklyn neighborhood of Bensonhurst to look at a used car when they were  attacked by baseball-bat-wielding white youths.  </P></p>

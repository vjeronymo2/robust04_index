He emphasized that the  only way to ensure the republic's sovereignty, independence and  territorial integrity was to develop its relations with the CIS  under the treaty on common security for the CIS states.    According to Akayev, Russian-Kyrgyz military cooperation  could be implemented only in accordance with this treaty as it  was pointed out at the negotiations with Russian President Boris  Yeltsin. The Kyrgyz president announced that this provided for  a radical assistance with stabilization of the inferior  political situation in Kyrgyzstan, in particular, in the Gorno  Badakhshan region. According to the Kyrgyz leader, this was  vitally important since the culmination of migration from  Kyrgyzstan had coincided with the civil war in Tajikistan.    Akayev stressed that the dynamic of migration of Russian  speaking population from Kyrgyzstan was not due to nationalist  dispositions or strengthening of the Islamic forces, contrary to  the situation in other CIS Asian states.    The migration was due to the social and economic problems.  The language barrier is now not that important, the Kyrgyz  president said. Akayev explained this by the energetic actions  of the Kyrgyz leadership aimed at preserving the role and the  space for the Russian language in Kyrgyzstan.    He made it known that 120,000 Russians had left Kyrgyzstan  for the last two years. The Kyrgyz president reassured that  everything possible would be done so that other 900,000 Russians  "determining the democratic path of Kyrgyzstan" remain in the  republic.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Crimean leadership's goal is economic  independence, not Ukraine's breakup, the Crimean president's top  aide Vladimir Karpov told Interfax on Monday. He said that  Crimea would welcome relations with Kiev similar to relations  between Russia and Tatarstan.    Meanwhile, Kiev has stated on many occasions that unlike  Russia, Kiev was a unitary state and that the conclusion of such  an agreement would go against the Ukrainian laws.    Commenting on some of the Ukrainian politicians' plans to  introduce direct presidential rule in Crimea, Karpov said that  the implementation of such a plan would be unfair. He admitted,  however, that the Crimean parliament's decision to restore the  1992 Constitution had been taken in haste. He noted that on the  eve of the decision-making, Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov had  urged the deputies to put the decision off at least until autumn.    Crimea's restored constitution provides for treaty-based  relations with Ukraine and for the Crimean citizens' right to  dual citizenship.    Karpov believes that a commission of Crimean deputies and  their Ukrainian colleagues could settle all the disputable  issues. He also expressed the hope that a Ukrainian  parliamentary delegation's forthcoming visit to Crimea would  help ease tensions.    "Crimea is always ready for compromise. The Crimean deputies  have a good command of the language of compromise and  diplomacy," said Karpov.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Pace of US job creation slows Job creation slowed sharply in the US last month, but the unemployment rate stayed unchanged at 6.1 per cent with an estimated 8.02m people out of work. The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment grew by only 179,000 in August to a seasonally adjusted total of 113.76m, the slowest pace of job growth so far this year. Ms Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said most of the growth in employment came in the service sector, especially in the business services and health industries. The average working week in the manufacturing sector lengthened in August to 42 hours, and average overtime rose to a record high of 4.8 hours. Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the White House's chief economic adviser, said job creation was still healthy, and the August rate was consistent with the gradual moderation in economic growth the administration has forecast. She noted an increase of 32,000 in the number of manufacturing jobs, a sector where employment growth has been sluggish. Some Wall Street economists, however, said the sharp increase in manufacturing employment, at a time when industries were operating at close to full capacity, could signal more inflationary pressure and prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise short term interest rates once again. This idea helped pull bond prices back down after they had risen sharply immediately after the announcement of slower overall job creation, and the dollar, too, fell. Ms Tyson dismissed the suggestion, noting that unit labour costs had risen over the last 12 months at their slowest rate for 29 years. Other Wall Street economists agreed. 'Wage pressures remain completely absent. Wages are up just 2.5 per cent from a year ago and have risen at a scant 1.5 per cent rate during the past three months,' said an economist with Merrill Lynch, the New York stockbroking giant. Ms Tyson said most economic forecasts, including the administration's, foresaw continued expansion coupled with modest inflation. Wall Street analysts, however, believe members of the Fed's policy-making Open Markets Committee pay considerable attention to high rates of industrial capacity utilisation and to the concept of a 'natural rate of unemployment' in the region of 6.0 to 6.5 per cent, below which labour becomes more scarce and wage inflation begins to rise.</p>

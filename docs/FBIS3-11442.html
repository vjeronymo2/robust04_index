			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with FSLN Deputy Willima Ramirez by Erick Aguirre </F> originally published in EL SEMANARIO; place and date not given]    [Text] The internal debate in the FSLN [Sandinist National  Liberation Front] seems to be heading toward a much more  extensive, open, and transparent course, in which Nicaraguan  society has observed, caught between surprise and amazement, how  the sectarian diatribe and political discussion are striving to  make what seems to be the preliminary move toward an  Extraordinary Congress that will define programmatic,  organizational, and statutory issues of vital importance to this  enormous and well-organized political party.    All this discussion has an undeniable political content at  its core, although many of those promoting it are trying to  create overtones of a personal nature, with excessively  ideologized undercurrents.    The FSLN should not be ideologically labeled immediately  after a verbal battle in which one of every two or three groups  tries to lord it over the others by means of demagogic  blustering or by resorting to slanted attacks, rhetorical  euphemisms, or personal criticisms without any political  foundation. Instead, the political and organizational structure  of the front should be transformed substantially from top to  bottom, and adapted efficiently and coherently to fit new  circumstances.    William Ramirez, an FSLN guerrilla comandante, party deputy  in the National Assembly, and member of one of the committees  (bylaws) created to prepare for the Extraordinary Congress,  reflects in this interview about the diverse angles from which  the debate has been approached.    Decorated with the "Carlos Fonseca" order, the supreme honor  his party awards to its best militants, Ramirez speaks here of  the type of party which, in his view, the FSLN should now become.    [Aguirre] Does the FSLN still carry, or should it continue  to  carry, the baggage of a political-military guerrilla  organization?    [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN should not renounce its  history.  The FSLN's formation obviously had both a political and military  origin; we cannot turn our backs on that, because it is  something that actually happened; it is a part of history. It  should be preserved as a historic landmark, to teach new  generations what we human beings are capable of doing when all  our options have been closed off and all the outlets for making  our voices heard and our rights respected have been denied us.  Starting from the basis of that historic experience, the FSLN  should now adapt and adjust to the new political circumstances  which the world is now experiencing, which Nicaragua is  experiencing. I think we need to maintain and reemphasize those  moral values and develop them in today's new circumstances.    [Aguirre] What does being a revolutionary mean to you now,  at  this point in history?    [Ramirez] More than anything else, it means identifying with  and serving the interests of the poor, but it does not  necessarily mean excluding other people who may contribute to  the nation's development. It seems to me that injustice must be  a spur that moves us to do battle constantly. The consequences  of the inhumanity that the world's present circumstances are  provoking must be another cause of sadness, another spur to move  us to take action and fight. To me, being a revolutionary today  means accepting a form of behavior and a theory identified with  the interests of the downtrodden.    [Aguirre] How revolutionary is the FSLN today?    [Ramirez] I believe the FSLN is a revolutionary party, and  we  need to continue to keep it revolutionary. I believe it is  dangerous for us to start dividing it into categories or to  express strictly ideological positions, for we know that the  front has always been full of a variety of political views. If  people here start to say that the FSLN needs to consist solely  of "pure Marxists," leaving no room for "liberals," or if we  take strictly ideological positions and begin to divide the FSLN  between haves and have-nots, between atheists and believers,  rich and poor, finally, if we create categories among  Sandinists, we will also be creating the germ of a split in the  FSLN, for the FSLN has always been a front and it has never been  a "pure" political party. There has always been a diversity of  elements in the front, believers, nonbelievers, landowners, and  workers, and there has always been respect for these different  beliefs. That must be preserved in the FSLN.    [Aguirre] Does that mean that calling itself revolutionary  now is more a matter of practical actions than of ideological  concepts that seem very confused and seem to lack strong  support...? Is that it?    [Ramirez] For many of us, what happened in socialism and  with  socialist ideas came as a sort of new discovery, and we realized  that many values were not what we had been taught. Today things  are seen in another way. I believe in humanity and I believe in  socialism, and it seems to me that we have to try to help  everyone to live better, to offer the technical and material  conditions for the advancement of all the Nicaraguan people. I  want a society in which all citizens have jobs, land, access to  health care and education, where the capacity exists to produce  material goods and where spiritual resources are expanded. But  in reality, there is a specific crisis that we need to resolve,  and until it is resolved it would be utopian to make promises  while overlooking that reality. It would not just be utopian,  but demagogic. We cannot offer the people something we know we  cannot do. That would be irresponsible.    [Aguirre] In recent days, as we have learned from the  diatribes and controversies recounted in the media, a more  definite division of the waters of the currents of political  thought in the FSLN has begun.... What is your position on all  this?    [Ramirez] I do not think this is an ideological discussion;  it is a personal attack aimed at one of the leaders, Sergio  Ramirez. In order to discredit him as a presidential candidate  they have begun to seek out his weak points, and so they have  created an entire pseudo-ideological language that is nothing  more than a coverup for an ideological discussion. People have  started to say he is a social democrat, etc., with the intention  of a priori discrediting him as a candidate. The  truth is that in the FSLN we all share a program, Sandinist  rules of behavior. I can ask any militant to support the front's  program with me, and if he backs it I will expect that he act in  accordance with that program. I will not be too concerned about  whether or not he may own property, whether he is a believer or  not. What interests me is that he does what the program says, so  we can work together in the struggle. If we start to talk about  categories, we need to remember that that is going to create  divisions within the FSLN.    [Aguirre] Does it seem to you that the FSLN's present  National Directorate is capable of guiding this process toward a  full, popular, and pluralist democracy?    [Ramirez] Everybody agrees that the FSLN needs renewal, and  in that renewal, its leaders must be included. I support that  position. It seems to me that the present National Directorate  played a great role in its leadership during the war, while we  were underground, and while we were in office. Now we need to  make room for new leaders. On whether or not they are capable of  leading the front in these new circumstances, many of us know  how they are currently working, and I feel there is no way at  this time that the present national leadership can continue  operating as it is doing, which is in a totally irregular  manner. I think it is healthy not only to change the FSLN  program based on the new circumstances and for the approaching  election campaign, but also the bylaws, the internal  regulations, and party officers.    [Aguirre] In your view, should a party like the present FSLN  consider the possibility of once again turning to an armed  uprising at some specific moment?    [Ramirez] That depends. In the Somoza era, our voices were  heard on the radio only when we attacked, we were in the  newspapers only when we were taken prisoner or we were dead,  because we had no space. Today's conditions are different. Now  we have room for political action, we have newspapers, radio  stations; we cannot say the political conditions are the same as  they were in the past. I believe we need to continue using  political methods, civic and electoral routes to work out our  internal disputes and bring about government changes in this  country. In reality, the possibility of an armed uprising is not  desirable for me, nor do I believe it would be for the rest of  the Nicaraguan people. I definitely support a civic and  electoral approach. I believe that is the best heritage we can  give our children.    [Aguirre] I remember seeing Sandinists leading the fight  against the Somozist guard, holding important posts in the  Sandinist government, dealing with difficult situations (a  government minister, along with the entire population, facing a  hurricane like Joan, for example), always as Sandinist cadres;  it would be said such people were proven Sandinists.... What  sort of FSLN does a man like you expect at this time?    [Ramirez] I want a FSLN for all Nicaraguans. I would not  like  there to be an FSLN that excludes anyone, I would like an FSLN  whose aspiration is to serve and fight for the interests of the  poor. I want an FSLN that will reclaim the mystique that many of  us have lost, a mystique that is practical and not a matter of  speeches or party lines. I want this country to live better, I  want the Nicaraguan people to live better. I want my party to be  a united party, a party of men and women capable of keeping  their nation free, with a moral quality that will serve as an  example to all of Central America and the world.    [Aguirre] How does a Sandinist guerrilla comandante deal  with  a world like today's, with today's Nicaragua?    [Ramirez] It has been a difficult transition phase on a  personal level. My first year in the National Assembly was very  hard for me because I am not a man used to talking or giving  speeches. I have always been more a man of action than a  theoretician, but I realized that things have changed, that we  had lost the elections, that my new place was in the National  Assembly. It was not until the second year that I came to  understand that that was where I should be fighting my political  battles. I think that is still happening to many of our  comrades. We have not yet realized that we are now something  different. We want to continue being Sandinists and recover the  best values of Sandinism. Now our struggle is not advanced by  setting fire to this country, but by taking part in politics, by  debating issues and expressing demands politically. Still, I do  not reject popular struggle, union, or even political  demonstrations. We need to combine all possible forms of civic  struggle so this country will have the opportunity it has never  had to move forward.    [Aguirre] This is obviously another context, another  scenario. So, how do you view your time as a "guerrilla  comandante"? Do you look at it with nostalgia, or does it seem  only a romantic image?    [Ramirez] I view it as a recognition of something that  happened. We were where we were, we did what we did. It was  something that happened. I believe it was for the good of our  country. I do not regret doing what I did or having been  involved in the FSLN, but it seems to me that I should not--none  of us should--live on past glories. We have to live in the  present and play a new role in this society.</p>

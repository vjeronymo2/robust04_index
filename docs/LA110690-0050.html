			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THINKING BIG;  </P> <P> CHRISTO'S UMBRELLA ART PROJECT A HIT BEFORE IT'S UP  </P> <P> The people who live amid the hills of the Tejon Pass are getting art lessons in  unexpected places lately.  </P> <P> Two locals had just left a coffee shop in Gorman one morning last month when  they bumped into Christo, the famous Bulgarian-born artist who scorns the use  of his last name.  </P> <P> Eager to share news on the progress of his latest mega-art project -- 1,760  umbrellas that will dot the hillsides of the pass next fall -- Christo pointed  to a bright orange circle spray-painted the day before on a parking lot.  </P> <P> "See where we will place an umbrella," Christo said.  </P> <P> The pair looked in silence and appeared to struggle to respond. One finally  blurted out: "It looks like you have everything under control."  </P> <P> For the past several years, folks in these parts -- whether they want to or not  -- have learned quite a bit about their frequent guest. They have watched  movies of Christo's previous artistic exploits (such as wrapping a Parisian  bridge with fabric and surrounding Florida islands with pink plastic). They  have chatted about art at community get-togethers, received the artist's slick  catalogues by mail and posed for pictures snapped by his West German  photographer.  </P> <P> By now, there is probably nobody for miles around who does not know about the  umbrellas.  </P> <P> Next October, the golden yellow umbrellas will decorate cow pastures and small  towns along 18 miles of Interstate 5 in Kern and Los Angeles counties. At the  same time, 1,340 royal blue umbrellas will snake through rice fields, a  riverbed, a bamboo forest and villages along a 12-mile stretch in rural Japan.  </P> <P> Each umbrella will stand almost 20 feet tall and weigh 450 pounds.  </P> <P> It most likely will be the world's largest art project. About 1,500 people on  each side of the Pacific Ocean will erect the umbrellas in early October. Three  weeks later, the work crews, made up primarily of art lovers, college students  and the curious, will dismantle them and the material will be recycled.  </P> <P> All that will remain will be memories and Christo's pricey umbrella collages,  sketches and other preparatory work that museums, investors and art collectors  already have been gobbling up. A modest collage costs $35,000. An eight-foot  drawing fetches $360,000.  </P> <P> Christo, who spends as much time as possible creating umbrella art in his Soho  loft, is paying for "The Umbrellas, Joint Project for Japan and USA" himself by  selling his umbrella sketches and other preparatory works. The current price,  $26 million, is double last year's estimate.  </P> <P> Even schmoozing is expensive. The diminutive artist with impeccable manners has  flown to the West Coast and Japan dozens of times to persuade skeptical  bureaucrats, farmers and landowners that his dream to "stretch peoples' notion  of art" is not a joke.  </P> <P> He has largely succeeded. He has secured all of the necessary approvals,  including a critical Japanese permit so detailed it is the size of a city phone  book. The California Legislature has feted the artist for choosing the state  once more as a backdrop for his creativity. (In 1976 he ran a 24-mile  shimmering fence across Sonoma and Marin counties and into the ocean.)  </P> <P> The Kern County Board of Supervisors in Bakersfield is thrilled that for once  its county will not be lost in Los Angeles' shadow.  </P> <P> Abe Gueler, owner of a heavy equipment company, is so excited about the project  that he plans to widen a steep dirt road with hair-raising curves on his land  in the Tejon Pass so it will be easier for Christo's workers to reach his  mountaintop.  </P> <P> A few years ago, Gueler said, "a high percentage didn't know who Christo was,  didn't have the slightest idea." Then some locals decided that he "had to be  nuts" when they learned of his projects in Paris, Florida and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Gueler added, "Now he's getting a better response."  </P> <P> Part of Christo's purpose in visiting the West Coast for 3 1/2 days last month  was to drum up paid recruits who will install, protect and answer questions  about the umbrellas while they are displayed next fall. Christo's never had  trouble in the past finding help, and when he showed his umbrella slides and  answered questions in Los Angeles and Valencia, the crowds were so large that  many had to sit on the floor.  </P> <P> "Why do you create such big monumental art?" someone in the crowd shouted as  Christo stood behind a lectern on the USC campus.  </P> <P> "My, human beings build much bigger things," he replied in his thick Bulgarian  accent. "They build airports, skyscrapers, highways, bridges, much more  monumental." He said his art "is monumental because it is only irrational and  completely irresponsible."  </P> <P> The audience cheered.  </P> <P> Christo lectured at night and hiked during the day. Two years ago, he walked  for miles -- he said it was the equivalent of 2 1/2 trips up and down Mt.  Everest -- to mark where he wanted to place each umbrella. This time, he wanted  to make revisions.  </P> <P> Christo knows the dips and bends and contours of this brutish landscape like a  tour bus driver knows Hollywood. He picked a favorite vista to unfurl his maps  and talk about his plans. It was a steep hillside covered with tall dry grass  that sounded like muffled firecrackers when crushed underfoot. Nearby was a  wooden surveyor's stick tied with a pink plastic ribbon flapping in the wind.  It marks the spot where one of the umbrellas will stand.  </P> <P> From Christo's hillside vantage point, I-5 looked like a thin gray snake. A  dying oak tree clung to the crumbling earth and a cascade of boulders appeared  frozen in a free fall. To the north, the burnished hills formed a distant giant  V and beyond lay the pancake-flat expanse of the San Joaquin Valley, tinted  blue by clouds.  </P> <P> "Here the freedom of the umbrellas is so visible," Christo said in awe.  </P> <P> "They are so free. They have no other reason than to be works of art."  </P> <P> The umbrella project is an international effort. The nylon fabric was woven in  Germany. Various parts were manufactured in Japan, Iowa, Kansas and Texas. The  umbrella tops are being sewn at North Sails Inc. in San Diego, one of the  world's largest sail makers.  </P> <P> Later this month, workers from Rain for Rent, an irrigation company, will begin  assembling and painting the aluminum and steel umbrellas in a dilapidated  warehouse in Bakersfield. Its location is a secret.  </P> <P> There were only three people working in the warehouse one recent afternoon, but  they were making a terrible racket. The sound of drills cutting through  aluminum bounced off the concrete floor and bowed ceiling. The poles, which  looked like giant metal straws, were stacked in tall piles.  </P> <P> Mike Grundvig, chief engineer at Rain for Rent, will oversee this portion of  the aesthetic process. He says he is amazed at the resiliency of Christo's art.  </P> <P> To test its durability, an umbrella was left for three months on a mountaintop  in Tejon Pass. After a windstorm earlier this year, Grundvig was dispatched to  pick up the pieces.  </P> <P> "I didn't expect to see it there," he acknowledged. "Not in one piece."  </P> <P> But it was.  </P></p>

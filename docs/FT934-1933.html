			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Book Review: Ultimate problem child RUSSIA 2010. WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE WORLD By Daniel Yergin and Thane Gustafson Random House, Dollars 23, 300 pages A book bearing this title gives rise to fears of a teach-yourself-Russian-politics book with a little futurology thrown in. It is not. It is an extraordinarily intelligent piece of work. Daniel Yergin is author of The Prize, a compendious and exciting history of oil, and of a revisionist history of the Vietnam War, Shattered Peace. Thane Gustafson is a scholar whose published interests cover Soviet energy policy, politics and the military. Together they have applied a level of experience and acute judgment which raises Russia 2010 to the level - rarely attained - of a book which qualifies for the accolade 'essential'. Reading it while Russia's latest crisis roared in the background meant being struck by the extent to which their framework could contain and explain events whose precise nature they could not have forecast. There are mistaken judgments - as when they predict, in one of their scenarios of the future, that government control of the media helps squash a nationalist upsurge. One recent lesson is that control, when exercised ineptly, causes a wave of support for the media underdog, in this case Vladimir Zhirinovsky. But these are minor shortcomings. The American diplomat-scholar George Kennan, writing after the second world war, said that, in trying to understand the Soviet Union, we tread 'the unfirm substance of the imponderables'. Yergin and Gustafson illuminate present imponderables by taking on the internally contradictory nature of post-Soviet Russia. Freedom ushers in scope for a new despotism and strong central control holds out the only chance for the rational working of a free economy. While interviewing the leader of a neo-fascist movement calling itself Liberal Democratic, I was grateful for an analysis which incorporates paradox and the apparently enduring reality that truth in Russia includes falsehood - and falsehood, truth. Yergin's and Gustafson's aim is to 'apply scenario planning to the future of Russia'. They believe that 'the collapse of communism stands as the most important development for the entire world at the end of the 20th century'. Their exercise is intended to overcome what Anthony Eden, former British prime minister and victim of Suez, despairingly said was governments' tendency to be 'always a lap behind, the fatal lap'. Thus the book contains four scenarios outlining Russia's likely future. The first scenario is the present 'muddling down', as the authors call it: a weak central government, a continuing struggle for power and property, relative freedom, fractious relations between the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union which cannot live comfortably with each other but cannot live without each other, soft budget restraints and demoralised security forces. The prognosis is contradictory. It 'could lead to a Russian version of the economic miracle (and) . . . it is fertile ground for extremism' (as we have just seen). The second scenario is called the 'two-headed eagle'. It is a reassertion, up to a point, of central authority: a mildly authoritarian, rather than extreme, reaction to chaos which threatens after an attempt to assassinate President Yeltsin; order is re-established but this involves top-down stimulation of a market economy; those running the state, while they lack the pro-market zeal of Gaidar and the reformers, nonetheless quietly adopt elements of their programme. At least as persuasive a scenario, sadly, is the third - the 'time of troubles: chaos and reaction'. A military junta takes over from the weak president who succeeds a demoralised Yeltsin, and suppresses most free institutions. Yet, because the junta has no long-run alternative, it resorts again to the market, albeit one contained within a centralised, nationalistic and authoritarian state framework. The last scenario is the most fantastic. The authors call it the 'chudo', or miracle. In this instance, a government which holds steadily to a pro-market course, overcomes the political obstacles and safeguards a new class of property owners and pro-market technocrats. 'By 2003 the Russian economy begins growing at a 9 per cent annual rate,' suggest the authors, 'fuelled by abundant manpower, resourceful Russian management, high and rising personal incomes, natural resources and foreign capital.' For this outcome, Russia has to navigate between the re-establishment of a strong state controlling the 'market' (the Chinese model) and the disintegrative tendencies in the 'muddling down' scenario. But there are few signs the Russian authorities have the sophistication for this. The authors also propose eight 'surprises' (mostly unpleasant) and sketch in a western response, raising the final paradox, namely that the west is at once marginal (in terms of direct influence) and crucial (in resources and know-how) to Russia's development. In international life - to quote the authors citing Kennan again - there is 'nothing final in point of time, nothing not vulnerable to the law of change'. This book helps us understand the vulnerabilities of this century's greatest problem child.</p>

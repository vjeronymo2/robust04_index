			<p>BFN     [Text] The discussion and, especially, the revision of  borders has always been a fraught business, so to speak, even if  it only takes place on paper. Participants in an international  conference on cartography which opened in Moscow today know this  well. Over to our correspondent, Andrey Zenkov:    [Zenkov] In various eras, no matter how different the  prevailing social system, no matter how complex the internal and  external political situation, the Geographical Department, the  Maps Department, the Supreme Geodesic Directorate, the Main  Directorate for Cartography attached to the Council of Ministers  and, now, Russia's Federal Service for Geodesy and Cartography,  have always done basically the same job. With assistance from  their experts they entered on maps the dividing lines which  politicians, assisted by the military, decided on. For 68 years  of its 75-year existence the Russian cartographic service has  answered to the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the State  Committee for Construction, the Ministry of Ecology, or the  Ministry of Natural Resources. Each of these bodies had its own  priorities.    [Begin Zhalkovskiy recording] We have now managed to  declassify maps in the 1:1,000,000 series, the 1:500,000 series,  and the 1:200,000 series. The Ministry of Defense has also  agreed to the declassification of the 1:100,000 series. Maps  for the use of the public, including maps of oblasts, maps of  rayons, and maps of regions, are being produced on the basis of  these maps. We will produce these maps. In fact we have  already started. They will be very detailed. You will be able  to find your own village -- and maybe even your own house on  them. [end recording]    As Yevgeniy Zhalkovskiy, first deputy head of the service,  told me, few people realize that throughout the entire existence  of the USSR, the only countries with whom we had official  agreements on the mapping of borders were Finland, Poland,  Korea, and Mongolia. Today special commissions are discussing  these extremely difficult issues with the Baltic republics and  the countries of the Caucasus region.</p>

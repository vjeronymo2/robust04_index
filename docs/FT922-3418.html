			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / More jobs likely to be shed at BAe BRITISH AEROSPACE is ex-pected today to announce a further 700 redundancies in its Dynamics missile division. Most of the redundancies - about 450 jobs - will be at Stevenage, Hertfordshire. The news comes only a week after BAe announced 640 job losses at its Stevenage space systems facility. The expected measure will bring to almost 6,000 the number of job reductions announced by leading UK defence contractors since the start of the year. It is likely to meet hostile reaction from unions after hopes for the Dynamics division's future were boosted by the award in March of a Pounds 570m Ministry of Defence contract for new air-to-air missiles. The division had already announced that it was cutting 450 jobs, bringing its total workforce down to about 6,000. The reductions are largely among engineering employees. In addition to the cuts at Stevenage about 150 jobs are expected to go at BAe's missile manufacturing plant at Lostock, near Bolton, and more than 100 at Bristol. BAe warned this year that 10,000 jobs would be shed in the group over two years after preliminary 1991 results showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 81m. Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the cuts would be 'yet another blow to the reputation of British Aerospace as Britain's leading manufacturer'. Meanwhile, unions representing MoD civilian personnel yesterday pressed Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, for a share of defence budget savings to be paid to staff affected by government cuts. About 20,000 staff are due to leave under the Options for Change programme. Over-60s will be compulsorily retired, and 14,000 headquarters staff are to be relocated outside London.</p>

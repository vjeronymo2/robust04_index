			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sterling's collapse helps MAI advance by 12% to Pounds 33.9m MAI, the financial services and media group headed by Lord Hollick, the Labour peer, increased pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 33.9m in the six months to December 31, against Pounds 30.2m. The core money and security broking business was again the main engine, accounting for all but Pounds 25m of turnover, which was up 9 per cent at Pounds 204.5m (Pounds 187.2m). Broking operating profit was up 16 per cent at Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 18.8m) in what analysts described as peak conditions with governments worldwide seeking financing for deficits. With 60 per cent of profits accruing overseas, mostly in dollars, the company benefited from the sterling crash following 'Black Wednesday' last September. Lord Hollick said translation was at an average of Dollars 1.69, compared with Dollars 1.75 for the 1991-92 year. With the rate now running at about Dollars 1.43, the benefit would be greater in the second half, he said. MAI added, however, that profits had been held back by a sharp decline in foreign exchange activity in the Far East, particularly Japan, where there was no sign of a sustained improvement. Meanwhile, Lord Hollick declined to comment on his relations with fellow directors at Mirror Group Newspapers. He has distanced himself from a recent statement from the board expressing support for the current management but refused to be drawn on reports that he might resign. 'I am still a director,' he said. He was more forthcoming about Meridian Television, which won the south of England ITV franchise with a Pounds 36m bid and began broadcasting on January 1. He said advertising and audience figures were slightly ahead of target. It was premature to speak of a sustained upturn in TV advertising, but prospects seemed good. MAI is investing Pounds 30m most of which has already been spent, with a targeted profit for the company in 1994. Profits increased at the Wagon used car finance company, the mainstay of retail financial services, despite sluggish motor sales. Analysts said Wagon had increased its market share and appeared to have overcome the worst of its bad debt problems. Wagon said it had refinanced more than Pounds 200m of bank loans on a medium term basis. Profits in the information side, which includes the NOP market research organisation, were also well ahead at Pounds 2.1m, compared with Pounds 1.2m, on turnover of Pounds 25.4m (Pounds 22.9m). The interim dividend is raised to 2p (1.4p) to reduce disparity. Earnings per share were 6.5p (5.8p).</p>

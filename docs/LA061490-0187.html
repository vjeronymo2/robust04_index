			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE FIRING LINE;  </P> <P> FIREARMS: WHO TAKES THE BLAME WHEN ACCIDENTAL SHOOTINGS OCCUR? MOST CITE A LACK  OF PROPER EDUCATION IN HANDLING HANDGUNS.  </P> <P> Officially, the cause of Christian Wiedepuhl's death was a .38 caliber bullet  in his brain.  </P> <P> It was fired at point blank range by another 17-year-old boy, who was examining  his parents' pistol in an upstairs room of the family's Anaheim Hills home on  the afternoon of May 24. The slug struck Wiedepuhl above the right eye.  </P> <P> Four years earlier, at the same hour and in the same room, the same boy, then  in junior high school, fired a round while examining his parents' shotgun and  killed 13-year-old Jeffrey Bush.  </P> <P> Officially, the cause of Jeffrey Bush's death was three 12-gauge shotgun  pellets in his brain.  </P> <P> Unofficially, however, these two extraordinary deaths may be far more complex.  Many believe the four bits of lead that snuffed out two young lives were not  causes but consequences of living in a society in which between 60 million and  65 million citizens own firearms.  </P> <P> Who to blame? It depends on whom you talk to.  </P> <P> The Wiedepuhl death is being investigated by police and the Bush case has been  re-opened, but for the time being both shootings are considered accidents. So  was it the boy's fault? Or were his parents guilty of improperly storing and  securing the weapons? Should they have kept guns in their home at all? Should  they have educated their son in the proper handling of the guns? Should they  have been sold the weapons in the first place?  </P> <P> In the United States each day, an average of one child dies in an accidental  shooting, according to the Washington, D.C.-based Center to Prevent Handgun  Violence. And, according to a study of unintentional shootings conducted by the  organization, the deadliest months of the The study of 532 shootings asserts  that such accidents among children 16 and under increase dramatically during  the summer and December holiday seasons. It also found that 42% of the  shootings occurred in the afternoon; in two-thirds of the cases, the children  were unsupervised.  </P> <P> A second study conducted by the center addressed itself specifically to  handguns. It found that three of four handguns used in 266 unintentional  shootings were owned by the parents of the victims or shooters, that 38% of the  shootings occurred in the homes of friends and relatives, and that 50% occurred  in the victims' own homes.  </P> <P> Still, handguns proliferate. According to National Rifle Assn. statistics, 65  million handguns are owned by between 30 and 35 million people, 58% of whom say  they own the gun primarily for protection. And 4.6 million people, or 13% of  the owners, say they actually have used the weapon for that purpose.  </P> <P> Whatever its intended use, however, the handgun continues to be at the center  of the most furious of firearms debates. Its opponents, if they do not argue  for an outright ban on the handgun's sale and ownership, urge that it not be  kept in the home. Supporters cite rising crime rates and the Second Amendment  to the Constitution as reasons for keeping a handgun.  </P> <P> And somewhere in the center falls Richard Wiedepuhl, Christian's father.  </P> <P> "I believe that there's nothing wrong with keeping a gun, except for an Uzi or  something like that," says Wiedepuhl. "But people need to be trained."  </P> <P> Wiedepuhl's profound grief and frustration over his son's death has not  modified that position. Although he says tearfully that nothing can mitigate  the sadness his family feels, he continues to believe, vehemently, that it was  not the pistol that killed Christian, but a lack of foresight and care on the  part of the parents of the boy handling the gun, and a lack of basic education  on the part of the boy himself.  </P> <P> "A person should have to get a permit for the gun, then go to the (range) and  learn how to use it and then purchase the firearm. It's very dangerous, like a  car. You don't drive a car 180 miles per hour. It's the same with firearms. You  have the right to own them, but you have to understand how to handle them and  secure them," Wiedepuhl says.  </P> <P> That last comment is a fairly accurate summation of the party line of the NRA,  likely the most tenacious defender of the rights of handgun ownership.  </P> <P> "People want the most optimum piece of (home protection) equipment for the  money, and a firearm is going to be your best bet for that, more than a knife  or some other device," says Tracey Martin, manager of women's issues and  information for the NRA and a firearms instructor. "It's a lethal force, but in  order to become proficient, there's not the investment of time that's involved  in a martial art, for instance."  </P> <P> The NRA, says Martin, does not advocate mandatory firearm training for new  owners, but recommends such courses. It is education, she says, that "is the  key to avoiding any type of accident. There's one hard-and-fast rule with the  NRA, and that's that a gun should be stored so that it's inaccessible to  untrained and unauthorized persons."  </P> <P> Children, in particular, are resourceful.  </P> <P> "I don't care how old or young a kid is, if there's a gun in the house, they're  going to find it," says Randy Garell, president of The Grant Boys, a firearms  retailer in Costa Mesa. "That's why we recommend that you put a trigger guard  lock on the gun or -- and this is the first choice -- that the gun go in a lock  box."  </P> <P> But, he says, locks are not an excuse for neglecting education.  </P> <P> "Children," Garell says, "should be educated at the earliest possible age how  to shoot and how to respect firearms and what the deadly consequences are of  their misuse. That's certainly something that isn't taught on television. In  one scene a guy's shot and in another he gets right up. They have to know that  this is a deadly object and that misuse of it will end their lives."  </P> <P> Or the lives of others, as many police officers know.  </P> <P> "That's a real fear we have," says Lt. Robert Helton, a spokesman for the Santa  Ana Police Department, "that a loved one will be out late and will try to come  home quietly and they might startle their own spouse in the dark. They see a  shadow in the closet in the dark and the next thing you know, kaboom.  </P> <P> "From my perspective, I would say most people (who keep handguns at home)  become more of a hindrance than a help. When we get a call from a person in a  residence, one of the first questions the dispatcher will ask is if they have a  handgun in the house. We won't go in if someone has a handgun. They do get  really pumped up in that situation, and we don't always come in through the  front door."  </P> <P> It is in just such a situation that the handgun owner's reason for keeping a  loaded weapon in the house must crystallize into deliberate, well-planned  action. An intruder at the bedroom door in the middle of the night presents the  moment of ultimate truth. Such a situation is the reason the person bought the  weapon in the first place, but no one -- not police, not firearms advocates,  not handgun opponents and particularly not the person holding the weapon -- can  predict whether the finger will be able to pull the trigger.  </P> <P> The law in such situations, says Garell, is clear.  </P> <P> "You have to think you or someone else is going to die," he says. "It's much  the same for a civilian as for a peace officer: You have to be in mortal fear  of your life with no other option, no place to hide and no place to run."  </P> <P> But, he says, if the situation calls for it, you must be prepared to take a  life.  </P> <P> "You don't pick up a gun to threaten," says Garell, "and you don't shoot to  wound. That's great in the movies, but once you pick up that gun, you have to  make the decision that you're prepared to use it, because if the other person  is armed and they see that you have a gun, they're likely to shoot you."  </P> <P> In fact, says Lt. Marc Hedgpeth, commander of the crimes against persons bureau  of the Anaheim Police Department, "We're seeing a trend in that quite  frequently the mere fact that you carry a firearm is not going to lessen the  possibility that you'll have somebody confront you. It's not that uncommon for  even police officers to attempt to hold a criminal suspect at gunpoint and have  the person challenge them to shoot them or even attack them, even though the  officer is armed."  </P> <P> Which is why, say gun advocates, a handgun in the home should be the final  resort.  </P> <P> "A firearm," says the NRA's Martin, "is the last line of self-defense, after  you've exhausted everything else." But, say Helton and others, there are many  people who own handguns who "on a whim purchase a gun, never even fire it, take  it home, and load it up and salt it away in the night stand."  </P> <P> It is these guns, more than any others, that can end up on evidence tables in  cases such as these:  </P> <P> * A 19-year-old Santa Ana man, Jose Rojas, accidentally shot himself in the  head and died in January, 1989, while brandishing a .357-caliber handgun  outside his Santa Ana home. Family members and neighbors told police Rojas had  been drinking and had been firing the gun all day.  </P> <P> * Last August, 9-year-old Melissa Delfrancia was accidentally shot in the neck  after she and her sister found a .44-caliber magnum revolver apparently left in  their Tustin-area home by a workman. She survived.  </P> <P> * Gregorio Torrez, 18, of La Habra, shot himself in the head and died last  September while playing Russian roulette with a friend's father's .38-caliber  revolver.  </P> <P> * A Santa Ana woman, Norma Nunez, was killed last October after being shot in  the chest by a bullet from her husband's .38-caliber revolver while he was  cleaning the gun.  </P> <P> There are, however, instances in which handguns have been used successfully by  private citizens to foil crimes:  </P> <P> * Craig Tantalo of San Juan Capistrano answered his door at about 2 a.m. in  February, 1986, and was confronted by two masked and armed men, one of whom  shoved a pistol into his face. As he was backing up, Tantalo reached behind him  and grabbed a 9-millimeter pistol he had forgotten to put away the night  before, disarmed the man and shot him in the groin. The second man fled.  </P> <P> * In September, 1987, 76-year-old Roy Johnson, a resident of Leisure World in  Seal Beach, was awakened by sounds in his apartment and confronted a burglar  with his own .22-caliber revolver. When the man advanced on him, Johnson fired,  wounding the man in the right armpit. The burglar fled on a motorcycle but was  captured an hour later.  </P> <P> But there are no guarantees of a happy ending when bullets start to fly, says a  spokesperson for a national anti-handgun group.  </P> <P> "I certainly believe people when they say that they would never use a gun on a  member of their own family," says Marjolijn Bijlefeld, the associate director  of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a Washington, D.C.-based educational,  statistical and lobbying group.  </P> <P> "But your intentions and your behavior are not always the same, particularly if  there are drugs or alcohol involved. If we could somehow verify that you're  buying a gun and you're always going to be a model citizen, you're never going  to get angry or have the wrong people over, or never have kids over, then maybe  we could talk. But you can't verify that."  </P> <P> According to statistics gathered by the coalition, the chances of using the  weapon properly do not appear to be good. There were 140 justifiable homicides  committed with handguns in 1988, says Bijlefeld. But there were also slightly  more than 9,000 handgun homicides that were not justified, about 12,000  suicides and about 1,000 unintentional shootings that were fatal.  </P> <P> That last category hurts Richard Wiedepuhl most deeply because it implies, with  antiseptic certainty, that his son's death could have been avoided.  </P> <P> "I can't bring my son back," he says. "But I'm going to make sure that people  realize that extreme steps must be taken. Education comes first, as soon as  possible, and then security. Because we could become a killing society, with  more people dying of accidents than diseases.  </P> <P> "This is a grief which I never will outlive. You never think you're going to  outlive your own children."  </P> <P>  Times Researcher Dallas M. Jackson contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P></p>

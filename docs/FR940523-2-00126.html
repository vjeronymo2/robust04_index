This has led to the issuance of a number of consent cease and desist orders and the assessment of substantial civil penalties for violations of these restrictions. Investigations of possible violations by a number of other airlines and travel agents are continuing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By this Notice, we once again take the opportunity to reaffirm the restrictions that were put in place as a result of security concerns by Department Order 85&hyph;7&hyph;45, as modified by Order 92&hyph;8&hyph;25. Specifically, it is a condition of all certificates held by U.S. air carriers, all permits held by foreign air carriers and all exemptions from sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Aviation Act that the holder shall not sell in the United States any passenger transportation by air which includes any type of stop in Lebanon. The Department has consistently interpreted this restriction to apply to all sales activities in the United States by air carriers and their agents, including travel agents, consolidators, wholesalers and other third parties, that are utilized to transact such sales. This prohibition includes any activity undertaken in the United States that effectuates the sale of such air transportation and includes, but is not limited to, reservations made in the United States by any air carrier or its agents by mail, overnight express, courier, telephone, facsimile or other means to any air carrier or its agents, including travel agents, consolidators, wholesalers and other third parties, located outside the United States that results in the issuance of a passenger ticket or the confirmation of a reservation for passenger air transportation to Lebanon.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fact that a ticket for air transportation is issued outside the U.S. is not dispositive of whether the sale of that ticket was made in the U.S. Thus, for example, a travel agent receiving reimbursement in the U.S. for a passenger ticket for air transportation service to Lebanon, who obtains that ticket through an airline or consolidator in Canada, would be in violation of the Department's Lebanon restrictions. Likewise, an airline that accepts a U.S. telephone purchase in Canada for air transportation to Lebanon, with ticket delivery in the U.S., would also violate our Lebanon restrictions. These agents and airlines would be subject to the imposition of substantial civil penalties. Moreover, criminal prosecution could result from knowing and willful violations of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This Notice shall be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and shall be served on all certificated air carriers, all foreign air carriers, the United States Departments of State and Justice, the Air Transport Association, the International Air Transport Association, the National Air Carrier Association, the American Society of Travel Agents, and the Association of Retail Travel Agents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 17, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Patrick V.

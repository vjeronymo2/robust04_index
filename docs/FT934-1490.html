			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Reliance Security rises to Pounds 991,000 Pre-tax profits of Reliance Security, the USM-quoted security provider, rose 10 per cent from Pounds 905,000 to Pounds 991,000 in the 27 weeks to November 5. The improvement was struck on turnover marginally ahead from Pounds 34.1m to Pounds 35.3m and was helped by a reduced loss of Pounds 430,000 (Pounds 502,000) in the electronic surveillance business. Mr Brian Kingham, chairman, said that although there were some positive signs, recovery from recession seemed likely to be slow. The interim dividend is maintained at 1.1p, payable from earnings per share up from 2.7p to 3p.</p>

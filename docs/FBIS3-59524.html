			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jean de Galard: "1994 Defense Budget </F> Examined"--first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION MAGAZINE  INTERNATIONAL introduction]    [Text] The budget bill just approved by the National  Assembly provides among other things for the 1994 delivery of 12  Mirage 2000 D and 10 Mirage F1CT. But only three Mirage 2000 DA  will be delivered, instead of the six planned.    Following two tame and unmemorable debates, the National  Assembly on 10 November 1993 passed the 1994 defense budget  presented and defended by Defense Minster Francois Leotard. The  Socialist and Communist deputies voted against. As will be  recalled, the military equipment budget authorized new spending  of 94.9 billion French francs [Fr], 7.8 percent less than the  initial 1993 budget, but with the addition of Fr5.5 billion  carried forward into 1994 and transfers amounting to Fr2.6  billion, the grand total comes to Fr103 billion. This is shown  in the attached table [see below] extracted from the report  presented on behalf of the Finance Commission by UDF [French  Democratic Union] deputy Arthur Paecht, one of its members.    At Fr103 billion, it amounts to a 5.7 percent increase over  the appropriations actually made available in 1993, taking into  account the cancellation of some credits during the year (9  billion) and the carryforward of others into 1993 (3.5 billion).  The rapporteur made two important observations about the defense  package:        -  The Fr103 billion includes nonrenewable appropriations.  As a result, there may be some risk that the budgetary reference  point used for programming purposes will still be only Fr94.9  billion;    -  Comparisons between 1994 and 1993 are virtually impossible,  owing to uncertainties affecting the two budgets: on the one  hand, carryforwards, cancellations, and external operations in  1993; on the other, carryforwards, transfers, and external  operations in 1994 -- and all with the assumption there will be  no freezes or canceled appropriations during this fiscal  year.       A category-by-category analysis of this budget leads to the  following observations:    Space: At Fr4,147 million, the appropriation for space  programs (budget + carryforwards) is up 13.8 percent, with the  increase inuring mainly to the benefit of the Helios optical  reconnaissance and observation satellite, the first of which is  scheduled for launch in 1994. In addition, the Syracuse II  (telecommunications satellite) program will benefit from the  decision to launch a fourth satellite. Research on radar  (Osiris) and electromagnetic (Zenon) observation satellites will  continue.    Nuclear: The total Fr22.9 billion in appropriations  requested  for the nuclear deterrent force (research, development, and  fabrication) represents an 8.8 percent reduction, due to  completion of the Mirage 2000N program and the stretching-out of  the M5 ballistic missile program. The [new-generation]  nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine program (SNLE NG)  will continue as before. The "Triomphant" is expected to enter  into service in 1996, the "Temeraire" in 1998, and the  "Vigilant" in 2001.    The segment of the minister's speech devoted to resumption  of  nuclear testing raised a number of eyebrows. We will quote from  it at length:    "...As for resumption of testing, the question is not  whether  we must do so but when: This will be determined solely in terms  of the need to protect our vital interests and our independence.  Thus it is not the moratorium which is at issue, but rather its  perpetuity... Many speakers have called for resumption of  testing in order to acquire simulation capability. The necessity  of this, for France and for other countries as well, is  incontestable."    Air Force: It can expect an overall equipment budget of  Fr24.3 billion (up 3.7 percent). The Rafale Air Force program is  being stretched out by six months (the consequences of this  delay are analyzed on page 10 of this issue).    As planned, 12 Mirage 2000 D and 10 Mirage F1CT will be  delivered in 1994. However, only three Mirage 2000 DA will be  delivered rather than the six planned.    The SCCOA (System for Command and Control of Air Operations)  program will be stretched out by several months. The program to  purchase Tucano training aircraft from Brazil is scaled back  slightly (18 aircraft instead of the 20 planned).    The other programs, including the Mirage 2000-5, will  proceed  as previously scheduled.    Army: Its equipment budget comes to Fr23.9 billion (up six  percent). A total of 44 Leclerc tanks will be ordered instead of  the 66 planned, and (as planned) 34 of them are scheduled for  delivery.    The other programs (light armored vehicle, Eryx and  long-range AC3G antitank missiles, multiple rocket-launchers)  are retained. The "Tigre" and NH-90 helicopter programs will  proceed as scheduled.    Navy: Its equipment appropriations -- Fr24.5 billion -- are  up 4.4 percent over the total available in 1993. The  nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was delayed six months in 1993  as a result of canceled appropriations. It is now scheduled to  go into service in mid-1999. The Rafale Navy program is also  pushed back six months. The state will order only two Rafale  Navy aircraft in 1994 instead of the four planned. Five  Atlantique 2 aircraft will be delivered in 1994.    Other programs will proceed as previously scheduled,  including the NH-90 transport helicopter, a cooperative venture  between the Army and three European partner countries (Germany,  Netherlands, Italy). The special rapporteur expressed the hope  that the total cost of this program, still in the development  phase, can be determined very precisely along with its financing  modalities.    Gendarmerie: Its budget is Fr2.2 billion.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Equipment Outlays for 1994 (in millions of French francs)                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Chapters          |1994 Appropriatio-|Carryforwards     |Total             |  |                  |ns                |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |56-60 Research--S-|3,515             |460               |3,975             |  |pace              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |56-70 Research--N-|13,577            |395               |13,972            |  |uclear            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |56-80 Research--C-|15,219            |425               |15,644            |  |onventional       |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |52-70 Investments |1,609             |330               |1,939             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |53-70 Fabrication |3,274             |206               |3,480             |  |(joint services p-|                  |                  |                  |  |lus gendarmerie)  |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |53-80 Fabrication |49,850            |3,328             |53,178            |  |(Army-Air Force-N-|                  |                  |                  |  |avy)              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Infrastructure    |6,915             |424               |7,339             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Military Supplies |                  |-70               |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TOTAL TITLE V     |93,961            |5,500             |99,461            |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Title VI          |945               |0                 |945               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |TOTAL EQUIPMENT   |94,907            |5,500             |100,407           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transfers (commer-|+2,593            |0                 |+2,593            |  |cial accounts)    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |MILITARY EQUIPMEN-|97,500            |5,500             |103,000           |  |T BUDGET          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

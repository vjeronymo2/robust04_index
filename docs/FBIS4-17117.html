			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Boris Lysenko: "Give Back the Currency! German </F> Government Demands of Zhirinovskiy's Party"]    [Text] Berlin -- When in early January this year the  Berlin newspapers reported the sensational news that Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia [LDPR] may be  being financed from Germany, few people believed it.    Only one thing was known for sure: The German firm TFO GMBH  following a ruling from the independent state commission for  checking the property of parties and mass organizations of the  former GDR, was subject to a search during which important  documents were confiscated at the firm itself and at the  apartment of its leader, Werner Hirche. According to Josef  Dirdorf, leader of the German trust agency's "special property"  directorate, these documents confirmed the suggestion that "TFO  had intensive contacts with Zhirinovskiy."    Official representatives of the FRG's trust agency assert  that in the fall of 1993, on the eve of the elections in Russia,  V. Zhirinovskiy's representatives received from a representative  of Hirche's company 63,600 deutsche marks [DM]. In  October-November last year over the course of a month four  representatives of Zhirinovskiy's party headed by Aleksey  Vedenkin, the LDPR leader's financial adviser, were in Berlin at  the invitation of TFO. The DM13,600 went to keep them and  50,000 were transferred to Moscow. Now, through its lawyers in  Moscow, the German trust agency is demanding that Zhirinovskiy  return that sum to Germany.    The LDPR categorically sweeps aside the trust agency's  demands. They say our liberal democrats are not familiar with  the TFO firm.    Perhaps the FRG trust agency would not have managed to  establish the true nature of the LDPR's relations with the TFO  firm had it not been for one important circumstance. According  to BERLINER ZEITUNG Werner Hirche, the firm's owner, has been  "cooperating fruitfully" for several months now with the German  law enforcement organs. With his aid the trust agency has  managed to find our for sure how many German marks the Berlin  company representative put into the accounts of his Russian  partners in foreign banks. The trust agency has documents  attesting that this sum was over Dm1 million. Thus, the  accounts of Russian representatives in Luxembourg banks have  been sequestered. They contain DM600,000 while a Prague bank  contains DM840,000.    All your IZVESTIYA correspondent's attempts to find out the  names of the Russian citizens whose bank accounts have been  sequestered in Luxembourg and Prague have failed. The BERLINER  ZEITUNG editorial office and the trust agency had just one  reply: Specific information relating to the questions you are  asking about is not yet being made public. In accordance with  the federal "data protection" law it is not permitted to cite  specific names until the end of the investigation. Most likely  they are known to the Moscow militia but not to the journalists  in Berlin.    The commission asserts that Hirche has already helped  Germany  to recover DM60 million. Hirche engaged in the "concealment" of  Socialist Unity Party of Germany currency stocks. It was to him  that the GDR's communist leaders entrusted part of their  currency wealth. Hirche gave away to the commission the secret  accounts of his former communist bosses in foreign banks.  Hirche's truthfulness has thus been tested and his evidence is  authentic.    So Hirche's testimony that currency was transferred to  Moscow  for the election campaign of Zhirinovskiy's party and also the  existence of the relevant financial documents looks convincing.  It will be very, very hard to dismiss the meticulous German  officials.    The FRG mass media have taken up the LDPR leader in earnest  and are beginning to investigate his "past and present with a  fine toothcomb." The DM50,000 handed over to Zhirinovskiy  belong to the German state and giving them to anyone is a crime.</p>

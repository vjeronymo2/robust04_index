			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Lacklustre recovery under way in Japan A lacklustre economic recovery is under way in Japan, hampered by a weak jobs market and a continued decline in corporate investment, the Japanese central bank reported yesterday. Businesses are slightly more confident than they expected to be last spring, stocks of unsold inventories are falling, and companies are finding it easier to borrow money, the Bank of Japan's latest Tankan quarterly survey of business conditions reveals. The survey 'shows economic recovery quite clearly,' said Mr Yasushi Mieno, central bank governor. But Mr Kagehide Kaku, head of the central bank's research and statistics department, added: 'This backs our judgment the economy is heading to recovery, but falls short of brushing out economic fragility.' The lacklustre upturn depicted by the most authoritative indicator of Japan's short-term economic outlook is expected to lessen the central bank's inclination to tighten monetary policy, motivated by its fear of repeating the run-away rise in asset prices that foreshadowed the recession. Government bond prices strengthened in response. It fuelled speculation in Tokyo that the government's Economic Planning Agency would declare an official end to the three-year recession when it publishes its monthly economic report on Friday. The Tankan index of big manufacturers' business confidence improved from -50 in the previous review in May, to -39 in August. The index records the change in the balance of companies citing a better and worse business outlook, from a sample of 10,000 businesses. It continues the improvement shown in the previous survey in May, the first upturn in confidence recorded by the Tankan for five years. This suggests the recession touched bottom for the survey in the final quarter of last year. The balance of businesses reporting excessive inventories fell from 23 in May to 17 in August, while the ratio of those reporting that banks' lending stance was getting easier rose from 17 to 19 over the same period. But the balance of companies with surplus employees remains high at 25, compared with 26 in May. Another disappointment is that leading companies plan to cut capital investment by 3.8 per cent this year, only slightly less bad than the 3.7 per cent reduction forecast in May. Small businesses are even more cautious, forecasting a 14.3 per cent investment fall this year. The recovery will be fragile and uneven, according to yesterday's review. Manufacturers expect a sharp profits rise this year, led by exports to the recovering economies of the US and Europe and helped by a moderate rise in domestic demand. But poorly-competitive service companies think profits will fall again, squeezed by increased competition. For large manufacturers, that means a forecast 16.1 per cent rise in profits this year, better than the 14.9 per cent expected in the previous survey, and a sharp turnround from their 26.3 per cent profits decline last year. They forecast a small rise in sales this year, 0.3 per cent, reflecting a fall in prices. Large service companies believe profits will fall 5.1 per cent this year, slightly worse than the 5 per cent decline they were expecting in May and much worse than the 17.9 per cent earnings decline they recorded in 1993.</p>

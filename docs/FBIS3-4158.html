			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 26 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today that his country may possibly  join NATO in the future, but that this was not the right time.    Touring the northern city of Murmansk together with his  Norwegian counterpart Bjoern Tore Godal, Kozyrev stressed that  it is still too early to talk about Russia's full membership in  NATO.    Cooperation between Russia and the NATO countries is the  only  issue that should be stressed right now, he added.    Moscow has stated its readiness to join NATO's partnership  for peace program, a step which could finally lead to Russia's  full membership.    However, Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev earlier this  month expressed his opposition to joining the organization,  although he is in favor of taking part in the Partnership for  Peace Program.    Among other reasons, Grachev fears that Russia may have to  reconstruct its 2.3-million-strong army if it joins NATO.    But the foreign minister did not rule out the possibility.    Kozyrev believes that Russia's ties with NATO are growing  steadily, citing the recent Russia-NATO joint military exercises.    For five days Russia held the war games, the first of its  kind, in the Barents Sea with troops from the United States,  Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and Norway, with the aim of  enforcing the U.N.-sponsored sea embargo against former  Yugoslavia.    Further cooperation between Russia and the NATO became the  main topic of discussions between Kozyrev and his visiting  Norwegian counterpart in Murmansk.    Before his departure, Godal praised Moscow for its  "constructive role" in resolving various world problems.    He welcomed Russia's earlier statement that it would soon  sign the Partnership for Peace Program, echoing Kozyrev's  optimistic prediction that the preparatory work was nearly ended.    Europe as a whole should draw no new boundary lines, but  instead cooperation on security should be strengthened, said  Godal, who left for home Saturday.</p>

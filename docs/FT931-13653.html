			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / ICI and BASF in exchange of assets IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, the UK's largest manufacturer, and BASF, the German chemicals giant, yesterday swapped their European polypropylene and acrylics businesses, as the restructuring of Europe's petrochemicals industry continued. The move follows last year's strategic alliance which gave Himont of Italy, Europe's largest supplier, and Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group, 30 per cent of the European polypropylene market. BASF is acquiring ICI's Pounds 135m turnover polypropylene business. In exchange the German group is selling ICI its Pounds 60m continental acrylics operations. ICI will also receive a consideration from BASF after due diligence has been completed. The British company is expected to receive between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. ICI's shares closed up 26p at Pounds 11.23. The deals allow ICI to exit from its loss-making European polypropylene business. The group controlled only 5 per cent of the European market which has been suffering from overcapacity and falling prices. BASF gains two polypropylene plants, one in Wilton on Teesside, the other at Rozenburg in the Netherlands, with a combined annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes. It becomes Europe's second largest polypropylene supplier with a capacity of 600,000 tonnes a year. About 530 ICI employees will transfer to BASF upon completion. The British group acquires three acrylic derivatives plants, two at Mainz in Germany and one at Barcelona in Spain. The company is building up its acrylics operations. Last year it swapped its fibres business for Du Pont's US acrylics plants. ICI said the BASF swap, which is due to be completed by the middle of this year, requires clearance from UK, Spanish, German and possibly Dutch competition authorities. The company said the deals would not affect US regulatory clearance for the Du Pont acquisition which is still outstanding. Mr John Newbold, district secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union, the main union at ICI's Teesside plants, said the only 'saving grace' was that the deal was with BASF, whose performance at the former Monsanto plant it now owns at Seal Sands, Teesside, had impressed the union.

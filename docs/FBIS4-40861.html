			<p>BFN     [Text] Tskhinvali 20 [dateline as received] -- Peacekeeping  forces stationed in the Tskhinvali region have undergone  changes. While up to 1,000 Russian airborne assault troops were  stationed in the region in 1992, only 523 soldiers of a motor  rifle battalion of the Russian Armed Forces are involved in the  peacekeeping operations there at the moment.    The commanders of the Russian peacekeeping forces have said  that they cannot stay in the region permanently. Therefore,  Ossetians and Georgians should find a common language promptly  to ensure a political settlement the current conflict.</p>

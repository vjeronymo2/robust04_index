			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Question and answer session following a news conference by </F> Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan with local reporters in  Abidjan on 14 January]    [Excerpts] [Noel Yao, REVEIL HEBDO] France has announced  the cancellation of half of our debt. How does this measure  reflect on the lives of Ivorians in concrete terms?    [Duncan] There are two levels of response to your question.  First, when you owe, normally you must settle your debt. This  debt will inevitably weigh on the use of your resources.  However, since you have less to pay, you have fewer constraints  on your resources, so you can use part of your resources to make  new investments and even meet your everyday needs. This is the  first aspect of my answer. In a more concrete way, this  reduction of our debt will mean the cancellation of all the  arrears Cote d'Ivoire owes to the French Development Fund, CFD.  This is extremely important, because up until now we were not  able to draw from this fund for the simple reason that we had  not paid our arrears. We are now in a position to get  disbursements from previous assistance.    For example, the CFD used to give assistance to the Abidjan  transport company [SOTRA] with government support. In recent  times the disbursements were stopped because Cote d'Ivoire had  accumulated arrears. Very soon we will be able to get a  disbursement of about 4 billion francs. You are undoubtedly  aware that SOTRA has some problems; there are not enough buses.  The government had to resort to additional borrowing of about  90 billion francs to have 150 buses repaired. New buses are  needed, and now we have funds. This is one concrete element.    Another concrete result of this reduction of our debt on the  lives of Ivorians will be in the textile sector. As you know,  we reorganized the textile sector, which took us a lot of time.  Long discussions took place between the government and the  private sector for the partial privatization of the sector. The  reorganization was to lead to the abolition of 800 out of 6,000  jobs. It was envisaged that after the sector had been revived  reemployment would be conducted. All this necessitated about 11  billion francs from the CFD. The greater part of this amount  has already been disbursed, and about 3.6 billion francs remain.  Because of the state's arrears to the CFD, the remaining  disbursement could not be made, so the reorganization program  encountered problems. The situation was even more alarming  because out of the remaining money 500 million francs was needed  to resettle the laid off workers. [passage omitted]    [Yao] Let's talk a bit about the sovereignty of our  countries. One has the feeling that the devaluation was imposed  on our heads of state without their being able to resist. Did  this decision come from our leaders, or it was simply dictated  to them by our partners?    [Duncan] I am going to put things bluntly: The decision to  change the exchange rate of the CFA franc was made by the heads  of state and governments of the 14 African countries. If the  heads of state did not want devaluation, they said so. Don't  you remember the in July 1992 in Paris they said no to  devaluation? Are you saying that when they say no, it is their  own decision, but when they say yes, then it is no longer their  decision? We must be logical. One can say "no" at a given time  and say "yes" at another time if new elements allow for a change  of opinion. [passage omitted]    Among the international institutions, financial backers  demanded conditionalities because they wanted to ensure that  countries that come to them have the ability to repay their  loans and have a good economic future, because it is economic  situation of a country which enables it to generate resources to  pay its external debt. [passage omitted]    Let us get this straight: The decision is not an imposed  one. We opted for devaluation because it appeared to us to be  the only way out of our crisis.    [Freedom Neruda, LA VOIE] Salaries have been frozen for 10  years now. It is obvious that the 5 to 10 percent salary  increase is not enough. In Niger labor unionists have demanded  a 70-percent salary increase. What does the government intend  to do in order to have the crop purchase prices it has just set  respected? Last year farmers were not protected enough against  dubious purchasers.    [Duncan] We admit that the 5 to 15 percent salary increase  is not enough. You said that Niger workers have demanded 70  percent, but how much did they obtain? This is what you should  know first. The reality is willy-nilly. We announced soon after  we returned from Washington that we would call on the nation for  more efforts, and this was not a lie. It is obvious that if you  increase salaries by 70 percent and producer prices by 100  percent your devaluation will be to no avail. It is like  beating the air. Let us understand each other well: Salary  increases should be low, otherwise your devaluation is to no  avail, which means that there is no effect, and you should start  all anew. One cannot do that. These are measures taken once  for all.    Why is the increase in farmers' revenues more substantial?  This is because they bore the brunt of the adjustment for a  long time. You, wage earners, your salaries were frozen but not  reduced. Elsewhere, salaries were cut, in addition to the  devaluation. You cannot say that you were not defended enough.    It is therefore important for political parties and labor  unions to understand that salaries cannot be increased beyond a  given level, otherwise the operation become worthless.    Concerning the control of crop purchasing prices, we have  set  up an interministerial committee charged with monitoring the  implementation of the various measures that we have just  announced. Even before the devalution, the minister of  agriculture took measures to this effect. They must now be  reinforced and checked.    In this sector and others, particular punitive measures will  be taken against businessmen who do not respect the decisions  made. In the past it was decided that farmers should  participate in the commercialization of their produce. The  guaranty funds will be increased substantially.  Cooperative-oriented groups will therefore be given resources  to play their role.    [James Cenac, NOUVEL HORIZON] Mr. Prime Minister, gas  delivered by the Ivorian Refinery Company costs 48 CFA francs.  The state gets 243 CFA francs for this gas, while pump  retailers get nine CFA francs on it. Now that sacrifices are  needed, isn't it possible for the state to use its margin to  freeze the price of gas sold at filling stations, especially  since the price of the commidity is linked to the dollar, which  has depreciated over the past few days, and as there is a  subsidy system in the price structure?    [Ducan] These are legitimate concerns which were much  expected. You can imagine that these issues were examined,  reexamined, and reviewed by the experts and the heads of state  and government who made this decision. [passage omitted]    First, concerning gas, this is a major question. I can see  that our friend James Cenac, went through enough documents to  give figures. Except for some minor details, his figures are  reliable. The answer is relatively simple. For a country to be  developed, it must benefit from projects, and to finance them,  it needs money. Where does this money come from -- from  taxpayers. Until further notice and before other types of  measures are taken, this money will be taken from taxpayers.  Actually, one of the means used to finance projects in Cote  d'Ivoire is taxes on petroleum products, since a large part of  these taxes go to the special investment and equipment budget to  finance roads and the major projects in this country. This  country's infrastructure was actually financed by these taxes. I  worked in the Ministry of Finance, so I also have some figures.  These taxes considerably contributed to financing projects in  this country, particularly in the road sector. Of course, fewer  taxes could have been raised by petroleum products.    [Duncan] If this had been done, however, we would probably  have not attained the development level we have today. That is  the reality of it. Oil taxes -- and I will give you the figures  -- amounted at the time to between 80 and 100 billion CFA francs  per year. They were substantial gains indeed, and that is what  enabled the state to carry out investments.... That is what  enabled the Special Investment and Equipment Budget [BSIE] to be  maintained at a relatively acceptable level in order to carry  out normal maintenance, pay for recurrent expenditure, and make  new investments despite the economic crisis. That is where the  funds for all that came from. If you do not have that  information, and I know you do, but since you asked the question  for the benefit of the public, I would like you to know that  these taxes were used to finance investments in our country.    You are saying that we could have reduced taxes to lessen  the  burden on the population. When studies were conducted at the  beginning, partners for development suggested a 35-percent price  increase for fuel. You are always complaining that decisions  made with the IMF, banks, and development partners take a long  time, so we are incompetent. We could have agreed to a  35-percent or even a 40-percent price increase. What would your  reaction have been if that had been the case? [passage omitted]    The customs duty in Cote d'Ivoire is very high. It was  increased as time went on to enable the state to earn revenue.  It developed into a prohibitive customs duty and encouraged  fraud. You are aware that for a few years now we have been  trying to reduce customs duties. This has cost us a lot of  money, but we are on the right track because the basic customs  duties have been brought down to acceptable levels of around 35  percent. [passage omitted]    [Lebry, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, I would like  to ask you questions which are political and economic at the  same time, since devaluation involves both aspects. The first  question is this: You mentioned that representatives of the  countries were truly unanimous in their decision during the  summit. However, certain people expressed anxiety here and  there, which seems to show that there was no true unanimity  after all. What assurances do heads of state and prime  ministers have that France will not abandon African countries?  What assurances have African countries obtained or what  promises have they received to confirm that this will not happen  because they run the risk of being left in the lurch by France?    The second question is: At the moment, France is continuing  to guarantee the CFA franc's convertibility. I would like you  to return to that issue. In the long run, in light of France's  wish to get a firm footing in Europe and in light of the  weakness of African economies, and especially with pressure from  Americans, a situation may arise in which France may pull away  from backing the CFA franc. How do leaders of African countries  intend to prepare African economies for such an eventuality?    [Duncan] As to whether the decision was unanimous, I can  confirm that it was indeed unanimous. I am not the one making  it up; you heard the communique. It was signed by all the heads  of state and prime ministers who were in Dakar. That is what I  am using as my reference. We insisted on everybody signing it.  I have signed copies of the communique, which are proof of the  fact that the decision was unanimous. France delivered a very  strong message at the summit, and I think everybody heard what  Minister Roussin said there as well as what he later said on  his return to France. The message was: It is not just the  presidency, it is not just the French Government, it is France  which is backing African countries of the franc zone in this  operation. It is not backing them just politically, it is  backing them economically and financially. The measures which  have been announced are along those lines. I have already  mentioned debt reduction, and I will give you the figures soon.  There will also be financial assistance for development. The  French fund has received instructions on that, and the Finance  Ministry has begun contacts to determine how France is going to  assist Cote d'Ivoire in carrying out investment.    This is not just empty talk; it is a political decision  which  has economic and financial repercussions. France has already  assisted certain countries whose situation was particularly  urgent with the payment of salaries. That decision was made  right away. This goes to show that France is truly committed to  assisting our countries. [passage omitted] Despite this  commitment, before anything else, we must be responsible. In  the first place, the future must depend on us and not on France.  We must know this. We must first help ourselves, and France  will help us later.    Concerning the issue of the guarantee for and the  convertibility of the CFA franc, I probably have to explain it  further for better understanding. At the time of independence,  the desire to create our national currencies was expressed in  our countries. Since self-determination is regarded as one of  the most significant signs of sovereignty, it was suggested that  it was necessary to create our own currency and manage it all  alone. The issue was raised at the level of the former French  West Africa and the former French Equatorial Africa. Here, the  states felt that it was better to remain in a monetary union.  This led to the creation of the monetary union for the West  African and the Central African zones. Together these states  created their currency, the CFA franc, the management of which  could have been made independently, because we were six or seven  countries that came together. This means not being connected to  any external currency. It is a political choice that we could  have made. [passage omitted]    Things went well from 1962 until 1980. [passage omitted]  The crisis began in 1980, and the accounts which had surpluses  began to diminish until they became negative. We had a surplus  of between 100 and 200 billion. We later came to a deficit of  10, 20, 30, 100, and even 200 billion CFA francs at a certain  time. The guarantee played a role in this case and the balance  became positive again -- even if not very significantly -- at  least by between 50 and 60 billion CFA francs in our zone. This  was not quite sufficient, because it was necessary to go beyond  the threshold of 20 percent. You see, assurance is a guarantee.  Nobody is obliged to take to it, but at that time, you would be  running a personal risk.    We feel that at any given time, one can successfully run  such  a risk when one's economy is well seated and diversified. This  is the future you are talking about.    For what reason should we be attached to the European  currency unit [ECU]? Look at the level of our trade with  Europe. According to the statistics, we have between 60 to 70  percent trade with EEC countries. Why should we want to get  attached to the ECU, which will be Europe's sole currency?  Simply because, if we do so, we will become attached to the  totality of the external partners. We can eventually do this  without even asking for a guarantee from France. France can  propose it, but what will this cost us? Will this help us?    Let us build the future for our children. Let us not make  then run useless risks by seeking to create another currency  apart from the CFA franc. We need to be prudent in politics.  We need to have guarantees and envisage all the possibilities.  We are not less free than those countries which have their own  currencies. We speak with the same voice in international  meetings and we are even better respected when we speak. Look  at the delegations which were coming to Cote d'Ivoire when the  late President Felix Houphouet-Boigny was receiving people here.  You will also see the number of heads of state and government  who will come here during his funeral. We need to avoid too  much susceptibility in politics. The economy must predominate.  [passage omitted]    [Roger Kouassi, FRATERNITE MATIN] Are we safe from further  devaluation? With the devaluation, has the specter of  retrenchment in the civil service been avoided forever? When  prices are not displayed, can we really prevent abusive price  increases?    [Duncan] You are right. It could happen that there is  further devaluation. Unfortunately, this is what happens to the  national currencies of most African countries. This happens  when the rates of devaluation do not correspond with the  imbalance. If we had set a rate of 25 percent, there probably  would have been another devaluation a year later.    This is what surprised everybody, especially traders, who  were expecting the devaluation but not at 50 percent. Provided  that we are able to adopt the measures that I have mentioned  concerning the control on the social demands (salaries) and  provided that that we are able to respect the price increases, I  am sure that we will succeed.    The total subsidy granted to help maintain prices at the  level they are now has reached 30 billion CFA francs. I say  that there will not be any subsequent devaluations. Concerning  retrenchment in the civil service, because of the devaluation,  there will not be any retrenchment. I only spoke about  voluntary retirement.    If some people want to go on voluntary retirement from the  civil service, we will help them do so by paying them 18 months'  salary at the time of their departure. This is better than what  has been achieved so far.    Concerning the listing of prices, the minister of commerce  and industry spoke on the subject in order to avoid panic. He  was to have hosted a news conference on 13 January, but I asked  him to wait for mine first. Beginning next week the various  ministers can hold theirs. I asked that the public  sector-private sector liaison group be activated so that these  issues could be discussed.    A commission will be set up on the issue of devaluation and  hold consultations that could lead to practical solutions.    It is also worth noting that some time ago a decision was  made on the liberalization of prices, except for the prices of a  certain number of regulated products. This explains that there  was no price control because an important section has been  liberalized in order to encourage competition. In the decisions  reached, the authorized products which will be subjected to  special control were indicated.    The practical measures will be announced when the meeting  takes place. Among other things, there will be measures  indicating to the consumer the places and the telephone numbers  where one can lodge complaints. These measures will be taken  beginning next week, because the consumer is the real  controller. We cannot put policemen in all the shops, but the  consumer who notices any irregularity will be able to contact  the ones who will be able to remedy the problem. [passage  omitted]    [Gustave Nguessan, REVEIL HEBDO] Couldn't the search for  competitiveness in Cote d'Ivoire because of the devaluation be  hindered by competitive devaluation that could be introduced by  neighboring Anglophone countries (Ghana and Nigeria)?    [Duncan] Due to the rate of devaluation, it is certain that  we will be more competitive than these countries. Could there  be a threat of a competitive devaluation? Let me remind you  that the change in parity is managed by an international  organization, namely the IMF, of which we are all members. The  change in parity obeys some precise rules. The countries to  which you refer are compelled to abide by these rules. The IMF  will always have its say, which will help prevent competitive  devaluations.    [Raymond Djadou, Bank Workers' Trade Union] I am Raymond  Djadou, secretary general of the Bank and Financial Institutions  Workers' Union of Cote d'Ivoire. Mr. Prime Minister, you  mentioned an increase in salary in the public sector. Is the  private sector concerned by this measure?    [Duncan] The workers' minimum salary and the agricultural  workers' minimum salary are a guideline, but it is also true  this is not the objective, because the private sector is  regulated by collective agreements. The case in point here is  that the state gives directives and will later initiate  discussions. On the other hand, the Employers' Association and  others expressed the wish to meet us, so decisions will be made.    [Patrice Douh, IVOIR'SOIR] I would like to ask a two-fold  question. On 19 and 20 April 1993, a seminar was held in  Abidjan on the harmonization of corporate law in franc zone  countries. While African states were studying reports that were  submitted to them, the decision to devaluate the CFA franc fell  on their heads like a sword. Won't this hasty decision to  devaluate the CFA franc be a source of blockage at the exchange  level between West African countries?    My second question is to know the level, in terms of  quantity, of the exchange volume in the West AFrican zone and in  which proportion, taking into account the devaluation, exports  will increase in this zone?    [Duncan] You just said that there was an April meeting in  Abidjan on corporate law and that there has been a certain lack  of preparedness in terms of devaluation that could jeopardize  cooperation. First, I would like to say that there was no lack  of preparedness. Just because governments did not talk about  the devaluation in the streets does not mean that they did not  study the question. I can assure you that no politician  announces devaluation beforehand. I do not know of a single one  who would do this. It is an operation that is carried out under  the cover of night and generally while markets are closed and on  weekends; then it is over. Therefore, there is no need to shout  that we are going to devaluate. This operation was well planned  and thoroughly examined before a decision was made. I will tell  you that this decision will strengthen cooperation within the  zone and the cooperation with France. All commitments made here  in Abidjan as related to the cooperation between African  countries will continue as far as rights are concerned at the  social security level and corporate law. You will see that all  these documents will be swiftly examined and signed in the  shortest possible time. [passage omitted]    [Goore-Bi-Hue, FRATERNITE MATIN] Mr. Prime Minister, you  stated that devaluation will make households consume  Ivorian-made goods. What measures will you take to ensure that  households effectively consume quality goods, to ensure, for  example, that locally manufactured rubber shoes last much longer  and that Ivorian-made cloth does not rip after washing for a  second or third time?    [Duncan] You are right in pointing this out. I think this  must be the concern of all Ivorian industrialists. They should  ensure that their goods are of good quality. The Ministry of  Industry and Commerce, in cooperation with the private sector,  has established the Ivorian Standards Board to ensure that goods  manufactured in Cote d'Ivoire meet Ivorian standards. We must  ensure that the goods leaving this country meet international  standards as far as quality is concerned. I think competition,  which is now more open, will make buyers reject goods that are  of low quality. As I told you, once this measure is taken, more  industrialists will come back to Cote d'Ivoire....    [Ballo Lancine, Radio Cote d'Ivoire] Mr. Prime Minister, you  spoke about 650 billion CFA francs that will be disbursed. Who  will disburse this amount --the IMF, the World Bank, France? Is  this another burden that is coming to put more weight upon the  external debt?    [Duncan] The 650 billion CFA francs will mainly come from  the IMF, of course. This money will come from major  contributors, from development partners, from Japan, and so on.  Some of them have already announced their commitment. You are  asking whether this is going to put more weight on the Ivorian  debt. Of course, these are elements of debts. What I can tell  you at this stage is that these elements are at very  consessional rates. As a result of this operation, Cote  d'Ivoire becomes an International Development Association member  country, that is, a country that can benefit from assistance at  concessional rates from the World Bank. Thus, we can now  receive more loans at extremely low rates like 0.5 percent  repayable over lengthy periods, say 40 years. That is it. We  will thus have the means for development.    As this is the last question, I would like to conclude this  news conference by saying that we have made difficult decisions.  This is a new start. This is a term used by a number of heads  of state who spoke at the Dakar meeting. The statement issued  by the president of the Republic pointed this out. Cote  d'Ivoire and all its components -- farmers, civil servants, the  business community, housewives -- must all feel involved in this  decision. They should not see only its negative aspects, but  rather the positive aspects that will enable Cote d'Ivoire to  get out of the present rut in the near future. In summation, we  are saying that Cote d'Ivoire must improve its competitiveness.  Public finances must be improved, giving more means to the  state. The possibility of developing businesses in Cote  d'Ivoire must be improved, both at the level of national  businessmen as well as foreign businessmen. The return of  private capital that might have been placed abroad, if such does  exist, will be made easier. It is essential that Cote d'Ivoire  play its important card. We have some assets and we must  ensure that they are well exploited. I have been asked in  particular to tell you that the government and the president of  the Republic are confident in the future, and that the president  of the Republic and the government will work tirelessly so that  we regain our growth rate within a reasonable period. This  growth rate must reach and later exceed the 3.5 percent  population growth rate. We must reach a 5.6 percent growth rate  every month. We can achieve that within the coming two or three  years. This is a message of hope. I think that Cote d'Ivoire  has the human and material potential to attain this goal. Thank  you.</p>

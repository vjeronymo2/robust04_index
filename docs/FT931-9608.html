			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Union Discount in talks on its future ownership UNION DISCOUNT, the discount house group which was the subject of a bid approach late last year, is now discussing a merger with another specialist operator in the short-term money market, it emerged yesterday. Union, under chief executive Mr George Blunden, has been fighting to rebuild its core money market businesses since a disastrous diversification into leasing and property lending in the 1980s. The group's share price slipped from a high of 500p in 1990 to only a tenth of that value before the bid approach, and yesterday remained steady at 100p. In a statement after the market closed, Union said that talks about its future ownership were continuing, but that they 'may be resolved by a number of possible structures.' These include a takeover, a merger with another company or an offer for the other company. The announcement is thought to indicate that Union is in merger talks with another specialist money market group, although a bid is still possible. Directors of Cater Allen, the money broker which owns 3 per cent of Union and whose name has been most often mentioned as the potential bidder, could not be contacted for comment yesterday evening.</p>

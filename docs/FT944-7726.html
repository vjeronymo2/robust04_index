			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Film sales surge helps Disney to record term The success of Walt Disney's animated features, especially The Lion King, more than offset a downturn in its theme parks to produce record earnings of Dollars 226m in the fourth quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 78m last time. Group operating profits, before losses at Euro Disney, the theme park near Paris, were up 23 per cent at Dollars 439m. For the first time in more than a decade, films made more profit in the full year than theme parks (excluding Euro Disney), at Dollars 856m compared with Dollars 684m. In the final quarter, operating income from films almost doubled to Dollars 189m, on sales up 43 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn. Operating profits from theme parks (excluding Euro Disney) were down 18 per cent for the quarter at Dollars 155m on sales 2 per cent higher. International tourist traffic was lower, the company said, and costs had been written off for the proposed Civil War theme park in Virginia, which Disney abandoned in the face of widespread opposition. Profits from the consumer division, covering the merchandise of characters and books from the films, were up 33 per cent at Dollars 95m on sales up 36 per cent at Dollars 490m. This was also due chiefly to the success of The Lion King, Disney said. The share of losses in Euro Disney fell to Dollars 58m, compared with Dollars 415m for the quarter and Dollars 110m, down from Dollars 515m, for the year. Earnings per share for the quarter were 42 cents against a loss of 15 cents, and for the full year, Dollars 2.04 compared with 55 cents. Full-year net income was Dollars 1.11bn, up from Dollars 300m. Disney spent Dollars 920m on repurchasing 23m of its shares since May, with Dollars 512m of that coming in the final quarter. The board has authorised the repurchase of a further 90m shares, on top of the 14m still authorised under the existing programme. At yesterday's closing share price of Dollars 43, this would cost the company about Dollars 4.4bn.</p>

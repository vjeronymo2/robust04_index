"It is a time to mend divisions  and heal wounds, and reach out to fellow Canadians."  </P> <P> But in a speech of his own in Quebec, Francophone Premier Robert Bourassa  talked about the end of his involvement in broad-based federal negotiations and  about the need to draw up a new, as yet undefined, political program.  </P> <P> Mulroney directed one part of his address to Canada's "friends and partners  abroad," urging them to keep the weekend's dramatic events in perspective.  </P> <P> "Canadians have always overcome challenges to our unity, and we shall do so  again," he said. "It would be unwise for anyone to underestimate this  industrious and resource-rich nation of hard-working and productive people."  </P> <P> Mulroney's words were clearly meant to calm international markets, which had  already closed for the weekend when it became clear late Friday that Canada  would now be entering a period of constitutional impasse and political  uncertainty. For months, Mulroney himself has been warning that if the  constitutional amendments were not ratified, the Canadian dollar might fall,  and foreign investors might think twice about putting their money into this  country.  </P> <P> Since Friday evening, leading politicians from Canada's two main opposition  parties have been calling for Mulroney to resign in the wake of the failed  amendments. Debate over them has polarized public opinion and awakened  separatist feelings in Quebec.  </P> <P> "I believe if a new process (of constitution-making) is to have any chance for  success, the prime minister must step aside in the national interest," said  Audrey McLaughlin, leader of the social-democratic New Democratic Party, the  third-largest political grouping in Canada. "I say he must resign."  </P> <P> But in his speech, Mulroney said he has no intention of leaving office.  </P> <P> "There is no dishonor in having tried to overcome a serious threat to our  unity," he said. "I would rather have failed trying to advance the cause of  Canada's unity than to have simply played it safe, done nothing, or criticized  from the sidelines. . . . This is not a government of quitters. We will all be  back at work next week."  </P> <P> There are likely to be more calls for Mulroney to resign in the coming weeks or  months. Whether he can withstand them will depend in large measure on whether  he can keep control of his Progressive Conservative Party caucus. Until now,  the caucus has shown him staunch loyalty even as he plunged in public opinion  polls -- but it includes numerous Quebecers, and they may now be tempted to  abandon the prime minister and go back home to work toward sovereignty. Six  members of Mulroney's caucus have either left or been kicked out in recent  months, and it will be up to Mulroney now to keep that number from growing.  </P> <P> The constitutional package at the heart of this weekend's events, called the  Meech Lake Accord, had been intended to woo the province of Quebec into signing  the national constitution, which it has been refusing to do for years. The  accord would have given extra powers to all 10 Canadian provinces -- and  thereby to Quebec -- and would have officially recognized Quebec as a "distinct  society" within Canada.  </P> <P> The accord ruffled few feathers when it was drafted in 1987, but as the months  went by before it could be ratified by all 10 provinces, it became intensely  controversial. The "distinct society" clause was the most disputed element of  all, with the English-speaking provinces of Manitoba and Newfoundland, in  particular, arguing that it would be dangerous to give special constitutional  privileges to Quebec.  </P> <P> It was the legislatures of those two provinces that killed the accord Friday,  by adjourning without voting to ratify it. By law, all 10 provinces had to have  approved the accord by Saturday for it to have become law.  </P> <P> But while English Canadians were fuming that the Meech Lake Accord was giving  too much to Quebec, Francophones in Quebec began to think that for them, the  accord was too little, too late. Since it collapsed Friday, there has been a  mood of happy anticipation here in Quebec, with many Francophones hoping that  the latest turn of events will open a new phase in their relationship with  English Canada.  </P> <P> Just hours after Mulroney made his remarks, Bourassa addressed his provincial  legislature in Quebec, holding court in a special chamber reserved for  important speeches and ceremonies.  </P> <P> Observers waited keenly for clues to what will happen next in Quebec, but  Bourassa spoke in very general and relatively moderate terms, leaving  practically all options open except for one: signing the national constitution.  </P> <P> "The process of constitutional reform in Canada has been discredited," Bourassa  said, vowing that his government would not enter any future talks on the  subject, however badly other provinces might want them. "How can you expect me  to return to the constitutional table?" the premier asked.  </P> <P> As for the unanswered question about whether Quebec would begin some sort of  process of separation from English Canada now, Bourassa merely said that he  wants to consult with party activists and others, and to develop plans.  </P> <P> "Quebec has the freedom of its choices, and it's going to make its choices in  realism and calm," he said.  </P> <P> "I can assure you that my only goal will be the superior interests of the  Quebec people."  </P> <P> While Bourassa was speaking in Quebec, Canada's main opposition party, the  Liberals, were selecting their party leader, the man who will run for  Mulroney's seat the next time an election is called. Significantly, the  Liberals elected Jean Chretien, a Francophone Quebecer who opposed the Meech  Lake Accord and is viewed with contempt in his home province.  </P> <P> Chretien's selection adds even more texture to the complicated political fabric  now being woven in Canada. When a national election is called, as one must be  sometime before 1993, it is hard to imagine Chretien carrying the province of  Quebec. And, however unpopular Mulroney and his Conservatives may be, it is  hard to imagine any Liberal beating them without carrying Quebec, which has  about a quarter of the Canadian population and tends to vote as a bloc.  </P> <P> In addition, Chretien's presence now, as the main alternative to Mulroney in  Ottawa, may persuade Quebec Conservatives to stick with the embattled prime  minister in the coming months, rather than jumping ship and heading for Quebec.  </P></p>

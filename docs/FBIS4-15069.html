			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimonda Rameliene: "The Vilnius Echo of the </F> Meeting"]    [Excerpts] At yesterday's press conference, President A.  Brazauskas briefly surveyed the results of the summit meeting of  the three Baltic presidents in Palanga and replied to  journalists' questions.    Asked why the Palanga meeting did not set up the Council of  the Baltic Presidents, A. Brazauskas replied: "Presidents'  meetings and contacts should not be squeezed into a fixed and  regulated framework." The experience of the Nordic countries  also confirms this. Therefore, all the three presidents came to  the conclusion that it was inexpedient to establish such an  institution.    The free trade agreement among Latvia, Estonia, and  Lithuania  comes into effect as of 1 April. Did not the meeting discuss  other inter-state agreements and the possibility of creating a  Baltic bloc? According to A. Brazauskas, there was no mention  of any blocs. [passage omitted]    As usual, journalists wanted to hear the president's opinion  on some pressing domestic policy issues.    Asked whether he, as the chief commander of armed forces,  has  sanctioned the searches in the national defense system, A.  Brazauskas replied: "I as the commander-in-chief of the armed  forces deal with the latter rather than with matters of criminal  persecution or searches." The state has institutions that must  perform this work, although it is sometimes very unpleasant and  difficult.    The searches were approved by the Prosecutor General's  Office, and the prosecutor general is responsible for this move.  "Certainly, it is unpleasant when politics is confused with  crime," said the president. Normal persecution should be  conducted in line with the Penal Code, while no one should look  for sanctions where they should not be. At the same time, the  president expressed his discontent with the fact that  "television and other mass media want to adopt the role of the  prosecutor's office. According to the speaker, "no case can be  resolved on the television screen." Such attempts only arouse  unnecessary human emotions, "many hints, illusions, reflections,  rumors, and so on."    In the president's opinion, such political moves are "too  conceited and picturesque, but with no content." It is the  latter that law enforcement institutions must find and assess  calmly, with skill and responsibility, and without turning it  into a show.    A. Brazauskas called the statement by the association  "Selma," which threatens to suspend the construction of housing  for the Russian military in Kaliningrad and demands the release  of association President V. Laurinavicius, a political challenge  and a shot into the air. "They have an agreement and must  execute it. Judicial institutions will establish whether their  president is guilty or not," said the state leader.    Commenting on the conservatives' statement concerning the  construction of the oil terminal, the president did not want to  agree that it was delayed. The key decisions have already been  adopted, and the government should announce the winner of the  competition shortly. The issue of financing is urgent. The  business plan should be ready by late March, which "will be a  good basis for talks with large financial organizations and  foreign banks that would undertake to subsidize this endeavor."    Asked about the law on land recently adopted by the Seimas  [parliament], A. Brazauskas said that he had received it only  that Monday [28 March]. Thus, "the clock has begun counting 10  days and nights" since yesterday, within which time the  president must study and discuss the law. The president said  that he knew the emotional and even unhealthy reaction that the  adoption of the document had caused in the Seimas. Before  signing (or rejecting) the law, the president promised to study  it thoroughly along with specialists.</p>

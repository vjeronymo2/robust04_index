			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (7): The FT reader - Economic History THE FINANCIAL TIMES GUIDE TO USING THE FINANCIAL PAGES Romesh Vaitilingam with additional material by Emma Tucker Financial Times/Pitman Pounds 12.95/Pounds 30 216 pages EVERY DAY, a torrent of financial statistics floods across the pink pages of the Financial Times. This guide contains an example of every regular table the paper publishes, with a clear summary of each table's purpose and sources. The book provides more than this background information on each table, however. It also contains a succinct guide to the way the data captured in the tables reflects the wider forces shaping the activities of economies and markets. Romesh Vaitilingam, a freelance writer, has managed to steer clear of financial markets jargon whilst also achieving accuracy and conciseness. Additional material is provided by Emma Tucker, an economics reporter at the FT. Their approach ensures the book's permanence. Even though the format of individual FT tables changes from time to time, the definitions and insight the book provides will remain of lasting value to readers.</p>

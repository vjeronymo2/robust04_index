			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Lobbying taken seriously Sir, Kevin Brown made a number of valuable points about lobbying the Labour party ('A word in Tony's ear', November 18). He is wrong, though, to suggest that Labour does not take lobbying companies seriously. We in the profession were pleased that Labour's head office organised two briefings for lobbyists, before and after this year's party conference. We had a fruitful dialogue about what our clients expected from and got out of the conference, and how they should be approaching the Labour party on policy matters in future. Clients do not always know where they should go to get their message across. Charles Clarke, a political insider, should be aware just how closed and forbidding the world of politics looks to people who are very good at running their own companies and organisations but don't know an early day motion from an oral question. Labour seems to appreciate that lobbyists help companies to sharpen their case and target it correctly. We help both clients and political parties to avoid a great deal of wasted time and effort.

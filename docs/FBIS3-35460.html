Your excellency, I would like to express my deep regret and  sorrow at the incident which occurred on 23 February in your  country's embassy -- most probably at the instigation of  self-seeking elements who seek to make fraternal and friendly  relations between the two neighboring and Muslim countries  tense. Your excellency, religious and cultural ties, and  material and moral support of the nation and government of  Pakistan on the uprising of the people of Afghanistan against  foreign aggression and the granting of asylum to millions of  Afghan refugees have so deepened and expanded our relations that  the occurrence of incidents such as the aforementioned cannot  damage our countries' religious and good neighborly relations.  I take the opportunity to wish from the compassionate God your  excellency's health, long life, success, and prosperity for the  people of Pakistan.    [Signed] Professor Borhanoddin Rabbani, President of the  Islamic State of Afghanistan.</p>

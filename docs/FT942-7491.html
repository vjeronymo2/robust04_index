			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Enlarged Casket rises to Pounds 3.6m Strong demand from abroad helped Casket, Britain's second-largest bicycle manufacturer, boost annual pre-tax profits by 27 per cent to Pounds 3.6m. The company, which claims 25 per cent of the UK market, increased exports by 26 per cent. Profits for the year to end-March were also helped by the Pounds 1.3m acquisition of a German bicycle company in November, which contributed Pounds 395,000 at the pre-tax level. Sales were 8 per cent higher at Pounds 103.8m. Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the underlying bicycle business had shown like-for-like growth of 18.5 per cent in the year. Demand for Casket's range of brands had been particularly strong in Germany, France and Ireland, he said. The results included the final costs of a long-running legal action over accounting practices at Kingsley &amp; Forester, a clothing company merged with Casket in 1988. The group incurred net exceptional costs of Pounds 453,000, bringing the total costs of the six-year suit to about Pounds 650,000. The final dividend is increased to 0.7p making a 1.1p (0.8p) total. Earnings rose by 26 per cent to 3.19p.</p>

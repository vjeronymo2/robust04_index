			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (31): Group F - Belgium Belgium were the big winners at Las Vegas. The draw put them in the weakest group and paired them with their glamorous local rivals. The spotlight will be on the Dutch stars but Belgium have done better in recent World Cups. Belgium reached the quarter-finals in '82 and the semi-finals in '86. In Italy, Belgium outplayed England in the second round before losing to David Platt's late goal; the Dutch, meanwhile, were soundly beaten by the Germans. Vincenzo Scifo (Monaco) will anchor the team. Scifo could have played for Italy. Belgium's attack may consist of Luis Oliveira (Cagliari), a naturalised Brazilian, and Josip Weber (Cercle Bruges), a naturalised Croat. They may bring a vital dash of flair to a team which traditionally combines resolute defence with methodical attack.</p>

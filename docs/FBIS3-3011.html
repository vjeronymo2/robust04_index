			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing and Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Beijing has boosted its defence budget by 20 per  cent in an apparent bid to expedite modernisation of weaponry.    While addressing the National People's Congress (NPC)  yesterday, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said the State Council  had earmarked 52.04 billion yuan (HK$46.2 billion) for national  defence for 1994. The percentage increase this year was the  highest since 1979, when patriarch Deng Xiaoping launched his  economic reforms, one of whose tenets was to curtail military  spending and devote more resources to the economy.    China's military outlay takes up 9.59 per cent of its total  governmental expenditure, as compared with 23 per cent for  Taiwan, 24.3 per cent for South Korea and 17.6 per cent for the  United States. A total of 43.25 billion yuan was spent on the  People's Liberation Army (PLA) last year, slightly more than the  original target. About 42.5 billion yuan had been set aside for  national defence in last year's budget, which represented an  increase of 14.8 per cent over the 1992 figure.    "This year's national defence expenditures have been  appropriately increased because of price rises, army wage reform  and higher living expenses," Mr. Liu told the 2,800-odd  legislators at the Great Hall of the People. The big increase  was made in spite of Mr. Liu's insistence that the overall  financial situation of the country was "grim" and that the  criterion for drafting his budget was "tightening control over  expenditures".    The 20.32 per cent surge for the PLA is also bigger than the  18.5 per cent boost for education, a "national priority area"  cited by premier Li Peng on Thursday.    In addition to the defence budget, Beijing has also  allocated  61.36 billion yuan for"administrative expenses for building  state power", which analysts said included police expenditures.  The 1994 figure is 13.57 per cent more than that of 1993.    Chinese sources said the State Council had succumbed to  aggressive lobbying by the top brass, who complained about  antiquated equipment and falling standards of living in the face  of inflation. Vice-Chief of Staff of the PLA, General Xu  Huizhi, said yesterday the new allocation was suited to the  "practical situation" of the country. General Xu claimed that,  as was true of last year's allocations, only a small part of the  budget would be used to purchase weapons.    General Ding Henggao, Minister of the Commission of Science,  Technology and Industry for National Defence, added the budget  bonanza was "mainly to help improve the quality of life of the  troops".    Xinhua (the New China News Agency) last night quoted the  Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission, Liu Huaqing,  as saying "our endeavours to modernise national defence serves  solely to defend ourselves". General Liu asserted that "China's  annual military expenditure is very small in the world", and  that the PLA's major role was to provide a "powerful security  guarantee" for the reform and open-door policy.    An NPC delegate representing the PLA, however, complained  yesterday that the 20 per cent rise was too small. Sources  close to the PLA said the actual expenditure by the army was  more than double the publicised sum allocated to it by central  Government.    "Much of the funds for military research and development,  retirement expenses, and those incurred in conscription and in  helping demobilised soldiers and jobs in the civilian sectors  are covered by 'hidden budgets' absorbed by other government  units," an informed source said. "A sizeable portion of the  funds, including foreign currency used by the PLA to import  weapons, comes from the profits made by the mushrooming PLA  business empire, which is sometimes a law unto itself."    Asian military analysts said yesterday the increase in the  budget was in line with the PLA's avowed goal of acquiring  weapons and technology that were commensurate in sophistication  with the country's fast-growing economic and geo-political  clout. They said a focal point of the PLA's armament  modernisation drive in the mid-1990s was the navy, which was  essential for China's "power projection" in the Asia-Pacific  region.    "The PLA is pumping funds and resources into developing  nuclear-powered submarines as well as medium-range missiles that  could be launched by them," a military source said. The source  added that priority was set after the top brass decided late  last year to scrap the plan for building aircraft carriers.    "China's five existing nuclear submarines are old Soviet  models that are terribly antiquated," the source said. "The PLA  is testing a submarine-launched missile that has a range of  around 400 kilometres."    Western military analysts said the PLA's Second Artillery  Unit was aggressively developing medium to long-range ballistic  missiles, including the Dong Fang 25 and the Dong Fang 31  models, which had ranges of respectively 1,700 km and 8,000 km.    At the same time, emphasis is being put on churning out a  new  generation of solid-fuel Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles.    The analysts said the PLA had to spend more money developing  its own weapons systems partly due to the stalemate in efforts  to procure Russian military technology. They added discussions  on buying another batch of SU27 jet fighters from Moscow -- as  well as a co-production agreement to turn out MiG aircraft on  Chinese soil -- had bogged down because of Russian reluctance to  part with top- of-the-line know-how.    However, with the revival of military co-operation with  Europe and even the United States, the top brass is again  hopeful of acquiring sophisticated hardware from the Western  world. "In view of the recent 30 odd per cent devaluation of  the yuan, the 52.04 billion yuan budget is not much to play  around with," a Beijing diplomat said.</p>

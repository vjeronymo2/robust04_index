			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Hekmatyar tries to break Afghan deadlock with new cabinet Afghan prime minister-designate Gulbuddin Hekmatyar said yesterday he had drawn up a new cabinet list to try to break a deadlock before more fighting erupts, Reuter reports from Charasyab, Afghanistan. His arch-rival President Burhanuddin Rabbani countered with proposals agreed after consultations among four other main guerrilla parties. A five-week-old peace accord among the fractious guerrilla groups has become bogged down amid disagreement between Mr Hekmatyar and Mr Rabbani over allocation of ministries. Mr Hekmatyar appeared to rule out any discussion with Mr Rabbani, accusing the government of preparing for more fighting. Under the March 7 Pakistani-brokered peace accord signed by the Mujahideen leaders in Islamabad, Mr Hekmatyar was to finalise the cabinet in consultation with the president in two weeks. Mr Hekmatyar hinted that his main compromise was over Mr Rabbani's powerful defence minister, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, who has held the job since the guerrillas took power from the former communist government last April. Mr Hekmatyar had vowed to sack him. In the new cabinet list, Mr Masood is to be one of three deputy prime ministers and is to head the foreign ministry, which will be run by a council of all the nine main parties.</p>

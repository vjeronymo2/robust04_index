Section 161 of the law amended section 493 of the Public Health Service Act, 42 U.S.C. section 289B, in several respects. Specifically, section 493, as amended, requires that the ORI be an independent entity in DHHS and that the Director, ORI, report to the Secretary. This revision accomplishes the statutory mandate while leaving ORI organizationally within the OASH for budget and general administrative purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice does not affect the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to conduct investigations of alleged misconduct solely involving regulated research. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under chapter HA, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, section HA&hyph;20,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Functions,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> delete in its entirety the titles and statements for the Office of Research Integrity (HAG), the Division of Policy and Education (HAG2), and the Division of Research Investigations (HAG3), and add the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Office of Research Integrity (HAG) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Director reports to the Secretary and will: (1) Oversee and direct PHS research integrity activities on behalf of the Secretary with the exception of the regulatory research integrity activities of the Food and Drug Administration;

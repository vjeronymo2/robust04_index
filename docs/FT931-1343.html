			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Mothballing six pits may cost up to Pounds 24m a year BRITISH Coal may have to spend up to Pounds 24m a year to keep open mines it does not want if expected recommendations for mothballing pits are included in today's white paper. It costs between Pounds 2m and Pounds 4m a year to mothball a pit. Ministers are expected to recommend that up to six pits which would otherwise close be kept in a condition that would allow them to reopen. British Coal is also likely to have to maintain the 10 pits it wants to close immediately in operational condition for several months. This would cost about Pounds 13m a month in total. Unless the government agreed to pay both the mothballing and maintenance costs, the corporation would have to foot the bill. The National Union of Mineworkers is expected to oppose the white paper with a campaign of industrial action. Its members are due to strike for 24 hours on April 2 in protest at threatened compulsory redundancies. Other mining unions are unlikely to support the white paper if it involves only a maximum two-year reprieve for 13 of the 31 threatened pits with the rest closing at once. But the Union of Democratic Mineworkers is opposed to industrial action. The Trades Union Congress said it intended to hold an emergency meeting of its energy committee tomorrow if the white paper fails to save all the pits.</p>

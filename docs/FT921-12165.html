			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Observer: Gift of tongue As next boss of the UK arm of Unilever, Michael Perry has an important advantage over fellow-Brits who've held the job before. He speaks Dutch, and so can converse with his counterparts at Unilever NV in their own language. Having joined Lever Brothers as a management trainee 35 years ago, Perry spent his early years as a brand manager in Holland and two thirds of his career has been overseas. But by the time he became president of Unilever (Japan) his interest in extending his linguist skills had subsided. Although Perry cannot be regarded as a mere caretaker chairman of the group's British undertakings, he is less than four years younger than Sir Michael Angus, who steps down as chairman in May. With Morris Tabaksblat's name pencilled in as the eventual successor to Floris Maljers, chairman of Unilever NV, 46- year-old Niall FitzGerald seems to be the frontrunner to succeed Perry. If he did, he would have more time to impose his mark on the business. Not that Angus shows signs of wanting to cut his workload as he nears retirement. He is increasingly involved in sorting out the problems of National Westminster Bank, and over the next few months will take on the chairmanship of Whitbread and the presidency of the Confederation of British Industry. If British Airways ever sealed the knot with KLM he would make an ideal chairman of the mega-carrier. But does he have time to take on yet another big job?</p>

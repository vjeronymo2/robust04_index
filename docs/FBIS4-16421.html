			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Shulman] </F>   [Text] Baku April 15 TASS -- The Russian plan to settle the  Karabakh armed conflict and eliminate the conflict aftermath  that has been passed over to the Armenian and Azeri leadership  includes many settlement variants. Their implementation may  result in peace in case of the sides' agreement, Russian  ambassador at large and head of the Russian mediating mission  Vladimir Kazimirov told ITAR-TASS here today.    In his words, the Russian initiatives aim to terminate  combat  operations in the Armenian-Azeri conflict zone, liberate the  occupied lands and return refugees to places of their permanent  residence.    As for the plan details, Russia offers to separate the  warring sides within three days after cease-fire. In the  opinion of Kazimirov, it will take another three days to create  a buffer or control zone to house international observers. He  is sure these conditions will enable the liberation of occupied  Azeri territories and solution of other problems related to the  conflict.    A wise decision must be taken in order to save human lives,  stop the bloodshed and war in the region, said the ambassador.  Today's statement on settlement of the Karabakh conflict  adopted at the Commonwealth summit has the same aims, said the  diplomat.    He stressed the statement is a reaction of the Commonwealth  state heads to the repeated appeals of Azeri President Geydar  Aliyev, who thinks it is unnatural that "two Commonwealth states  are at war".    Kazimirov said further war in the region is unpromising, it  may aggravate the tragedy of the Armenian and Azeri peoples.</p>

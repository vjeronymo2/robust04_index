			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Observer: Dogged from the outset If the eyes of the Dulux Dog, the famous mascot of ICI paints, were going to go on the blink, it is hard to imagine a worse time. Just as the newly slimmed down ICI is trying to prove that it is a fit and healthy corporate animal, it has had to issue a nationwide recall of its 30,000 offspring before their eyes pop out. Admittedly, the one-foot-high Dulux Dogs in question are only cuddly toys which were sold to raise money for charity and, understandably, ICI is worried that children might swallow any offending eyes which fall out. Even so, the symbolism of the recall has knocked a bit of the gloss off the new-look ICI. After all, chairman Sir Denys Henderson has starred in ICI adverts alongside the real Dulux dog, and chief executive Ronnie Hampel keeps a life-size imitation in his office. It sounds as if the cost of renewing the eyes of the poor dumb mutts will probably exceed the sums raised for charity.</p>

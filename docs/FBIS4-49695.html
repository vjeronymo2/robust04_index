			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 9 (CNS) -- The trend for the exchange  rate of the renminbi [RMB] is one of the Mainland's main  concerns. Deputy Director of the State Administration of Foreign  Exchange Control Mr. Xu Bin said that there had been no dramatic  fluctuation of the exchange rate of the renminbi since the  second half of last year and he is optimistic about the  maintenance of relative stability of the currency because the  overall economy has since the beginning of this year proceeded  at a well-coordinated pace.    The exchange rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar  has remained at RMB 870 against U.S.$ 100 during the period  between early this year up until now, Mr. Xu said. The renminbi  showed a slight gain against the U.S. dollar in recent times,  representing success in the restructuring of the foreign  exchange system and unification of the exchange rate of the  renminbi. Mr. Xu said he was convinced that the present  exchange rate for the renminbi was reasonable, reflecting the  level of cost and profit resulting from exports as well as  endurance capability for imports. The rate also showed supply  and demand for foreign exchange resulting from the flow of  capital.    Mr. Xu said that the exchange rate of one U.S. dollar  against  8.7 yuan was based on the market regulation and the foreign  exchange control administration played no part in the  maintenance of the exchange rate nor did other departments play  a dominant role in maintaining the exchange rate. He was  convinced that the current rate showed the real market supply  and demand and considered it the true market exchange rate.    The so-called floating exchange rate system under  administration set out in a statement issued by the People's  Bank of China, according to Mr. Xu, mainly put the emphasis on  the formulation of a programme for the foreign exchange market  and on the ensuring of orderly operation of the market. It will  in no way disrupt trading in the foreign exchange market. China  will employ economic means in accordance with law to govern the  foreign exchange market.    It is a must, Mr. Xu said, for enterprises to have analysis  and projection on the trend of the exchange rate. The rate  itself is not an independent factor showing the overall level  and demand for the economy but it is closely related to  macroeconomic and monetary policy. The exchange rate which has  remained at the current level for a relative long period  indicated that it was acceptable to the market. The main policy  on the exchange rate of the renminbi, Mr. Xu said, was to  maintain relative stability of the rate of the currency.</p>

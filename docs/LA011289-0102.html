			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH GROUND 737S TO CHECK WARNING SYSTEMS;  </P> <P> MOVE TERMED 'PRECAUTIONARY'; POSSIBILITY OF INSTRUMENT FAILURE SUGGESTED  </P> <P> The Civil Aviation Authority, in what it described Wednesday as a  "precautionary" move, ordered British airlines to ground all their late-model  Boeing 737 aircraft pending an inspection of their engine fire-warning systems.  </P> <P> It was the first suggestion that some sort of instrument failure may have  contributed to last Sunday's crash of British Midland Airways Flight 092.  Forty-four passengers died and 82 other passengers and crew were injured as  their crippled aircraft undershot the runway at a central England airport  during an emergency landing attempt.  </P> <P> The agency said it is also "urgently" preparing detailed instructions for more  frequent mandatory engine inspections on the newer Boeing 737s, as well as  European-built Airbus A-320s, which use the same power plant but have different  warning systems. Initial checks will have to be performed on those airplanes  within 24 hours of the new instruction being issued, according to the agency.  </P> <P> The agency said it was acting upon recommendation of investigators probing the  British Midland crash, which involved a 12-week-old Boeing 737-400 series  twin-engine jet. And while the Transport Ministry stressed in a separate  statement Wednesday that "much work remains to be done" to pin down the exact  cause of the disaster, the order served to shift speculation back toward  technical malfunction after speculation the day before that pilot error might  have been involved.  </P> <P> While the order immediately affects only 37 aircraft here, it has implications  for several times that many planes, many of them in service with American  carriers.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the International Air Transport Assn. said in a telephone  interview from Geneva on Wednesday that more than 250 aircraft have been  equipped with the late model CFM-56 engines that are subject of the CAA order.  That order, he added, puts "fairly compelling pressure on other governments to  take similar steps," if only because of the potential liability if there were  now a similar accident involving the targeted planes.  </P> <P> Alerted to developments by the British, the U.S. Federal Aviation  Administration ordered similar warning-system inspections of 300 late model  737s flown by American carriers, wires  </P> <P> </P> <P> Starboard Engine Cut  </P> <P> According to the official account of the England crash so far, Flight 092 pilot  Kevin Hunt reported shortly after taking off from London's Heathrow Airport for  Belfast, Northern Ireland, on Sunday evening that he had shut down his  starboard (right) engine because of a fire. He was diverted to the East  Midlands airfield, Britain's 11th largest, about 110 miles northwest of here.  </P> <P> As he neared East Midlands, witnesses reported that his port (left) engine was  in flames, and the aircraft slammed into an embankment alongside England's  busiest highway, the M-1, breaking into three pieces. It was about 500 yards  from the end of the runway.  </P> <P> "Evidence obtained early in the investigation indicated that both the No. 1  (port) and No. 2 (starboard) engines might have suffered a related failure,"  according to a Transport Ministry statement Wednesday. While physical evidence  as well as information from the plane's flight data and cockpit voice recorders  confirmed in-flight failure and fire of the port engine, investigators have so  far found no evidence of fire or other malfunction in the starboard engine.  </P> <P> The ministry stressed that "a great deal of significant evidence relating to  this (starboard) engine has yet to be obtained." However, its findings had  fueled widespread speculation here that Hunt might have mistakenly shut down  his "good" (starboard) engine instead of an already crippled port engine.  </P> <P> "Pilot Shut Off the Wrong Engine," asserted the main headline in the tabloid  Sun newspaper Wednesday. "Fatal Error," proclaimed the Daily Star.  </P> <P> While pilot error may still prove to be a factor, however, the aviation  authority's announcement made it clear that such judgments are at least  premature.  </P> <P> The airplane's engine monitoring system includes separate heat and vibration  sensors in the left and right engines, and separate alarms in the cabin to warn  of a problem, according to aircraft experts here. At one point, however, the  left and right systems pass through a common circuit.  </P> <P> What the agency's directive means, these experts said, is that it is now  thought possible that because of some technical fault, the warning system in  Flight 092's cabin may have indicated fire in the right engine when it was  actually the left that was malfunctioning. That could have misled Hunt into  shutting down the wrong engine, according to this theory.  </P> <P> From the cockpit, it is impossible to see either engine on a Boeing 737, the  experts noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Source Found  </P> <P> "They have pinpointed a possible source of the problems the captain  experienced," commented Freddy Yetman, technical secretary of Britain's Air  Pilots Assn. He added that the association had "protested strongly" over  earlier suggestions of pilot error because they were "without a shred of  evidence."  </P> <P> Yetman conceded that it also "seems unimaginable" that the ultra-sensitive  engine fire warning system could have failed.  </P> <P> Workmen removed both engines as well as the wreckage of the fuselage from the  M-1 embankment Wednesday, shifting it onto the road itself until it can be  hauled away for further inspection.  </P> <P> The engines will be taken to the facilities outside Paris of SNECMA, the French  manufacturer which, in partnership with America's General Electric, makes the  CFM. There, the power plants are to be stripped down to find out what went  wrong.  </P> <P> Transport Ministry officials here said it is still possible that closer  analysis will reveal a malfunction of the starboard engine that was not  apparent from the on-site inspection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hunt Questioned  </P> <P> Also as part of their continuing probe, officials of the Air Accident  Investigations Board questioned Hunt in the hospital Wednesday. He is at least  temporarily paralyzed with injuries.  </P> <P> A spokesman at the Leicester Royal Infirmary, where he is being treated, said  Hunt was "anxious" before the meeting but relieved afterward.  </P> <P> Michael Pepperman, the doctor in charge of the intensive care unit, said that  while hospital staff had kept from Hunt some of the harshest press accounts so  as not to undermine his medical recovery, "we have made him aware of the  comments that have been raised, and he hasn't passed any comment."  </P> <P> Following the Air Accident Board's recommendations, the Civil Aviation  Authority said British airlines flying Boeing 737-300 and 737-400 series  aircraft "are being required to carry out checks of the fire, overheat, and  vibration monitoring systems on their aircraft." While the ill-fated British  Midlands plane was a 737-400, it is basically a stretched version of the  737-300. It uses virtually the identical CFM-56 engines.  </P> <P> Earlier versions of the 737 carry a different engine.There are also earlier  versions of the CFM-56 engines that are not affected by the agency's order.  </P> <P> After Sunday's crash, there are three Boeing 737-400s on the British registry  of commercial aircraft, and all were immediately grounded voluntarily by their  operators. The new engine warning system checks "are required to be  satisfactorily completed before further flight," the CAA said.  </P> <P> Checks on Series 300 Boeing 737s "must be carried out before the first flight  after midnight tonight," Wednesday's order said. There are 30 Series 300  aircraft in use here, operated by nine different airlines. The carriers said  they hope to carry out the checks without disrupting their schedules.  </P></p>

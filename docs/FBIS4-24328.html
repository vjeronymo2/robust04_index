			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 27 Jun (PANA) -- A meeting between the  Malian Government and representatives of the Tuareg rebels  opened this morning at Tamanrasset (far south in Algeria), it  was announced from official sources in Bamako.    This meeting, which is taking place under the mediation of  Algeria, is expected to discuss the increased violence which has  officially claimed in one month about 30 lives in the north of  the country.    In Tamanrasset, the discussions will also be on the  "National  Peace Pact" signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government  and the Tuareg rebels, whose implementation has already shown  its limits on the ground.    This pact made for the integration of former Tuareg  combatants into the regular Army, but after the integration  several Tuareg combatants recently deserted the ranks of the  Army after exchanging gunshots with the soldiers.    The Malian Government delegation to the meeting is led by  Defense Minister Diocunda Traore, while that of the rebels is  led by Zeidane Sid' Lamine of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of the Azawad, one of the four tendencies of the  Malian Tuareg rebellion.</p>

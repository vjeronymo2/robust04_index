			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Of all of the new Cabinet ministers, Defense  Minister Pavel Kanis is so far the most active on the  international scene. He was on a lightning visit to Hungary on  Monday [21 March], and this morning he left for a scheduled  visit to Israel.    This country, which was not accessible to us until recently,  is becoming an interesting partner for Slovakia. Besides  economic cooperation, we are also interested in cooperation in  the military sphere. Our editor Jan Baranek interviewed Defense  Minister Kanis before his departure.    [Begin recording] [Baranek] Minister, you will be leaving  for  Israel in a few hours. What will be the main themes of your  talks with the Israeli partner?    [Kanis] This visit has been under preparation for a fairly  long time. I was thinking whether it would serve any purpose to  go on this visit so soon after taking office. After  consultations, my colleagues and I gained the impression that  the visit was well prepared and that we should go because these  relations with Israel are interesting and important to us.    The objective of the visit will be, first of all, an  exchange  of experience in the field of the arms industry and arms  systems. We are small countries that can complement each other  in some areas of this type of production. Meetings with the  prime minister and the foreign minister are scheduled, and,  therefore, foreign policy issues and the international situation  will also be on the agenda.    I will be accompanied by several people from the economic  sector and from Slovak arms factories. I assume that they and  their partners will discuss the opportunities for cooperation or  for trade.    [Baranek] What will be the Slovak delegations's stance on  the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict? Would you like to link it to the  policy of the former Czech and Slovak Federal Republic?    [Kanis] Probably not. Our opinion on Israeli-Arab relations  is guided by the relevant UN resolutions, including the latest  resolution made on the issue. I think our country is far away  from this territory, and, therefore, we have to keep a certain  overview of Israeli-Arab relations. In my opinion, Slovakia's  foreign policy on this conflict and on these relations is well  balanced and meets the preconditions and the criterion of a  certain overview on the matter.

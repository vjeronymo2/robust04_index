			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Unions will campaign against the demerger BRITAIN'S biggest trade union yesterday denounced ICI's plans and said it and other trade unions would campaign to dissuade the group against such a move. Mr Fred Higgs, national secretary of the TGWU, said: 'ICI is trying to pacify the short-term demands of the City rather than address the long-term health of the business.' Mr Higgs said the demerger proposal presented a major threat to employment. The plan would effectively isolate and leave exposed those businesses which would find it difficult to survive the current recession without being part of a large and diverse group. Trade unions and ICI's management have enjoyed a good relationship. They campaigned together last year against the threatened hostile bid by Hanson Group. Mr Higgs said the trade unions accepted the need for certain rationalisations at ICI, but they believed that in the absence of a vigorous acquisition policy ICI was effectively contracting the business. In May, unions representing UK employees of ICI's fibres business met to discuss the company's divestment policy. Union concern had been heightened by the announcement that ICI was to swap its European fibres operations for the acrylics businesses of Du Pont, the US chemicals group. Du Pont, which is to take on ICI fibres employees under the deal, was also paying Pounds 250m.</p>

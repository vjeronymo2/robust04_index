			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Computer survey confirms shift from mainframes MAINFRAME computer sales declined sharply in 1992, with International Business Machines taking the brunt of the decline, according to a market survey. IBM's mainframe computer revenues were down 21 per cent on the previous year, analysts estimate. Dataquest, in its annual market survey, said world sales of all types of computers fell by Dollars 2.5bn, to Dollars 104.5bn. It said the decline reflected the sluggish worldwide economy; the shift from mainframes to client/server networks; and a significant reduction in the cost of technology, coupled with heavy discounting by manufacturers struggling to maintain market share. Mainframe computer sales fell almost 16 per cent from the previous year to Dollars 22.5bn in 1992. But sales of mid-range computers, workstations and personal computers increased, with PCs showing the strongest growth, up 7 per cent at Dollars 46.5bn. Sales of mid-range computers, minicomputers commonly used as 'servers' in PC networks, surpassed mainframe sales for the first time. 'However, this should not be taken as the death of the mainframe market,' said Ms Nancy Stewart, senior industry analyst in Dataquest's Worldwide Computer Systems and Peripherals Group. Mainframes still account for 22.5 per cent of total computer systems sales, she noted. 'It is expected, however, that the shift in buyer preference away from mainframes . . . will continue to erode the mainframe's share of the total worldwide computer systems market,' she added. The trend was recently acknowledged by IBM, which is cutting investment in mainframe technology development and reducing its workforce. But IBM still holds a clear lead in the mainframe market, with 1992 sales of Dollars 11.8bn representing 52.2 per cent of the world market. In the PC market, IBM also leads, although its winning margin has narrowed over the past year. According to Dataquest, IBM's PC revenues were Dollars 5.8bn last year, with Apple computer gaining market share to reach Dollars 5.5bn.</p>

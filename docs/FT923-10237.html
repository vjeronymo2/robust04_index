			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Yorkshire and Humberside (3) Humberside's surge aids fight for life - The 'unloved' county closes a national gap THIS AUTUMN, Sir John Banham is going to need his renowned skills of analysis and diplomacy. It is then that the new Local Government Commission, which he chairs, will start to look at the future of Humberside. The county is an amalgam of most of the old East Riding of Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire, joined by the Humber Bridge in the middle and a no-man's-land of a district called Boothferry at its western border with old Yorkshire. Traditionally, Tykes live to the north of the Humber and Yellow Bellies to the south, but Boothferry, lacking an estuary for opposing factions to shout across, offers no similarly convenient cultural division. A populist campaign to break up Humberside has been raging for the nearly two decades of its existence, and the county has been officially 'under review' since 1985. First, the Boundary Commission decided things should stay as they are, then changed its mind after a flood of complaints. Before anything could be done, however, the government decided to re-examine the structure of local government generally under Sir John. In the meantime, something unusual has happened to Humberside: it has become almost average. The latest figures for regional gross domestic product (GDP) show a transformation during the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade, Humberside's was a laggard. Its GDP per head was 87 per cent of the national average, adding to arguments that this was an enforced, unnatural grouping of communities which did not mesh. But at the end of the decade, Humberside's GDP index was 99.1 per cent, an unheard-of achievement in northern counties. Yorkshire and Humberside as a whole managed only 90.7 per cent. Across the Pennines, north-west England was at 91.2 per cent. North Yorkshire, supposedly the richest county east of the Pennines, was at 95.2 per cent. West Yorkshire, which generates most of the region's wealth in absolute terms, had a GDP per head 93.1 per cent of average, with South Yorkshire down at 79.1 per cent. The scale of Humberside's improvement is even more astonishing when compared with southern England. At nearly 134 per cent, it was the sixth best in Britain. The increase in economic performance was greater than those of Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, Bedfordshire and Berkshire, and not far behind Northamptonshire, West Sussex, Surrey and Buckinghamshire. Only Clwyd, in north-east Wales, showed faster growth than all of these counties. Humberside County Council has worked hard at promoting the county as the north's leading gateway to Europe. It claims a fragmentation of authorities could not have had the same effect, because they would have competed with each other and diluted the impact for a Humberside community that totals only 860,000. Economically, the picture looks like getting even rosier as the Humber ports expand rapidly in the wake of abolition of the national dock labour scheme in 1989, which freed them from trade union restrictive practices. 'No one can suggest Humberside doesn't work, especially now,' says Mr John Parkes, the county's chief executive. 'Even the Boundary Commission admitted it does. We have a coherent policy for economic development that benefits both Tykes and Yellow Bellies and which is now proving itself. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The test of this argument will not be how it squares with local opinion, but whether it will impress the Local Government Commission. Both sides pin their hopes on Sir John, but the county council thinks it may have an edge: a former director-general of the Confederation of British Industry and former head of the Audit Commission - the government watchdog on local authority spending and efficiency - he understands business and the arcane world of local government finance. Mr Parkes estimates it would cost Pounds 11m in transitional costs, plus Pounds 2m a year thereafter, to abolish Humberside's nine district councils and make the county a unitary authority. But, he says, it would be even costlier to do the reverse. A split into two authorities - one for each bank of the river - would still leave the question of Boothferry, and neither would be big enough to be efficient. Other options, such as Hull and Grimsby each going its own way, would create tiny urban islands and, in Hull's case, permanent Labour dictatorship. Dr Norman O'Neill, a county councillor who chairs the economic development committee, says: 'A lot of people who want to split up Humberside don't recognise the relationship of local government to economic development.' He thinks that much of the opposition to Humberside concerns its name. Calling the county authority a regional council or renaming it East Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire might defuse the issue. So might a simple change of postal addresses. Polls on the issue are confusing. Humberside is unloved, with people preferring old county names, but more than 70 per cent are satisfied with its services and performance. At the same time, younger people, who never knew East Riding, identify with it. Although people want single tier authorities, rather than the present district and county council structure, there is no consensus on which options to choose. Regional economic growth in the face of national recession may well be a powerful argument to leave things as they are if growth looks likely to be diminished by break-up. There is also the argument that this is not a local issue. Mr John Gunnell, Labour MP for Leeds South and Morley, and chairman of Yorkshire and Humberside Development Association, says: 'Humberside has great economic significance for the region and the north. It has a lot to offer strategically as a unit and its ports are a big selling point for inward investment anywhere within reach of them. There is a very good rationale for keeping Humberside together.' Dr O'Neill says: 'Sir John is a rational man who understands local government finance and is not in the pocket of the government. We shall be making a rational case.'</p>

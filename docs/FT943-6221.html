			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / World Trade News: US companies sign up for Dollars 5bn of new business in China - Sino-American relations enter fresh phase as bout of commercial diplomacy pays off American companies have initialled Dollars 5bn of agreements with Chinese counterparts in the power, automotive, and communications sectors in the last two days, signalling a more aggressive US drive into the China market. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, who is leading a trade mission to China of the heads of some of America's biggest corporations, said yesterday he had been 'exhilarated' by the success of US companies and the reception he had received from Chinese officials. He gave notice that the Americans would be fierce competitors for an estimated Dollars 250bn worth of infrastructure projects in China before the end of the century. 'American companies - often the world's technological leaders - deserve their fair share,' he said. 'We intend to compete in this market, and we intend to win.' Mr Brown described his mission to China as the beginning of a new era in Sino-US commercial relations. The high-profile US commercial diplomacy follows the Clinton administration's decision in May to 'de-link' trade and human rights issues in renewing China's Most Favoured Trading access to the United States. The MFN issue had threatened to sour Sino-US relations. US corporations argued that the administration's focus on human rights was jeopardising American business interests in China and benefiting competitors in Europe and Asia. Mr Brown announced yesterday that China and the US would resume a dialogue next month on human rights issues. Exchanges were broken off earlier this year following the tense visit to Beijing of Mr Warren Christopher, the US Secretary of State. Among Sino-US commercial agreements signed yesterday were: A Dollars 2bn agreement between the Wing Group and the Jiangsu Power Bureau for the construction of China's first LNG (liquefied natural gas) fuelled power plant, located in Jiangsu province, south-central China. A Dollars 1bn agreement between Entergy Corporation of the US, in partnership with the Lippo Group of Hong Kong, and the North China Power Group for an extension to a power plant at Datong, Inner Mongolia. Supplies of US-manufactured equipment would amount to Dollars 450m. A contract between TRW of the US, Suman Group of Guangdong province and Beijing Cable TV Network to supply 1m de-scrambler units for television programmes in Chinese households. An agreement between TRW and Jinan Auto-Accessories Works for the manufacture of engine valves. The joint venture is expected to produce 14m engine valves annually for China's fast-growing automotive sector. An agreement between Sprint Communications and China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunication for the introduction of Sprint's Internet service, opening China to the international information super-highway. These agreements followed others initialled on Monday, including a Dollars 150m contract involving Westinghouse for the supply of steam turbines and other equipment for the Ligang power station on the Yangtze in Jiangsu province. Representatives of American power companies such as Entergy said that while they were confident the projects would go ahead, difficult negotiations were required on financing. Among vexed issues is the rate of return to foreign companies taking equity in power projects under 'build-operate-transfer' (BOT) arrangements. China has baulked at returns exceeding 15 per cent, but company representatives said the risks involved required higher rates. Mr Brown told a packed meeting, organised by the US-China Business Council, that US exports to China were growing at four times the rate of exports to the rest of the world, and that 150,000 Americans earned their living from these exports. 'China's importance - strategically and economically - demands that we construct a more comprehensive relationship,' Mr Brown said. The Brown mission was due to travel on to Shanghai last night, and then to Guangzhou before ending up in Hong Kong.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP TEN FOREIGN INVESTORS IN CHINA  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Foreign investments, 1979-1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Countries                       No of                       Contracted                                projects           inv.

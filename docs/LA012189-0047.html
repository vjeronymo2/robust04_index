			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TELEVISION REVIEWS;  </P> <P> 'DOLPHIN COVE' MAKES SPLASHY BOW ON CBS  </P> <P> Lassie has nothing on Slim and Delbert, the dolphins who hang out at "Dolphin  Cove" -- which also is the name of their new CBS series that premieres at 8  tonight (Channels 2 and 8).  </P> <P> Slim and Delbert are not only bright and graceful. They're also psychic -- they  can sense when a swimmer is in trouble, one cove away, and lead rescuers to  her.  </P> <P> They're not really the stars of the show. That title goes to Frank Converse, as  a recently widowed dolphin researcher, and to Trey Ames and Karron Graves as  his children.  </P> <P> In the initial episode, written by series co-creator Peter Benchley of "Jaws"  fame, this American family arrives in Australia, where a wealthy dolphin lover  (Nick Tate) is bankrolling Converse's studies of dolphin lingo.  </P> <P> The most compelling performance in the show is from Graves, whose character  hasn't spoken since the death of her mother. Naturally, she has a great  affinity for Slim and Delbert, but she doesn't get along so well with her new  therapist (Virginia Hey).  </P> <P> Converse is rather cold and stolid for such a warm, soft series. But "Dolphin  Cove" does offer Graves, the dolphins, pretty shots of Queensland and the  currently chic status of Australia, personified here by aboriginal actor Ernie  Dingo as Converse's assistant.  </P> <P> Benchley also took care not to wrap everything up in the first episode, so  perhaps there is hope for "Dolphin Cove" in its struggle against the ratings  currents.  </P> <P> Mel Damski directed the premiere for executive producers Dick Berg, Allan  Marcil and John Masius. Ron and Valerie Taylor ("Jaws," "The Blue Lagoon") are  the underwater cinematographers. DON SHIRLEY  </P></p>

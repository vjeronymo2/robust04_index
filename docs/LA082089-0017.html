			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> DESIGNING FURNITURE FROM CONCEPT TO SHOP DRAWING: A PRACTICAL GUIDE;  </P> <P> BY SETH STEM  </P> <P> (The Taunton Press; 1989)  </P> <P> SETH STEM'S FURNITURE would be right at home in a modern, multi-million-dollar  Bel-Air manse. While this book doesn't tell anyone how to make furniture, Stem,  a well-known furniture designer and teacher, details a series of steps in a  basic design process. He also presents many full-color photographs of dazzling  contemporary pieces: Garish Memphis-style chairs, sleek tables, and downright  weird cabinets are offered as examples of the furniture-maker's art and the  designer's achievement. Stem includes drawings to illustrate his design points:  "An Exercise in Proportioning," for instance, shows seven different vertical  cabinet rectangles, each with distinct details that seem to alter its shape.  </P> <P> Stem also provides standard furniture measurements, drawing techniques, a list  of necessary tools for design and suggestions for making models and mock-ups --  just about everything a designer needs except the imagination.  </P> <P> The book is intended for the experienced, professional furniture maker. But  don't let that daunt you; the pictures and the process are engrossing even to  furniture spectators. ($24.95) Judith Sims  </P></p>

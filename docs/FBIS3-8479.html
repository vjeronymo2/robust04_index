Canadian Captain George Petrokeleas said in Visoko, 40  kilometres (25 miles) northwest of Sarajevo, that the convoy's  arrival meant that "a long and frustrating time is now over."    The infantry troops are to help monitor a Croat-Moslem  ceasefire in central Bosnia. "We've needed them here for a long  time. We didn't have enough infantry," he said.    The convoy of the Royal 22nd Regiment was to pick up 69  Canadian UN troops and their equipment and take them to Visoko.    Serb forces have for months blocked the rotation out of  Srebrenica, a UN-declared safe haven. The Serbs said the number  of UN troops in the enclave, at full strength 160 Canadians  before they started leaving last week, should not be increased.    But some 350 Dutch troops arrived in Srebrenica last week to  relieve the Canadians. The Dutch UN force there is eventually to  number about 600.    The Canadian convoy was held up at a Serb checkpoint about  25  kilometres (15 miles) northwest of Sarajevo for 30 hours before  continuing its trek on Tuesday.    The Serbs said they did not want tracked vehicles on their  roads anymore.    The convoy included five Cougar tanks and 15 trucks.</p>

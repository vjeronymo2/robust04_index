In an interview with THE TIMES in west Belfast, the Sinn  Fein  president said Sinn Fein could not wait indefinitely for the  Government to meet its demands. But he described December's  Anglo-Irish declaration as a significant development which he  hoped to incorporate into a wider peace process.    Mr Adams, who was interviewed at Sinn Fein's office on the  Falls Road in west Belfast, called on the Government to clarify  the document in the way that it has for other parties. But he  warned: "At some point of course we may exhaust that possibility  and we may have to conclude reluctantly that because of Mr  Major's leadership difficulties that he won't be able to engage  with us. Then I think we will perhaps have to try to find other  ways of moving forward." This would mean turning back to the  agreement Mr Adams reached last year with John Hume, the leader  of the SDLP.    "We cannot allow the peace process to founder," Mr Adams  said. "The lesson is that this peace process arose from the  Irish initiatives. One would move back to that."    Mr Adams, who was wearing the kind of smart suit which  helped  him to woo the American media during his trip to New York last  month, said that he was perplexed by the Government's attitude  to the peace process during the past few months. He said: "They  seem to have stopped petrified in mid-leap. We are keen to  explore whether the Downing Street declaration is a tremendous  leap or whether it is a barricade the British Government has  erected almost as a counter-offensive to the pressure coming  from Ireland."    Since John Major and Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime  minister, issued the Downing Street declaration last December,  Mr Adams and other leading Republicans have been careful neither  to accept nor reject the document. Mr Adams said yesterday that  while Sinn Fein was encouraged by the peace process it was  unhappy with the Unionist veto in the declaration and its  assertion that Irish self-determination should be exercised  separately on both sides of the border.    "It is perfectly reasonable to say that we want London and  Dublin to come to an agreement which involves all of us, and  then as part of that to seek Unionist consent. But I think what  is turning that on its head is to say that we cannot move unless  we have Unionist consent."    That would be akin, he said, to President de Klerk of South  Africa refusing to agree to reforms without the consent of the  far right.    "Why should John Major stall on the basis of right-wing  reaction in Ireland?" Mr Adams said. Unionists should be  persuaded that their future lay in a united Ireland. "Why  doesn't he try to move these people forward. I actually have  confidence in the Unionists that in the new scenario they will  be pragmatic and that they will seek to work out the best  arrangement for themselves."    Mr Adams said that Britain had no right to interfere in  Irish  self-determination, and Sinn Fein would continue to boycott any  border polls to decide the future of Northern Ireland. But he  added: "It's remarkable that the British Government has taken  all these hundreds of years to admit that the people of Ireland  are a nation."</p>

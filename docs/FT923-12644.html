			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / France's dock scheme expires France's 45-year dock labour scheme expired yesterday, with the application of a law which will modernise labour practices and help curb costs in what are among Europe's least competitive ports, writes William Dawkins in Paris. However, a handful of ports, led by Marseilles and Dunkirk, were yesterday continuing to hold out against the reforms and the terms of a FFr2bn (Pounds 208m) early retirement and redundancy package from the government and employers. As a result of the reforms, voted through parliament in May, nearly half of France's 8,300 dockers will lose their jobs. The change means dockers will be paid monthly at market rates by cargo handling companies, instead of at centrally fixed rates paid by port authorities irrespective of whether or not work is available.</p>

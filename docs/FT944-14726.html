			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Revenue growth spurs IBM back into profit International Business Machines reported much higher than expected revenues and earnings for the third quarter, raising hopes that the world's largest computer company will achieve its first year of profit and revenue growth since 1990. Third quarter net earnings were Dollars 689m (Pounds 436m), or Dollars 1.18 per share after payment of preferred stock dividends, compared with a loss of Dollars 87m or 15 cents per share last year. Revenues grew 8.6 per cent to Dollars 15.4bn. Last year's figures are adjusted for the sale of IBM's Federal Systems Company, restructuring charges and accounting changes. 'There is evidence that we are moving into the second phase of the transformation of IBM,' said Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive. Although cost cuts will continue, IBM is now focused on growing revenues, said Mr Jerome York, chief financial officer. Revenues from sales of IBM's traditional mainframe computers, its most profitable products, increased for the first time in more than two years as demand exceeded supply. 'We shipped all of the mainframes we could build,' said Mr York. Sales of IBM's AS/400 mid-range computers grew about 25 per cent. IBM continues to have problems in the personal computer sector. Although revenues increased modestly worldwide, US results were 'sluggish'. Semiconductor sales grew strongly with year to date sales of about Dollars 2.2bn. IBM may forge an agreement with another chip maker to make better use of its chip plants, Mr York hinted. Gross profit margins were 39.9 per cent of sales in the third quarter. Gross margins have now been stable for two years, said Mr York. IBM cut overall expenses 13 per cent, or Dollars 700m, from the 1993 third quarter. Through the first nine months of 1994, total expenses fell Dollars 2.8bn. Mr York said the workforce was cut by about 3,000 in the third quarter, to 232,000. Another 10,000 to 12,000 jobs will be cut in the fourth quarter. IBM no longer expected to reach its year-end staffing target of 215,000, mainly because of demand for mainframes. For the year to date, net earnings were Dollars 1.7bn, or Dollars 2.86 per share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 464m, or 81 cents per share last year, before restructuring charges and an accounting change. Revenue for the first nine months was Dollars 44.2bn, a 6 per cent increase. IBM's share price, which has gained 9 per cent since the beginning of the month, yesterday closed down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75.</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVE EL TORO, TUSTIN MARINE STATIONS TO GEORGE AIR FORCE BASE  </P> <P> Whether we really need an international airport in Orange County, a better idea  for the use of George Air Force Base would be to relocate both Tustin and El  Toro to that location.  </P> <P> For the same reasons that the other proposed sites are not suitable, it makes  no sense for these military air bases to be located in urban Orange County.  </P> <P> Ask yourself if anyone in his right mind would consider establishing these air  bases in their present locations at this time.  </P> <P> Then, in view of the impending cutbacks of military operations, the desire of  the residents near George to continue its operation, the more appropriate  environmental and safety conditions there, and the minuscule economic impact on  us here of eliminating El Toro and Tustin, let's do it.  </P> <P> As for high-speed trains, why not use them to connect John Wayne and Los  Angeles International Airport and downtown Los Angeles, where we'd get  coordinated benefits other than a faster means to deposit money with the  ganglords in Vegas.  </P> <P> As for what to do with El Toro and Tustin, how about national parks and/or a  bird refuge and/or the agricultural operations they replaced originally that  could absorb some of the greenhouse gases created in overdeveloped Orange  County?  </P> <P> BERNARD FELDMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(joe)": "The Army Is Trying To Manage Itself </F> Better"]    [Text] Prague--The development plan drafted by the Czech  Republic Army (ACR), which the defense minister will submit to  the government and parliament for their information, proposes  that roughly 2.5 percent of the gross domestic product be  earmarked for the state's defense needs. This statement was  made at a press briefing held yesterday by Deputy Minister  Miroslav Kalousek. He described the ACR's drawing on the budget  this year as equable. The development plan should include  stipulations concerning the human, material, and financial  resources for the Army and its programs up to the year 2005 in  accordance with the priorities of the defense strategy.    According to M. Kalousek, the ACR's acquisition plan for its  modernization should be defined by mid-1995. At the same time,  the Defense Ministry will give preference to negotiations with  direct producers, and the final supplier should be a domestic  company. Public competitions and tenders, with the exception of  cases where the nature of the order makes this impossible, will  be implemented as much as possible in making purchases and  sales. To simplify the contractual relationship, the ministry  will try--as, for example, it is doing at the moment in  selecting a food supplier--to find a central guarantor who  would, among other things, make it possible to resolve the  problem of different regional prices. In this connection,  Kalousek referred to the ministry's attempt to create the most  clear-cut system possible in harmony with legal and ethical  norms, a system that would eliminate the risk of influence being  brought to bear on the choice of Army suppliers.    The new Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS),  which is operating in parallel with the system utilized to date,  should make the Army's economic management considerably clearer.  The ACR will transfer to double-entry bookkeeping in 1995.    In assessing the Army's transformation, Kalousek emphasized  its quite reductive nature. For example, only five of the  original 12 military airfields should remain in operation. The  ACR intends to offer to interested parties, within the framework  of stipulated contractual conditions, those reserve airfields  whose operation is costly. Projects are now being drawn up for  the airfields in Bechyne, Zatec, and Hradec Kralove and for  combined operations in Pardubice. The Army is selling off or  transferring to other entities its unserviceable facilities and  hardware. The money saved by reducing the cost of maintaining  the Army can be used for its modernization, said Kalousek.</p>

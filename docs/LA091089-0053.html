			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO FLOW  </P> <P> While I was thrilled to see my home state of Vermont pictured on the front of  the Travel Section ("Autumn in New England," Aug. 20), I must point out an  error in the caption. The Black River is that which is shown on the front page.  The Williams River does not flow through Ludlow. At least it didn't flow  through Ludlow the last time I saw it! Nonetheless, thank you for showing  Californians the splendor of New England. I only hope you didn't encourage too  many of them to visit.  </P> <P> STEPHEN J. FRAZIER  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

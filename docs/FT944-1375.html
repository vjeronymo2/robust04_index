			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities in good form as bid stories emerge - Market Report The emergence of a series of actual and potential takeover developments supplied the ammunition for a strong start to the week in London's equity market. Dealers said there were no real surprises with Trafalgar House's bid for Northern Electric but potential bids for oil group Pict Petroleum and Wills Group, the industrial concern, were news to the market. And marketmakers remained on red alert for an expected bid from De La Rue for Portals, the banknote paper manufacturer. There was no disguising, however, the beginning of a winding down process in the market ahead of the Christmas holiday. That was evident in the relatively low level of turnover  - 477.2m shares  - the lowest for ten trading sessions. Activity in non FT-SE stocks accounted for 275.8m shares, or 58 per cent of the overall total. The value of customer business is expected to fall close to Pounds 1bn; last Friday saw customer business worth Pounds 1.54bn pass through the market. A disappointing opening to Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Average came in under pressure and fell over 20 points within an hour of the opening, took some of the shine off London's excellent showing. There was an element of uncertainty in the US ahead of today's crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting which will ponder US monetary policy. London traders did not expect any shift in US interest rates until the New Year. 'We expect the Federal Reserve to wait until it has sieved through the necessary data on the fourth quarter before it decides on any further shift,' said the head of strategy at one big European bank. Looking further ahead, he said there was a faint hope of a reduction in German interest rates on Thursday when the Bundesbank Council meets in Frankfurt. The market's takeover enthusiasm was such that the FT-SE 100 shrugged off a tired-looking Wall Street and closed 20.8 higher at 3,034.4, its highest for almost two weeks. There was also keen support for second-line issues, where the FT-SE Mid 250 index settled 22.9 higher at 3,460.0. Pride of place however, went to BP, whose rehabilitation was completed as the stock became the UK equity market's highest capitalised stock for the first time since the 1980s. The 100 index began the day some 13 points higher, as the market got wind of the Trafalgar House offer for Northern Electric, a move which sparked buying across the whole utilities areas of the market. Analysts said the Trafalgar move could attract a counter offer from domestic or overseas predators anxious to acquire the cash generative electricity company. The generally accepted view around the market was that the bid for Northern was probably the first of many among the recs. South Wales Electricity, London, South Western and Norweb remain the other favourite targets. East Midlands Electricity raced higher, courtesy of a 27 per cent interim dividend increase. Dealers pointed to above-average turnover in the recs as the bid speculation gripped the sector; 'Big turnover is always the precursor of corporate activity,' said one trader 'and we've seen big activity for two weeks.' Outside of the utilities and excluding the expected offer for Portals dealers said there was plenty of activity across various sectors. In a generally firm retailing sector Kingfisher was outstanding - and the FT-SE 100's best individual performer  - amid talk of buoyant sales. SG Warburg took the wooden spoon as the worst performer in the 100 index, with suggestions of great unhappiness around the company's various departments after the failed merger talks with Morgan Stanley.</p>

SPD [Social  Democratic Party] parliamentary group chairman Wolfgang Birthler  told journalists in Potsdam today that the minority government  would operate on the basis of the existing cooperation agreement  reached in November 1990. Only the objective of devoting even  greater effort toward the creation of jobs would be added to the  existing coalition paper.    The Liberals intend to add further amendments following a  private meeting this weekend. Both partners stressed their wish  to continue their "successful policies as before" until the  regular Landtag elections this autumn. There will be no  fundamental break with previous government policy, Birthler said.</p>

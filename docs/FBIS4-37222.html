			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Maryam M. Shahin] </F>   [Text] Amman -- The Israeli government has approved the  entry of up to 600 Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)  personnel including all members of the Palestine Central Council  (PCC) in preparation for the expected entry of PLO Chairman  Yasir 'Arafat to the Palestinian autonomous territories, PLO  sources said Friday [17 June].    The Israeli-approved list, which includes PLO activists from  Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, is the first to include members of the  Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP). Both  groups reject the peace process.    Up to 400 names of PLO activists including members of  women's  organisations and medical organisations and administrative  officials were approved Thursday and up to 100 more were passed  through Gaza-based PLO officials to Tunis on Friday.    The PLO had submitted large lists to the Israelis and now  they are flowing back to Tunis. Most members of the PCC were  also given clearance by the Israeli authorities by Friday.    There was, however, a "B list" and "C list," according to  PLO  sources in Amman. These were still subject to further security  checks by Israelis and in the case of "list C" -- which  contained the names of those who were refused entry. "The PLO  sources in Amman did not have the names of the people refused  entry. [quotation marks as published]    The names included in the list of 600 are both from Gaza and  the West Bank and include several hundred Fatah-affiliated  activists, independents, about 25 FIDA members, 19 members of  the PFLP and a handful of DFLP members.    Former militant activists and political prisoners expelled  by  Israel are among those whose names were approved.    The timing of the approval is in synchronisation with the  expected entry of Mr. 'Arafat and an effort to make the  Palestinian National Authority operational within the next few  weeks.    The timing of Mr. 'Arafat's entry, initially tipped to have  been on June 5, is still uncertain. Many PLO officials now say  that it will not be until after the July 6 ceremony in Paris in  which the PLO Chairman and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  will receive a special U.N. prize for their role in the Middle  East peace process.    International funding is among the points of contention said  to have delayed the PLO chairman's entry into Jericho and Gaza.  World Bank officials were in Tunis to discuss the channelling  of funds.    Mr. 'Arafat is said to be angered by the World Bank's  insistence that the funding be given directly to government  agencies or projects.</p>

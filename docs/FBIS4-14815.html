On the night of March 31 to April 1,  unidentified attackers fired from automatic weapons from a rear  area on a border post of the Kazakh battalion of the  peacekeeping force in Tajikistan in the sector of border picket  no. 1 of the Khorog border-guarding detachment, a spokesman at  the press centre of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan told  ITAR-TASS on Saturday morning. The border guards returned the  fire after which the attackers fled upon wounding a Kazakh  serviceman.    On Friday afternoon, in the sector of border picket no. 3 of  the Panj border-guarding detachment, Tajik opposition militants,  who had infiltrated from the territory of Afghanistan, fired on  a border patrol. There were no casualities among border guards.    The situation on the Tajik-Afghan border remained relatively  calm on Friday night and Saturday morning.</p>

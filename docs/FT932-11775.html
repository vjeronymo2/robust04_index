			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / US acts against Japan on trade: Clinton takes tougher stance to force opening of foreign markets THE US yesterday launched a salvo of tough trade actions against Japan, Brazil, India, Thailand and several other trading partners. The move provoked an immediate hostile response from Japan and heralded a new era of trade friction with several other countries. The measures are likely to add to foreign governments' perplexity over the direction of US trade policy. Just the night before, Mr Clinton told finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrialised countries, meeting in Washington, that the US was ready to take 'exceptional actions' to bring about agreement in the stalled Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. Mr Clinton's remarks were echoed yesterday by Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, who told the IMF the US wanted the Tokyo summit in July to seek a G7 agreement on market access issues holding up a Uruguay Round agreement. The round should be concluded by mid-December, he said. Yesterday's tough US measures target the Japanese government's procurement practices in construction and supercomputers, while taking aim at abuses of intellectual property rights in the other countries. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, invoking US laws against foreign government discrimination on procurement, said President Clinton's administration was 'taking a different tack' from the Bush administration in seeking more rigorous enforcement of US trade laws and bilateral trade agreements. Mr Kantor argued that these enforcement actions were intended not just to open foreign markets for US goods and services, but to restore credibility to the idea of open trading. He said tough action could help to develop public support for free trade in the US, where protectionist sentiments are mounting against the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the North American Free Trade Agreement. The strongest action announced yesterday was against Japanese practices in awarding construction contracts. Citing 'persistent and significant discrimination against US firms', Mr Kantor threatened sanctions within 60 days if the issue was not resolved. Angry Japanese officials warned that they might retaliate against US contractors and insisted that negotiations would not begin with the US under the threat of time limits or sanctions. Japanese officials interpreted the move by the US trade representative's office as a sign of the Clinton administration's tougher stance on the bilateral deficit. Japan also sees the US action as an opportunity to show it will resist bilateral trade agreements. The US earlier this month used the same law to invoke sanctions against the European Community in the telecommunications and heavy electrical equipment sectors. Sanctions are due to be imposed in the telecommunications area. Procurement practices were also listed as concerns in Australia and China. Mr Kantor complained of Japanese discrimination against US supercomputer suppliers and ordered a review of Japanese actions under a 1990 supercomputer agreement. A senior Japanese foreign ministry official said the timing of the US action could damage multilateral negotiations under Gatt. 'We are ready to discuss the construction market but we will never do so under threat of sanctions,' he said. At the same time, the US listed Brazil, India and Thailand as 'priority foreign countries' because of their denial of adequate intellectual property protection. Other countries also targeted for action on the intellectual property issue were Hungary, Taiwan, Korea, Argentina, Egypt, Poland, Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia and the EC. The US move came as G7 finance ministers agreed this week that a further opening of the international trading system was indispensable for maximising world growth.

			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Economics: Focus turns to UK Budget outcome THERE have been few clues as to what tomorrow's Budget will deliver in the UK. But with the public sector borrowing requirement set to rise to between Pounds 45bn and Pounds 50bn in the next financial year, the chancellor is expected to announce some revenue raising measures. An alteration to the VAT system is one possibility. The chancellor has the option of either raising the rate of VAT - currently 17.5 per cent  - or extending its base to include items such as food, newspapers and children's clothes. One drawback would be the upwards pressure such a move would put on the retail prices index. But as the RPI figures at the end of this week are expected to show, the government still has plenty of room on inflation. The rest of the week will be taken up with other UK figures, including manufacturing output, unemployment figures and the February PSBR. Other economic highlights of the week follow. The figures in brackets are the consensus of economists forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

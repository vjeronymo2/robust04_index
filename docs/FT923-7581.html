			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Shareholders show little faith in annual reports, says survey MOST analysts and shareholders do not believe annual reports give a 'true and fair view' of a company's financial position, according to a survey. The findings come during an intense debate over the quality of accounting in British companies. Last week, Mr Terry Smith, head of UK research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, was suspended after he pressed ahead with plans to publish a critical book on the subject. While 80 per cent of finance directors had faith in the accounts, 60 per cent of investor relations consultants - who are often intimately involved in preparing annual reports - were not confident that they fairly reflected a company's financial position. The survey of more than 300 finance directors, analysts, shareholders and investor relations staff was conducted for McBride's, a design consultancy, in April and May this year. Both companies legislation and guidelines for auditors use the phrase 'true and fair' to mean that the accounts accurately represent the financial state of the company. But there are differences in the way the accounting standards required to comply with the phrase are interpreted. Two-thirds of analysts and a quarter of shareholders said accounts did not provide a true and fair view. Some 39 per cent of shareholders said they did give a fair view; 36 per cent said they did not know. One commented: 'An annual report is self-generated by the company so one cannot expect it to be true and fair'. Analysts wanted more information on the value and use of a company's assets, capital expenditure and the sector in which it operated. Shareholders called for greater detail on long-term performance and less on profiles of key staff. Only 22 per cent of shareholders said the most important purpose of an annual report was to gather information on financial performance, while 29 per cent said it was for general information about the company. Nearly two-thirds of shareholders and one-quarter of analysts said they would be interested in a short form annual report, containing far less detail on a company's accounts. But only 2 per cent of finance directors said they were interested in producing such a report, and 15 per cent of these said they would consider providing it as well as the full report. The vast majority of those questioned said clearly-written text, an uncluttered format and figures which were easy to read were the most important design features in a report. Three-fifths of shareholders and nearly two-fifths of analysts believed that too much money was spent on producing annual reports. Annual report survey.

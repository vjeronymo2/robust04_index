			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. The Bank has requested retroactive relief, for the in-kind transfer to HighMark that occurred over the weekend of November 12, 1993. It is represented that on the weekend of November 12, 1993, all of the assets of five CIFs <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE> , which were maintained by the Bank and in which the Plans held interests, were transferred to HighMark in exchange for an appropriate number of shares of certain portfolios of HighMark which have investment objectives and policies substantially identical to those of the CIFs. At the same time, the five CIFs were terminated and the assets of each, then consisting of shares in portfolios of HighMark, were distributed in-kind to the Plans participating in such CIFs based on each Plan's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of the assets of the CIFs on the date of the transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is represented that the CIFs maintained by the Bank which engaged in the transfer in-kind on November 12, 1993, were the Balanced Fund, the Flexible Bond Fund A, the Government Fund, the Income and Growth Equity Fund, and the Income Equity Fund A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Bank provided to the Second Fiduciary for each affected Plan disclosures that announced the termination of the CIFs, summarized the transaction, and otherwise complied with provisions of Section I. It is represented that based on these disclosures, the Second Fiduciary from each affected Plan approved in writing the transfer of the CIFs assets to the corresponding portfolios of HighMark, the investment of the assets of the Plans in shares of HighMark, and the receipt by the Bank of fees for services to HighMark and to the Plans. It is represented that the assets of Plans that did not approve investment in HighMark were withdrawn from the CIFs and held or invested in appropriate alternative investments in accordance with the terms of such Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to the transaction, the assets of the five CIFs were reviewed to confirm that such were appropriate investments for the corresponding portfolios of HighMark into which such assets were transferred. If any of the assets of the five CIFs were not appropriate for HighMark, it is represented that the Bank sold such assets in the open market through an unaffiliated brokerage firm prior to the transfer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is represented that the assets transferred by the five CIFs to HighMark consisted entirely of cash and marketable securities. For purposes of the transfer in-kind, the value of the securities in each of the five CIFs were determined based on market values as of the close of business on November 12, 1993, the last business date prior to the transfer. It is represented that the values were determined in a single valuation using the valuation procedures described in Rule 17a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In this regard, it is represented that the ``current market price'' for specific types of CIF securities involved in the transaction was determined as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) If the security was a ``reported security'' as the term is defined in Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the 1934 Act, the last sale price with respect to such security reported in the consolidated transaction reporting system (the Consolidated System) for November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions in the Consolidated System that day, the average of the highest independent bid and the lowest independent offer for such security (reported pursuant to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 under the 1934 Act), as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the security was not a reported security, and the principal market for such security was an exchange, then the last sale on such exchange on November 12, 1993; or if there were no reported transactions on such exchange that day, the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer on such exchange as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) If the security was not a reported security and was quoted in the NASDAQ system, then the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer reported on Level 1 of NASDAQ as of the close of business on November 12, 1993; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For all other securities, the average of the highest independent bid and lowest independent offer as of the close of business on November 12, 1993, determined on the basis of reasonable inquiry. For securities in this category, the Bank represents that it obtained quotations from at least three sources that were either broker-dealers or pricing services independent of and unrelated to the Bank and, where more than one valid quotation was available, used the average of the quotations to value the securities, in conformance with interpretations by the SEC and practice under Rule 17a&hyph;7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is represented that the securities received by the corresponding portfolio of HighMark were valued by such portfolio for purposes of the transfer in the same manner and on the same day as such securities were valued by the CIFs. The per share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the shares of each portfolio of HighMark issued to the CIFs were based on the corresponding portfolio's then current net asset value. It is represented that the aggregate value of the shares of the corresponding portfolio of HighMark issued to the CIFs were equal to the value of the assets (cash and marketable securities) transferred to such portfolio as of the close of business on November 12, 1993. It is also represented that the value of a Plan's investment in shares of a corresponding portfolio of HighMark as of the opening of business on the first business day after the transaction (November 15, 1993) was equal to the value of such Plan's investment in the CIF as of the close of business on the last business day prior to the transaction (November 12, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is represented that not later than thirty (30) days after completion of the transaction (December 15, 1993), the Bank sent by regular mail a written confirmation of the transaction to each affected Plan. Such confirmation contained: (1) the identity of each security that was valued in accordance with Rule 17a7(b)(4), as described in the paragraph 7(4) above; (2) the price of each such security for purposes of the transaction; and (3) the identity of each pricing service or market maker consulted in determining the value of such securities. To reiterate the above discussion, and in accordance with the conditions under section I, similar procedures will occur upon any future in-kind exchanges between CIFs maintained by the Bank, Plans, and the Funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Receipt of Fees From Funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. It is represented that the Bank currently invests assets of the Plans it manages in shares of the Funds in accordance with the conditions set forth in PTCE 77&hyph;4. Under certain conditions, PTCE 77&hyph;4 permits the Bank to receive fees from the Funds under either of two circumstances: (a) where a Plan does not pay any investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees with respect to the assets of such Plan invested in shares of a Fund for the entire period of such investment; or (b) where a Plan pays investment management, investment advisory, or similar fees to the Bank based on the total assets of such Plan from which a credit has been subtracted representing such Plan's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  share of such investment advisory fees paid to the Bank by the Fund. As such, it is represented that there are two levels of fees_those fees which the Bank charges to the Plans for serving as trustee with investment discretion or as investment manager (the Plan-level fees); and those fees the Bank charges to the Funds (the Fund-level fees) for serving as investment advisor, custodian, or service provider.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

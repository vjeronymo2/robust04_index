			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / DoT computer service privatisation plan expected THE government is expected to announce plans in the next few days to privatise DVOIT, the organisation that provides computer services to the Department of Transport and its executive agencies. Based in Swansea, DVOIT has about 500 employees providing computing services to the Department of Transport and its agencies. Its largest customer is the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which registers and licenses drivers and vehicles and collects vehicle excise duty. DVOIT also processes data for the Department of Transport and two of its other agencies, the Vehicle Inspectorate and the Driving Standards Agency. Its three mainframe computers can be accessed from some 4,000 terminals in 200 offices throughout the UK. DVOIT was made a government executive agency in April, shortly before the general election. Mr Christopher Chope, then a junior transport minister, said that he hoped it would develop 'a more commercial style of operation . . . to pave the way for privatisation in a few years' time'. Immediately after the general election, a review was established into the method and timing of privatising DVOIT. The resulting report is now with ministers. A decision to proceed with privatisation much sooner than expected likely within days. With much of the government's IT work likely to be put out to tender in the next year, DVOIT would be the first of almost 80 government executive agencies to be privatised. Like other agencies, DVOIT has been encouraged to compete for new work to augment income. As long as it remains an agency, however, it cannot compete outside the public sector. 'If we are privatised, we would be able to compete just like any other company,' said Mr Tony Fitzgerald, DVOIT's business development manager. 'We are keen to get into new markets and with other government IT divisions likely to be privatised in the future, we would rather be at the forefront in getting the new business,' he said. The consultants who prepared the report are believed to have approached a number of companies in the private sector to see if they would be interested in buying the agency. Companies likely to bid for DVOIT include EDS-Scicon, Hoskyns and Sema.</p>

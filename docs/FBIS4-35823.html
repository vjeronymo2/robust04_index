			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Muhammad 'Abbas, secretary general of the </F> Palestine Liberation Front, by 'Imad al-Dik in Baghdad; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Dik] What is your opinion on the  agreements signed between the PLO and Israel?    ['Abbas] In principle, we oppose this plan, and we have  expressed our opposition through various means and in different  places, including the PLO institutions, the Executive Committee,  the Central Council, and the subsidiary institutions, and also  whenever we had an opportunity to criticize this plan or oppose  this agreement. This is because we view this agreement as a  relinquishment of the constant national principles in which we  believe and for which we have offered sacrifices. Our  Palestinian Arab people have paid a great price to achieve their  aspirations and objectives, which are much greater than the  maximum benefits offered by this agreement. This agreement does  not achieve even the minimum of our people's aspirations. It  was signed under circumstances in which the balance of power was  in favor of the enemy by all standards. In brief, when the  balance of power is in favor of the enemy, an agreement serving  the enemy's interest is the result. [passage omitted]    [Al-Dik] What are your future plans for dealing with the new  situation in view of the Israeli-Palestinian agreement?    ['Abbas] We confronted this agreement even before it was  signed. Now, instead of just rejecting the agreement we must  work so that this agreement does not turn into the end result of  the Palestinian struggle.    [Al-Dik] Do you believe that there is an agreement between  'Arafat and the Israelis on not releasing the detainees who  oppose the peace march?    ['Abbas] Israel has publicly declared this, so it does not  need an agreement. However, the PLO leadership, which  represents the Palestinian people, cannot sign such an agreement  because this leadership does not distinguish between  Palestinians and because it is duty-bound to protect the  Palestinian people. [passage omitted]    [Al-Dik] What will be the [Palestine Liberation] Front's  position on the Palestinian police if the latter confronts the  Front's elements who attack the Zionists?    ['Abbas] The Arab borders are wide, and so is the area on  which the Zionists are present. When we decide to fight the  enemy, we will certainly choose a way that will keep us away  from clashes with our people's sons in terms of the police and  security forces. We will also complete our march without  involving ourselves in a confrontation with any nationalist  Palestinian.    [Al-Dik] As a Front, was participation in the self-rule  authority offered to you?    ['Abbas] Yes, it was directly proposed to us in our capacity  as a part of the PLO. Our choice was to join the field  institutions that are directly concerned with our people's  situation in the self-rule areas. Participation in the  self-rule authority, however, was left for the future because it  will take a political decision by the organization's bodies. We  have not made a final decision on this issue, and we have  requested some time to consider it. The final decision,  however, will be made by the Front's leadership, although my  personal opinion is not to participate. [passage omitted]    [Al-Dik] Following the [Israeli-PLO] agreement, is it  possible that such agreements can end the state of animosity and  conflict with the Zionist enemy?    ['Abbas] Of course not. The current solution is fully in  line with the present situation, which is not a normal  situation. A solution that would end the conflict should  necessarily take into account the interests and rights of the  Palestinian and Arab peoples. I can see no current solution to  the conflict. However, I can see a form of truce imposed by the  influential world forces. The extent of these forces' influence  may perpetuate or shorten such a truce. [passage omitted]</p>

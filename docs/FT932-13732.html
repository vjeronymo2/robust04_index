			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major to hold TV press meetings MR JOHN Major is planning to hold occasional televised press conferences at Downing Street, which could possibly be broadcast live, Ralph Atkins writes. The prime minister's office said yesterday that Mr Major sees the move as a chance to get his message across more directly. However it stressed that they would not be held on a regular basis. Mr Major does not believe the 'bear pit' atmosphere of his twice-weekly Commons questions sessions allow for a calm explanation of his thinking. He is also instinctively wary of the lobby system of unattributable briefings and press conferences could be used particularly when the Commons is in recess. The prime minister's office also said yesterday that Mr Major wants to 'grab the agenda' on the development of the European Community after Maastricht in a series of speeches starting today. Britain has too often been forced into responding to an agenda set by the France-Germany alliance, an official said: 'We have been left rather dragging our heels.' Mr Major will develop his theme of an enlarged, free market European Community when he addresses the Conservative Group on Europe tonight - a meeting marking the 20th anniversary of Britain's entry into the EC.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vytautas Landsbergis, leader of the Motherland Union  -- the Lithuanian Conservative party -- held a press conference  at the Lithuanian Seimas today.    Landsbergis urged the Lithuanian officials to show  solidarity  with Latvia by making public statements, because of late Latvia  has become an object of repeated attacks by the Russian imperial  forces. Because of the circumstances which had developed, Latvia  is now the weakest link among the Baltic states. Having failed  to subordinate the entire region, Russia is making efforts to  split it by first of all becoming firmly established in Latvia  and later perhaps even to annex it, Landsbergis said at his  press conference.    Such a split in the strategic unity of the Baltic states  would also weaken Lithuania's security, he stressed. According  to Landsbergis, Lithuania should draw the attention of  international organizations, states, and heads of state to the  dangerous tendencies in Russia's policy towards Latvia. Several  points in this policy were singled out by the leader of the  opposition. First of all, this is most vividly manifested by  the delay and by the ever increasing conditions for the  withdrawal of the occupational troops from Latvia. Efforts are  made in order that some units of these troops would remain  deployed there. Another vivid feature of the aforementioned  policy is the allegedly existing problem to protect the  Russian-speaking population. Even the President of the United  States, who agreed to see that they were not discriminated  against, has been drawn into this propaganda network. The  situation is being depicted in such a way as though the Russians  in Latvia were a historically established minority the  discrimination against whom had currently begun, Landsbergis  said, at the same time drawing the attention to the fact that  this type of propoganda was also a warning to Lithuania.    According to Landsbergis, the Russian foreign minister  accuses Latvia and Estonia of being aggressive towards Russia  which is exactly what Russia itself is doing. In this way  attempts are made to establish firmly the right of force which  Russia was ready to use during the incident with its generals.  According to Landsbergis, the incident itself was inspired in  an attempt to compromise the volunteer force. It seems that a  the Russian military intelligence has been entrusted with a task  to destroy the volunteer force in the Baltic states, he stressed.    In turn, Landsbergis said, the Latvian Government is also  making concessions to the imperial designs of Russia. According  to him, the former stance adopted by the government was more  resolute. Probably Latvia has realized that it cannot expect  support from the West. Unfortunately, in this case we are  becoming very much like the West, Landsbergis, leader of the  Motherland's Union - Lithuanian Conservatives, stressed in  today's a press conference.</p>

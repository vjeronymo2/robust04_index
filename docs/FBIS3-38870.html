			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Trevor Mason, PRESS ASSOCIATION parliamentary chief </F> reporter]    [Text] The Prime Minister warned today that the United  Nations may need to use force, including air power, to carry out  its mandate in Bosnia.    But he stressed at Commons question time: "Ultimately peace  is only going to come at the negotiating table."    Challenged by Labour leader John Smith about the possible  use  of air strikes, Mr Major stressed that air power must only be  used for clear objectives.    Continued mortar and artillery attacks on Sarajevo could not  await an overall setlement.    "UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force], with support  from NATO, must apply immediate and strong pressure to halt  those attacks."    Mr Major also clashed with Liberal Democrat leader Paddy  Ashdown over Britain's response to the carnage in former  Yugoslavia.    He angrily told him to stop pretending "there is some easy,  magic and painless solution to a problem that is intensely  difficult."    The question of how to respond to the weekend market place  massacre in Sarajevo dominated the exchanges.    Mr Smith asked: "If no action is taken to protect the people  of Sarajevo from the pitiless shelling, aren't the Serbs bound  to conclude that no action will be taken against them, whatever  they do?"    Mr Major said UN troops were in Bosnia to help the civilian  population.    "The UN cannot end the civil war by force. That has never  been a feasible option," he insisted.    "Ultimately peace is only going to come at the negotiating  table."    "But I think the UN may need to use force for specific  purposes, to carry out its mandate and protect its own people in  Bosnia.    "It may need tactical air support from NATO. We have always  been prepared to see air power used for these purposes, provided  the commanders judge it appropriate."    Mr Major said: "I don't believe that we can wait for action  to follow an overall settlement.    "I don't believe it is right to tolerate the continued  mortar  and artillery attacks against the civilian population.    "UNPROFOR, with support from Nato, must apply immediate and  strong pressure to halt these attacks."    Mr Smith agreed that the civil war could not be ended by  military intervention but added: "Ought there not to be some  minimal objectives that we should set for ourselves?"    He said: "Surely it ought to be a political objective to  remove all the weapons within striking distance of Sarajevo,  under threat that if that is not done, air attacks will be  pursued."    Mr Major said NATO would meet tomorrow to consider "what  pressure can most effectively be applied and how."    He said: "It is certainly the case that if we use air power  we must be very clear about the objectives of that action.    "And the aim must be to reinforce pressure to end the  bombardment of Sarajevo."    Mr Major said the UN command must be able to set "clear and  specific conditions, knowing that tactical air support is  available if necessary in order to back them up."    Any use of force must be "forward looking," he said. "It  must  seek to improve the situation in Sarajevo and contribute to the  pressure on the parties to end the war."    Mr Major admitted: "These are not easy options in any way."    Decision-making must also take account of the importance of  the humanitarian effort, the safety of civilians and the safety  of soldiers carrying out the aid operation.    "These are the objectives NATO must consider tomorrow in  determining how to proceed."    Mr Smith asked if the Government would support an ultimatum  calling on the Serbs to withdraw "weapons of attack" from  striking distance of Sarejevo.    Mr Major pointed to the EU [European Union]'s foreign  affairs  council recommendation yesterday that the aim should be to bring  about the immediate lifting of the siege of Sarajevo "using all  the means necessary."    But he said foreign ministers had gone on to look to NATO to  carry forward the process -- a decision in line with views  expressed by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd.    Mr Ashdown, quoting Mr Major, welcomed the Prime Minister's  "new more muscular mood" on Bosnia.    But he said it was now four weeks "since you told us of your  determination to reopen Tuzla airport as soon as possible and  probably five weeks until the launching of the Serb spring  offensive aimed at obliterating what remains of Bosnia."    Mr Ashdown demanded: "Are you able to tell us yet of any  progress on opening Tuzla airport to which you have set your  hand?"    Mr Major said it was a matter under consideration by the UN  and NATO.    "It is not a unilateral matter for the British Government."    He said the UN and NATO were taking a very firm line on  Tuzla  airport, removing obstacles to humanitarian relief convoys and  lifting the siege of Sarajevo.    "These are important and difficult matters that are being  considered by commanders on the ground on a day to day basis."    But he told the Liberal Democrat leader: "I do wish you  would  cease, as you do so often, to pretend there is some easy, magic  and painless solution to a problem that is intensely difficult  for commanders on the ground and everybody concerned with the  operation.    "You have been consistent in one respect only. You have been  consistently wrong in every single course you have advocated  since this dreadful conflict began!"    Earlier Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind told the House  British troops would remain in Bosnia throughout the winter to  support the UN mandate.    Mr Rifkind, who returned today from a visit to former  Yugoslavia added: "No decisions have yet been taken about their  deployment thereafter."    He said: "All countries have to take account of the need to  ensure the safety of UN forces currently in Bosnia.    "We have to take into account the advice of military  commanders in Bosnia because they have an awesome  responsibility, which must be a very important factor in the  considerations that are under way."    He said every initiative had to be consistent with the need  to show political leadership and political will and sound  military judgment.    "If it is not so rooted, it will be a cruel deception on the  people it is designed to help."    Shadow defence secretary Dr David Clark called for Sarajevo  to be demilitarised. "The British Government should join in an  ultimatum to the Serbs ... that if they do not acceed to this  request, they face the consequences of air strikes."    Mr Rifkind said: "What we now have to consider is whether  action that might be taken will meet the various objectives we  have: continuation of aid, the need to try to influence the  behaviour of the Serbs and other factions and our obligation as  a national government to the protection of our own forces.    "It would be unwise to follow any initiative which put at  jeopardy these requirements."</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Rover cuts losses despite poor market ROVER GROUP, BAe's cars and Land Rover vehicles subsidiary, cut its first-half losses before interest from Pounds 43m to Pounds 31m, despite the savage recession in the UK new car market. Although most motor industry analysts expect UK sales to remain heavily depressed for the rest of this year, and at best a marginal recovery in 1993, BAe chairman Mr John Cahill said Rover would be in a position to 'come back very strongly' when the market showed an upturn. He emphasised BAe's intention to retain the Rover business - in which Honda of Japan has a 20 per cent stake - even after the embattled aerospace group becomes entitled to sell formerly UK state-owned Rover group from August next year. 'We have no plans to sell it; we are very happy with it, and its management has done an outstanding job with it,' declared Mr Cahill. The improvement in Rover's financial performance arose from continuing cost-cutting and productivity measures, and was achieved despite a reduction in turnover from Pounds 1.863bn to Pounds 1.651bn in the first six months. The efficiency improvements have reduced Rover's break-even to around 440,000 vehicles annually. The break-even position last year was around 495,000 vehicles, according to Mr George Simpson, BAe's deputy chief executive and Rover's chairman. This year's objective remains well above the informal target of 404,000 Rover had hoped to achieve by the end of 1992. The cost savings already achieved this year should have been sufficient to reach the lower level, said Mr Simpson. However, Rover has been blown off course by the fact that the much-predicted second half upturn in the UK car market failed to materialise. As a result, profit margins have been much reduced by the savage price war still raging in the marketplace. Nevertheless, the benefits of the productivity measures and cost cutting would continue to lower the break-even threshhold over the coming months, insisted Mr Simpson. Rover's first half unit sales totalled 202,000, with the second half expected to be 'little better', according to Mr Simpson. Some 45 per cent of first half sales were exports, mainly to the continental Europe. Because of the high UK content of its cars Rover's financial performance is also expected to be boosted by sterling's devaluation against continental currencies, following the pound's withdrawal from the ERM. 'Potentially, it will make a big difference', said Mr Simpson, who also expects the share of Rover's total sales taken by exports to rise slightly over the coming year. Rover's competitive position inside the UK should also be strengthened because of the much higher import content - whether cars or components - of main rivals Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot Talbot. While acknowledging that Rover still had some way to go to meet Japanese efficiency levels of 45 cars per man year, he said Rover's 35 was now 'a match for anyone in Europe', where the industry average is 30 cars a man year. BAe made clear yesterday that despite the problems elsewhere in the business, there would be no let-up in investment programmes at Rover, which involve spending of Pounds 200m in each of the next two years. Most of this would be financed by Rover itself.</p>

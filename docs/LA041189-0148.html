			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH BALKS AT CRITICISM OF D.C. MAYOR  </P> <P> The White House put some distance today between President Bush and drug policy  coordinator William J. Bennett's criticism of District of Columbia Mayor Marion  Barry Jr. and his handling of drug-related crime.  </P> <P> "We are in this to solve the drug problem, not to pick fights," said White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater when asked if Bush was ready to second  Bennett's criticism.  </P> <P> "This is a very serious problem that has to be worked out with the authorities  that were elected and charged with dealing with these problems," the  presidential spokesman said.  </P> <P> Asked if the President supports Bennett, Fitzwater replied, "Absolutely. He  supports everything Bennett says and does."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bennett's Contention Rejected  </P> <P> Barry said he welcomed the federal government's planned major drive on  drug-related crime in the capital but rejected Bennett's contention that his  Administration's poor performance made the intervention necessary.  </P> <P> Bennett's plan, announced Monday, calls for construction of pretrial detention  and prison facilities, expansion of a local law enforcement task force, efforts  to rid public housing of drug users and dealers, expansion of drug treatment  facilities and an increase in job training programs.  </P> <P> However, the D.C. government will receive no direct funding. Instead, Bennett  said, the effort's $70-million to $80-million estimated cost will come from  existing federal programs.  </P> <P> "I've said this as frankly as possible -- the local government has not acted in  as responsible a way as it should," Bennett said. "The plain fact is that, for  too long and in too many respects, the D.C. government has failed to serve its  citizens."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Under Federal Investigation  </P> <P> Barry, who is under federal investigation for his relationships with a  suspected cocaine dealer, went on NBC-TV's "Today" show this morning to defend  the local anti-drug effort.  </P> <P> "The D.C. government, I think, has been vigorous. We've had more people  arrested than any other city in America -- over 12,000 people in jail, getting  longer sentences."  </P></p>

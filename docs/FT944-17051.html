			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Eko Stahlaid will exceed DM1bn Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency yesterday confirmed it would grant more than DM1bn (Pounds 408m) in subsidies and investments to Eko Stahl, eastern Germany's largest steelmaker, in a deal which amounts to one of the largest single rescue packages for an east German company. However, officials from the Treuhand and from Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel producer that has bought a 60 per cent stake in Eko Stahl, said they expected the European Commission to question, if not block, the subsidies. 'Everything now hangs on Brussels,' a Cockerill official said, adding that the company expected to take over Eko Stahl next January. The remaining 40 per cent will be held by the agency. The Treuhand's rescue package has two elements: investment grants and financial assistance to cover current and future losses. The agency will provide investments and subsidies totalling DM275m, while a further DM385m will be provided by the federal government and Brandenburg state, where the mill is located. In addition the Treuhand has agreed to pick up losses of over DM220m which will occur between 1995 and 1997. It will also provide an extra DM480m for compensating losses made by Eko Stahl when its markets in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union collapsed after German unification in 1990. Eko Stahl is expected to make losses of more than DM100m this year on a turnover of DM1bn more than DM100m. A further DM39m will be allocated to the local infrastructure. The Treuhand drew up the final subsidy and investment package at the weekend after Cockerill agreed to invest DM440m in modernising Eko Stahl's existing blast furnace and building a new hot-rolling mill. Cockerill will also guarantee about 2,300 jobs. Eko Stahl currently employs more than 2,900 people, nearly a quarter less than in 1990.</p>

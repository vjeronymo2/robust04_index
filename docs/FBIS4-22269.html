			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Yefimov, candidate of historical </F> sciences: "Russia's Shuttle Diplomacy"]    [Text] It seemed that the Hebron tragedy had, if not  aborted, thrown back the peace process. But the urgent efforts  of Moscow have saved peace in the Near East.    The tragedy in Hebron on 25 February brought about a pause  in  a Near East settlement. The negotiations and, together with  them, the hopes for an end to the most inveterate conflict in  the Near East also were broken off. But Igor Ivanov, first  deputy Russian minister of foreign affairs, set off on 27  February for Tunis, where the PLO has its headquarters, and then  to Israel also. Andrey Kozyrev was in daily telephone contact  with the Palestinian and the Israeli leadership.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation  issued several decisive statements on the Near East, which  express new ideas for an acceleration of the reconciliation of  the Arabs and the Israelis. Viktor Posuvalyuk, special  representative of the president of Russia for a Near East  settlement, flew to see Yasir Arafat on 7 March. And on 11-12  March, Minister Andrey Kozyrev himself visited Tunisia and  Israel with messages from President Yeltsin, conducting  intensive negotiations with the leadership of the PLO and  Israel. And the outcome--Yasir Arafat has declared his readiness  to return to the negotiating table. Russia has rescued,  apparently, a seemingly hopeless situation.  <H5>  Idle Fuss </H5>   Following Moscow's successful demarche in the Bosnian  conflict, which made it possible not only to avert a NATO  military operation against the Serbs, but also to stabilize  considerably the situation in Bosnia, the world once again began  to talk about Russia as a great power whose legitimate interests  could not be ignored. At the same time, on the other hand,  arguments concerning new rivalry between the Russian Federation  and the United States and Moscow's imperial ambitions were set  in motion. And when Russian diplomacy intervened just as  energetically in surmounting the crisis in the Arab-Israeli  negotiations, it came to be argued in places that Russia had  intruded into a sphere of vitally important American interests  and had displayed "inordinate independence."    It is forgotten here that, first, Moscow and Washington  operate, in accordance with the mandate of the Madrid Peace  Conference, on an equal basis as co-sponsors of the Arab-Israeli  negotiations; second, the Near East region is for Russia no  less, and even more, important than for the United States,  considering its direct geographical proximity to the southern  borders of the Russian state; and third and finally, the efforts  of Russian diplomacy were geared to the salvation of the peace  process in the region, which more than corresponds to the  Americans' interests.    Why the United States was this time unable to achieve what  the Russians achieved, displaying on this occasion a strange  passiveness in mediation, is another matter. Not Moscow's fault  but Washington's dereliction consisted in the Americans'  dragging out the adoption of an effective UN Security Council  resolution guaranteeing a nonrecurrence of the Hebron tragedy.  After all, one further such incident, and the file of the Madrid  process may be closed. And it is by no means in the interests of  either the Arabs or Israel to bury the 30 months of efforts of  the complex and, at times, dramatic dialogue.  <H5>  New Ideas </H5>   The essence of the Russian proposals expressed since Hebron  amounts to the quite simple, but very ample format: 1) the  peaceful Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza  obtains international guarantees of security under the  conditions of occupation up to the final resolution of all  problems, primarily via the dispatch of international observers;  2) soundings are made concerning the possibility of the  convening of a second plenary session of the Madrid Conference;  3) the Arabs and the Israelis resume negotiations, and, first  and foremost, the PLO and Israel accelerate realization of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement.    It was the first two points that were given a guarded  reception by the United States and part of the Israeli  Government. Their allergy to the proposal concerning the  organization of Madrid-2 was particularly strong. For some  reason or other, some prominent politicians in these two  countries considered that Russia had conceived a desire to  substitute for the present form of negotiations new ones, at  which international patronage would prevail over direct  bilateral dialogue.    But the explanations of the Russian diplomats dispelled all  misgivings, with Yitzhak Rabin included: Two years and six  months have elapsed since the Madrid Conference, and entirely  new factors, of an extra-negotiation character included, are  operating, and it would for this reason be better to evaluate  collectively the path that has been covered, ascertaining its  positive and negative aspects, and on the basis of a thorough  analysis determining the prospects of development of the peace  process for the future. After all, it is now sufficiently clear  that the Madrid formula has worked positively for the  Palestinians and the Jordanians, but has proven unproductive for  the Syrians and the Lebanese.    Disputes arose also over how to guarantee the security of  the  Palestinian population. Moscow proposed a flexible option:  Inasmuch as Israel has a negative attitude toward a UN  "umbrella," the role of aegis of international presence could be  performed by the two co-sponsors, with the enlistment of the  countries that both the Israelis and the Palestinians find  suitable. It was on this issue that Russia needed the support of  the Americans, who skirted the demands of the Palestinians in  silence, which evoked the accusation against Washington on the  part of the Arabs of one-sided sympathy for Israel.    Ultimately, the Russian plan for stimulation of a Near East  settlement was approved by both Israel and the PLO--as a result  of the lightning visit of A. Kozyrev, both parties agreed that  Russia and the United States should be the guarantors of the  security of the Palestinian population of the West Bank and Gaza  and that a second session of the Madrid Conference could be very  productive for imparting new international impetus to the peace  process. On 12 March, Yasir Arafat, leader of the PLO, after  negotiations with the Russian minister, gave his long-awaited  consent to a return to the negotiating table. Also interesting  is the fact that the Russian minister of foreign affairs brought  the Palestinian leader from Jerusalem additional concessions of  the Israeli Government, which were so much needed for a  resumption of the peace process.    As far, however, as the talk about Russian-American rivalry  in the Near East is concerned, it was conclusively buried at the  meeting of the minister of foreign affairs of the Russian  Federation and the U.S. secretary of state in Vladivostok on 14  March, at which both sides confirmed their intention to continue  to jointly advance an all-embracing and lasting peace between  the Arabs and the Israelis.  <H5>  What Next? </H5>   Nonetheless, there are no grounds for undue optimism as yet.  The Palestinian unrest on the occupied territories continues,  and, consequently, people continue to die. Islamic extremists  are threatening vengeance for the tragedy in Hebron. Radical  Palestinian groupings are putting pressure on Arafat to  terminate the negotiations with the "Zionist enemy." Iran, where  large demonstrations of solidarity with the Palestinian  fundamentalists are taking place, is adding fuel to the fire.    The Yitzhak Rabin government is in a difficult position  also.  The Israeli Labor Party members have made many good-will  gestures and have accommodated a substantial part of the  manifestly overstated demands of the PLO. This has given rise to  the incitement of an atmosphere of hysteria by forces of the  right, which are attempting to split Israeli society and  stimulate the anti-Arab mood in the country. It is now sensed  more than ever that the governing coalition is being torn  between the firm intention to achieve peace agreements with the  Arab countries as soon as possible and the entirely justified  need to ensure the security of the state of Israel. It is  perfectly obvious that a hand of friendship from outside needs  to be extended to Rabin at the present difficult moment, and the  Arabs should be doing this also. However bitter their feeling  following the act of vandalism at Hebron's Al-Ibrahimiyyah  Mosque, it should be understood that an Israeli Government made  up of the political opponents of the Labor Party would never  agree to the compromises that Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres  have made. In the interests of a future peace, it is essential  now to be guided by pragmatic considerations.    Something else is clear also--as long as Israel controls the  occupied Arab territories, its army must guarantee the security  of all its inhabitants more dependably. It would be expedient  for this even now to begin negotiations on the status of the  settlements, where the most extremist Israeli groupings  frequently find refuge. Nor can the settlers be permitted to  freely roam around the Palestinian localities with weapons,  inasmuch as this could provoke new bloody outbursts. But the  most important thing, which would make it possible to knock back  the escalation of tension and instill confidence in the  successful outcome of the peace negotiations, is the immediate  fulfillment of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. Having hoisted the  PLO flag on their land, the Palestinians would really sense the  first fruits of peaceful cohabitation with the Israelis. It is  essential here to seek in parallel tangible progress in other  areas of the negotiations also. Only then will a favorable  background for the accomplishment of the tasks outlined in  Madrid back in 1991 have been created.</p>

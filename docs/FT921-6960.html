			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics (Campaign Profile): Preacher turned party propagandist CHRIS PATTEN is a thoroughly nice man who has become a thoroughly nasty politician. A year ago, the Conservative party chairman chose the now-defunct Marxism Today as the vehicle for his vision of moderate post-Thatcherite Conservatism. Now he spends his time shining a torch on ageing reds under Labour beds. His enemies (and it is only recently that the numbers in the Labour party have outstripped those on the Tory right) declare that a once affable, intelligently irreverent approach to politics has been subsumed in tawdry ambition. Friends (and there are still plenty) talk of a purely temporary transformation. No chairman fighting the toughest general election since 1974 could avoid getting his hands dirty. 'It's a bloody awful job and I can't imagine he is enjoying it,' says a soulmate. But if Chris (as everyone calls him) returns to an appropriately senior cabinet post after the election, the old, tolerant, intellectualism will reassert itself. Mr Major's appointment of the 47-year-old MP for Bath to the chairmanship of the party infuriated the dispossessed right of his party. Here was the author of The Tory Case - the sharpest critique of Thatcherism produced from her own side during the 1980s - charged with winning for Mr Major the fourth election victory which she had been so cruelly denied. Within weeks, Mr Patten was living up to their worst fears - providing a political rhetoric which distanced the prime minister from his predecessor and, horror of horrors, cuddling up to German Christian Democracy. That, though, was back in the days when it seemed that, with a new leader and a softer focus, the Conservatives had to wait only for the tide of economic recovery to carry them back to power. Now they have a real fight on their hands. To win they must discredit the Labour alternative. To opposition cries of 'hypocrite' Mr Patten has deserted the high ground of political philosophy for the mud of negative campaigning. The serious thinker now turns out the sort of racy propaganda that can embarrass even his clients at the Tory tabloids. Early most mornings, he can be found hosting a ministerial press conference from behind a long, shocking blue platform at Conservative central office. Bleary-eyed journalists look on slightly bemused as the party chairman charts the horrors which await them under Labour. There is the 'tax bombshell' which would rob every family of at least Pounds 1,000 a year of their income and then raid their savings. There are the handcuffs which lock Mr Neil Kinnock to his union paymasters. Then there are the secret CND sympathisers who would leave Britain defenceless in the face of whatever has replaced the Soviet threat. We do not have to take Mr Patten's word for it. Every charge is documented minutely in a torrent of research papers which might have extracted a sizeable chunk from the Brazilian rain forest which he is so committed to saving. Opposition leaders are quoted to show how frequently they have changed their minds, underpinning the theme: 'You can't trust Labour.' It is slick and professional. It looks as if it has cost an awful lot of money. Chris makes no excuses for the campaign, designed by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in a style that can best be described as late 1970s brutalist. Nor can Labour claim that the charges are more extravagant than their own - Mr Major does not want to privatise the National Health Service, for example. Mr Patten's central assertion is that for all its slick public relations respectability, Labour's instincts remain rooted in the discredited statism which the rest of the world has abandoned. His aim is to get across to the voters the fundamental 'dishonesty' of a strategy which promises to shower money on public services yet put up the taxes of only a wealthy minority. The sums do not add up. It is entirely legitimate to question a commitment to the 'market' if at nearly every mention it is qualified by the word 'failure'. Then there are the unions and the left. Mr Norman Willis and Mr Tony Benn might seem harmless eccentrics as long as the Conservatives are in government. But they would extract their dues if Labour scraped into power. The sub-text is obvious. Mr Major has proved himself an honest, open and consistent leader. You see what you get. Mr Kinnock is shifty, opportunist. He could easily change his mind again. All this, of course, has to be conveyed to the voters in easily-digestible 'sound-bites' which cannot avoid occasional hyperbole. So Mr Patten, best known for the elegant erudition with which he writes and lectures, has adapted his linguistic talents to the cause of abusive alliteration. He still gives the occasional serious speech. One came a few months ago in the shape of a sermon on 'Politics and the Kingdom of God' delivered from a Cambridge pulpit. He has not, it seems, changed his basic political outlook. Labour's 'hat-trick of horrors' was replaced by a considered defence of the 'socially responsible market economy'. His conclusion explained why some around the cabinet table still describe him as a 'bit of a leftie'. The market could not be an end in itself. It was not certain to produce 'socially favourable consequences'. It had to be constrained. A sense of community was necessary to inject fairness into economic relationships. There were concepts not easily 'priced'. Such sentiments should be reflected in the Tory manifesto. Mr Patten has a central role in drafting Mr Major's alternative to the conviction politics of his predecessor. The final product will sit much more easily alongside The Tory Case than any of the manifestos he wrote for Mrs Thatcher. Back at the morning press conferences, the occasional wry smile reinforces the suspicion that Mr Patten does indeed prefer the pulpit to the central office platform, political philosophy to propaganda. 'He may be behaving like Norman Tebbit but he hasn't become him,' offers a friend. For now, though, he has chosen to worship at the temple of Essex Man. It causes some of his friends discomfort. One observes sadly that it is rather as if the Pope (of whose church Mr Patten remains a devout member) were caught pulling the wings from a fly.</p>

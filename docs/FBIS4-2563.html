			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng and visiting Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva  today pledged that they will make joint efforts to further  strengthen friendly bilateral ties and promote good cooperation  on the issue of Macao.    The two premiers expressed the pledge during their talks at  the Great Hall of the People here this morning.    Li said that relations between the two countries have  developed smoothly since they established diplomatic ties 15  years ago.    Especially over the past few years, he added, the exchange  of  visits between high-ranking officials of the two countries has  increased and the bilateral relationship has been growing.    Li said China places great importance on its economic  relations and trade with Portugal on the basis of equality and  mutual benefit and will send a purchasing group to Portugal at  an appropriate time.    Extending his warm welcome to Portuguese entrepreneurs who  are accompanying the prime minister on the visit, Li said it is  his hope that industrialists and businessmen of the two  countries will have wide contacts and explore various ways for  cooperation, to enable bilateral trade to rise by a big margin  and expand the scale of bilateral economic cooperation.    Praising the fruitful cooperation between China and Portugal  on the issue of Macao, Li said the Macao society is stable and  its economy is growing steadily. The residents of Macao have  full confidence in its future, he said.    The facts demonstrate that earnestly implementing the Sino-  Portuguese Joint Declaration conforms to the interests of the  two countries and cooperation benefits them both.    He expressed the belief that so long as the two sides, as  always, act in accordance with the spirit of friendly  consultation, various issues concerning the transitional period  of Macao can be properly settled and Macao can realize a stable  transition and smooth transfer of power in 1999.    Silva said he was very pleased to have the chance to revisit  China on the occasion of the 7th anniversary of the signing of  the Portugal-China Joint Declaration on the question of Macao.    He expressed the hope that this visit will give impetus to  the smooth implementation of the joint declaration and promote  the growth of bilateral relations.    Silva said the Portuguese Government consistently attaches  great importance to its relations with China. He has brought a  large delegation of entrepreneurs with him to China, which he  said vividly shows that the Portuguese Government and  entrepreneurs have sincere aspirations for and are eager to  develop Portugal-China economic ties and trade.    He said the Portuguese Government and people pay great  attention to the question of Macao and are looking attentively  at Macao's future and stability.    "What we are gratified at is that the two countries have had  very good cooperation on the question of Macao in the spirit of  friendly trust.    "The joint declaration is being implemented smoothly, which  gives us full confidence in Macao's future," he said.    On international issues, Li said that after the end of the  Cold War, the world people's demands for the establishment of a  new international political and economic order has daily become  stronger.    This is the need of the times and also the inevitable result  of the development of the international situation, he said.    Li said the new world order should be based on the five  principles of peaceful co-existence. Countries, big or small,  strong or weak, rich or poor, all have the right to be involved  in international affairs and can make their due contributions to  this end.    He said international affairs should not be decided by one  or  several big powers in the world. Therefore China supports the  current world trend toward multipolarization.    The Chinese premier said China attaches great importance to  developing its ties with European countries, adding: "We have no  conflicts of interests and our economies are mutually  complementary and have great potential."    He said China thanks Portugal for its support of the  resumption of China's status as a signatory party to the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    During the talks, Li recalled with pleasure his visit to  Portugal in February 1992.    Silva invited Li Peng to visit Portugal again and the  Chinese  premier expressed his thanks and accepted the invitation with  pleasure.    Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and  visiting Portuguese Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso  participated in the talks.    After the talks the two premiers attended a ceremony for  signing a framework loan agreement between the Bank of China and  the National Overseas Bank of Portugal (Banco Nacional  Ultramarino).    According to the agreement, the Portuguese bank will provide  the Bank of China with a credit line of 200 million U.S. dollars.    This is the first instrument of credit between the banks of  the two countries and also the largest credit agreement signed  between the two countries.    This evening, Li Peng hosted a banquet here in honor of  Silva  and his wife and their party.</p>

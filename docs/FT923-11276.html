			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage rates threat remains - Societies may have no option but to increase them eventually THE possibility of a mortgage rate increase in two or three months has not gone away, even though building society rates look set to stay around 10.75 per cent for the rest of the summer. The government's decision on Monday to heed protests and reduce interest paid on the National Savings First Option bond came just in time. Alliance &amp; Leicester and Abbey National were within hours of announcing rate increases in line with the proposed Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester increase from 10.75 per cent to 10.99. Had they moved, other societies certainly would have followed. C&amp;G responded by withdrawing its proposal. But trimming the interest paid on the National Savings bond, introduced on July 7, does not solve the lenders' problems. If the squeeze on their funding goes on, the societies will have to offer investors more attractive rates. They can do this only do if they put up their mortgage rates. In June, a month before the new bond was launched, Pounds 314m flowed out of the societies. Meanwhile, disgruntled borrowers might bear two things in mind. The first is that the 10.7 per cent rate prevailing in the market now is, effectively, a discounted rate. It dates back to February when the larger lenders moved their rates down, expecting the banks' base rate to drop soon afterwards. Since then, they have kept their mortgage rate about 0.7 percentage points above base rate. Yet, historically, mortgage lenders normally have pitched their rates at around 1 or 1.25 percentage points above the base rate. The second point will probably not have to be spelt out to anyone who has a mortgage from one of the centralised lenders rather than a building society. For the past four years, they have consistently charged their mortgage customers more than the building societies, but the gap between their interest rates and those of the societies is wider than ever just now. Where centralised lenders are concerned, you can forget about your rate being 10.7 or 10.99 per cent. With a few exceptions, most mortgage companies charge rates well above 11 per cent to existing customers. Bank of Ireland Home Mortgages, Bear Stearns and UCB Home Loans all charge 11.5 per cent or more. Household Mortgage Corporation, Citibank Mortgages, BNP Mortgages, Legal &amp; General Mortgage Services and Mortgage Trust levy rates between 11 and 11.45 per cent. There are some exceptions to these high rates. Credit Agricole, the Mortgage Corporation, the Mortgage Business and Britannia Central Lending charge 10.99 per cent. This is, of course, equivalent to the proposed C&amp;G rate. C&amp;G Guardian, which was a building society in its own right until 2 1/2 years ago and is a centralised lender subsidiary of C&amp;G, charges 11 per cent (although why anyone should go to a subsidiary and pay more than they would do if they went to its parent is a mystery). Centralised lenders offered several explanations this week for their high rates. None seems entirely satisfactory. Their first excuse is that only their existing customers pay them. New customers are wooed with discounts, special offers, and other enticements which make the rates they pay in the first year or two of a mortgage comparable with those of the building societies. The second line of defence is that the building societies are out of step with the market and are charging too little for their mortgages. 'If the societies choose not to charge a commercial rate for their business, that is not our affair,' one centralised lender told me. That begs the basic question. With the banks' base rate at 10 per cent, a mortgage interest rate of 10.7 per cent might look a shade underpriced - but a mortgage rate of 11.55 per cent is distinctly overpriced. Over the past three years, the centralised lenders, as well as charging higher interest, have been consistently tougher on customers who get into payment difficulties than the building societies. These facts should be borne in mind by anyone thinking of entering the housing market now.</p>

Douglas R. Turner, 38, entered the plea in U.S. District  Court in Denver as part of an agreement that called for three other theft  counts to be dropped. Prosecutors say Turner used a government computer to  transfer about $1 million from the HUD Section 8 rent-subsidy program to the  bank account of a real estate company he owned.  </P></p>

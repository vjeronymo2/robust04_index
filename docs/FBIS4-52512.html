			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 11 KYODO -- The head of an employers'  association said Wednesday [11 May] the ongoing restructuring of  business operations at Japanese firms would inevitably result in  a temporary increase in unemployment.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), told a news conference it is  not easy to carry out corporate reorganization without reducing  jobs in view of the serious business environment caused by the  strong yen. He said employers have so far done their best to  prevent an increase of unemployment.    The strong yen has caused a serious impact on corporate  performance, particularly in the raw materials industry, he  said. Nagano expressed hope that the dollar will rise to around  105 yen.</p>

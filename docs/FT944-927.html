			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / World Trade News: EU clears trade round European Union ministers yesterday formally cleared the Uruguay Round trade accord for ratification, rubber stamping a decision taken earlier this week, writes Emma Tucker in Brussels. The move allows the EU to send the necessary papers to Geneva on December 30, meeting an end-of-year deadline allowing Gatt's successor, the World Trade Organisation, to be set-up on January 1, 1995. Commission officials are confident all member states will have completed ratification in national parliaments by December 30. One said that by this weekend only Portugal, Spain and Greece would still have to complete the domestic approval process. The package includes tariff cuts on industrial and farm goods by an average of over 35 per cent.</p>

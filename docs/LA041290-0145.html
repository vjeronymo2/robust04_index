			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PETA SUES WRITER OF MAGAZINE STORY IT CALLS 'FALSE . . . MALICIOUS'  </P> <P> People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals contend the biomedical community  has hit below the belt in a recent article in Washingtonian magazine about PETA  founder Alex Pacheco, whose 1981 expose of conditions at a Silver Spring, Md.,  research lab led to the facility's losing its federal funding.  </P> <P> A story in the February issue alleges, among other things, that Pacheco staged  photographs used as evidence in the Silver Spring lab case, and that PETA has  used funds for purposes that violate the organization's status as a nonprofit,  tax-exempt charitable group.  </P> <P> The 16-page article, titled "Beyond Cruelty," was written by free-lancer Katie  McCabe, a former English teacher who -- the magazine made a point of noting in  a biographical box -- has made 18 speeches to scientific groups on the subject  of animal rights for which she has received a total of $6,000 in honorariums.  </P> <P> The article created a considerable stir on Capitol Hill and is being used by  animal rights opponents across the country -- particularly those in the medical  community -- to help make their case against the movement.  </P> <P> "I expect backlash, but I didn't expect it to be (so) dirty. I didn't expect  outright lies," said Ingrid Newkirk, a former chief of animal disease control  for the District of Columbia who co-founded PETA with Pacheco and serves as its  national director.  </P> <P> PETA has filed a $3-million lawsuit against McCabe in District of Columbia  Superior Court, charging the writer with writing "false, defamatory and  malicious statements" and with "malicious intent" to damage PETA's reputation.  </P> <P> One of the photographs in question is of a macaque monkey named Domitian, who  is shown hanging from clamps with his head pulled back and arms and legs  outstretched in a lab restraining chair. The picture has been used in posters  and other publicity material widely distributed by PETA and has become  something of a movement icon of animal suffering at the hands of scientific  researchers.  </P> <P> Pacheco, who gained admittance to the lab by taking a job there as an assistant  and going in alone at night to document the abuse of the monkeys used in a  study of spinal-cord injuries, contends the photograph of Domitian was taken  during a routine experiment.  </P> <P> He also maintains that the allegations of financial misconduct in the article  relied on two anonymous sources, both of whom are disgruntled former PETA  employees who were "fired for cause."  </P> <P> "I believe time will show that Ms. McCabe's article was part of an attempt by  those under siege for wrongdoing and heinous cruelties . . . to distract the  public and the Congress from the pursuit of overdue reforms by trading in lies  and distortions," Pacheco said in testimony before the House Subcommittee on  Health and the Environment, which had the article included in its hearing  record on a bill to stiffen penalties for lab break-ins and the like authored  by the committee chairman, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) DAVID TREADWELL  </P></p>

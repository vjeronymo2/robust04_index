			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL WORK FOR PROGRESS IN CHINA, EXILED FANG SAYS  </P> <P> Fang Lizhi, China's most prominent dissident, said Tuesday that he will  continue to work for progress in his homeland as he returns to an academic life  in Britain.  </P> <P> Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, arrived in London after Chinese authorities  Monday allowed them to leave their yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing.  </P> <P> The couple had been in the embassy since shortly after the June 3-4, 1989,  military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in Beijing, in which hundreds  and perhaps thousands of people were killed.  </P> <P> "As citizens of China, we hope to do whatever we can in the future to help  China's continuing progress and development," Fang said in a statement issued  Tuesday through the Royal Society in London. He did not meet with journalists.  </P> <P> The society, one of the country's oldest and most prestigious scientific  organizations, invited the 54-year-old astrophysicist to Britain. Fang will be  a senior visiting fellow at Cambridge University's Institute of Astronomy.  </P> <P> A Foreign Office official who met Fang and Li when they landed at Upper  Heyford, a U.S. air base 60 miles west of London, said they were "tired but  cheerful."  </P> <P> Fang's statement said he and his wife were looking forward to a few days of  quiet to "rest and recuperate, and to have some medical tests."  </P> <P> U.S. media reports said Fang recently suffered an apparent mild heart attack  but refused to be treated in a Chinese hospital.  </P> <P> "The past year has been difficult for us, but we have received strong support  from the international scientific community and friends everywhere," the  statement said.  </P> <P> "My wife and I would also like to express our heartfelt appreciation to  President Bush, Ambassador (James) Lilley, and the staff at the U.S. Embassy in  Beijing."  </P> <P> China's decision to allow the couple to leave eliminated a major obstacle to  better relations with the West.  </P> <P> Fang and Li, a physicist, have two sons. Fang Ke is a student at Wayne State  University in Detroit and the other, Fang Zhe, a student at Beijing University.  </P> <P> "We understand that our son in China will be soon be able to study abroad, and  we are naturally looking forward to a family reunion," Fang said in the  statement.  </P></p>

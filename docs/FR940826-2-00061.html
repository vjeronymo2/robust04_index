			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By petition filed August 5, 1994, applicants sought approval of a protective order to protect confidential, highly confidential, and proprietary information, including contract terms, shipper-specific traffic data, and other traffic data to be submitted in connection with the control application. A protective order was approved in a decision served August 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also on August 5, 1994, applicants filed a petition to establish a procedural schedule. The Commission seeks comments now on applicants' proposed procedural schedule. Applicants' proposed procedural schedule is as follows: <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to submitting an original and 20 copies of all documents filed with the Commission, the parties are encouraged to submit all pleadings and attachments as computer data contained on a 3.5-inch floppy diskette which is formatted for WordPerfect 5.1 (or formatted so that it can be converted by WordPerfect 5.1). The computer data contained on the computer diskettes submitted are subject to the protective order attached to the Commission's decision served August 12, 1994, and this information is for the exclusive use of Commission employees working directly on review of substantive matters in this proceeding. The flexibility provided by such computer file data will facilitate expedited review by the Commission and its staff.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Procedural Schedule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> F&blank;Primary application filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+30&blank;Commission notice of acceptance of primary application published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+75&blank;Comments on primary application (except DOJ, DOT) due, including first list of protective conditions or other affirmative relief to be sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+90&blank;DOJ, DOT comments on primary application due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+105&blank;Second lists of protective conditions due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+120&blank;Responsive applications due; opposition to primary application due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+150&blank;Commission notice of acceptance of responsive applications published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+180&blank;Government parties' evidence due; opposition to responsive applications due; rebuttal with respect to primary application due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+205&blank;Responses to government parties' evidence due; rebuttal in support of responsive applications due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+220 to F+225&blank;Hearing on all evidence; witnesses to be cross-examined only to the extent specific need is shown in order to resolve material issues of disputed fact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+246&blank;Opening briefs due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+256&blank;Reply briefs due.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+270&blank;Oral argument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F+365&blank;Final decision. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposal, immediately upon each evidentiary filing, the filing party will place all documents relevant to the filing (other than documents that are privileged or otherwise protected from discovery) in a depository open to all parties, and will make its witnesses available for discovery depositions. Access to documents subject to protective order will be appropriately restricted. Parties seeking discovery depositions may proceed by agreement. Relevant excerpts of transcripts will be received in lieu of cross-examination at the hearing, unless cross-examination is needed to resolve material issues of disputed fact. Discovery on responsive applications will begin immediately upon their filing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed schedule contains substantially shorter time periods than those provided for in our rules at 49 CFR 1180.4(a)&hyph;(e). For example, &sect;1180.4(e) tracks the statute at 49 U.S.C. 11345(b)(3) and requires that the evidentiary proceedings for a major transaction be completed in 24 months after acceptance of the primary application, with a final decision to be issued within 180 days thereafter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We invite interested persons to submit written comments on the proposed procedural schedule. Comments must be filed by September 12, 1994. Applicants may reply by September 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Decided: August 22, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> By the Commission, Chairman McDonald, Vice Chairman Phillips, and Commissioners Simmons and Morgan.

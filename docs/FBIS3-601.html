Informed sources say the attack took place  near Gamalakhe Township.    Earlier the IFP refused to allow members of the AWB  [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] to join the march. The AWB  members said they had gone to Port Shepstone to support Zulu  King Zwelithini's demand for a sovereign kingdom and the Freedom  Alliance's constitutional demands. Thousands of Zulus continued  the march without the AWB members.    The group of protesters handed over a memorandum to the  South  African Police at Port Shepstone, supporting King Zwelithini's  intercession in the negotiating process. Chief Khawula handed  in the memorandum on behalf of the South Coast Zulu leaders. He  said Zulus would never accept a flawed constitution. He said  that not only did they reject the constitution, but they would  actively resist it.</p>

			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMAZING DISGRACE;  </P> <P> JIM BAKKER'S NOW BATTLING NOT ONLY WITH THE LAW BUT TO KEEP A GRIP ON REALITY  </P> <P> When Jim Bakker is having a problem and is called before the government, that  is Christianity being called before the government. That is the Body of  Christ's problem.  </P> <P>  -- Jim Bakker in his 1980 book, "Survival: Unite to Live"  </P> <P> Nine years ago in the same book where he equated himself with an entire  religion, PTL founder Jim Bakker wrote of a premonition. He believed that  "God's clock is in the final hour," meaning that the world would end soon.  </P> <P> He may have been right -- but not in the way he intended.  </P> <P> Thursday Bakker was on the precipice of a personal Armageddon that forced a  halt to his media-saturated trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.  Bakker, whose PTL television ministry once had the potential to reach a billion  people, was ordered to undergo psychiatric testing to see if he is mentally  competent to stand trial, after he apparently became hallucinatory and  irrational. The order by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter suspending the trial  in its fourth day came after Bakker's psychiatrist testified that the  televangelist, 49, suffered hallucinations and "was lying in the corner of his  attorney's office with his head under a couch, hiding."  </P> <P> "He was expressing thoughts that someone was going to hurt him," Dr. Basil  Jackson testified in a brief competency hearing in Judge Potter's court  Thursday morning.  </P> <P> Federal marshals led a crying Bakker from his attorney's office shortly after  the order was issued. "Please don't do this to me," Bakker pleaded before  crawling into the waiting car and assuming a fetal position. He was taken to  the federal courthouse here for paper-work processing and was led, crying and  disheveled, out of the building some 90 minutes later in handcuffs.  </P> <P> Jackson, a Milwaukee psychoanalyst, said Bakker's hallucinations began  Wednesday after a prosecution witness collapsed while being cross-examined.  </P> <P> "Mr. Bakker reported that when he left the courthouse, suddenly people outside  took on the form of frightening animals which he felt were intent on destroying  him, attacking him and hurting him," Jackson said. After the witness had  collapsed, Bakker, prompted by his attorney, went to the witness' side, knelt  down and began to pray.  </P> <P> The psychiatrist also said that Bakker was suffering from "acute depression"  and had "lost the ability to judge and evaluate reality." Bakker apparently was  continuing to hallucinate Thursday morning when he was persuaded not to appear  in court because "he was not able to participate in a rational manner in these  proceedings."  </P> <P> Jackson, who testified that he has been treating Bakker for about nine months,  was present in court last week, ostensibly to advise Bakker's attorneys during  jury selection.  </P> <P> Federal marshals indicated that psychiatric tests would not be completed before  Tuesday or Wednesday. Potter recommended that the tests be conducted at a  psychiatric hospital that is part of a federal prison in Butner, N.C., about  140 miles northeast of here.  </P> <P> When he headed the PTL network, Bakker exercised power over millions with his  emotional, often tearful, appeals. His sense of drama and staging brought PTL  from backwoods obscurity to national and, ultimately, international prominence  before the electronic ministry collapsed.  </P> <P> Before he was forced to resign from PTL in 1987, Bakker reigned over Heritage  USA, a gigantic theme park, resort and ministry headquarters that included  hotels, a shopping center and PTL's state-of-the-art TV studios and satellite  broadcast links. It was Bakker's need for luxury and television time, the  government charges, that led him to divert donations earmarked for construction  at Heritage to PTL's operating expenses and to his own pocket.  </P> <P> Bakker's current, bargain-basement teleministry, based in Orlando, Fla., is  carried by only eight television stations, in contrast to the hundreds that  once beamed PTL programming into millions of homes.  </P> <P> The Bakkers' overall circumstances are a comedown of interstellar proportions,  too. And that fall from the heights seems to have put a strain on both. Lately,  Tammy Faye Bakker -- who has not been present at the trial and who taped a  program for broadcast Thursday -- has been issuing emotional pleas for  contributions to her husband's legal defense fund, claiming that they owe  lawyers about $1 million. At its height, PTL -- which means Praise the Lord and  People that Love -- brought in $100 million a year in donations, defense  attorney George T. Davis said in his opening argument.  </P> <P> Bakker's apparent mental collapse underscores concerns expressed before the  trial began here Monday that Bakker was in a fragile state of mind. Moreover,  court records, the testimony that had been presented against the television  evangelist and his own behavior, indicate that the former high-flying head of  PTL is a man who lived grandiose dreams but denied his own nightmares.  </P> <P> In fact, denial or avoidance of hard realities was a Bakker hallmark.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, for instance, Bakker's former personal assistant David  Taggart testified that when Bakker got bad news of any sort he "would turn  around and look out" his office window, refusing to respond to the bearer of  bad tidings. On the telephone, Bakker's silences could stretch up to 10 minutes  when unwelcome information was passed along, Taggart noted.  </P> <P> As a result, Taggart said, underlings often were afraid to tell Bakker anything  negative.  </P> <P> It may be an indication of Bakker's denial that until just before the trial  began, his largest concern was raising money to keep his latest television show  on the air, a source close to Bakker said last week.  </P> <P> When the federal grand jury began the investigation that led to his indictment,  Bakker called it "a fishing expedition."  </P> <P> And after he resigned from PTL, broke and in disgrace, Bakker turned up in the  Palm Springs area with plans -- apparently without any reasonable hope of  fruition -- for a hotel, golf courses and a religious theme park that would  rival PTL's Heritage USA complex.  </P> <P> Moreover, in a fund-raising letter last year, Tammy Bakker reported that her  husband had lain in a fetal position for hours following his resignation from  PTL.  </P> <P> Bakker also practiced denial of another sort, according to Taggart, the  prosecution's first witness.  </P> <P> Taggart testified that Bakker sometimes chose to stay ignorant of what was done  on his behalf. When he was approached about paying hush-money to cover up his  1980 sexual encounter with former church secretary Jessica Hahn, Bakker refused  to discuss the issue at any length, Taggart said.  </P> <P> "Mr. Bakker made the statement he didn't believe in paying blackmail money but  he told (former PTL executive vice president Richard) Dortch to do whatever you  have to do," explained Taggart, who was convicted last month of tax evasion for  using cash advances from PTL ministry credit cards to support his own expensive  tastes in jewelry and cars.  </P> <P> And although Bakker shied away from his own imbroglios, he was quick to fault  others and demand that his whims be fulfilled, according to the prosecution.  Bakker once ordered a cook fired at his ministry's Heritage USA headquarters  because he was served a hamburger without mustard, prosecutor Jerry Miller said  in his opening statement Monday.  </P> <P> Taggart testified that Bakker once ordered the air-conditioning to be  reinstalled in his son's treehouse at their lakeside home near Heritage USA and  demanded an explanation of why it had been removed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Showed No Anguish  </P> <P> Until his breakdown Wednesday and Thursday, Bakker seemed to be keeping himself  in an iron grip. He showed no anguish or regret that he faces up to 120 years  in prison and $5 million in fines if convicted of defrauding his followers of  millions of dollars. He had been showing up for trial with a smile ready for  the cameras and had been attentive during court, making notes and occasionally  whispering to his attorneys.  </P> <P> Bakker's collapse was the third health problem to strike former PTL executives  this week.  </P> <P> The witness who collapsed Wednesday, former PTL vice president Steve Nelson,  returned to court Thursday, saying "I feel a lot better."  </P> <P> Earlier, Dortch was admitted to a hospital in Clearwater, Fla., near his home,  for an undisclosed ailment. Dortch, who was scheduled to testify for the  prosecution, pleaded guilty Aug. 8 to three counts of fraud and one count of  conspiracy for his role in the PTL scandal, the irresistible combination of  religion, sex and money that produced such cultural artifacts as a violated  church secretary turned centerfold, an air-conditioned doghouse and countless  jokes about Tammy Faye Bakker's zealously applied makeup.  </P> <P> Thursday's eye-popping events were additional icing on what was proving to be  one of the biggest -- and wackiest -- stories of the year.  </P> <P> Every television network, most major newspapers and news magazines, a  smattering of the foreign press and a host of local media had staked out the  courthouse grounds by the time the trial began in earnest Monday.  </P> <P> And that doesn't include demonstrators such as the two men in baseball caps  carrying signs condemning Bakker to perdition. Or the couple who arrived in a  limousine wearing masks of Bakker and Tammy Faye. Or the man and woman hawking  "Bible belts," black cloth belts with small Bibles glued to the buckle.  </P> <P> The circus atmosphere was accented by the weather -- unrelenting,  oxygen-depleting humidity punctuated by brief bursts of broiling sun and  intense thunderstorms. By midweek, many of the television technicians, required  to stay outside at all times, were both damp and tan.  </P> <P> Everybody, of course, had come to see -- or be part of -- another episode in  the long-running spectacle of the PTL scandal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Maximum Bob'  </P> <P> Unfortunately, only a few were chosen to enter the cramped 70-seat courtroom  where Judge "Maximum Bob" Potter was presiding over Bakker's trial on 15 counts  of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit  mail and wire fraud. The charges stem from Bakker's fund-raising measures while  he headed PTL.  </P> <P> What the chosen few had been hearing this week was chapter and verse on how  Bakker and his associates raised $158 million from 1984 to 1987 and how Bakker  allegedly diverted more than $3.7 million for his own benefit.  </P> <P> Those benefits included such items as a $5,000 Christmas tree, a Florida  vacation in a mansion that rented for $10,000 a week and two Cadillacs that  cost a total of $57,000 -- one each for his home near here and for the Bakkers'  house in Palm Springs, one of several homes or condominiums that Bakker once  owned. The Bakker family once spent $600,000 on a Florida condominium that  Tammy Bakker complained was "nothing but a hotel suite."  </P> <P> "This case is about cheating people out of their money. This case is about  tricking people out of their money," declared Miller in his opening argument.  Miller, a former college football player and Washington, D.C., policeman, is  one of two attorneys prosecuting Bakker. The other is Deborah Smith, a former  newspaper reporter who once worked for the Justice Department in Alaska.  </P> <P> But Bakker's attorney, 82-year-old Davis, portrayed his client as the focus of  a "lynch mob mentality." He also maintained that Bakker never had "criminal  intent" in selling the partnerships. PTL was "the product of a religious,  creative genius," Davis said, placing the blame on Dortch and Taggart, Bakker's  two closest associates at PTL.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heart of Government's Case  </P> <P> The heart of the government's case is that Bakker raised the money for his many  homes, cars and other extravagances largely by selling "lifetime partnerships"  in Heritage USA, the theme park and ministry headquarters located in nearby Ft.  Mill, S.C. Most of the $1,000 partnerships promised that donors would receive  three nights of free lodging annually for the rest of their lives in a Heritage  hotel or bunkhouse. Further, the government contends that Bakker knowingly sold  more partnerships than could ever be accommodated, a total of 153,000.  </P> <P> The diverted millions were used to support PTL executives' "lavish and  extravagant life styles," the indictment maintains, alleging that Bakker, his  wife and associates received millions in bonuses while keeping the amount of  those bonuses -- often $100,000 or more -- secret.  </P> <P> Despite the charges, a hard core of Bakker support remains, although, before  his breakdown, most observers thought Bakker was almost a sure bet to be  convicted.  </P> <P> "I'll be glad when it's over and Jim is cleared," said Loretta Mays of  Jacksonville, Fla., as she waited in line this week for a courtroom seat with a  handful of other Bakker supporters.  </P> <P> "I never had a problem with a reservation," declared Virginia Mack, also of  Jacksonville, referring to her ability to use her $1,000 "lifetime  partnership." "I would do it again," Mack said, noting that she had purchased  three of the partnerships.  </P> <P> However, Bakker has been deserted by some of his closest associates, who also  profited handsomely for spreading PTL's brand of religion.  </P> <P> Richard Dortch and brothers David and PTL interior designer James Taggart are  probably prison-bound for their parts in the scandal. All have agreed to  testify against Bakker in hopes of leniency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Damaging Development  </P> <P> By far the most damaging development was the guilty plea last week of Dortch,  PTL's defrocked former executive vice president and mastermind of the hush  money payment to Hahn. Dortch was sentenced to eight years imprisonment and  fined $200,000 -- two years and $300,000 less than he might have been fined  under the plea agreement. However, if he performs to the prosecution's  satisfaction, that term may be reduced. The Taggarts are to be sentenced Sept.  8.  </P> <P> While there is no way to know absolutely what transpired in the minds of Bakker  and his associates, the physical evidence of their ambitions and their downfall  lies open for all to see 14 miles south of here in Ft. Mill, S.C.  </P> <P> The Christian theme park, resort, campground and residential development --  Heritage USA -- that was the launch pad for Bakker's voyage to the drab, gray  federal court building here is still open, in a manner of speaking.  </P> <P> Bakker originally envisioned Heritage partly as a Christian Disneyland or Magic  Mountain, an alternative to the "secular theme parks" that were drawing both  the faithful and the undevout.  </P> <P> But as his television ministry grew and the money flowed in, his dreams  mushroomed. In his final months and days as a big-time televangelist Bakker  apparently conceived of Heritage USA's four square miles as a mini-theocracy,  self-contained and sustained by his electronic pipeline to the pocketbooks of  his followers.  </P> <P> Plans called for a giant crystal palace containing the "largest church  sanctuary in the world," a 5,000-seat television studio, 100 offices, hundreds  of classrooms, altogether capable of accommodating 30,000 people at one time.  Nearby a proposed "Crystal Tower" would house one-, two-, and three-bedroom  timeshare condominiums.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10 Million Visitors  </P> <P> Heritage USA attracted more than 10 million visitors from its opening in 1978  until PTL declared bankruptcy in 1987, according to the ministry's own figures.  </P> <P> Now, however, the flow of visitors that sustained these grandiose schemes has  dried to a faucet drip. Weeds grow in the cracks between the concrete slabs of  the vast, nearly empty parking lot. Weeds also sprout around an uncompleted  fairy tale castle with five brass-colored towers; a sixth tower lies tumbled at  the edge of the parking lot in tall grass and mounds of dirt.  </P> <P> The castle was meant to be part of Heritage's amusement park that included a  giant water slide, a miniature railroad and an Old West town. Only the  waterslide is open, attracting on one recent sweltering day a few hundred  children and teen-agers who carried large blue inner tubes to the top of the  slide like penitents climbing to a shrine.  </P> <P> The other still-operating portions of Bakker's former kingdom on earth include  a chapel called the Upper Room, the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel and Main  Street Heritage USA, a mall-like array of shops selling fudge, baked goods,  toys, Christian art and a combination souvenir, book and music store.  </P> <P> By far the largest, the souvenir shop contains a potpourri of items left over  from the Bakkers' zenith. The records, tapes, books, Bibles, coffee mugs,  insulated cups, T-shirts, jackets, post cards, sweat shirts, buttons, baseball  caps, ceramic bells, boomerangs, Frisbees, stuffed animals and other items are  marked 50% to 75% off their original prices -- if not much more. Maps of  Heritage USA, formerly $2, are 99 cents each -- and the customer gets two maps  free. A coffeetable book titled "Jim &amp; Tammy Bakker Present the Ministries  of Heritage Village Church," once priced at $100, is now $5.95.  </P> <P> One end of Main Street opens onto the lobby of the Heritage Grand Hotel, which  sports an in-door swimming pool. The smell of chlorine from the pool -- which  doubles as a baptismal pond -- mixes with the strains of Christian music  issuing from large speakers on a dais that also holds a grand piano.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Glaring Symbol  </P> <P> Outside the hotel lobby, the most glaring symbol of Bakker's downfall stands  vacant and boarded up, surrounded by a deteriorating barricade of wooden  sawhorses. The 21-story skeleton is the Heritage Grand Towers Hotel. A  construction crane still stands in place on the building's flank, and an  overgrown field behind the rusting crane is littered with big bundles of bricks  and other building materials.  </P> <P> In the eyes of most, the verdict of the federal jury -- if there is one -- will  determine whether the abandoned hotel, the crumbling castle and the moribund  Main Street are the remnants of a grand dream or a seedy scam.  </P></p>

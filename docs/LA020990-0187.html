			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AUSTRALIA'S BOND CORP. LOSES COURT BATTLE  </P> <P> Entrepreneur Alan Bond's embattled flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. lost a  major battle today when it failed to persuade a court to lift its prized  Australian breweries out of receivership.  </P> <P> Justice Barry Beach ruled in Victoria's Supreme Court after a monthlong case  that Bond Brewing Holdings should remain under control of a court-appointed  receiver.  </P> <P> Bond Corp., caught up in a morass of legal action and burdened with $4.9  billion in debt, said it will appeal the decision as soon as possible. Its key  Australian breweries, including Fourex and Swan, said they will apply for a  stay of the ruling pending an appeal.  </P> <P> Peter Lucas, a Bond Corp. director, said before the judgment that the  receivership order, obtained by a bank syndicate led by National Australia  Bank, could have a domino effect and lead to the collapse of the rest of the  media and property empire.  </P> <P> The judge ruled that the syndicate, owed $530 million by Bond Brewing, was  entirely justified in seeking the receivership order, which was granted Dec.  29.  </P> <P> He said Bond Brewing deliberately tried to keep people with any knowledge of  the Bond group's affairs away from court, and said he found it extraordinary  that Bond Brewing had excluded relevant material from the case.  </P> <P> The company's U.S. breweries, including Wisconsin's G. Heileman Brewing Co.,  were not included in the receivership order.  </P> <P> In a separate development, Bond Media, which is 51% owned by Bond Corp., won a  reprieve from immediate repayment of a $275-million loan.  </P> <P> The bank syndicate agreed not to take further action to recover the money until  March 28. National Australia took Bond Media to court last week to demand  immediate repayment.  </P></p>

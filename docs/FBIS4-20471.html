			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Zhang Chun'an [1728 2504 1344]: ``Set of </F> Institute 8's Scientific Research Achievements Pass Appraisal'']    [Summary] Six research achievements of MEI's Institute 8  recently passed appraisal. These achievements are:    (1) Dual-use (military/civilian) radiation-resistant optical  fiber and fiber optic cable;    (2) Dual-use wire-guided high-strength/toughness fiber optic  cable;    (3) Longitudinal hermetically sealed leak-resistant fiber  optic cable, with a technical performance approaching  late-eighties international standards;    (4) Wired optical waveguide connectors for dense-water  single-fiber single-mode fiber optic cable, particularly suited  to communications with offshore oil and gas fields;    (5) Dual-use fiber-optic-sensing high-voltage isolation  modules;    (6) SD-optical modems, with wavelength-division-multiplexing  and frequency-division-multiplexing (FDM) functions, ideal for  optical fiber data transmission systems and single-fiber  multiplexed video PFM [pulse-frequency modulated] FDM  transmission systems.</p>

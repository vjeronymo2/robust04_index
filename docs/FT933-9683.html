			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Clinton seeks deal with Congress on future legislation: Democrats press for bi-partisan approach in wake of budget victory DEMOCRATIC leaders yesterday sought to capitalise on President Bill Clinton's one-vote budget victory on Friday night by seeking to establish a bi-partisan approach to the next important pieces of legislation due to be presented to Congress. 'I think that in the process of governing a president has to work with the Congress to put together majority support for a package of changes that can pass,' Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, said yesterday. Mr Gore said he had repeatedly reached out to his Republican opponents during the early months of the administration but had been rebuffed. However, he said: 'In order to address the important challenges we face now we have got to try and create a bi-partisan approach.' The administration's overtures reflect both a recognition of the narrowness of its victory last week and a hope that passage of the budget will pave the way for other important Clinton legislation, such as an overhaul of the healthcare system and completion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The loss of just one more vote among the 535 members of Congress would have been enough to defeat Mr Clinton's budget package and deal a lasting blow to his presidency. The House of Representatives passed the compromise bill, which aims to cut Dollars 496bn (Pounds 333bn) from the budget deficit over the next five years, by 218-216, and it squeezed through the Senate only on the casting vote of Mr Gore. All Republicans in both houses voted against the budget bill. But Mr Bob Dole, the Senate minority leader, said yesterday he had telephoned Mr Clinton to congratulate him and to suggest that there were other issues ahead on which they could work together. He appeared to soften the Republican position on the possible imposition of higher payroll taxes to pay for an improved healthcare programme, another key element in Mr Clinton's plan. Mr Dole denied telling Mr Clinton that 'under no circumstances' would Republicans approve higher charges, but instead 'strongly disapproved' of any such proposals. 'We have left the door open,' he said. He stressed it would be a mistake for liberal Democrats to believe they could raise taxes and then come back later this year and demand Republican support for additional spending cuts: 'That's not going to happen.' Mr Gore said he had always been confident of victory and claimed people would now begin to see the benefits of the bill after the disinformation and misrepresentation. Controversy had been inevitable, he declared, because the administration was trying to change the course of the nation by creating jobs and moving the economy in the right direction after 12 years during which the federal deficit had quadrupled. He promised further spending cuts in the autumn, and forecast continued decline in long-term interest rates. The tax cuts for small businesses would help to create new jobs, he added, and many lower-income families would find they were better off as a result of the bill's proposals.

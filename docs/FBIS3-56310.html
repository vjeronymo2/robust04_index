			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Churkin, deputy minister of foreign </F> affairs, by Blazej Panik in the High Tatra; date not given: "On  Zhirinovskiy, Minorities, and NATO"]    [Text] Bratislava -- Vitaliy Ivanovich Churkin is Russian  deputy minister of foreign affairs (in charge of European  affairs) and President Yeltsin's special envoy for former  Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of the State Institute of  International Relations in Moscow. He spent five years in  Switzerland within the framework of the Soviet-U.S. talks on  limiting strategic offensive weapons (START II) and another five  years at the embassy in Washington. This "flying Russian  emissary" (he spent over 300 hours flying last year) was  vacationing in the High Tatra these days together with his  family. On this occasion, he granted an exclusive interview to  our daily.    [Panik] A certain reorganization is currently taking place  in your ministry and cadre changes are also being prepared.  What are the causes?    [Churkin] Minister Andrey Kozyrev has been saying for some  time -- and quite justifiably, in my opinion -- that it is  necessary to devote more attention to the CIS, to our closest  and immediate neighbors. The aim of the current structural  reorganization of our office is, therefore, to orient our  activity to the greatest possible degree toward these states.  Whereas, until now, the Baltic states were the only former  Soviet republics under the jurisdiction of the European Affairs  Department, following the reorganization, this department will  also be in charge of relations with Ukraine, Belarus, and  Moldova. The CIS department will then only deal with  multilateral relations within the framework of this  Commonwealth. Four regional sections will be established within  the European Affairs Department.    [Panik] According to the new Constitution, foreign policy is  the president's prerogative. Nonetheless, the question comes to  mind what influence the new parliament will exert on it?    [Churkin] We would like to hope that our relations will be  distinguished by a spirit of cooperation. Even regarding the  old parliament, our ministry devoted considerable efforts to the  search for constructive interaction with deputies. We were not  too successful, however.    [Panik] Mr. Zhirinovskiy has been active on the official  Russian political scene for only a few weeks, yet his statements  have already alarmed many states, particularly Russia's  neighbors. On the other hand, they also cause unnecessary  problems to your office, which will repeatedly be forced to  react to his words. How do you intend to approach this problem?    [Churkin] It seems that, after the elections of 12 December,  foreign countries, in particular, have been struck by some kind  of a shock, which finds its expression in the attribution of  great significance to Zhirinovskiy's statements. One  circumstance tends to be forgotten in all this -- that  Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president. Even if we take a  realistic look at the composition of the new parliament, we see  that his party does not even have a majority there. Russia's  Choice will, after all, be the strongest parliamentary group.    [Panik] Yet Zhirinovskiy's electoral success is impossible  to ignore.    [Churkin] Certainly not. It is a fairly serious signal, one  that should be taken into consideration by both Russian  democrats and by foreign countries, that highly complex  processes are taking place in Russia, that the continuing  struggle for democracy is taking place under extremely  complicated conditions. At the same time, however, I do not  think that it is necessary to react from all sides and with an  outcry to every statement Zhirinovskiy makes. For example, he  spoke about some weapons. So what? What can he actually do? He  is a man with a very peculiar and well-known manner of conduct.  He is not averse to sensationalist statements; his main concern  is to build up his popularity. If each of his statements  triggers a minor storm the world over, it will only play into  his cards, in my opinion. Therefore, I would suggest that the  reactions be calm and prudent because, as I have already said,  Zhirinovskiy is far from being the president and is not even a  Russian politician who could influence certain decisions. Of  course, should he raise some questions in parliament within the  framework of constitutional procedures, we will respond to them.  But we definitely do not intend to build our policy on some of  his exotic statements.    [Panik] But try to imagine yourself in the position of other  states. In Bulgaria, for example, he called for the removal of  President Zhelev....    [Churkin] This is exactly one of those cases where any  commentary is unnecessary. This man simply does not hesitate to  resort to such scandalous statements for the sake of popularity.  How can you elbow your way to the front pages of newspapers in  the East European countries, for example? In his opinion, it is  simple: You just have to go there and call for the removal of  the president. I repeat, if we were to oversensitively react to  each of his statements and call a meeting of the General  Assembly or the UN Security Council every time, we would look  absurd -- if we get trapped by this quite simple political trick.    [Panik] Sometimes it seems as if Zhirinovskiy were  specially "made to order" of certain, possibly quite specific,  aims of Russian foreign policy, so that these can be covered by  his strong, and in [the Russian] society rather popular, ideas.  This is particularly alarming when we consider a phenomenon  such as the growth of Russian nationalism. Is Moscow, planning  to change in any way its policy regarding the protection of the  rights of Russians in the so-called adjacent foreign countries  [reference to former Soviet republics]?    [Churkin] No.    [Panik] Not even modify?    [Churkin] No. Another matter is that the December elections  -- and also the way in which Zhirinovskiy exploited the thesis  about the position of Russians abroad -- demonstrated that this  problem really exists. Therefore, when we raised this issue on  the premises of the CSCE, the Council of Europe, or the United  Nations, it was no propaganda on our part, as some of our  partners in the Baltic countries have been trying to interpret  this, but the pinpointing of actually existing sore spots that  must be dealt with. The elections clearly showed this. This is  one of those issues, from which, as I hope, correct conclusions  will be drawn.    [Panik] This entire complex of questions is associated with  the highly topical all-European subject of ethnic minority  rights. Which view does Moscow endorse: Should uniform and  universal standards of these rights be drafted within the  framework of the entire European continent or should the  so-called regional principle be applied?    [Churkin] This is a very delicate issue. Our main  principle, which we are trying to observe, is not to cause any  damage. When ethnic minorities are concerned, a small problem  can easily grow into a big one. As a matter of principle, we  are of the opinion that the idea of drafting a charter of ethnic  minority rights is not bad and must be assessed. However, we  are opposed to proceeding in these matters on the basis of the  bulldozer principle, as it were.    [Panik] What does that mean?    [Churkin] I am thinking of the formulation of some rigid  principles and the effort to force them upon everyone. It is  generally true, and the example of Yugoslavia showed this quite  drastically, that any coercion is a very dangerous thing with  regarding the issue of ethnic minority rights. Apart from the  aforementioned principle, we are guided by yet another one: In  every specific instance, Russia's demands concerning the rights  of Russian minorities in the countries in question must not  exceed their demands -- that is, the demands of these countries.    [Panik] What did you have in mind when you said that it is  necessary to assess the idea of drafting a charter of minority  rights?    [Churkin] Apparently, it will be necessary to formulate a  set of certain universal rights. The question is how  far-reaching and all-encompassing these universal rights should  be. Would it be appropriate, for example, to treat as absolute  the principle of federalization? I do not think so. In some  instances, the creation of a federation can be the only way out  of the situation, but in other instances this requirement can  complicate the problem where it may not even exist, and where it  could be resolved, for example, by the installation of road  signs or street names in the language of the minority, as a  supplement to signs in the state language. Hence, minority  rights cannot be made fully universal. And there is yet another  thing. I have the feeling that far from everything is stable in  Europe in this regard and that not everyone understands that  some demands that are being raised could be applied also against  those who raise them, if one were to be consistent. Regarding  Yugoslavia, for example, some countries are putting forward  demands, which I am not at all sure they would be able to apply  at home, once the Yugoslav conflict is settled. Therein lies a  danger. Because when we resolve some problem at one place and  lay down some criteria, an explosive mixture will come about  when we try to apply the same criteria to other states. I  assume that Europe is not interested in this. I repeat, certain  general, universal principles of minority rights are necessary  but, at the same time, exceptional sensitivity is needed when  tackling problems with regard to each specific situation.    [Panik] How would Moscow react if the real threat emerged in  the south of Slovakia of the creation of territorial autonomy  based on the ethnic principle?    [Churkin] I would not like to comment on such specific  issues. As a matter of principle, however, I am of the opinion  that the fewer surgical incisions every specific decision will  entail, the better. In other words, the smaller the number of  changes and adaptations that are necessary for people to feel as  citizens with full rights, the better. It is necessary to  proceed according to the principle of minimization [princip  minimalnosti]. For example, it is superb when it is enough to  install [bilingual] signs and inscriptions and people will say  that precisely that is what they found lacking. If more needs  to be done to satisfy people -- for example, open more schools  -- even that is fine. Overall, however, many things need to be  taken into consideration. There are politicians, for example,  who deliberately stir up people's emotions to be able to score  additional points with the help of these emotions in order to  obtain some political post. A Georgian politician once spoke  with one of our diplomats about the position of the Russian  minority in Georgia. He said that Russians have no problems  there, live the same lives as Georgians, and have absolutely  equal rights. He also said, however, that if all of a sudden  some extremist politician from among Russians in Georgia started  asking for autonomy, a problem would immediately emerge, as well  as another conflict. We must beware of this everywhere.    [Panik] Under what circumstances would Moscow not have any  objections to the Visegrad Four countries joining NATO?    [Churkin] We all will enter together....    [Panik] Who "all"? The entire Europe?    [Churkin] No, why? The Visegrad group along with Russia.  All together. Why not, as a matter of fact? Why?    [Panik] Is that your answer?    [Churkin] No, it is my spontaneous reaction, so to say.    [Panik] And your answer?    [Churkin] The problem is not in whether Moscow has or does  not have objections. We have not objected to anything. But  when this issue arose, we only came up with what I would rather  call a plea: not to deal with this issue rashly, on a wave of  emotions. This is because a whole number of issues is at stake  that, in our firm conviction, have not been thought through yet  -- by anyone. Not by you, not by the North Atlantic Alliance,  and not by us. Incidentally, I am absolutely sure that, even if  he had not said a single world and had sat silently like a fish,  neither the Visegrad Four nor anyone else would have been  admitted into NATO now. Simply because the North Atlantic  Alliance itself is not ready for that. It is not ready because  of what I have mentioned: that not all the consequences of such  a step have been calculated.    [Panik] What, in particular, do you have in mind?    [Churkin] In my opinion, it is necessary to keep several  factors in mind. In present-day Europe it is impossible to gain  additional security while at the same time harming the security  of other states. So there has to be equal security. Second,  how would the admission of, let us say, only some East European  countries into NATO be accepted by the other states of the  region (and I am not thinking of Russia right now)? For  example, in the past few months, when this dispute was going on,  I quite clearly felt a certain tension arising among the East  European countries themselves. Because some of them were  interested not so much in their own NATO membership but, rather,  they feared that someone might be admitted without them being  admitted. This is a negative factor, and then will the East  European countries' entry into NATO at this time resolve the  actually existing problems in this region? Or is it something  that is rather more symbolic and that does not resolve these  real problems and may even create additional ones? How will  this be reflected in the very foundations of European security?  One of its pillars and, in my opinion one of the most important  ones is the Treaty on Conventional Forces in Europe. If four  former Warsaw Pact member countries were now admitted into NATO,  how would that be reflected in the treaty? I do not know....    [Panik] What do your experts say about that?    [Churkin] They also raise this question and draw attention  to the fact that the treaty had been worked out in blocks, that  is, it was based on the number of weapons of 16 NATO states and  seven Warsaw Pact states deployed on the European continent.  Certain ceilings were set. Then the Warsaw Pact broke up.  Still, we are observing the treaty. Even the Soviet Union has  broken up but, still, we are observing the treaty. But what if  there will not be 16 states on one side, but 20 states? What  are we going to do with that treaty then? This is an unclear  and unanswered question. Or take another matter: I have had a  number of conversations with representatives of East European  states and, to be candid, I do not have the feeling that from  the purely financial viewpoint they have a clear idea of what  NATO membership would cost them. After all, this is not such a  simple matter. NATO is, of course, a solid organization; the  people there are solid. I do not see in them any evil spirits  who are conspiring against someone. That is not the point. We  ourselves are prepared and want to cooperate with them. But they  are no philanthropists either; they are not going to engage in  any charitable activities. Entry into NATO is, therefore, a  serious matter, which would surely require considerable material  contributions and expenditures. Therefore, having pondered the  issue and racked our brains, and, understandably, keeping in  mind the interests of Russia and our already complicated  internal political situation, we said: It will be better to  ponder the problems of European security for another while. In  this context, it seems to us that the idea of "Partnership for  Peace" is a good one.    [Panik] Evil tongues claim that it is more your idea than  Washington's idea....    [Churkin] No. I think that it is the product of a dialogue,  including our dialogue with the Americans. But in this case it  would be immodest and incorrect if we tried to arrogate the  authorship of this idea.</p>

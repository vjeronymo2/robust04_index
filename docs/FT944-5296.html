			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / A-Z of Personal Finance (25): Make money abroad from home territory - Xenophobia Xenophobia, literally fear or hatred of foreigners, has been making an unfortunate comeback in unscrupulous political circles around the world, but continues to look extremely out of place in investment, where global thinking is considered essential. But in its wider definition - fear of strange customs - xenophobia could be taken to mean no more than an aversion to the unfamiliar settlement systems or currency dealing involved in buying and selling overseas investments. Creatively treated, this phobia can be used to seek out British-based companies with a high proportion of sales or earnings abroad. Investors can then have the convenience of buying foreign earnings from home territory in sterling, and may be able to secure tax advantages not normally available on investments in some geographical areas. For example, investors who want to hold investment trust shares in a personal eguity plan, out of reach of capital gains and income taxes, have to ensure that at least 50 per cent of the trust's portfolio is in countries belonging to the European Union. But there is no similar geographical limit for investors buying shares in individual industrial or financial companies to place under a Pep shelter. So although Bunzl derives 63 per cent of its sales from the US, Fisons 62 per cent and Grand Metropolitan 60 per cent, all are fully eligible for Peps. Analysts at BZW track UK companies' geographical sales exposure on a monthly basis, using historic figures from annual reports and the firm's own earnings forecasts for the next two years. Analyst Steve Wright explained that BZW also took into account companies exposed to the US dollar without necessarily selling anything in the US, such as BP, Shell and British Airways, all buyers of oil; or commodity-related stocks such as RTZ. BZW mid-November figures reveal RTZ as an ideal stock for xenophobes with investment wanderlust, offering just 1 per cent exposure to the UK market, against 28 per cent in the Asia-Pacific region. Zeneca is the next least reliant on Britain, with just 7 per cent exposure to the UK against 45 per cent to the US and 15 per cent to Asia and the Pacific. By comparison, Glaxo's UK/US exposure is 9 per cent/45 per cent. Hanson's much advertised 'over there/over here' turns out to mean 45 per cent of sales in the US and 43 per cent in Britain. And there are no Eurosceptics in the building materials sector, judging by the European exposure of RMC Group (67 per cent), BPB Industries (56 per cent) and Redland (52 per cent).</p>

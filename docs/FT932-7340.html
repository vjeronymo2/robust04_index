			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / EC draws up jobs strategy THE European Community could begin to roll back unemployment by such measures as reducing employers' social security contributions to cut labour costs and more sharing-out of jobs. This is the main conclusion of the 'Community-wide framework for employment' the European Commission is set to adopt tomorrow. The framework policy, approved in its essentials yesterday by the chefs de cabinet of the Commission, puts forward a jobs-crisis agenda for the next three presidencies of the EC, to the end of 1994. It starts from the premise that a return to the high economic and productivity growth of the late 1980s 'would still leave the Community well short of a target such as 5 per cent unemployment'. The EC now has 17.4m jobless, 10.3 per cent of the workforce. But the Commission confidently says 'there is sufficient evidence and experience to suggest that ways of, at least, improving the situation can be found - over and above those which can result from higher levels of economic growth.' The proposed strategy, likely to be near the top of the agenda at next month's Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government, is the first EC-wide attempt to deal with structural unemployment. It focuses on ways of creating more labour-intensive growth. The document notes that while Belgium and the Netherlands have similar labour productivity, the Dutch provide jobs for 10 per cent more people of working age. The Danes earn less per head in real terms than western Germans, but have a much higher portion of their people at work. 'You can have labour-intensive work while still providing a highly competitive product,' said one senior Brussels official. 'It's a question of how you share a given volume of employment between people.' The Commission is at pains to stress that its strategy is consonant with the 'economic and social aims' of EC member states. It would 'not exploit workers in a weak position in the labour market, or inhibit the development of the high value-added, knowledge-based jobs which will be the key to future competitiveness.' But it suggests employers' 'social contributions' - averaging 15 per cent of wages across the EC but varying between member states from virtually nil to over 20 per cent - affect job creation. The five main points of its framework therefore call for: 'reducing labour costs. . . notably by modifying the incidence of taxation systems'; new working time structures to share out jobs; 'adaptability at the workplace' and 'new forms of work organisation'; training systems to bring more people into work and 'anticipate structural change'; and exploitation of 'new areas of work' such as the environment.</p>

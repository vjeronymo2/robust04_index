			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Rea Holdings declines to Pounds 193,000 A drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 193,000 was announced by Rea Holdings, the plantation company, for the six months ended June 30. Turnover declined from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 39.9m. Mr Richard Robinow, the chairman, said that while crops were encouraging, tea prices continued at levels just insufficient to achieve a break-even position in the Bangladesh operation. Plantations reported a loss of Pounds 36,000 (Pounds 22,000 profit) for the period. Product merchanting increased to Pounds 169,000 (Pounds 111,000) but margins had been under pressure, while storage, which advanced to Pounds 191,000 (Pounds 176,000), had a high occupancy level, he said. Earnings fell to 0.1p (0.5p) per share.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (10): Mrs Ciller stubs her toe - Why privatisation has limped to a halt Like a clapped-out car, Turkey's privatisation programme appears finally to have limped to a halt. The process of state sell-offs was set in motion nearly 10 years ago, but it never really picked up speed. Turkey has raised only Dollars 1.7bn in state sales since Turgut Ozal announced plans to liberalise the economy in the early 1980s. But privatisation has faced formidable opposition, from the bureaucrats and politicians with vested interests, to the unions and Social Democrats (now the junior partner in the coalition government) fearing thousands of lay-offs across Turkish industry. The election in June of Mrs Tansu Ciller held out new promise. In a move to speed up privatisation, Mrs Ciller pledged to raise as much in one year as the programme had raised in the past decade. Seen as a moderniser and radical economic reformer, the new prime minister seemed to have enough support and enthusiasm to pull it off. More important, the need for revenues had become urgent. Mrs Ciller promised to sell Turkey's biggest state companies, including telecommunications, electricity, oil and the motor and steel industries. The revenues, which the government still says will reach Dollars 1.7bn this year, are needed to ease the burden of the loss-making state sector, to reduce the budget deficit and to dampen down inflation. It is more an economic imperative than a political crusade. Turkey's 34 state-run industries are expected to lose around Dollars 3bn this year. They employ 600,000 people in more than 400 affiliates. Economists estimate that around 60,000 jobs will have to go across state industry if it is to become efficient. So far this year, Dollars 350m has been raised through block sales, public offerings and flotations on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. But the government has no chance of reaching its 1993 target. Last month, Mrs Ciller's decree enabling the sale of PTT, the national telecommunications company and jewel in the state crown, was ruled unconstitutional. The sale, of up to 49 per cent of the company, was expected to raise between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 4bn. The constitutional court in Ankara ruled the sale should have been put to parliament. A lower court then overturned Mrs Ciller's proposals to restructure PTT in preparation for sale. The rulings have thrown the whole programme into doubt. 'Telecoms was the big test case and Mrs Ciller failed,' says one western observer. 'Not only is there no chance of selling PTT for at least a year, but the government cannot even restructure the company. The ruling means all major projects must be halted, there can be no investment, no transfer of debt, nothing that was part of the move towards privatisation. Mrs Ciller has stubbed her toe on PTT.' Some economic analysts have questioned the wisdom of Mrs Ciller's heading straight for the big companies: PTT, TEK, the national electricity company, and Petrol Ofisi, Turkey's largest petrol retailer. They argue the government should hold on to the profit-makers to secure revenues over the long term and to reduce the burden on the state by closing the many loss-makers that are too hopeless to be rehabilitated. 'Selling the winners is not a smart move,' says one economist in Ankara. 'It provides a one-shot input of capital and doesn't cut the overall burden. Mrs Ciller should start by cutting the bureaucracies and imposing a wage freeze.' Yet the criticisms and recent setbacks appear to be forcing a change of tack. Mrs Ciller is pressing on with other sales and putting energy into a campaign to answer her critics. Two weeks ago, the government's trade and industry committee passed a further decree, despite the recent court rulings, empowering the energy ministry to sell TEK. The company is another of the government's showcase sales and potentially among its biggest revenue earners. Parliamentary deputies, who sought the ruling on PTT, are now said to be preparing their case against the restructuring and sale of TEK. Mrs Ciller has responded to criticism from the left by promising to use privatisation funds for job creation and redundancy payments. The priority now is to close loss-makers and to make provisions for unemployment with job creation programmes and special welfare provision. Revenues from privatisation 'are earmarked for industrialisation incentives and job creation,' government officials said two weeks ago. Sales this year have enabled several foreign companies to build controlling stakes in Turkish subsidiaries, and to position themselves in the market for the larger sales. Northern Telecom of Canada paid Dollars 27.8m for a further 20 per cent in Netas the telephone and switch manufacturer, taking its holding to 51 per cent. Alcatel of France built its share of Teletas, the second biggest telecoms group, to 65 per cent, buying 18 per cent of the company for Dollars 21m. Other stakes up for sale and attracting foreign interest include Tofas, the Fiat car assembly subsidiary. The government has decided to sell its 21.1 per cent stake and its 18.5 per cent in the company's distributing arm, Tofas Oto, in an initial public offering on international markets, along with private placements in the US and Europe. Private domestic companies have bought up state competitors. Earlier this year, Rumeli Cement bought out three state cement makers for a total of Dollars 135m, and Ercimsan paid Dollars 31m for another small cement company. Rumeli's sister company. Rumeli Electric paid Dollars 114m for minority holdings in two electricity utilities. Such sales are small beer against the larger sell-offs stalled by the constitutional court. There are many companies still to come to market. Among the large companies planned for sale in the next few years are Petkim, the petrochemicals company, which the government says needs substantial investment, and the Turban hotel chain, which operates a tourist agency, four marinas, and 19 hotels and holiday villas. Such companies might well be an enticing prospect for an overseas investor, and the need for foreign money might yet strengthen Mrs Ciller's hand. Much will depend on municipal elections in March, and the prime minister's future relationship with the Social Democrats, on whom she is relying to mediate with the unions. Mrs Ciller has won few friends in her attempts to sell Turkey so far. She is accused of naivety, even arrogance, in trying to push sales through in the face of an entrenched bureaucracy and wider opposition. As one western diplomat says: 'Whichever way she does it, she'll get political flak: from the unions, from her coalition partners, from the courts. It's impossible to make rational policies in such circumstances. Mrs Ciller is up against bureaucratic gridlock and parliamentary constipation.'</p>

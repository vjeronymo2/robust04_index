			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Letter: VAT charge on food not illogical Sir, Mr Poynor (Letters, October 24) considers the logic and consistency of the UK's system of charging VAT on food could have been devised by Lewis Carroll and advocates a uniform rate for food. Mr Poynor fails to understand the principle behind the zero-rating of most food and the normal (17.5 per cent) rate applied to the rest: unless the food is supplied in the course of catering or consists of snacks or confectionery, it is zero-rated. The logic for charging snacks and confectionery is that they are either not really essential or are luxuries. With the tens of thousands of food lines available in stores there are obviously going to be some grey areas, but even Mr Poynor's 'most whimsical' example of frozen yoghurt is easy to explain. If it can be 'spooned when frozen' and eaten immediately it falls within the snack or confectionery category: if it has to be defrosted it falls within the general category of necessary human food and is zero-rated. Equally logical is the taxation of pet food and zero-rating of other animal feeding stuffs: the feeding of livestock is (pace vegetarians) necessary to provide food, whereas the keeping of pets is mostly an unnecessary luxury. A uniform rate - at the 6 per cent implied by Mr Poynor - would be unfair on those who buy little or no snack foods and confectionery and detrimental to the less well-off.

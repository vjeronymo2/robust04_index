			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, commander of the General  Staff of the Supreme Command of our Army, addressed the fighters  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the citizens of our country.  Here is what he said in his message;    [Begin Delic recording] Behind us is a difficult, war-ridden  1993 during which the brutal aggression on our homeland  continued. Despite the unjustly introduced embargo, the fact  that the world indifferently observed the war horrors in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the difficult conditions in which  members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina waged the war, they endured in their heroism  and defended their homeland and people.    As a soldier of the Army of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to wish to all the fighters of  the Armed Forces, all patriots of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in both  free and occupied territories, that next year, 1994, will be a  year of freedom and peace. I want arms in this region to go  silent. I wish for a just peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina and its  people. I want people to return to their homes, families, and  jobs that they performed in peace. Our people -- and by this I  mean all citizens that consider Bosnia-Herzegovina their  homeland -- have the right to that because of the sacrifices  they made in this struggle.    Regardless of everything, my message to all fighters is to  remain firm and ready to stop all future offensive intentions of  the aggressor. If the peace negotiations fail, we must be ready  to secure the freedom and peace of our people with arms and,  above all, enable them to return to their centuries-old hearths.    I appeal to all those who have so far not fully participated  in the struggle not only to fully contribute with arms next  year, but to also strengthen in all other ways the front of our  just struggle for the freedom of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    I wish the fighters all the luck in their honorable tasks  and  peace and freedom to all citizens of our homeland. [end  recording]</p>

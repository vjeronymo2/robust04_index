			<p><P> February 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY  </P> <P> Change keeps on happening, and the winds of change wafted down to Central  America and turned Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega into just another  discredited Marxist leader with a salesman's tattered sample case of ideology  and a history of failed economic promises. Nicaraguans discovered for  themselves that his collectivist dogma just did not cut it at the dinner table.  It did not deliver the goods. It went bankrupt years ago, and Sunday its  shareholders voted for a whole new management team.  </P> <P> And so in one sunny and bold stroke the people of Nicaragua have seemingly  managed to achieve the goal that has so long eluded Washington and the Contras:  the removal of the Sandinistas from power.  </P> <P> Ortega himself quickly assured the world that the Sandinistas would accept the  voters' decision. He was never so gracious in power as he was Sunday in defeat.  One hopes he'll be true to his word and render every assistance in what could  be a difficult political transition. The election turned out far, far cleaner  than anyone could possibly have hoped. This not only reflects well on the  Ortega government and the Nicaraguan people but also on former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter, Elliot Richardson, wave after wave of election observers from the  United Nations and the Organization of American States and other well-meaning  souls.  </P> <P> A triumphant Violeta Barrios de Chamorro of the National Opposition Union won  victory as the head of a broad and disparate alliance of various  anti-Sandinista groups that may not prove durable. Some observers are already  doubting that Chamorro will prove any more effective than, say, Philippine  President Corazon Aquino. No matter for now. Let us simply congratulate the  Nicaraguan people on their good judgment and decisiveness.  </P> <P> Their decision could improve the stock of El Salvador and Honduras as well.  This whole section of the planet has known more than its share of war, poverty  and despair. Sure, many, many problems remain (see following editorial). But  new opportunity has visited that land and hope has been reborn.  </P></p>

Traffic lights in the Koura neighborhood of  Bamako were destroyed, and electricity substations in  Kinsambougou and (Bagadajeda) were damaged. The Jamana  publishing house and the annex of the Ministry of Economic  Affairs were also seriously damaged. The police made some  arrests. (?CNID Fato Yirouaton) sent us a communique calling  for the immediate release of the Association of Malian Students  and Pupils [AEEM] secretary general, Yehia Zarawana, and his  friends, in order that a frank and constructive dialogue might  be initiated. This is the sole condition needed to get the  country out of the crisis.

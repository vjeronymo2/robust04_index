			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Putting the right leaves on a classic English tree - Neil Buckley looks at the well-cut and tailored expansion plans of Aquascutum's new chief executive The favourite tailor of Lady Thatcher might not necessarily be expected to be so popular in Shanghai. But China is one of the markets Aquascutum has its eye on. The arrival at the group's headquarters on London's Regent Street last November of a new chief executive, Mr James Pow, a 42-year-old Scot, has brought a new era of expansion and brand development. It parallels the changes occurring elsewhere on this famous shopping street. Towards Oxford Circus, Liberty, the retailing and fabric group, is enfranchising its non-voting shares, and virtually next door, Dickins &amp; Jones, part of the newly-floated House of Fraser group, is to undergo a Pounds 3m revamp. A few doors down, Hamleys, one of the world's best-known toy retailers, has undergone a Pounds 1.3m refit and has just been successfully floated. Aquascutum, one of the UK's most prestigious clothing and retail groups whose name means 'water shield', was founded in 1851 when Mr John Emary patented a process for shower-proofing woollen fabric. In the first world war, Aquascutum used the technique to develop the first trench coat for officers, which later became popular civilian wear. By the 1980s it had become a premium British brand alongside the likes of Burberry, Daks, Jaeger and Austin Reed with operations in Europe, east Asia and North America and sales of close to Pounds 50m a year. It found favour with Lady Thatcher after providing her with coats for a trip to Moscow. However, late in the decade this most traditional of retailers was facing pressure from a dissident shareholder group for a radical shake-up. That ended in April 1990 with the Pounds 74m takeover by Renown, Japan's largest clothing manufacturer. While the takeover helped the group to expand its business in east Asia, Aquascutum by last autumn was stagnating. Then came Mr Pow. Formerly with Hackett, a subsidiary of Dunhill, and responsible for opening Hackett's flagship store in London's Sloane Square, he understood the potential of premium British brands. He realised, as he puts it, that 'the Aquascutum label was sitting on a goldmine if it refocused itself'. In less than six months he has swept through the company, holding presentations of his plans in management offices, stores and on factory floors. The first task was to reorganise the management - bringing divisions in Canada, the US, Europe and east Asia together under one headquarters and centralising functions wherever possible. Mr Pow says the divisions were run as separate empires, but with a 'spider's web of overlapping functions'. He cut 40 jobs in the UK, mainly in service functions in Regent Street, with similar cost-cutting programmes in the US and Canada. He appointed a creative director, operations director, finance director and sales director responsible for both the retail and wholesale sides of the business - all with worldwide responsibility. The next priority was to regain control of the Aquascutum brand. Aquascutum, says Mr Pow, represents 'the classic English company worldwide'. But it had licensed the name to manufacturers who had used it on unsuitable and poor-quality products from bed linen to jewellery, far removed from the quality clothing for which it had been a byword. Mr Pow aims to ensure that the name appears only on quality goods and has set up a London-based international merchandise committee to monitor the 'price, imagery and general aesthetics' of every Aquascutum product sold worldwide. He also intends to modernise Aquascutum's core raincoat range. 'Fifteen years ago, the company didn't look at what was happening in the coats area. Lightweight textiles were regarded as not suitable for a traditional house.' Now, Aquascutum will be looking at high-technology performance fabrics, such as 'memory fibres', which are conditioned always to return to their original state - 'solar fibres' which retain heat from the sun's rays, and fine waterproofed wools. Furthermore, it plans a range of branded sports and leisure wear, especially in the sailing and ski-wear markets. Both the new raincoats and leisure wear ranges should be on sale by spring 1995. By introducing these, Mr Pow hopes to attract a younger clientele - current typical customers are in their mid-40s 'with a fairly good lifestyle, who currently buys three or four main labels'. However, he says the business needs to attract customers of 35 and upwards to build up the brand for the future. Other strategies are being adopted to entice shoppers into the stores. Work will shortly begin on refitting the Regent Street flagship store inside and out, with each floor given a different theme - manor house, town house and stately home - designed to capture the store's quintessential Englishness. Stores in New York and Boston in the US will be similarly refurbished. Mr Pow sums up what he is doing like this: 'I recognised that Aquascutum was a very strong tree. All the branches were there, but they had been covered by the wrong leaves.' The final part of his strategy involves expanding the group's international business. New stores are planned for the US in Chicago, Washington and San Francisco over the next three years as well as three stores in Prague. Aquascutum also hopes to open a joint venture retail operation in Shanghai later this year. Mr Pow believes that Aquascutum will be as popular in China as it is elsewhere in east Asia - especially in Japan, where it has more than 120 in-store outlets. It has benefited from the experience of its parent Renown, which already has four Chinese joint ventures. 'The Shanghai-ese are already the biggest capitalists in the world,' he adds. Mr Pow says his reforms are already bearing fruit, with sales currently running 22 per cent ahead of the same period last year, and 9 per cent above budget. The likely cost of his regeneration plan for Aquascutum is Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m, but funding is already in place, and the pay-back period is expected to be less than two years. 'I can see the headroom in the business,' says Mr Pow, 'and so can the banks.'</p>

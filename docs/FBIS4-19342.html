			<p>BFN     [Text] One day before the hearing of the Federal  Constitutional Court on armed forces foreign missions,  Chancellor Kohl has stressed that Germany has to assume  responsibility at the side of its partners. If peace and  freedom in the world and Europe are at issue, the FRG must not  stand aside, Kohl said in Bonn in the morning.    During the reception for soldiers who had participated in  humanitarian and peace missions, the chancellor warned that  Germany's security and capacity to act in foreign politics are  based on the allies' confidence. Therefore, the FRG must be a  reliable partner.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOOKING INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA'S FAMED SALMON  </P> <P> "Look down there," our pilot shouted, trying to make himself heard over the  roar of the engine. "It's a pod of killer whales heading north."  </P> <P> As he dipped one wing we could see five of the black-and-white whales 1,000  feet below, rounding a point off San Juan Island.  </P> <P> Six of us had taken off at dawn from Seattle's Lake Washington for a weekend of  salmon fishing in British Columbia's Inside Passage.  </P> <P> For the aviation buffs among us, getting there was half the fun because many of  the fishing resorts along the Inside Passage can be reached only by float  plane.  </P> <P> These are the same sturdy, reliable aircraft used by Alaskan and Canadian bush  pilots for years. They give you a sense of flying the way it used to be.  </P> <P> Powered by a big (and noisy) radial engine, the planes cruise at a bit more  than 100 m.p.h. The route north from Seattle is low and slow, ideal for  sightseeing as you pass over tugs towing rafts and freighters steaming along  Puget Sound.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Island Resorts  </P> <P> After a customs stop at Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, we flew to the resorts  around Stuart and Sonora islands.  </P> <P> The half-dozen resorts, plus more than a dozen others clustered around Campbell  River, Desolation Sound and on the islands off the northern tip of Vancouver  Island, offer a salmon experience that includes accommodations, meals, boat,  license, tackle and guide for one price.  </P> <P> Fishing is from small boats with light tackle -- a real challenge when you hook  one of the 40-pound-plus types for which these waters are famous.  </P> <P> And if you're looking for something a bit more difficult, try qualifying for  the Tyee Club at April Point Lodge, where you must land a salmon of more than  30 pounds on light tackle from a wooden boat powered only by oars.  </P> <P> We headed for an area called "The Drain," where the tide rips through at 10 to  13 knots.  </P> <P> Steep forested mountains rose nearly sheer from the water to several thousand  feet on either side of the half-mile-wide channel. Our guide kept the boat  headed into the current at half-throttle. Water rushed by like a giant river.  Huge whirlpools roiled suddenly alongside, then just as suddenly subsided.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bald Eagles  </P> <P> An eight-foot waterfall in the middle of the channel was created by a submerged  rock. When we would go through this area in the afternoon it would be falling  the other way, the tide change is so great. Bald eagles perched in the trees  and sea birds wheeled overhead.  </P> <P> These resorts are small, accommodating from half a dozen to about 30 guests,  but facilities are modern and comfortable, often including a hot tub or sauna.  </P> <P> At the Sea Lion Rock Lodge we sat down to the belt-bursting repast that  proprietress Hazel Stephenson serves to guests on their last night at the  lodge.  </P> <P> Cold appetizers began with cod ceviche, raw oysters and giant prawns. Each was  served a whole Dungeness crab, poached salmon, baked cod, a bucket of steamer  clams and heaping platters of deep-fried oysters and prawns -- all of it caught  within two hours of reaching the table.  </P> <P> The next morning we flew into Farewell Harbor Resort on the rugged shore of  300-acre Berry Island next to Queen Charlotte Strait.  </P> <P> Dozens of small islands dot these waters. They are so placid in summer that the  resort is used as a base for kayaking trips to watch whales.  </P> <P> Several hours of patient trolling paid off with several lovely salmon,  including a 37-pound chinook.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Fishing season in the Vancouver area begins in May and lasts through September.  Float plane pilots will carry your fish back in the plane's hollow pontoons.  They'll radio ahead to have canners, smokers or shippers meet you on return.  Kenmore Air operates the float planes.  </P> <P> Among the fishing resorts:  </P> <P> April Point Lodge -- Famous as one of British Columbia's most elegant lodges,  April Point is on Quadra Island.

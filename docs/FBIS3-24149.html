			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Suren Zolyan, deputy of Supreme Council of the </F> republic of Armenia: "What Is Good for Russia Is Not Necessarily  Acceptable for All"]    [Text] Besides integration "in the Moscow manner"  there are other forms of interaction.    A study of the post-Soviet space recently made by Andranik  Migranyan in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA is based on a clearly expressed  pragmatic concept defining real geopolitical interests of the  current moment as well as interests that are not common but  primarily Russian. Naturally, with such an approach the specific  concept of "the near abroad" may be determined only with  application to Russia. At the same time Migranyan's study is  dominated by thinking characteristic of contemporary Russian  political scientists: whatever is good for Russia is good for  all, and Russia is the CIS. It is possible that this sense of  succession and responsibility prevailed over a falsely conceived  imperial guilt complex with political escapism prompted by it.  But what if Russian interests become contrary to the interests  of its partners, which, although Migranyan does take into  account, he does not accept as being of equal importance? The  same problem may have another aspect if one proceeds not from an  absolutization of the interests of a certain state but from the  possible long-range prospects of the CIS.    But who is holder of CIS interests? Can there be  Commonwealth  interests different from the interests of each of the states  forming it? Finally, does the CIS actually exist? Is that a  legal form for the restoration of something akin to the Russian  empire, or a channel through which former Soviet republics  continue to "milk" Russia?    Despite the contradictory nature of these publicist rather  than political approaches they are similar in that they  interpret the CIS as a certain extension of Russia. Therefore  those "integrative processes" of which Migranyan speaks, may be  conditioned only by its political will backed up with numerous  control levers--from economic to military ones. In that form the  CIS might develop through the purposeful weakening of all  partners with a dominant Russia. It is necessary to remember  that it was only military failure and anticipation of Russian  aid that brought Georgia and Azerbaijan into the Commonwealth,  and domestic problems made Ukraine more loyal. This, however,  makes Russia itself weaker forcing it to keep those who are  drowning "afloat" and interdicting attempts to involve "third  parties." Will Russia have sufficient strength to act as the  donor, creator of conflicts with subsequent peacemaking,  supporter of regimes loyal to it, while also counteracting  different blocs, particularly since CIS members are  simultaneously members of other unions (the Black Sea Economic  Organization, the Islamic Conference, the Turkic Conference)?  Currently it is clear that the CIS will not become either a form  for restoration of the Soviet Union, nor anything like the  Sakharov model of a commonwealth of freely unified free peoples.  With the weakening of Russia the CIS may immediately  disintegrate or return to its 1992 state when relations between  its partners were reminiscent of scenes in the lodging house  from the stage play called "At the Bottom."    It is, however, possible to view the concept at the basis of  the CIS not primarily as a Russian one. Today the CIS is rather  a club of presidents who for the most part are defending the  interests of the elite they represent and supporting integration  only to the degree agreeable to that elite. Out of the numerous  declarations on the creation of various kinds of "unified spaces  and zones" not a single one was ever created. But there is a  unified psychological space, coinciding with boundaries of the  former USSR, which does not depend on any decisions at CIS  summit meetings and is not politically structured--it is a space  common to all problems, where everyone, by virtue of his  possibilities, resolves similar survival tasks. "The holders of  CIS interests" are not only the national minorities and citizens  who remained outside the borders of their national states. The  small businessman-speculator negotiating at the airport with a  minor bribe-taking customs official, a major industrialist  lobbying the government for credit, the president signing  another edict on measures for the social protection of the  population, and the old woman begging for alms--all of that is  devoid of any national features and is not delineated by current  state borders. It is impossible to get away from this unified  space of common crises, inasmuch as beyond the very first real  foreign border post the criteria are completely different.    At the same time prospects for the realistic development of  the CIS lie not in political intrigues and pressure on weak  partners, but in the appearance of forces, which for various  reasons are interested in the development of the CIS. Thus far  only the communists, who do not acquire any complexes resulting  from accusations of restorative tendencies, are openly appearing  as a transnational force, which discredits the very idea of  cooperation. An alliance between nationalist movements, which in  a paradoxical manner are unified by their opposition to  transnational structures, is planned even though that is not  advertised. But centrist and democratic forces, retaining  loyalty to national sovereignty, are avoiding any organizational  forms of cooperation. The interparliamentary assembly, which  today exists more as an appendage to presidential conferences  and not as a realistically operating political organ, could  become such a form. Parliaments merely ratify decisions adopted  at the presidential level, while their multiparty structure may  serve as an effective feedback mechanism. The CIS  interparliamentary assembly could assume a form close to the  Parliamentary Assembly of the European Council (which includes  not only groups of deputies from individual countries but  interstate factions as well), whose decisions, formally  considered as recommendations, become the defining factors for  interstate executive structures. Even with such a  transformation, however, an interparliamentary assembly must be  supplemented with a nongovernmental formation--a permanently  operating forum representing regional cultural and ethnic  minorities incapable of negotiating parliamentary selection  procedures.    Many problems may be eliminated if a regional approach,  already adopted by the European Community and the European  Council (known as "Europe of regions"), gains an upper hand. It  assumes that Europe consists not just of independent states, but  also of unified, historically formed regions, whose borders do  not always coincide with state and ethnic boundaries. Expansion  in the authority of local units of self-government and  autonomies, transborder cooperation, and even interstate  management through regional parliaments composed of  representatives of local authorities in the neighboring  states--all of these real integrated models have already proven  their effectiveness. But the presently existing CIS structures  do not promote integration and lead to one-sided, and therefore  temporary domination by Russia. It is undoubtedly difficult to  create political and civil institutions which would be capable  of correcting decisions made by a narrow circle of individuals  in power. But then the policy of Russia toward the near abroad,  whose instability at present compels even its most loyal  partners to remain on guard, will lose its quality of  extemporaneous operations by appartchiks.    Alternative approaches are particularly important in  analyzing the situation in the Caucasus. In the study by  Andranik Migranyan the Caucasus occupies a special place as a  model of integrative processes. He proceeds from the political  reality with sovereign Russia, Belarus, and Armenia with their  presidents, borders and flags. The disintegration of the Soviet  Union, however, goes on and its effects continue to be felt even  in the most independent and sovereign Russia. It periodically  finds itself on the verge of civil war. Its troops engage in  battle along the Tajik border but do not have the right to enter  the territory of Chechen. The position of others, particularly  of the Transcaucasian states, whose actually controlled  territories differ significantly from the  national-administrative borders, is even more problematical.    Migranyan overcomes one conditionality by viewing Northern  Caucasus and Transcaucasia as "a unified geopolitical zone in  which similar processes are taking place." But stops himself,  concluding that "Caucasus represents a cultural, religious, and  ethnic mosaic and, beyond the control of the great powers  bordering it, the people of that region, by virtue of their  cultural and historical characteristics, do not wish to or  cannot carry out full integration. The creation of independent  states in the Caucasus, however, is also impossible outside of  the sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the  region due to the ethnic composition of the population, the  small size of such states, and the limited economic potential  and geopolitical isolation." Therefore the solution proposed by  Migranyan fails to account for the peculiarities of the region,  but is adjusted to fit preexisting experience that has not  justified itself: "In order to achieve stability and peace in  that region Russia should establish itself as the guarantor of  national and territorial autonomy of these formations. Just the  observance of the rights of small minorities and cultural  communities, guaranteed by Russia, must allow Russian  authorities to guarantee and ensure territorial integrity of  these new states. Considering the continued attachment of the  Caucasus specifically to Russia, integration of a federalized  Caucasian space with the Russian Federation within the CIS  framework appears highly possible." All of that, however, was in  the twenties. In the inevitably callous language of practical  politics that means a return to the system of microempires,  while the "integrating" role of Russia will boil down to  performance of the functions of a policeman watching to make  certain that the seniors (states-republics) do not harm the  juniors (autonomies and minorities), and juniors listen to the  seniors. In reality this means that Russia will be constantly  drawn into conflicts either on one or the other side, which in  the end will lead to its total loss of credibility in the region  and then its final withdrawal, which will be welcomed both by  the seniors and the juniors (those who manage to survive). I  think that Andranik Migranyan is somewhat exaggerating the  degree of "attachment of the Caucasus specifically to Russia."  Russian tanks and bullets provide a rather swift cure for such  sentiments. To consider that "the overthrow of the  administrations of Gamsakhurdia and Elchibey is vivid evidence  of the fact that they lost the support of the population when  consequences of a rift with Russia became clear," indicates an  unwillingness to analyze universally known factors. The reason  for their downfall was certainly not national indignation with  an anti-Russian policy of these "administrations," but rather  obvious political manipulation.    Andranik Migranyan considers that "the creation of  independent states in the Caucasus is impossible outside the  sphere of influence of one of the great powers adjoining the  region." Today, however, there is the political realization of  the existing "cultural, religious, and ethnic mosaic." The  Caucasus is a unified, even though a heterogeneous, finely  balanced system of historically formed regions. That equilibrium  is very easily disrupted: it is sufficient to intensify one of  the elements from the outside. That is exactly the way the  neighboring powers acted for centuries. Such a policy may pursue  a variety of goals, with the exception of one--establishment of  peace and stability in the region.    The proposed federalization is highly reminiscent of  Bolshevik experience with the Transcaucasian Federation which  included Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan with the autonomous  republics, oblasts, and even uezds contained in them. By virtue  of historical peculiarities of the Caucasus, its real elements  are not the three main nations--Azerbaijanis, Georgians, and  Armenians, but historically formed mono and multiethnic regions.  The natural geographic and linguistic boundaries promoted  preservation of natural habitat regions which in the Middle Ages  were politically established as semi-independent mini-states  (gavars, beks, khanates, meliks) which could not be changed  either by the systematically conducted unification (Russian  authorities constantly changed the boundaries of gubernias and  uezds), nor by the policy of the USSR aimed at consolidation of  titular nations at the expense of minorities. Back in the 17th -  18th centuries small Karabakh consisted of five practically  independent principalities (meliks). Another example, of an  integrated multi-ethnic region (most lamentably it is no longer  such), consisted of Abkhazia. Anyone who has any knowledge of  the Caucasus, will readily suggest this version. First of all  the regional structure of the Caucasus is more stable than its  mosaic-like ethnic boundaries, secondly it serves as a natural  guarantee of the existence of minority nations. Consequently  federalization of the Caucasus could be carried out proceeding  from the reality of the regions.    By way of an example it is possible to cite the Swiss  Confederation which is certainly not a confederation of Germans,  French people, and Italians, but that of regions, cantons, and  mini-states with their own parliaments, executive and judicial  organs and a right to veto decisions of federal organs. The  federation in the Caucasus would be not a system of ethnocratic  states with certain autonomous features "guaranteed" by Russia  but sovereign regions, possessing legitimate power and a certain  form of representation in the CIS and international  organizations.    The "intensification of disintegration processes" of which  Migranyan is speaking, is a natural continuation of the collapse  of the Soviet Union. But it is not understandable why that  process must be labeled as an ongoing "de facto federalization  of Georgia and Azerbaijan" which must still be consolidated de  jure with the aid of Russia. Quite the contrary: the  federalization of these states within the USSR system was  consolidated de jure. The result is well known. It would be more  accurate to call the actual process as regionalization of the  Caucasus. The present struggle of Transcaucasian states for  "territorial integrity" and "intensification of executive power"  (idioms, designating dictatorship, suppression of minorities and  disassembly of structures of local self-government) merely  confirms the actual disintegration of the Caucasus into regions.  Russia, supporting that struggle, is joining in the victorious  war of the "administrations" against their own citizens who are  of a foreign race or against dissidents.    The alleged inability of Caucasian nations to live together  without the help of police is a myth. It is specifically the  small size of elements comprising the ethnic system of the  Caucasus that ensures a balance of power among them. The  influence of Russia in the Caucasus can be stable and  irreversible if it assumes the role of a guarantor ensuring  peaceful creation of the final political map of the Caucasus.  Russian military presence, particularly along the borders is  permissible only as a restraining factor.</p>

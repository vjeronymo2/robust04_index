			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act, as amended, requires the Secretary to publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time the Secretary has not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law. The Secretary, in making that determination, will take into account the data, views, and comments received during the comment period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is not significant and is not subject to review under E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule, if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Council prepared a regulatory impact review (RIR) and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), which are incorporated in the Amendment 11 document and may be obtained from the Council (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). A summary of the economic impacts evaluated apply to small business entities because this industry consists primarily of small entities. Under the Council's recommended alternative that eliminates the sliding scale escapement goal, allowable coho ocean harvests will be reduced in the short term, with the changes in net economic value (NEV) in the millions of dollars (estimates of ^$1.5 million and ^$3.2 million were made based on landings data for 1990 and 1992, respectively). Over the long term, some stock rebuilding is expected, resulting in an increase in allowable harvests and a reduction in the negative effects in any one year. Expression of the spawning escapement goal in terms of a number of fish per mile in standard index survey areas is expected to reduce administrative costs by allowing the Council to use the best available information to achieve MSY escapement without emergency regulations or FMP amendments. At reduced allowable harvest levels for the recreational fishery (under 167,000 coho), the Council's recommended alternative will maintain harvest shares between central Oregon and areas south of Humbug Mountain close to historic levels and minimize any controversy resulting from a geographic shift of harvest from northern to southern areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council prepared an environmental assessment for this amendment that concludes there will be no significant impact on the human environment as a result of this rule. The environmental assessment has been incorporated in the Amendment 11 document and may be obtained from the Council (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that this rule, if implemented, is not like to adversely affect Snake River sockeye salmon, Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon, Snake River fall chinook salmon or Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon, species listed under the Endangered Species Act. This rule will generally apply a more conservative management standard for coho salmon off Oregon and California. Given the integrated management structure of chinook and coho fisheries, the rule will generally reduce impacts and, therefore, have a beneficial effect on the currently listed species. In addition, no fishing on these stocks will occur until a section 7 consultation has been completed governing the annual harvest regime under the FMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has received petitions to list two coho stocks from central California (March 11, 1993), five Oregon stocks (July 21, 1993), and a coastwide petition for all coho salmon (October 20, 1993). In response to the first two petitions, NMFS published a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing its intent to conduct a comprehensive status review to assess all coho stocks in Washington, Oregon, and California (October 27, 1993, 58 FR 57770). This rule will affect many of the stocks petitioned for listing. However, because the rule will implement more conservative standards for the management of coho fisheries, NMFS concludes that it would have a generally beneficial effect on petitioned coho salmon species as well. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 661 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Indians, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  16 U.S.C. 1801  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: January 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Nancy Foster, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Deputy Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

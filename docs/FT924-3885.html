			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: US houses active in London equities VOLATILE trading in the London stock market yesterday left share prices firm at the close of a session featured by the presence of several of the US securities houses. There was a slightly cool reception for a batch of profits statements from leading UK companies but, once again, there was little sign of significant selling. The FT-SE Index closed 6.9 up at 2,771 after moving through a 20 points range during the session. Heavy buying of the stock index futures by a US house rescued the underlying equity market from a dull start which saw the Footsie down by 6.1 in early trading. Later, the Index for December rose sharply as sterling advanced sharply against the D-mark and showed a 13.6 gain at 2,777.7 at the day's best. But the mid-session gain was then in turn trimmed as Wall Street opened uncertainly to show a fall of 5.6 on the Dow in UK trading hours. Traders expressed satisfaction with the market's performance against a potentially troubling backcloth yesterday, which included the continued turmoil in Hong Kong equities and poor economic data from Germany. Two sizeable trading programmes were identified and ascribed to two of the largest US houses; a third was known to have been a heavy buyer of the December futures contract on the FT-SE Index. The past week has brought more favourable news on the US economy and dealers will focus on today's announcement of the latest US employment statistics. The trading programmes helped swell the day's Seaq-reported volume total to 669.5m shares from Wednesday's 624.2m; retail volume remained high on Wednesday and was worth a total of Pounds 1.26bn. The day's list of corporate reporting features included Hanson and Grand Metropolitan, both US-influenced stocks. Hanson's half year figures found a satisfactory response but Grand Metropolitan disappointed some investors. The firmness in sterling in the second half of the session, while not necessarily helpful for overseas earning companies, was regarded as favourable for prospects for the cut in bae rates pencilled in by stock market analysts for soon after Christmas. Most of the activity was in the blue chip internationals, indicating the presence of the US investment houses. Reuters RTZ and ICI all found buyers and there was some selective demand among the pharmaceutical stocks. UK store and retail issues held steady as sector analysts began to look for signs of some recovery in consumer spending which would boost Christmas spending patterns. UK banking stocks also looked firmer, with Royal Bank of Scotland supported following the results, despite the expected news on bad debts. HSBC rallied from the losses suffered in the wake of the fall in the Hong Kong stock market as some UK strategists began to predict that the Far Eastern market was due for a recovery in confidence. Market strategists remained fully confident, commenting that it was not unexpected that the London market should jib at breaking through the FT-SE 2,800 mark after rising so rapidly over the past week. The general consensus that the Footsie will close just above 2,800 at the end of the calendar year seemed to be holding firm.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Markets take it all in their stride . . . so far: Relief at ending the Hosokawa scandal is tempered by worry over choosing his successor Financial markets are supposed to hate uncertainty, but Japanese investors reacted calmly to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation yesterday. The Tokyo stock market closed 0.2 per cent higher at 19,890.98 and the yen ended down Y0.68 against the dollar at Y104.95. As the initial shock receded, many investors seemed to come to the conclusion, at least for now, that Mr Hosokawa's departure signals the likely revival of budget talks which have been blocked by the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The reasoning in the financial community is that since the opposition had increasingly focused on the corruption allegations against Mr Hosokawa, weakening his ability to make decisions on tax reform and trade issues, the resignation is good news for the economy. However, it is highly likely that choosing a successor will not be a smooth process. If there is prolonged backroom haggling over who becomes prime minister or a political realignment hampers the budget debate, the delay in putting into effect public investment and government spending plans could hurt economic prospects. 'It's important that the budget is passed during the next couple of weeks, and it all depends on how soon the next government can be formed,' says Mr Dick Beason, senior economist at brokers James Capel in Tokyo. Mr Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute, says recovery of the economy and in financial markets may be hamperedunless the new prime minister can take political command of both the coalition and bureaucrats. Moreover, the resignation of Mr Hosokawa could affect recovery hopes by jeopardising prospects of a quick resumption of trade talks with the US. The recent strength of the yen following the breakdown of the US-Japan trade talks is hurting Japan's export-dependent manufacturers and threatening chances for economic recovery expected later in the year. Talks between the US and Japan broke off in February when the two sides failed at a summit meeting to agree on measures to open Japan's markets to imports and reduce its trade surplus. The Japanese government had been hoping that a meeting between Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, and Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, next week would go a long way in thawing the chill that has come between the two countries in their dispute over trade. But with the government now in turmoil, a high-level meeting next week in Marrakesh, in the shadow of the Gatt members' meeting to sign a global trade agreement, could pose problems. Political direction is seen to be crucial in breaking the current stalemate. In particular, political instability will damage government efforts to put together a deregulation package by June to present to the Group of Seven meeting in July as its proposal for reducing the country's huge trade surplus. 'The situation surrounding Japan-US ties requires urgent action,' Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, trade minister, said. 'There is not much time left before June.' Officials were, however, less concerned about the impact of the political drama on the Gatt meeting itself. 'Policy is not expected to change regarding Gatt,' said an official at the Foreign Ministry.</p>

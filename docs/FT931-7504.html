			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Letter: Commission has wrong priorities Sir, lain Vallance makes justified criticisms of the European Commission's gingerly approach to telecommunications liberalisation (Personal View, February 18). Indeed, the situation is more alarming than even he indicates. Here is paragraph 18 of the European Commission's recently published work programme for 1993: 'The Commission's proposals concerning telecommunications will be designed to establish for a period of 8 to 10 years a stable framework, approved by all interested parties (regulatory authorities, network operators, service suppliers and users), laying down the various measures to be introduced gradually to promote the establishment of advanced trans-European networks. The guidelines for satellite and mobile telecommunications will continue to be applied. There will be no let-up in the Commission's endeavours to facilitate the introduction of high definition television in Europe.' It would be hard to think of a better example of diametrically wrong priorities. The EC needs to speed up work on trans-European telecommunications networks while slowing down on the misconceived high definition television programme. Bryan Cassidy, European Parliament, 97-113 Rue Belliard, 1040 Brussels Belgium</p>

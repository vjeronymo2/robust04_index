			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Andrada e Silva] </F>   [Excerpts] Brasilia -- The United Kingdom yesterday  celebrated the clinching of a $225 million contract to sell nine  Super Lynx helicopters to the Brazilian Navy as well as a supply  of spare parts to modernize the Navy's fleet of this same kind  of helicopters. The sale, made by Westland Helicopters Ltd.  from Somerset, was the best news heard yesterday in British  business circles. The report was released yesterday at noon  through the REUTER news agency, and was later broadcast during  the evening television and radio newscasts despite the fact that  the selling company had made no official comment on the deal.    Without citing its source for the information, REUTER  asserts  that the contract was signed on 23 December. Westland did not  confirm the amount of money involved as cited in the radio and  television reports. The unofficial figure was learned of on the  floor of the London Stock Exchange, where the company's shares  put in a strong performance. Westland's preferential shares  climbed by 9 pence during the day, closing at 2.65 pounds, or  $3.97.    The contract signed between the British supplier and the  Brazilian Navy establishes that the equipment will be delivered  over a period of two years. During the same period of time  Westland must modernize the Lynx helicopter fleet operated by  the Brazilian Navy. [passage omitted]    The nine Super Lynx helicopters purchased by the Navy will  be  used for war exercises on the Niteroi class frigates. The  aircraft were purchased thanks to a line of credit of 111.505  million pounds granted by the Brazilian American Merchant Bank.  According to Captain of Sea and War Kleber Luciano de Assis,  Navy public relations director, the first unit will be delivered  in June 1996.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Motoring: The seat of success AS MANY motorists know only too well, some cars can be a pain in the neck - and back. According to the findings of a survey by the Osteopathic Information Service, to be released on Monday at the start of National Back Pain Week, 80 per cent have back pain and one in four suffers at worst permanent damage, or at best discomfort, because of driving. More than half are over 30 years old. Men and women suffer equally. The taller they are the more likely they are to get back pain, especially on long journeys. Almost all of those questioned said they were uncomfortable or in pain within three hours of starting a journey. As someone who is tall and a long way past 30, I find all this believable. But why does it happen? The French used to fit their cars with soft seats to cushion the body from the shock of driving over bad roads. The Germans took an opposite view, having seats that seemed stuffed with reinforced concrete. I sided with the French. Some of the most fatigue-free long journeys I have made in cars - from the UK to the south of Spain or to Austria, for example - were in cars with seats into which one sank deeply. And, in contrast, some of the least comfortable were made in cars with seats so hard they barely yielded at all under one's body weight. In recent years there has been a levelling up. In general, French car seats have become harder, German ones a little softer. Italian makers still believe that seats should be a bit squashy. So do the Americans. The Japanese, who once aped German habits so slavishly they adopted hard seats and funereal black interiors for any car with sporting pretensions, have more bottom-friendly upholstery nowadays. British cars demonstrate Britons' traditional ability to compromise. Their upholstery is unlikely to offend either lovers of soft seats or those who would have agreed with the German makers who never tired of telling me that hard seats (like cold baths) were good for you. The Swedes - over the years Volvo and Saab have researched seat comfort very thoroughly - belong to the not-too-hard, not-too-soft school. But there is far more to seat comfort than the hardness or softness of upholstery. As cars have become more compact and more aerodynamic, there has been less space to spare for the driver. Mounting the engine sideways and moving the driver forward can lead to both pedals and steering wheel being off-set to the seat. This is why I never make up my mind about the driving comfort of a mainland European car until I have tried the right-hand steering version over a fair distance. The results can be enlightening - and disappointing. In my experience, Japanese cars nearly always have good driving positions. Years ago their makers got the message that Europeans were much bigger than their home market customers. And of course, Japan has the same keep-to-the-left rule of the road as the UK so their cars have right-hand drive. The Osteopathic Information Service says back pain is as likely to trouble drivers who sit close to the wheel as those who adopt an arm's length stance. It is a personal view, but I find some sporty Italian cars less comfortable to drive than those from north European or Japanese makers. My theory is that they are still designed for the traditionally short-legged, long-armed Italian male, not long-legged people like me. And I settle comfortably behind the wheel of any Volvo or Saab, with lots of space round the pedals, because they seem to have been built for big people with larger feet than mine. The growing popularity of high-roofed, multi-purpose vehicles like the Renault Espace, and of lofty on-off road 4x4s, may help back pain sufferers. Their ample headroom allows a driver to sit upright rather than slouch behind the wheel. People troubled so badly by their backs that they choose to sit at home in dining chairs rather than deeply upholstered easy chairs will know what I mean. In a few days time the Osteopathic Information Service will be going into detail about which cars it considers can reduce the risk of causing their owners back pain. In the meantime, it advises potential car buyers: Try the the praying test. Adjust the seat so your hands just touch the wheel. Arms straight, with your back and shoulders square in the seat, put the palms of your hands together. If your fingertips do not point at the middle of the steering wheel, your spine is slightly twisted. Now the fist test. Sit normally, so you can depress the clutch fully without stretching. Put a closed fist on your head, knuckles up and palm down. There should be at least 6cm (over 2in) between your knuckles and the roof. Next, sit straight, hands evenly on the steering wheel, left foot on the clutch, right foot on the accelerator. You should not be able to see more of one leg than the other. Drive the car for a short time, then look at the position of your right leg. Is it at the same level as the left leg (as it should be) or has it fallen toward the edge of the seat? Is your thigh in line with your foot - or has it slipped toward the centre of the car? If a car passes these simple tests, the Osteopathic Information Service says it should help reduce the risk of your suffering back pain. It may still be difficult to find a perfect fit, but at least the tests will put you on the right lines.</p>

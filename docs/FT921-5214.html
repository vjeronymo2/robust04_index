			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Chief executive to stay on for two further years MR Edzard Reuter, the chief executive of Daimler-Benz, the German vehicle, aerospace, and electronics concern, will stay on for two more years after reaching the normal retirement age next year. Daimler has followed the example of Volkswagen, which extended Mr Carl Hahn's period in the top job by two years until the end of 1993. Daimler's supervisory board, headed by Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, decided yesterday Mr Reuter's contract should be extended until the end of 1995. Mr Reuter, 64, became chief executive in 1987, succeeding Mr Werner Breitschwerdt who was ousted after Daimler had suffered poor publicity over car production problems and was still striving to absorb its new acquisitions - AEG (electronics), Dornier (aerospace), and MTU (engines). It has since bought Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm to extend its aerospace business, now grouped into Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa). Unlike Mr Breitschwerdt, the articulate Mr Reuter was one of the architects of Daimler's diversification, believing other activities were needed for a time when the car and truck markets reached possible stagnation. Supporting Mr Reuter was Mr Werner Niefer, deputy chief executive of Daimler and head of its Mercedes-Benz vehicle subsidiary. Mr Niefer, 63, who joined Daimler as a toolmaking apprentice, will remain as Mr Reuter's deputy until May, 1993, after 50 years with the company. He will then also step down as chief executive of Mercedes to be succeeded by Mr Helmut Werner, the former head of Continental tyres. Both Mr Werner and Mr Jurgen Schrempp, 47, who heads Dasa, are regarded as strong candidates to succeed Mr Reuter as the chief executive of Daimler after 1995. Mr Werner, 55, heads Mercedes' truck operation and has moved it into profit by curbing costs and lifting productivity. Rising domestic demand, helped by unification, has also benefited sales.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Body drier shoots the breeze An inventive, if somewhat bizarre, product from Primacare Marketing of Bolton falls into the category of technology 'worth trying' rather than watching. The Cozydry electric 'body drier' is a unit that can be installed in the corner of a shower stall. It consists of a floor to ceiling strip with several blowers, rather like hair or hand driers. After showering, the user simply turns on the drier and basks in streams of warm air. 'Forget wet towels. Forget the effort of rubbing. Forget the twisting and stretching to reach those awkward places,' the inventors say. 'The Cozydry sensation is like standing naked in a gentle breeze on a summer's day.' Not for everyone, perhaps, the Cozydry may none the less prove a valuable appliance for the disabled or elderly. Primacare Marketing: UK, 0204 386316.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Landline local exchanges can be used to impede competition between cellular providers. Triennial Review, 673 F. Supp. at 551; see pp. 40&hyph;42 below. Cellular carriers and interexchange carriers both rely on local exchange facilities for access, interconnection and transport. The Court has recognized that the dangers from BOC control of an out-of-landline-region cellular system are no greater than BOC control of in-region cellular systems, but has required both to provide equal access and prohibited both from providing interexchange services. United States v. Western Elec. Co., 1986&hyph;1 Trade Cas. &para;66,987, at 62,055 (D.D.C.) (PacTel/CI''), rev'd on other grounds, 797 F.2d 1082, 1089&hyph;91 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied sub nom. US West Inc. v. United States, 480 U.S. 922 (1987). Applying the Decree's equal access restrictions only to the ``landline switch,'' as the movants propose, would be insufficient to prevent abuse of the landline exchange. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> By contrast, the Department's proposed order adds to the protections against discrimination by the landline exchange by prohibiting the BOCs from building and owning their own interexchange facilities, and limiting them to the resale of switched interexchange services obtained from multiple vendors. See p. 37 &amp; n.50 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is no reason to believe that the Decree's purposes end where the local landline exchange ends. The Decree's terms plainly apply to cellular exchanges_as this Court's latest opinion and eight years of consistent application of the Decree to out-of-region BOC exchange services makes clear. This Court has specifically applied Section II's interexchange prohibition and other Decree requirements to an out-of-region cellular system, notwithstanding the fact that the BOC did not control local exchange facilities in the cellular service area. PacTel/CI, 1986&hyph;1 Trade Cas. at 62,060. Subsequent orders, including orders sought by BellSouth and Southwestern, have also applied Section II to cellular exchanges where the BOC does not provide landline local exchange service. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Order, Sept. 27, 1987 (Southwestern acquisition of Metromedia); Order, Oct. 31, 1986 (BellSouth joint venture with MCCA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Attempts to limit the applicability of the Decree to the local landline ``bottleneck monopoly'' read the Decree too narrowly. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  This request for a modification turns on whether the modification is necessary to the public interest. Rufo, 112 S. Ct. at 760. The determination of the public interest, in this specific context, asks whether eliminating equal access from cellular systems will reduce competition in interexchange markets. The cellular carriers' duopoly status gives them the monopoly or market power_terms the Court of Appeals has used interchangeably <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE> _and that market power makes abuse of the cellular exchange an issue of competitive concern. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Cellular exchanges are ``bottlenecks'' if they can be used to prevent or deter a customer's access to interexchange carriers, since customers have to go through one of the two cellular exchanges to reach their interexchange carrier. See pp. 19&hyph;23 below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Whatever it means to `leverage' one's monopoly power, the DOJ is surely correct that no damage can come to competition_through `leverage' or otherwise_can occur unless the BOCs can exercise market power.'' Triennial Review, 900 F.2d at 296 (emphasis added). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Standard economics and antitrust texts recognize that monopoly power and market power are functionally identical concepts. ``Pure monopolists, oligopolists and monopolistic competitors&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;all possess some degree of power over price, and so we say that they possess monopoly power or market power.'' F. Scherer &amp; D. Ross, Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance 17 (3d Ed. 1990) (hereafter ``Scherer &amp; Ross''); accord, e.g., 2 P. Areeda &amp; D. Turner, Antitrust Law &para;&para;504, 507, at 325, 330 (1978) (hereafter ``Areeda &amp; Turner''); D. Carlton &amp; J. Perloff, Modern Industrial Organization 97 (1990) (hereafter ``Carlton &amp; Perloff''). Any purported distinction between ``monopoly power'' and ``market power'' would hardly be meaningful. See, e.g., Hay, ``Market Power in Antitrust,'' 60 Antitrust L.J. 807, 817&hyph;21 (1992). Professor Hay discusses varying definitions of ``market power'' and ``monopoly power'' by courts and commenters, noting that at best the distinction appears to be only that ``monopoly power'' is taken to mean ``a high degree of market power.'' Id. at 817, 818 n. 44. citing Landes &amp; Posner, ``Market Power in Antitrust Cases,'' 94 Harv. L. Rev. 937, 952&hyph;60 (1981). Professor Hay concludes that ``the key to monopoly (or market) power is the power to control price (i.e., the power to charge prices above the competitive level), and the power to exclude competition is an ingredient of that power to control price.'' Hay, 60 Antitrust L. J. at 821. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

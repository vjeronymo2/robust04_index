			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / RHM fights Hanson with demerger plan UNTIL yesterday, shareholders in Ranks Hovis McDougall were waiting for the baking and grocery group to unveil a defence strategy against the Pounds 780m hostile bid launched by Hanson 10 days ago. What they were offered was a restructuring proposal which tacitly acknowledged that the company - or at least large parts of it - was unlikely to remain independent under present top management for very long. Announcing plans to demerge RHM into three businesses, Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman, said the aim was to give shareholders an option to the Hanson bid which recognised more fully the value of their investment. 'What would really be very bad news would be if our business went too cheaply,' he said. 'We would never forgive ourselves for that.' The increase of only 5p to 246p in RHM's shares yesterday in a buoyant market suggests investors were not immediately convinced that they stood to gain much from RHM's own option. Mr Metcalfe said his board had been concerned since late spring about the long slide in its share price, which had fallen to 135p, from 460p only three years ago. The board had already been considering a demerger and decided to go ahead after the Hanson bid. A principal attraction of demerger would be to stop market perceptions of RHM's profitable grocery and cake businesses from being clouded by the problems of its milling and baking division, which have been largely responsible for its weak share price. For the past three years the division has been savaged by a bread price war, though RHM yesterday offered a crumb of hope by announcing that it planned to buy Dalgety's bread baking business for Pounds 28m. RHM says the purchase, which is not conditional on the demerger going ahead, would give it control over about half the surplus capacity in the bread market and three modern bakeries in the south and southwest, regions where it could use extra production. They are said to be profitable on turnover of about Pounds 50m. It was also encouraged by recent flour and bread price increases and by a modest pick up in bread consumption. However, the main bait for shareholders is in the grocery and cake businesses, which together earned operating profits of Pounds 84.8m on sales of Pounds 849m last year. They comprise many household names, including Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravy mix, Saxa salt, Paxo stuffing and Sharwood's relishes. RHM believes the businesses would trade for as much as 15 times earnings as independent quoted companies. They would also be much more exposed to takeover by a group such as BSN of France, which has already expressed interest in buying parts of them. Mr Metcalfe and his colleagues stopped short of saying they wanted or expected takeovers to be the ultimate outcome. But did not seek to conceal the potential rewards to shareholders if they occurred, pointing out that some branded food companies had recently been sold for 25 times earnings or more. Whether RHM's mixed bag of brands would command that high a multiple could not be known until a bidder emerged. In any case, under RHM's plan, the opportunity would not arise until after the demerger took effect in four to six months' time. The plan could also be complicated if there was a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the Dalgety deal. RHM considers this unlikely because the acquisition gives it about 22 per cent of the bread market, below the 25 per cent threshold which triggers an MMC reference. However, the acquisition would give RHM 35 per cent of sliced and packaged bread sales, which account for three- quarters of the total market. That is about the same as the share held by Associated British Foods, its main rival. Given these uncertainties, and the fact that Hanson's bid is governed by a tighter timetable than demerger, RHM's newly-hatched option may offer shareholders less of a straight choice than a fall-back contingency should a Hanson takeover fail to materialise.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          RHM DEMERGER PLANS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Turnover??

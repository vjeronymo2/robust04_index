			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: UK company in Pounds 260m Hong Kong road deal AN INTERNATIONAL consortium including Amec of the UK and the mainland Chinese-controlled China Fujian Corporation has won a Pounds 260m road contract as part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 114bn (Pounds 8bn) new airport project. The award of previous contracts for the airport has prompted criticism that the project is being used as a final 'pay-day' for UK companies before the colony is handed over to Chinese rule in in 1997. Mr Alan Cockshaw, Amec chairman, said yesterday the consortium had received no special treatment. 'Competition for the road contract was intense. As we understand it, ours was the lowest price but only by a short head.' Other members of the winning consortium included Downer of New Zealand, Eltin of Australia, International Water &amp; Electric Corporation and Universal Dockyard, both of Hong Kong. The contract for work on the 6.5km Tai Ho section of the North Lantau Expressway, forming part of the road-rail system to link the Lantau Island airport with Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, is due to be completed in 1996. The consortium is also bidding for the remaining 7km section of the North Lantau Expressway which will carry a six-lane highway, as well as provision for an airport railway and a service road.</p>

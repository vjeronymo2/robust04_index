			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The beginning of a Balkan endgame: The war in Croatia may be at an end, but that does not necessarily spell peace in what used to be Yugoslavia This Wednesday, European Community governments will decide whether to recognise the four out of six Yugoslav republics that have applied for recognition as independent states. After Germany's decision to recognise Slovenia and Croatia before Christmas, it is likely most EC countries will follow suit. The Community may even extend recognition to the ethnically-mixed republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia. Recognition of any of the republics will mean a number of things. First, Yugoslavia as a state of diverse ethnic groups, religions, alphabets, and languages that were welded together after the second world war, will de jure, as well as de facto, cease to exist. Second, recognition will open a new phase in the country's civil war, in which the gaps between the republics - in terms of economic development and political stability - will widen substantially. Third, it will highlight the increasing problems within Serbia, the republic that set out to take control of what used to be Yugoslavia and has ended up sowing discord throughout the former federation. Recognition of the republics goes hand in hand with two processes aimed at bringing lasting peace to the country. On the one hand, the Community is persisting with its peace conference on Yugoslavia, despite last week's shooting down by the Yugoslav air force of a helicopter carrying EC ceasefire monitors in which five of them died. On the other, the United Nations is preparing to send 10,000 peace-keeping troops to Croatia if the latest ceasefire - the fifteenth since the civil war began last summer - holds. The chances that the ceasefire, arranged by Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN envoy, 10 days ago, will hold are high. Unlike on previous occasions, when all sides had an interest in continuing the fighting on Croat territory, some of the participants at least may now have a stake in trying to make it stick. Croatia, having broken many previous ceasefires, has abided by the latest one partly because it wants to speed up recognition. Serbia has supported it because Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the republic's president, faces a growing anti-war movement at home. The army has backed it, not because it no longer has the stomach to fight, but because, as officers now admit, it has lost the struggle to keep the old Yugoslavia together. All sides in the conflict have even agreed to the deployment of UN peace-keeping troops. But are these developments genuine grounds for optimism about a lasting peace? The key to stability lies in guaranteeing what used to be the internal borders of the old Yugoslav federation. These could be undermined from three quarters: Mr Milosevic, Serb nationalist leaders outside Serbia, and the army. The current lull could still be the prelude to a final storm. For the first time since his rise to power in October 1987, Mr Milosevic appears vulnerable. He is losing credibility among Serbs because he has turned his republic into an international pariah; he is presiding over a near-bankrupt economy; and the war that is in part his creation is increasingly resented, particularly by the younger generation. Observers in other republics, who have obsessively analysed Mr Milosevic's every move in recent months, sense he is in real trouble. 'Everything Milosevic touches, he destroys,' said Mr Jelko Kacin, Slovenia's minister of information. 'He has destroyed the country which he wanted to dominate,' agrees Mr Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Hercegovina. By trying to make Serbia the dominant force in Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic precipitated not only the independence moves by Slovenia and Croatia, but the violent disintegration of the Yugoslav federation. By using the army to defend the ethnic Serbs in Croatia, and stem Croatia's independence, he has turned the professional, non-nationalist wing of the army against him. Moreover, except through repression, he has failed to control the ethnic Albanian dominated province of Kosovo which he forcibly re-integrated into Serbia two years ago. He now faces a rebellion from the region's 2m Albanians. In other words, in the process of trying to reawaken Serb nationalism, he has simply fomented hatred between Serbs and the other ethnic groups. 'But do not be deceived,' said Mr Kacin in Slovenia. 'We are dealing with the Balkans where nothing is predictable. Milosevic is mercurial. We have written him off too many times in the past, and before we know it he is scheming again.' The most recent version of Mr Milosevic's grand design is to make Serbia the core of a successor state to Yugoslavia. This state would include the tiny republic of Montenegro, the region of eastern Slavonia in eastern Croatia, and even parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina. As part of that plan, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's 1.3m Serbs, last week declared a republic of Serbs in Bosnia after Moslem and Croat communities applied for recognition by the EC. 'All Serbs should live together,' said Mr Karadzic, who is a close ally of the Serbian president. 'We do not want to live in an independent republic. We want to have a state for the Serbs, even if it means living in a smaller Yugoslavia.' Mr Karadzic, and leaders in Serbia, say this state could be created by changing Yugoslavia's internal borders. In a letter written to the arbitration commission that was set up by the EC peace conference to examine the status of Yugoslavia's internal borders, Mr Branko Kostic, vice-president of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav presidency, described the country's internal boundaries as 'purely administrative', implying they can be changed. 'It has never been established who actually drew up these borders,' Mr Kostic wrote in a letter to Mr Robert Badinter, president of France's constitutional court, and a member of the arbitration commission. 'They do not meet internationally recognised, legal, constitutional and legitimate conditions for gaining the status of borders of independent and sovereign states.' Mr Kostic even warned that unilateral recognition of the borders of Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina by western governments 'would solve nothing but would only serve to exacerbate further relations and would result in fresh armed clashes and the escalation of the existing conflicts.' For its part, the arbitration commission has argued that the internal borders are state borders, and it is only those boundaries which will be recognised by the EC. It says that in law no one state has the right to be the successor to Yugoslavia. Mr Mahmutcehajic, Bosnia's deputy prime minister, says that any change in the former federation's internal boundaries would lead to more instability. He argues that a redrawing of Bosnia-Hercegovina's borders would mean a possibly violent break-up of the republic, the most ethnically mixed of them all: the west of the republic, inhabited by many Croats, would want to unite with Croatia, and nationalist Serbs living in the northern swathe of the republic would want to unite with Serbia. And that would leave a large number of people politically homeless. 'The Moslems, (which make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m population) would be without a republic,' said Mr Mahmutcehajic. 'How can you realistically carve up Bosnia when mixed ethnic communities are scattered throughout the republic? It would lead to terrible bloodshed.' Any redrawing of the republic's borders would also affect Macedonia, whose sizeable Albanian minority might be tempted to unite with Kosovo, while Greece and Bulgaria could become embroiled over historic claims to the republic. Even Montenegro, which wants more access to the sea, has staked an historic claim to the Croat peninsula of Prevlaka on the Dalmatian coast. Bosnian officials believe Mr Milosevic will persist in trying to create this new Yugoslavia, provided he has the support of the army. General Blagoje Adzic, the new defence minister who was appointed last week in the wake of the EC helicopter incident, may back the president's plan. He is a hardline Serb nationalist who still harbours a deep personal resentment against Croatia - all his family were killed by the Nazi-backed Croat forces, the Ustashas, during the second world war. Moreover, since Yugoslavia has now ceased to exist, the army is seeking a raison d'etre - and it is finding it in Serb nationalism. 'The army is now relying on Serbia. The army has been humiliated. If Milosevic does not look after it, the military could turn against him,' said Mr Hido Biscevic, editor of Vjesnik, the influential Croat daily. Mr Stjepan Kluijic, leader of Bosnia's Croats, believes steps must be taken to stop the army. 'It must be prevented from carving up Bosnia-Hercegovina, and from assisting Mr Milosevic in trying to make Serbia and its allies the successor to Yugoslavia. That is why we need the UN troops to be stationed in Bosnia.' Fears that the army and Mr Milosevic will turn their attention away from the northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia to the southern republics explain why Bosnian and Macedonian officials are lobbying in western countries for recognition. The EC's decision on Wednesday on whether to grant it will have a big influence on what happens next in the war. Recognition of Bosnia and Macedonia would legitimise their borders with Croatia and Serbia, and would strengthen their hand in securing help from the UN. But recognition might also provoke Serbia into stepping up its intervention in Bosnia itself. 'The war in Croatia may be coming to an end,' said Mr Mahmutcehajic, 'but we must not delude ourselves into believing Mr Milosevic, or the Serbian army will quietly retreat. We must not delude ourselves into believing peace has arrived.'</p>

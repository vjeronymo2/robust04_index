			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Clearing the air Today's rail strike, the fourth in four weeks, will force a third more cars than usual to battle with Britain's clogged roads. It will also pump more pollution into the layer of smog hanging over southern England and Wales. This week, as levels of ozone exceeded World Health Organisation guidelines by more than 30 per cent, ministers advised those suffering from asthma or heart problems to avoid outdoor exercise. They also called on drivers to leave their vehicles at home and take to bicycles. It does not take ranks of wheezing cyclists to point out that the advice is partly contradictory; it is also an inadequate response to a growing problem. Recent warm weather has been the catalyst for the smog, by causing pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons to react together to produce ozone. While ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from the sun, at ground level it causes coughing, eye irritation and lung damage. But the real culprits are motor vehicles, especially those without catalytic converters and those with poorly-tuned engines. If all vehicles were fitted with catalytic converters, which strip out 80 per cent of harmful gases, this summer's smog would not have formed. Since January 1993, converters have been compulsory on all new cars - nearly two decades after the US took the same step. But the effects will take time to show: converters cannot be fitted to older cars, and cur-rently only 15 per cent of UK vehicles carry them. The government's immediate target should be the dirtiest engines. According to the Royal Automobile Club, 10 per cent of vehicles - particularly old buses and lorries - emit half the pollution. The annual MOT test on vehicle quality has incorporated emissions standards since 1991. If these were met year-round by all vehicles, that would solve much of the problem. But motoring organisations say that many vehicles meet the standards only on the day of the test: ageing vehicles can be eased through the MOT by temporary retuning, while recession has discouraged drivers from servicing their vehicles as often. For that reason, the government should consider tougher roadside checks of vehicle exhausts. Ministers' resistance to this suggestion, raised by health and environmental groups as the shortcomings of the MOT have become clearer, is partly based on cost, but this ought not to be excessive given the vehicle-checking arrangements that already exist. A second objection is that tighter checks would carry an unwelcome air of intrusiveness. But compared to staying indoors in stifling weather, this is a small constraint on freedom. Public concern about dirty air is growing. If ministers fail to act against the worst polluters, they will face pressure to restrict all vehicles in urban centres during hot weather, as is already the case in cities like Athens. It is time to face the problem.</p>

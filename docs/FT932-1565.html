			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Letter: System fails if wages have to fall Sir, Edward Balls' report on rising unemployment in the European Community ('A labour market gripped by 'Euro-sclerosis'', June 21) suggested that the only solution lay in following the experience in the US, whose better performance on employment he attributed to falling real wages. He did not, however, discuss the further question which his analysis prompts, though it stared the reader so closely in the face: why, in a time of rising productivity, should real wages have to fall? To turn to basics, rising productivity means that the average unit of labour (or, to non-economists, person) produces more goods and services. Falling real wages mean that that same person is rewarded for his or her labour with fewer goods and services. To argue that mass unemployment can be avoided only by falling living standards at a time of rising productivity and rising productive potential is surely to point to a massive failure of our economic system. Equally surely, an adequate response to mass unemployment must start by identifying the source of that failure.

Chief Cabinet  Secretary Masayoshi Takemura did not reveal the size of the  package.    Government sources say the business stimulating measures  will  total 15 to 16 trillion yen and will include 7 trillion yen in  income and resident tax cuts.    Takemura said the cuts and revenue sources for them will be  specified in the plan. The government and ruling coalition  parties "will decide in the first half of this week on how big  the income tax and resident tax cuts should be, whether  corporate taxes can also be reduced and how to finance such tax  cuts," he said.    Takemura spoke at a reception in Takamatsu, Shikoku Island,  sponsored by his party, Sakigake (Harbinger).    Takemura, who is Hosokawa's chief spokesman and chief of  staff, said many leaders of the coalition's seven parties share  the view that the tax cuts should be implemented for a certain  period of time before the consumption tax is raised from the  present 3 percent. The Finance Ministry insists the cuts be  carried out in tandem with a hike in the consumption tax to 7  percent around April 1995, government sources say.</p>

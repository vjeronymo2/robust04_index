On behalf of the Standing  Committee of the provincial discipline inspection commission, Ma  Shichang, Commission secretary, delivered a report entitled  "Submit to the Overall Interests of the Entire Party,  Unswervingly Carry Out the Anticorruption Struggle." Provincial  Party Secretary Mao Zhiyong made an important speech.    In his speech, Mao Zhiyong pointed out: Carrying out the  anticorruption struggle in a thoroughgoing, sustained, and more  effective way is an important guarantee for deepening reform,  promoting development, and maintaining stability. It is  necessary to approach the struggle from the strategic height of  safeguarding reform, development, and stability, and to work  hard to achieve good results in the struggle. As far as  anticorruption work in the next stage is concerned, stress  should be placed on continuing to implement the three tasks,  encouraging honesty and self-discipline among leading cadres in  performing official duties, intensifying investigation and  handling of major and important cases, and effectively checking  unhealthy practices. He stressed: In carrying out the  anticorruption struggle, we should have a firm grasp of economic  construction, the center of all our work, to enable the struggle  to better serve economic construction and reform and opening up  to the outside world. In terms of work planning, we should  carry out anticorruption work simultaneously with reform and  development tasks. We should closely follow the major measures  taken in reform and development and inspect law enforcement. In  determining and handling cases of economic discipline  violations, we should make a specific analysis of specific  cases. He urged: We should solve deep-seated problems of  corruption by deepening structural reform, pay close attention  to the departments and links where corruption emerges most  easily, and by deepening reform establish and improve an  internal management system, a supervisory mechanism, and laws  and regulations. He stressed: Party committees and governments  at all levels should have the overall situation in mind and  effectively strengthen leadership over the anticorruption  struggle. 1. Party and government organizations should work  together to carry out the anticorruption struggle under the  leadership of the party committee, with principal leaders taking  charge personally. 2. We should strengthen inspection and  supervision and give specific guidance in specific matters. 3.  We should vigorously support the work of discipline inspection,  supervision, and judicial organs. 4. We should guide the  anticorruption struggle through correct public opinion.    In his report, Ma Shichang, Standing Committee member of the  provincial party committee and secretary of the provincial  discipline inspection commission, reviewed the main aspects of  work since the commission's seventh plenary session.

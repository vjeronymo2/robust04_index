			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / International Company News: Overseas growth helps Valeo to advance 27% Valeo, the French vehicle components group, yesterday announced a 27 per cent increase in first-half net consolidated profit to FFr487m (Dollars 91m) on turnover which rose by 10.5 per cent to FFr11.7bn. The results confirm Valeo as one of France's more successful companies. In the first six months of this year it was able to outperform the rest of the French car components sector by growing faster in the rest of the world. Turnover advanced 7 per cent in Europe, roughly in line with the general increase in car sales, but by 10 per cent in South America, 24 per cent in North America and 30 per cent in Asia. As a result, Valeo made 59.1 per cent of its sales outside France in the first half of this year, compared with 56.5 per cent in the same period of 1993. The company said it had increased gross margins, operating income and net profit, in spite of a rise in its tax rate, increased spending on R&amp;D and capital equipment, and unchanged restructuring charges. It also increased its foreign investments by nearly 10 times, to FFr330m in the first half by acquiring Borg Instruments in Germany and taking majority stakes in new subsidiaries and joint ventures in Argentina and China. With stronger cash flow and a capital increase, Valeo's debt to equity ratio stood at 5 per cent by the end of June, compared with 14 per cent last December and 23 per cent a year earlier.</p>

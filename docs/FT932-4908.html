			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Clan hatreds divide Left from Right The Tory party's break-up into warring factions is reminiscent of the Labour party of years gone by - not of the struggle against Militant, but of the much older battles of the Bevanites against the party's mainstream. These battles were accompanied by anti-heresy drives, witch-hunting and slogans such as a 'party within a party'. The Conservative struggles are reminiscent of these battles in another way too: there was little intrinsic link between the policies which were supposed to unite the members of various factions. Personalities and clan loyalties were more important. There is a virtuoso description by Matthew Parris of the links - or lack of links - between the various kinds of latter-day Thatcherite in last week's Spectator. According to Parris, the former prime minister is emerging as a cult leader. 'Just as a messiah starts his life as a real man with a real plan who does things, measurable things, in the real world, and ends his life as the idealisation of a man, an abstraction almost, whose claimed works are unnumbered and ill-defined and whose function is to inspire, so does this woman now move from the part of her life when she did things to the part of her life where she just is: a visible beacon.' But it is very unclear to what practical path this beacon points. The important element is betrayal - 'that strange alloying of supremacy with martyrdom' - whether by her own cabinet or in the way the Europeans interpreted the Single Market Act. The days when Thatcherites had to defend unpopular actions like tax increases to bring down the budget deficit, leaving ailing firms to find their own salvation, pricing people into jobs, and so on, are long since past. Present-day Thatcherism overlaps another faction: anti-Majorism for its own sake. Of course the latter contains a large element of snobbery; but it is more complex than that. At one time the Tory grandees were just as scathing about Margaret Thatcher. I can always get an easy laugh on the Continent by citing Harold Macmillan's view that her government had 'too many Estonians and too few Etonians'. Perhaps the simple truth is that to be anti-Major is simply fashionable among some of the politically minded young as it once was to be anti-Selwyn Lloyd, or anti-Harold Wilson - whose cosy-glow electric fires were the victims of such superior mockery by Private Eye. Not that the so-called Tory Left, which surrounds the present prime minister, is much pleasanter. Some of its more ruthless tactics - such as putting the squeeze on members via their constituency parties, or uttering dire threats to those who are cool on Maastricht - recall the last time this wing of the Tories was close to the throne, in the days of Ted Heath in 1970-74. Both wings suffer from gangster-like obsession with the question: 'Is he or she one of us?' A weird aspect of the present polarisation is the assumption by nearly all political commentators that interest in European monetary union or even in the exchange rate mechanism is a prerogative of the Tory Left and that no one on the Right would touch them with a barge pole. Alas I must spoil the game with some economic distinctions: even the concept of an Economic Right as a simplification. At one time the Right consisted of protectionists, including Alan Clark when he was not writing his diary. But even the more market-oriented Economic Right has been split between those who insist on a framework of fiscal as well as monetary restraint, and the mislabelled supply-siders who want to cut taxes in virtually all circumstances. 'Old time religion' and 'Snake oil merchants' are the terms of endearment that fly around. This split has been especially evident in the US, but has its echoes in Britain too. To ask which of these attitudes is more Right or more Left, is to put more strain on these terms than they can bear. The more ambitious goals of European union indeed appeal more to the Tory Left than to the Right. But the idea of some kind of exchange rate link, as a deterrent to inflationary policies, as well as an aid to trade, has nothing left-wing about it. Indeed in the closing years of the Bretton Woods system, the desire to leap to exchange rate freedom was a radical one, strongly opposed by financial conservatives. In the 1980s, the ERM was quite consciously embraced by many sound-money supporters as a way of imposing monetary constraints, which would appeal to a broader constituency than domestic monetarism. Left-of-centre economists who criticise the 'straitjacket' of the ERM and the Maastricht treaty are quite right from their own point of view. There was a time when the Tory Economic Right took the greatest delight in quoting James Callaghan (scripted by Peter Jay, who was in turn paraphrasing Milton Friedman), to the effect that governments could not spend their way to prosperity. Now an alliance which I have called the Black-Red Coalition, ranging from journalists such as William Rees-Mogg to Anatole Kaletsky, has sprung up which believes than they can, so long as they use the monetary and not the fiscal route; and that they are stopped from doing so mainly by the lingering desire of some around John Major to rejoin the ERM. Would that economic policy was so easy. Intellectual short cuts are required; but the Left-Right dichotomy is a hopeless method of finding one's way around these minefields.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has reached an agreement with a  delegation of police presently on strike for higher salaries  that has (?set off) allowances for the same categories of  service in the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police and the Royal  Lesotho Defense Force will be increased with effect from the 1st  of June. [sentence as heard]    This follows negotiations between a government delegation  consisting of the honorable minister of home affairs, President  Lesao Lehohla; the honorable acting minister of finance and  minister of broadcasting and information, Mr. Mpho Malie; and  the principal secretary for home affairs, Mr. Abna (Mufase), and  a police negotiating team of seven officers. The agreed  increases were as follows: (?briefed) allowance from 50 to 100  maloti; special duty plain clothes allowance from 25 to 50  maloti for officers, and from 20 to 40 maloti for junior ranks.  Mounted allowance from 17 to 25 maloti for junior ranks and for  officers the allowance will remain at 32 maloti. Patrol  allowance from 4 maloti to 20 maloti. The allowance for radio  operators will be as follows: Grade one from eight to 15 maloti;  grade two from 10 to 20 maloti; grade 3 from 12 to 25 maloti.  Band allowance from 10 to 20 maloti and land [word indistinct]  from 22 to 30 maloti.    The government spokesman said the doors for further  negotiations and consultations with the government would remain  open. Their meetings could always be arranged in consultation  with the government secretary. As far as the demand for overall  salary increases were concerned, this matter would be reviewed  as soon as the proposed Independent Salary Review Commission has  been established.    The democratic Government of Lesotho announced today that an  Independent Salary Review Commission would be established to  review the salary structure of all civil servants. A government  spokesman said that this recommendation was proposed during  negotiations between the Lesotho Government ministerial  delegation and representatives of the police force over the past  few days. The work of the proposed salary review commission  will be carried out by professionals from outside the country.  Toward this end the government will request assistance from the  international donor community to help in the identification of  such specialists and their assignment to Lesotho to undertake  the work as soon as it is appropriate. It is understood that  the work of mounting such a commission was of such complexity  and magnitude that it could take from three to six months to  accomplish.    The former minister of natural resources in the government  of  the Kingdom of Lesotho, Mr. Monyane Moleleki, has resigned. A  government spokesman made the announcement this afternoon  without giving reasons for the resignation. Mr. Moleleki's  resignation from the cabinet was made while he lived outside the  country.</p>

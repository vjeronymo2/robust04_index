			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by reporter Tang Yongxing (0781 3057 5281): "A </F> Visit Promoting Sino-Canadian Economic Cooperation and Trade"]    [Text] Ottawa, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- Vice Premier Zou Jiahua  wound up his 10-day visit to Canada. His visit has promoted the  economic cooperation and trade between China and Canada and  created an opportunity for further developing the bilateral  relations.    Zou Jiahua was one of the two Chinese vice premiers who  visited Canada over the past year. The visits to Canada by two  Chinese leaders during the past one year show the importance  China attaches to the development of the Sino-Canadian  relations. Likewise, Canada also attaches great importance to  Zou Jiahua's visit.    While Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to Canada last May  restored the momentum of development for the Sino-Canadian  relations, Zou Jiahua's recent visit provided an opportunity for  the leaders of the two countries to discuss ways to expand  further the bilateral economic cooperation and trade for years  to come.    During the visit, Zou Jiahua met with Prime Minister  Chretien  and all the principal members of the Canadian cabinet. A  consensus among them is that the Sino-Canadian cooperation from  now on will mainly be in the fields of infrastructure, such as  electric power, telecommunications, transport, aviation, and  petroleum and natural gas, as well as in service trade.    During Zou Jiahua's visit, the two countries signed four  cooperation agreements on telecommunications. According to the  agreements, the Canadian Government will extend a loan of 200  million Canadian dollars (approximately $150 million) to China  for the establishment of joint ventures and for scientific  research projects. Zou Jiahua and Canadian leaders spoke highly  of the four agreements.    During his visit, Zou Jiahua met with the governors of four  Canadian provinces and held discussion with Canadian  entrepreneurs. They showed great interest in expanding economic  cooperation and trade with China, particularly in investment in  China.    During his meeting with Prime Minister Chretien, Zou Jiahua  pointed out: China and Canada are having an unusual opportunity  to develop their relations, and a great deal can be done by the  two countries to strengthen their mutually beneficial  cooperation. Chretien said that both Canada and China are vast  in area with abundant resources, each having its strong points;  and there is a great potential for them to promote mutually  beneficial cooperation. He believed that Zou Jiahua's visit  would certainly promote further the economic cooperation and  trade between Canada and China.</p>

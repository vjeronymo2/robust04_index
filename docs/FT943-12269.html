			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Beef trade fears for sales to EU: Agriculture ministry acknowledges new rules will hit exports The bulk of Britain's beef exports to the European Union will come to a halt this week when new restrictions to stop the spread of 'mad cow disease' take effect, meat traders warned yesterday. 'We've been sold down the river by the government,' said one beef exporter who did not want to be named. 'They've agreed to a system which means we'll virtually stop exporting British beef to the EU.' The rules agreed by EU farm ministers last week were hailed as a victory by Mrs Gillian Shephard, then UK agriculture minister, because they led Germany to drop its threat of a unilateral import ban on British beef. The rules say Britain may not export beef carcases containing bone unless the animal is certified as coming from a herd that has been free of the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, for six years, instead of two years as at present. Agriculture ministry officials are advising meat exporters to develop a market for de-boned beef instead. 'Although we recognise there will be effects on trade, there's no point in talking ourselves into a crisis,' the ministry said. According to figures from the Meat and Livestock Commission, an estimated 107,000 tonnes of 'bone-in', or carcase, beef were exported to the EU last year, some 84 per cent of total UK beef exports to the EU. The purpose of de-boning is to remove nervous and lymphatic tissues which might carry the disease. The new rules are designed to prevent diseased tissue finding its way into animal feed in continental markets. A large beef exporter, who also did not want to be identified, said he would be forced to lay off about 150 people. He feared a knock-on effect on the British beef market. 'If this is winning the battle, I'm glad we didn't lose,' he said. He believed BSE was so widespread that no more than 18 per cent of animals could be certified safe for export, assuming their health history could be traced. The Ministry of Agriculture says there have been 131,757 cases of BSE and more than half the country's dairy herds have had at least one case. The bulk of carcase beef exports are dairy cows that have passed their useful productive life and have been slaughtered, mainly for processing into meat pies and sausages. Tracking the health history of these older animals, which may have lived on four or five different farms, will be extremely difficult, traders and farmers' leaders say. 'Three, four or five years ago that animal may have come from another farm and the seller won't know if there was BSE there or if that farm had BSE subsequently,' said Mr Ian Gardiner, policy director of the National Farmers' Union. However, he said the new rules made sense given the delay in the appearance of the disease in an animal. 'The two-year rule had very little justification with a disease that takes four to five years to show.' Meat companies say there is no spare capacity for de-boning. Moreover, they question whether France, the most important market, will agree to pay more for a service it prefers to do itself. If the continental market dried up, carcase beef could seek an outlet in the UK. That could seriously damage the home market, the MLC said.

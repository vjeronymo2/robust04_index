Livshits, </F> Moscow Disinfection Station; UDC 579.8.083.13]    [Abstract] The complexity and shortcomings of existing  physical, chemical, and bacterial test methods of sterilization  control prompted the development of color nutrient media which  would make it possible to take into account the outcome of  bacteriological control by a change in the color of the medium  itself. This would also make it possible to relax the  bacteriological skill requirements in evaluating the control  procedure outcome and thus expand bacterial control  applications. The following three formulations are developed as  a result of an exhaustive preliminary experiment: a prepared  Hiss medium with a bromocrezol purple (BKP) indicator, a color  nutrient medium with a bromocrezol purple indicator, and a color  medium with a bromothymol blue (BTS) indicator. The sensitivity  of each medium was assessed by its ability to change color after  inoculation by small microorganism doses. A comparison of the  color nutrient media sensitivity to Bacillus  stearothermophilus and B. licheniformis, a  comparison of the B. licheniformis spore growth at 37  and 55C temperatures, the effect of temperature on the  B. licheniformis ability to grow in the bromothymol  blue medium, and the Hiss medium sensitivity with an addition of  glucose to the growth of B. stearothermophilus spores  are summarized. The effort made it possible to develop workable  color nutrient media for analyzing the outcome of  bacteriological control of sterilization and recommend the Hiss  medium as the most efficient; if spores of the B.  stearothermophilus bacteria grow, the medium changes color  from the original lilac to yellow. The use of color media makes  it possible to assess the results by the medium color after an  inoculum exposure to 55C in a thermostat, since the growth  of foreign microflora at this temperature is almost impossible.  Color nutrient media have successfully passed tests in numerous  practical institutions with invariably good marks. Tables 4.</p>

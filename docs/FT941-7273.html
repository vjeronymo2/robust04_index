			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Universities turn to investment bank to help raise private funds UK universities have appointed European Capital, the investment banking boutique, to draw up a blueprint for them to raise finance from the capital markets. They plan to use the extra funds for academic capital projects, such as new libraries and lecture theatres. The committee of vice-chancellors and principals last year estimated that the universities' total need for extra capital spending in addition to that provided by the government was Pounds 3.2bn. Mr John Avery, head of estate management for the government's English higher education funding council, which will be paying European Capital's fees jointly with the vice-chancellors, said: 'We see the partnership as becoming more and more dominated by the universities because clearly there is not enough public money generated through us to support their capital needs.' The first funds could be raised by the end of this year, provided European Capital does not find any serious legal or technical problems. The company's brief is to prepare a blueprint for a financial vehicle company in which a syndicate of universities would raise money. The scheme forms a significant step in the government's private finance initiative, which is aiming to attract private funds into public sector infrastructure projects. It takes advantage of freedoms given to universities to borrow against their assets. By raising money through a vehicle company that will spread the risk for borrowers across several projects, universities hope to borrow on more favourable terms than would be available normally. Their borrowing capacity against assets funded by the government is still limited, so that the costs of repaying the loan must not exceed 7 per cent of their income. However, the funding councils will relax this rule except where it is plain that a university's financial health could be damaged. European Capital aims to produce a blueprint on how the financial vehicle company should be formed by the end of April. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen Republic intends to keep from any  relations with Britain in the future until the law and order  conforming with world standards be established in the United  Kingdom. This was stated by the Chechen Foreign Ministry today.    The Chechen Foreign Ministry said Britain had tried to stain  the honor and dignity of the Chechen people blaming it for a  vendetta.    "Unwilling to cause any additional troubles and problems for  the Britain [as received] and in order to avoid new provocations  and incidents unpleasant for Britain," Chechnya decided not to  participate in the Sytex-94 international exhibition.    The Chechen president's service told Interfax that the  statement was due to the assassination of Karin Reed in London.  Karin Reed was a relative of an Armenian terrorist  Ter-Oganesyan who had taken part in the assassination of the  Utsiyev brothers. Currently, he is serving a life-sentence in a  British prison. After the assassination of Karin Reed several  London editions suggested that this had been a vendetta on the  part of relatives of the Utsiyev brothers sent to Britain more  than a year before and killed by Armenian terrorists.    The official reason for the Utsiyevs' trip to London was to  legalize the order for printing Chechen currency units and  stamps. Scotland Yard suggested that the Utsiyevs had come to  Britain in order to buy missiles and to re-sell them to the  Azerbaijani party.    Blaming the foreign special services for attempts to  discredit Chechnya, the Chechen Foreign Minister stated that the  British special services seemed not to know well enough customs  and traditions of "Chechens for whom the assassination of a  woman an elderly person or a child is a national disgrace."</p>

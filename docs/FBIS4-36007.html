			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Armed Forces Command has  told the Yemeni news agency in Aden that a few hours after the  issuance of the resolution of the UN Security Council calling  for an immediate cease-fire, a development welcomed by our  country which declared that it will fully observe all its points  and will welcome the dispatch of the investigating committee  formed for this purpose, the forces of the ruling military  regime in Sanaa today launched a number of surface-to-surface  missiles on the capital, Aden. These missiles were intercepted  by our air defenses. Fragments of one of the missiles fell on  one of Aden's mosques where worshipers were engaged in dawn  prayers. A number of them were seriously injured and were  subsequently taken to the hospital for treatment. Later a  number of Arab, foreign, and local correspondents gathered at  the scene as eyewitnesses to this [word indistinct] incident.</p>

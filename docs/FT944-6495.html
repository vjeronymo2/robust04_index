			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Company News: Campbell Soup in Dollars 1.1bn purchase Campbell Soup, the US food company best known for its condensed soups, is to add some spice to its product line-up with the acquisition of Pace Foods, the world's biggest maker of Mexican-style hot sauces, for Dollars 1.1bn in cash. Mr David Johnson, Campbell's chairman and chief executive, described Pace Foods as a 'brand jewel' and said the acquisition would provide Campbell with a 'turbo-charged' new business category. The privately-owned Pace Foods is based in San Antonio, Texas, near the Mexican border. Its main product is salsa, a hot sauce accompanying Mexican food and increasingly used in the US as a dip or condiment with other dishes. Salsa, consisting mainly of crushed tomatoes and chilli, has become popular with an increasingly health-conscious US public because it is low in fat and perceived as a healthy food. According to Campbell, US supermarket sales of salsa and other Mexican-style sauces have grown at an annual rate of 13 per cent since 1988 and have now overtaken sales of ketchup in the US. Campbell is expecting further rapid growth in the category in the US and overseas. Pace Foods has 471 full time employees, most of them in two factories near its headquarters. It expects current year sales of Dollars 220m and operating profits of Dollars 54m. More than Dollars 1bn of the purchase price consists of goodwill, reflecting the fact that Pace has the strongest brand name awareness in the US among consumers of Mexican food products. Campbell said the acquisition, expected to be completed in January, would dilute earnings per share by 7 cents in 1995 and the same again in 1996, but would start adding to earnings in 1997. Its shares were up Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 43 7/8 in early trading yesterday. Campbell's existing range of food products includes soups, spaghetti, fruit and vegetable juices, frozen foods, salad dressings, bakery products, pickles, olives and chocolates. Apart from Campbell's, its brand names include Pepperidge Farm, Vlasic, Mrs Paul's, Prego, Swanson and Godiva. The company has been handicapped by the fact that its US market is largely mature, but like other US food companies, it has been looking for growth through a combination of acquisitions and expansion overseas. It now gets about 30 per cent of its sales from businesses in Europe, Latin America and Asia, and the percentage is growing. Since the arrival of Mr Johnson as chairman and chief executive in 1990, the company has shown strong profits growth. In its financial year to July 1994, net earnings rose by 16 per cent to Dollars 630m, or Dollars 2.51 a share, on sales of Dollars 6.7bn.</p>

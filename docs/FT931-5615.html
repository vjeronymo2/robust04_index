			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Siemens in Thai railway bid SIEMENS of Germany is to make a joint bid with the Christiani &amp; Nielsen group of Thailand (CNT) for construction of an Dollars 800m elevated railway system for Bangkok, CNT and Siemens executives said yesterday. The two-line, 16-km railway is to be operated by the Tanayong group, a Thailand property company, under a contract with the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority. It looks likely to be the first of three competing mass-transit projects for Bangkok to start construction. The streets of Thailand's capital city are notoriously congested. Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the international construction group, has its headquarters in Thailand following the recent reverse takeover of the Danish parent company by its dynamic Thai subsidiary. Siemens has expertise in railway systems and rolling stock. Bidding for the Tanayong project is expected to take place in June or July. Mr John Millard, CNT's chief executive, also announced that his company had won its largest ever Thai contract, an order for a Baht 2.45bn (Pounds 67.1m) shopping centre for the Siam Retail group near Bangkok. This so-called Fashion Island will be built on a greenfield site and have 200,000 square metres of retail and commercial space, plus a further 155,000 square metres for parking. CNT is negotiating at the same time to build two shopping complexes in northern China. Stockbrokers say it is also hoping to win a contract for a water treatment project in Bangkok, in association with the British company, North West Water.</p>

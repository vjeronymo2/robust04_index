			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'SONNY BOY': BIZARRE BUT TOUCHING COMIC FABLE  </P> <P> "Sonny Boy" (selected theaters) sounds like a story from a supermarket tabloid:  a petty crook and his transvestite lover raise a kidnaped baby boy as an  animal, caged, brutalized and trained to be a thief and killer. Yet this  obscure little movie, surfacing without advance notice after two years on the  shelf, proves darkly amusing and surprisingly touching, thanks to the  imagination of writer Graeme Whifler and the sensitivity and judgment of  director Robert Martin Carroll.  </P> <P> A goofy -- what else? -- Brad Dourif steals a Lincoln Continental convertible  and presents it to his big, beefy boss, Paul L. Smith, a part-time Surrealist  painter who lives in a desert compound littered with stolen goods. Dourif,  however, has overlooked the infant in the back seat. Smith figures that the kid  will bring 10 grand on the black market, but his lover, David Carradine, a  hairy-chested, cigar-smoking transvestite, won't hear of it.  </P> <P> The story gets under way with Sonny Boy (Michael Griffin), who has had his  tongue cut out to render him mute, at 17. He has by now developed feelings and  yearnings that put him at desperate odds with what Smith intends for him. The  film indulges in some risky religious symbolism, equating Sonny Boy's suffering  with that of Jesus on the cross, and threatening to go sentimental with an  angelic blond who shows love for the tortured youth. However, the filmmakers  wisely opt for a decidedly tentative ending, hitting precisely the right note.  </P> <P> What makes "Sonny Boy" special instead of merely morbid is that Smith and  Carradine are steadfastly devoted to each other and that, although they are  world-class abusive parents, they actually care for Sonny Boy after their own  fashion. The film emerges as a parable about the evil that may surface in  loving people -- and also how hypocritically indifferent society can be to  child abuse. It's this human dimension that makes "Sonny Boy" so unsettling,  yet engaging.  </P> <P> Smith and Carradine resist camp, playing the crazy couple as perfectly sane to  themselves. Griffin, in a singularly challenging debut, is quite credible as  the unfortunate "wild child." Dourif's zaniness adds welcome humor, and Conrad  Janis, as an alcoholic physician, lends a crucial note of sanity amid the  grotesqueries. "Sonny Boy" (rated an appropriate R) just might end up a cult  film.  </P></p>

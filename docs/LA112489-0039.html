			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: PRESS, PUNCH AND PULL: HOW TO PREPARE YEAST BREAD DOUGH FOR  SHAPING  </P> <P> In past columns we've discussed how to mix and knead the dough for yeast bread.  After being prepared, the dough is covered and left in a warm, draft-free place  until it doubles in volume.  </P> <P> During this proofing, or fermentation period, the yeast cells feed on sugar and  produce carbon dioxide. It's this gas that lightens the dough and makes it  expand.  </P> <P> The dough should not, however, be allowed to more than double or it may  collapse back into the bowl. Bread baked from dough that is overproofed has a  tendency to be coarse and dry.  </P> <P> To check whether it is ready for shaping, lightly press a finger one-half inch  down into the dough. If the indentation remains when the finger is removed  (Step 1), the dough has doubled and is ready for the next step.  </P> <P> Punch down the dough by making a fist and pushing it into the center of the  dough (Step 2). This allows the gas to escape.  </P> <P> Pull the edges of the dough to the center (Step 3) and turn the dough over. A  future column will be devoted to shaping the dough into loaves.  </P></p>

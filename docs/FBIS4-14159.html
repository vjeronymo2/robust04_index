			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Jalal Talabani, leader of the </F> Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, by Sami Kulayb in Paris; date not  given]    [Text] Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of  Kurdistan [PUK], has not ruled out the establishment of  relations between the Kurds and Israel sometime in the future  when most of the Arabs have done so. However, he rejected the  possibility of renewing a dialogue with Baghdad and criticized  Saddam Husayn's regime, describing him as a dictator.    In an interview with AL-SAFIR, Talabani said that the  Turkish  military operations in northern Iraq are meant for domestic  propaganda.    Talabani's remarks came the day after his arrival in Paris,  where he will meet for the first time with the leaders of the  French right in addition to President Francois Mitterrand, who  stressed in their meeting one year ago that he supports the  proposal for a Kurdish federation within Iraq's territory.    On relations with Israel, Talabani said: "We have not found  any Israeli who has penetrated Iraq's Kurdistan. No Israeli  delegation has visited us. But I want to ask why it is all  right for the Israelis to visit Cairo, the capital of the Arab  nation and the citadel of Arabism, but they are not allowed to  visit part of Arab Iraq or part of Iraq's Kurdistan? Why is it  permissible for them to hold talks with the Arab leaders but  they are not allowed to come to us?"    He continued: "I want to ask with more frankness. We, the  Kurds, have been historically known to support the Palestinian  people in their just cause and are more than proud of this  support. But are we more Palestinian than the Palestinians  themselves? Do we care more for the Palestinian cause than Mr.  Yasir 'Arafat? He met, talked, and even embraced Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Why shouldn't a Kurd do the same? Are  we more royalists than the king?"    Talabani added: "It is true that there are no relations now.  But I would not be surprised if such relations were established  one day. As we know, relations between a number of Arab  countries and Israel have become semi-normal. Iraq has informed  Israel in secret memos on relations of its desire to establish  ties with the Hebrew state, and Kurdistan is part of Iraq. Why  shouldn't the Kurds have the right to do so when the Arab  countries are competing to establish ties with Israel and when  King Hassan II, chairman of the Arab Jerusalem Committee,  receives Israeli ministers?"    He said: "The talk about Israeli penetration is primarily  based on the Iraqi regime's lies and on the appearance of an  organization for the Jews of Kurdistan in Israel. The Jews who  went from Kurdistan to the Hebrew state carried with them good  memories of the hospitable and tolerant Kurdish people, who  treated them humanely and with dignity. Kurdistan's Jews have  established a society to defend the Kurdish people and  strengthen ties with Kurdistan. This society has carried out  some activities in Israel. There has been talk about the  existence of a relationship. I personally do not rule out the  establishment of a relationship in the future. I do not think  that this will be strange, since the Arab brothers have  legalized the relationship with Israel."    Regarding how relations with Israel will benefit the Kurdish  people, Talabani said: "It is in the best interests of the  Kurds to establish relations with everyone and not be hostile  toward anyone in the world because, as the proverb says, one  thousand friends are a little but one enemy is too much. If the  Arab brothers are accusing us of establishing ties with Israel,  then they are establishing better ones. If a Syrian-Israeli  peace settlement is achieved on the basis of a comprehensive  peace in return for a full withdrawal, then we will welcome it,  especially if Syria retrieves the Golan. Kurdish-Israeli  relations will begin then."    Talking about "the impossible dialogue" with the Iraqi  regime  and about some Kurds' desire to establish some form of autonomy,  he said: "The Kurdish people are committed to the Iraqi  people's national unity. We are committed to Iraqi unity, but  we want a democratic, federal Iraq. We believe that  dictatorship poses a great danger to Iraq's independence, unity,  and existence. Therefore, we want to change the dictatorial  regime and replace it with a democratic one."    The PUK leader added: "It was the current Iraqi regime  that ruled out the dialogue. It refused to introduce any  democratic changes and submit to the will of the Iraqi people,  both Arabs and Kurds. It also rejected the Kurdish people's  minimum demands. The (regime) became very arrogant for several  days following the Russian military coup, and this prompted it  to give a negative reply to the simplest demands presented by  brother Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the negotiating Kurdish  delegation in Baghdad. The delegation had no choice but to  return and the negotiations were aborted."    He said: "I personally have much experience in negotiating  with successive Iraqi Governments. I have been negotiating with  them since 1963. I believe that the experience proves that  negotiating with a dictatorial regime is futile and will not  lead to results. Therefore, I personally rule out negotiations  with a dictatorial government. This is not just my personal  opinion, but also that of the Kurdistan Front, which believes  that action is necessary for the sake of a democratic Iraq.  This is also the view of the unified Iraqi National Congress."    Asked to comment on reports published in some newspapers  citing Turkish officials who stressed that Iraq is ready to  resume a dialogue with the Kurds, Talabani said: "I believe  that this is a new Iraqi lie to deceive the Turks because the  Turkish Government likes to get rid of the Kurdish problem in  Iraq's Kurdistan. It fears the presence of a federal Kurdish  entity and consequently fears the internationalization of the  Kurdish problem. It wants a solution to be found within the  Iraqi framework. Hence, the Iraqi Government is deceiving the  Turks and dropping hints of its desire to resume the dialogue.  But I ask: If (Baghdad) is serious, why doesn't it do so  directly?"    Talabani expressed doubts about Ankara's information on the  losses of the Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK], against whom Turkey  is undertaking military operations in northern Iraq. He said:  "The Turkish figures that are always given about Iraq's  Kurdistan are exaggerated. There are no people, villages, or  human beings in the area invaded by the Turkish forces. If  there are some PKK members there, they have most probably come  from Turkish territories, not to set up permanent bases but to  flee from the Turks."    He stressed: "There are no permanent PKK bases all along the  Iraqi-Turkish border. The `joined' Kurdish forces [Talabani's  PUK and Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party] can control the  border areas. The Turkish Government's objectives in its  operations are to use them for domestic propaganda."    Regarding the reason for the West's nonrecognition of the  political institutions in Iraq's Kurdistan, such as the  parliament and the government, Talabani said: "The reason is  that the Kurds themselves are not asking the West to recognize  the Kurdish government because they do not want an independent  government and they have not announced one. They only announced  federal measures within a unified Iraqi entity. A federation  does not mean division of the state's institutions, and an  example of this is Germany, Belgium, Canada, the United States,  Pakistan, and India. However, the West has recognized the  elections and democracy in Iraq's Kurdistan."    On the nature of relations with Syria, the Kurdish official  said: "Syria has always been a shelter for free Kurds and free  Iraqis. Since the corrective movement launched by President  Hafiz al-Asad, Syria has been backing the struggle of the  Kurdish people and the Iraqi opposition forces to establish  democracy in Iraq, end the dictatorship, and build a plural and  democratic Iraq. Syria has always been and continues to be  friendly with the Kurds." He denied that Mas'ud Barzani had set  conditions for visiting Damascus. He added: "Actually, my  information is the opposite of what the newspaper AL-HAYAH has  published. When I was in Syria, I met with a representative of  brother Mas'ud Barzani, who made a request explaining Barzani's  desire to visit Damascus without prior conditions."    Reviewing the ties linking the Kurds with the United States,  Talabani pointed out that the "U.S. position toward the Kurdish  cause is friendly. The democratic administration under  President Clinton and Vice President Gore has repeatedly  reiterated its commitment to protecting the Kurdish people from  the dictatorial aggression, helping them rebuild their region,  and getting involved in our issues in general. Even if we take  the U.S. stance regarding the Turkish Kurds, we will find that  in his latest message to the Turkish prime minister Clinton  urged her to find a political and peaceful solution to the  Kurdish issue in Turkey. Thus, the U.S. attitude toward us is  friendly and positive."    Asked if the Kurds want the United States to overthrow the  Iraqi regime, Talabani said: "As an Iraqi Kurd, I cannot accept  the dictatorial regime's being removed by foreign hands. Had  the Gulf war resulted in the downfall of the regime, we would  have been happy, but I believe that the main task lies with the  Iraqi people."    Talabani talked about his current European tour. He  explained that before visiting France he had met in Germany with  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, leaders of political parties, and  leaders of the Bundestag, particularly the chairman and leading  figures of the Foreign Relations Committee. In Greece he met  with leaders of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement].    On his current visit to France, he said: "Tomorrow we will  meet with French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, party  leaders, and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. On Friday we  will meet with President Mitterrand. They will be the first  meetings with the French right, and the atmosphere surrounding  the meetings seems to be one of understanding and amity. As for  the meeting with Leotard, we will express condolences over the  death of the French military official who was killed in the U.S.  helicopter incident. Leotard was and still is sympathetic to our  cause. I repeat that France remains committed to its position  regarding the need for Iraq to implement all the UN resolutions.  President Mitterrand has responded positively to our federation  proposal. He is the one who proposed such a solution for  countries with multiethnic groups."    In another development, Talabani announced that he will  participate in a seminar entitled "The United Nations  Declaration on the Rights of Minorities and the Middle East  Peoples" to be held in Cairo 12-14 May. It will be attended by  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and a number of Arab figures,  including Minister Walid Junblatt, Minh al-Sulh, Karim  Paqraduni, Ghassan Salamah, Karim Muruwwah, and Muna 'Ubayd from  Lebanon. It will also be attended by Ait Ahmed, leader of the  Algerian Socialist Forces Front, and leaders of the rebellion in  southern Sudan.</p>

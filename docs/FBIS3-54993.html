The reason is that during  the post-war period a lot of time has been spent on setting up  law enforcement bodies and strengthening them with  professionals, time which has been used by criminal elements.  By the end of 1993, a RIA correspondent was told by Konstantin  Adleber, chief of staff of the Abkhazian MVD [Ministry of  Internal Affairs] Headquarters, that the number of particularly  serious crimes has been considerably reduced. Those who violate  the curfew are now subjected to a fine of 5,000 rubles or  detained for 3-15 hours. No military servicemen or other  persons carrying weapons are allowed on the streets. The sale  of spirits has been banned.</p>

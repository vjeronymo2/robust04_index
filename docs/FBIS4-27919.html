			<p>CSO     [Text] In administrative inspection conducted by the  Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] regarding water quality  preservation measures such as for rivers and lakes and marshes  used for tap water and industrial water, it was learned on 29  May that water quality measures are as inadequate as ever, such  as local self-governing bodies not proceeding with pollution  source surveys for underground water where pollution is  spreading nationwide. The MCA reviewed water quality  preservation standards in the Environment Agency and recommended  on the 30th that they strengthen pollution prevention measures  such as designating pollution sources.    The recent administrative inspection was implemented by the  MCA from April to July 1993, and in addition to rivers, sea  areas, and underground water as the target of inspection, they  surveyed for the first time the upgrading of comprehensive water  quality preservation measures.    MCA surveyed areas where pollution of underground water has  been confirmed due to the effects of harmful substances such as  trichloroethane that is being used in semiconductor washing and  dry-cleaning. Among the 56 districts surveyed, local governments  are conducting soil surveys to designate pollution sources in  only 28 districts.    The attainment rate for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and  chemical oxygen demand (COD) in rivers, lakes and marshes, and  sea areas nationwide was 59.6 percent in fiscal 1975, but rose  to 75.2 percent in fiscal 1992. It has become a hit-the-top  situation in just the past few years.    MCA has inspected the Environment Agency for designating  pollution sources, recommended that they hasten measures,  reviewed the types of water quality to be the objective of use  and the criteria for preservations standards, and is demanding  that the time to reach the standards be shortened. At the same  time, they are strengthening on-the-spot inspections and are  seeking strict measures for businesses that violate the drainage  standards.</p>

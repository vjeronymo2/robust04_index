Foster, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Room N3647, 200 Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20210 (202&hyph;219&hyph;8148). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On January 31, 1994, OSHA issued a new standard addressing the work practices to be used during the operation and maintenance of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. In that document, OSHA also revised the electrical protective equipment requirements contained in the General Industry Standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> I. Correction of the Preamble: Clothing for Employees Working On or Near Exposed Energized Parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (l)(6)(iii) of &sect;1910.269 prohibits employees exposed to flames or arcs from wearing clothing that, when exposed to flames or arcs, could increase the extent of injury that would be sustained by the employees. In adopting this requirement in the final rule, OSHA relied on the evidence submitted to the record in determining what clothing would or would not be acceptable under the language of paragraph (l)(6)(iii). The preamble to the final rule discussed a portion of this evidence as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The requirement is intended to prohibit the types of fabrics shown in the Duke Power Company videotape to be expected to cause more severe injuries than would otherwise be anticipated. These include such untreated materials as polyester and rayon, unless the employee is otherwise protected from the effects of their burning. Natural fabrics, such as 100 percent cotton or wool, and synthetic materials that are flame resistant or flame retardant are acceptable under the final rule. (If and when a national consensus standard on clothing for electrical workers becomes available, OSHA will examine whether or not to revise the rule to require materials conforming to such a standard.) [59 FR 4389] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is clear from this discussion that OSHA relied heavily on the videotape produced by Duke Power Company and on the results of arc tests on clothing as shown in the videotape in its finding that clothing made from certain fabrics was prohibited and that clothing made from other fabrics was acceptable. It is also quite clear from the preamble quotation that the Agency intended the final rule ``to prohibit the types of fabrics shown in the Duke Power Company videotape to be expected to cause more severe injuries than would otherwise be anticipated.'' However, later in that same quotation, OSHA stated that ``natural fabrics, such as 100 percent cotton or wool, and synthetic materials that are flame resistant or flame retardant are acceptable under the final rule.'' Several questions have been raised in the period after the promulgation of the rule in regard to this statement in the preamble. Interested parties have pointed out that the Duke videotape stated specifically: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> All the heavyweight natural fibers we tested performed well. Natural fibers are those found in nature, such as cotton, wool, silk, and linen. We did little testing with silk and linen since most people wouldn't wear them while doing electrical work, but we performed extensive tests with cottons and wools. Lightweight cottons and wools sometimes burned, but without the melting and sticking of synthetics. Heavyweight cottons, wools, and blends of the two did not burn. They actually seemed to insulate whatever they were covering from the heat of the arc. Heavyweight means that a material weighs at least 11 ounces per yard, like the fabric in a denim jacket. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA wrote &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii) in performance-oriented language. That language prohibits any clothing that, when exposed to flame or arc, could increase the extent of injury sustained by an employee. Although the record that was in place when final &sect;1910.269 was adopted did not provide sufficient information for the adoption of a rule specifying clothing that would actually protect an employee from both flames and arcs, the Agency concluded that the record did support a rule prohibiting clothing that could further injure a worker. In other words, OSHA adopted a rule that addresses whether or not the clothing worn by a worker would contribute to injury rather than a rule requiring personal protective equipment. As a result, to determine whether clothing made from a given material meets the standard, OSHA need only ascertain whether that material will ignite and continue to burn under the conditions to which an employee is exposed. If, under these conditions, a material will ignite and will continue to burn in the absence of an ignition source, then clothing made from such material is prohibited by &sect;1910.269(l)(6)(iii), unless the clothing is worn in such a manner as to eliminate the hazard involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

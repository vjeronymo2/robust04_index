			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Perot clears way for tilt at presidency MR Ross Perot will step down next week as chairman and chief executive of Perot Systems, clearing his way for an independent run at the US presidency. A formal declaration is expected later next month. Mr Morton Meyerson, a business associate, will take over the corporate offices of the computer services company which had revenues of about Dollars 200m (Pounds 112.9m) last year. Mr Perot will remain on the board. The Texas businessman has so far contributed about Dollars 1.25m to finance his prospective campaign, including Dollars 850,000 in April alone. He has said he is willing to spend more than Dollars 100m. So far his supporters have officially registered him on the presidential ballot in only seven states, with five more due later this week. But there seems little doubt that petitions on his behalf will get him on all 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. He had made this a pre-condition for running for president.</p>

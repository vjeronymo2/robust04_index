			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / NatWest faces refunds in BES row NATIONAL Westminster Bank and Hambros Bank face a possible repayment of more than Pounds 25m to investors, following an initial ruling by the Inland Revenue that shares in their 'Homeshare' loan-backed business expansion scheme companies were not issued in time to beat the deadline announced in the Budget. The chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, disallowed loans on BES shares unless the shares had been issued to investors before midnight on the day before the Budget. According to the Inland Revenue it would be left to the discretion of individual tax inspectors to decide whether shares had been properly issued in time for the deadline. Yesterday NatWest and Hambros, which sponsored the issue, wrote to investors, and said: 'Despite advice from leading counsel to the effect that the shares were issued by the Homeshare companies before March 16 1993 for the purposes of the proposed legislation, a preliminary indication from the Inland Revenue is that they do not agree.' The banks said they would pursue the issue with the Inland Revenue 'with vigour'. If this is unsuccessful they will consider alternative courses of action to provide an exit for investors who would have made use of the loan facility. NatWest had originally promised investors a loan of 74p after six months for every Pounds 1 invested. Top-rate taxpayers would have received tax relief of 40p per Pounds 1 invested, giving a total increase on the original investment of 14 per cent. Without the tax relief taking the loan involves a substantial loss to investors. The scheme was launched in the first week of March and raised the full subscription of Pounds 25m within two days. It was mostly marketed directly to NatWest's own customers. NatWest's action follows a similar problem for Barclays De Zoete Wedd, the securities arm of Barclays Bank. BZW wrote to shareholders in its Gracechurch business expansion scheme companies last night to say that it had still not received a ruling from the Inland Revenue on whether shares in its Pounds 25m scheme had been issued in time for the deadline.</p>

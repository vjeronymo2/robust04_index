			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Report from Hong Kong" by reporter Huang Tien (7806 3944): </F> "Zhu Rongji Warns Against Inflation, Saying Worsening Inflation  Will Affect Social Stability"]    [Text] Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council on  the mainland, recently warned against inflation on the mainland.  He said that the macro environment is so tight, and reform is  developing in such depth and width, that if the inflationary  pressure at this moment continues to increase or if serious  inflation takes place, then social stability will be affected.    At a recent meeting of experts, Zhu Rongji warned against  the  bad situation that price increases in some mainland cities  exceeded 40 percent and that grain prices were skyrocketing.  Zhu Rongji said: Without stability, there is no point in  talking about anything, and a small incident can disrupt the  historical process, so we must not pursue speed only, our work  must be solid.    At the meeting, Zhu Rongji said citing Deng Xiaoping's words  that an overheated economy can easily lead to mistakes,  development speed must be moderate. When it is too fast and  completely out of the question, we can do nothing but increase  the price of goods, but the masses already have fears about  prices and inflation, and in an economic environment which does  not allow much room for maneuver, we must correctly handle the  relations among reform, development, and stability, and the  overall situation.    Summing up the problems arising from the economic  development  of last year, Zhu Rongji stressed that the socialist market  economy needs macroeconomic regulation and control, which is  very important to the reform of the socialist market economy  system which will be launched thoroughly this year, but the  problem is, for a long time we viewed socialism as planned  economy and capitalism as anarchy.    In light of this, Zhu Rongji once again cited Deng  Xiaoping's  unpublished words that a market economy is not a sign  distinguishing a country's social system. Last year, some  problems emerged from the national economy and financial  discipline was chaotic while the investment scale was too large,  which requires us to keep exploring in future practice so as to  clear a real road.    Zhu Rongji also criticized some people's idea that a market  economy is the special feature of capitalist economy which is  difficult to link to socialism. He said: Up to now, many  economists in the world unanimously think that the market  economy on the mainland has been run very well. At the end of  the meeting, Zhu Rongji said: From the stance of a socialist  country, we think our own road is right.</p>

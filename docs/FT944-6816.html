			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Observer: Hold the presses Poland's bankers are not looking forward to New Year's Day. After the festivities of the night before, they will have to be at their desks busily lopping noughts off bank balances. It is all part of a campaign to restore the value of the Polish currency. It was planned some time ago but has taken longer than expected to implement. The NBP, the central bank, says that it has been waiting for inflation to come down before giving the go-ahead. However, there may be other reasons. Originally the central bank had ordered its new bank notes - depicting Polish towns - from a German printer. They were ready in 1992 but have not been issued because the anti-forgery devices are out of date. That's the official story anyway and the central bank has been at pains to deny what some newspaper reports suggest is the real reason - not only was some of the paper for the print run stolen, but a bundle or two of notes fell off the back of the aircraft coming in to land in Poland. Whatever the motive the NBP shelved the Polish towns and went to Thomas De La Rue for a new set costing 'a few hundred billion zlotys' according to Hanna Gronkiewicz Waltz, the bank's head. These notes depict a trio of medieval monarchs who are supposed to symbolise the hope that this year's 28 per cent inflation will have fallen to 17 per cent next year and 9 per cent in 1997.</p>

			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: AHP faces Dollars 1bn jobs charge A Dollars 1bn lawsuit concerning the alleged transfer of nearly 1,400 factory jobs from the US mainland to Puerto Rico was filed yesterday by trade union representatives against American Home Products (AHP), the US pharmaceuticals company. An unusual aspect of the lawsuit, which also names the governor of Puerto Rico as a defendant, is that it is has been filed under the controversial Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act (RICO), a law which provides for the tripling of damages in the case of a court victory. The main allegation is that AHP, which opened plant in Puerto Rico in 1983 and 1987, made use of US and Puerto Rican tax credits connected to the sheltering of profits earned from the Puerto Rican factories and that development grants and training subsidies were obtained to 'illegally destroy mainland jobs by creating duplicate capacity in Puerto Rico'. The lawsuit says nearly 1,400 jobs were lost in AHP plants in Indiana and Pennsylvania as a result of the opening of the Puerto Rican plants, which make Anacin, Advil and other over-the-counter and prescription drugs. It claims AHP used a provision of US tax law that grants US companies 100 per cent tax credits on profits made by Puerto Rico subsidiaries. The suit alleges the governor and other officials of Puerto Rico ignored their duty to thoroughly explore the adverse potential impact on US mainland employment resulting from the opening of the new AHP plants. It seeks damages of Dollars 1bn and to void a further Dollars 500m of estimated AHP accrued tax benefits since 1985. The case could create a precedent suggesting that US companies might be liable for job losses related to the transfer of production facilities outside the US. AHP said it could not comment on the lawsuit, which it had not yet received.</p>

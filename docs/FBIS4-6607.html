			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- Heads of the ruling  coalition will endorse Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata on Friday  [22 April] afternoon as a candidate for prime minister as  coalition representatives struck a deal on a draft policy  platform for a new cabinet early Friday. The prime ministerial  election in both houses of the Diet is expected to be held  Monday.    Hata, concurrently deputy prime minister, is certain to be  elected prime minister because the coalition has a majority in  the 511-seat House of Representatives.    Secretaries general-level representatives of the ruling  parties reconciled their positions early Friday on two key  policies -- Japan's response to North Korea's alleged nuclear  weapons program and tax system reform.    The coalition executives also decided to ask all coalition  chiefs to convene a meeting around 2 PM [0500 GMT] Friday to  endorse the draft policy platform and name a candidate to  succeed departing Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who suddenly  announced April 8 his intention to resign over financial  improprieties.    Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), the largest force in the seven-party coalition, told a  news conference early Friday that Hata, who leads Shinseito, is  the best candidate from a common sense viewpoint. He also  denied speculation that he will become deputy prime minister.  Murayama currently does not hold a cabinet post.    Talks among the coalition partners had remained at an  impasse  over how to find common ground to document policies in two key  areas -- tax reform and the North Korean nuclear issue.    Earlier Thursday, all the coalition parties other than the  SDP spurned its demands to play down the wording on tax reform  and the North Korean nuclear issue in a policy document for a  new cabinet, officials said.    The SDP earlier threatened to leave the alliance because of  differences on the key issues but decided to remain in the  coalition by seeking a compromise.    The representatives agreed on a phrase requiring the  government to seek "cooperation with Asian nations concerned" in  addition to the United States and South Korea in the event of an  emergency over North Korea's alleged nuclear program.    The agreement was made after the SDP conceded its demand on  the inclusion in the coalition's policy paper of a phrase  obligating the government to consult with China, as well as the  U.S. and South Korea, if the United Nations decides to slap  economic sanctions on North Korea. The SDP has friendly ties  with Pyongyang.    On tax system reform, the coalition parties agreed on a plan  to revamp the current tax system with a phrase seeking reform  based on "public understanding" through possible revision or  elimination of the existing consumption tax but focusing  attention on raising indirect taxes.    The SDP demanded that the term "national consensus" be  inserted into the policy document as a prerequisite for a hike  in indirect taxes, while other parties call for inserting an  indication of their readiness to hike the consumption tax from  the current 3 percent.    The SDP had demanded the abolition of the 1989 consumption  tax, a value-added tax, in exchange for a compromise that calls  for creation of a new indirect levy with public consensus. The  SDP scored a victory in the 1989 House of Councillors elections  campaigning against the consumption tax.    In February, Hosokawa was forced to scrap a plan to  introduce  a 7 percent "national welfare tax" to offset a 6 trillion yen  tax cut in place of the consumption tax in the face of strong  opposition from the SDP.</p>

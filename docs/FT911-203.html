			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Brittan urges dropping of 'hard Ecu' proposals SIR LEON Brittan, the senior UK commissioner, yesterday urged the UK government to drop its proposal for a 'hard Ecu' in favour of improving the existing Ecu basket unit. He did not link this with the overture by Mr Jacques Delors that Britain be offered a let-out in the emu treaty. The hard Ecu had proved 'politically valuable', Sir Leon said, showing that the UK government was taking part in the Emu debate constructively. But, for economic reasons, it had drawn little support from UK partners. Sir Leon derided Britons who regarded the let-out on Emu as a trap or a form of blackmail. There was no underhand deceit in the proposal, nor could be it be considered blackmail for Britain's partners to try to make Emu such a success that the UK would feel impelled to join.</p>

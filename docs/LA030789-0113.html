			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY WILL BE DONE ON TOLLWAY  </P> <P> The agency overseeing the planning for the Eastern tollway has agreed to  conduct new noise and air-quality studies in the Peters Canyon area in order to  settle a homeowners' lawsuit challenging the project.  </P> <P> The suit, filed in July by the Tustin Hills Homeowners Coalition, alleges that  the environmental impact report approved by the County Board of Supervisors  last year is inadequate because it does not detail homeowners' exposure to the  expected increases in noise and air pollution once the tollway opens to  traffic, in the mid to late 1990s.  </P> <P> The Foothill-Eastern Transportation Corridor Agency, which is supervising the  tollway project, and the homeowners group have accepted the terms of the  settlement, but county officials are still processing the paper work and have  not signed it, according to Donna Stubbs, spokeswoman for the corridor agency.  The Board of Supervisors as well as the corridor agency was named a defendant  in the suit.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the settlement, the county and corridor agency admit no  wrongdoing but they do agree to pay for new noise and air-quality studies  intended to compare existing noise- and air- pollution levels with those  projected for after the tollway's opening, using worst-case traffic scenarios.  </P> <P> Equipment to monitor noise and air pollution will be placed at several spots  along the tollway route.  </P> <P> The settlement also calls for studies to assess how the tollway will affect  state and regional efforts to improve air quality.  </P> <P> The Eastern tollway will connect the Riverside Freeway near the Orange  County-Riverside County border with the Santa Ana Freeway at Jamboree Boulevard  and at the interchange with the Laguna Freeway.  </P> <P> Homeowner association leaders could not be reached for comment Monday.  </P></p>

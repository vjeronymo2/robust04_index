			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Aetna plans 4,800 cut in payroll by 1994 AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurance companies, yesterday announced plans to shed 4,800 jobs by the end of next year as part of a new cost- cutting programme. The company said it would take a pre-tax charge of Dollars 145m in the second quarter to cover the severance, benefits and other costs related to the plan. It hopes the job reductions will lead to pre-tax savings of about Dollars 200m a year. Aetna, which employs 46,000 people, plans to lose about 3,000 staff this year and another 1,800 in 1993. About 40 per cent of the job cuts will be in Connecticut, where Aetna has its headquarters. The news is a blow to the north-eastern state, which has been affected by the recent national recession. Aetna revealed that about 80 per cent of the staff reductions would come from four areas of business: group health insurance (about 1,300 jobs lost); property-casualty field operations (1,000); property-casualty claims (800); and systems and information technology (700). The company said that payrolls in the various departments would be reduced by 'redesigning work processes and dramatically streamlining the delivery of customer service, consolidating certain functions, continued downsizing in unprofitable markets and more aggressive cost-management.' The job reduction programme is part of a large-scale restructuring at Aetna which, like many other US insurers, has been trying to bolster reserves and improve profits in the wake of problems with poor-performing property investments. Earlier this month it announced plans to sell its reinsurance subsidiary to a buy-out vehicle for about Dollars 1.4bn. The cost-reduction plan failed to impress Wall Street yesterday. The stock closed Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 41 3/8 in New York, having touched Dollars 40 7/8 .</p>

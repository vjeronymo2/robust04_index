			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARAMOUNT'S EPIC 'GODFATHER III' STRUGGLE;  </P> <P> THE STUDIO'S MANCUSO PUSHES THE FILM TO COMPLETION; 18 COPPOLA SCRIPTS LATER,  THE $55-MILLION SEQUEL OPENS  </P> <P> At the end of "The Godfather Part III," which opens in nearly 2,000 theaters  across the country today, Michael Corleone blows his brains out.  </P> <P> Scratch that. He dies in a diabetic coma.  </P> <P> No wait. He gets shot, then his nephew murders the archbishop . . . .  </P> <P> Well, actually, none of the above occurs at the end of Francis Ford Coppola's  third entry in the Corleone family saga, but those endings were among many  written in the 18 versions of the screenplay during the last two years. Two  versions were filmed.  </P> <P> Even as late as September, Coppola was shooting new scenes that he had just  completed writing. All that frantic, sometimes chaotic, composition has finally  been condensed into the two-hour, 41-minute "Godfather III," which arrives 16  years after the second, Oscar-winning installment, in 1974.  </P> <P> The film marks the close of an epic struggle by Paramount Pictures and its  chief executive, Frank Mancuso, to breathe life into this long-awaited sequel  to two of the most popular and critically acclaimed movies of all time.  </P> <P> Mancuso and his studio have more than a $55-million production bill and an  estimated $20-million-plus marketing tab riding on this movie: Their prestige  is deeply wrapped up in the production. "(The first two 'Godfather' movies)  were the pinnacles of achievement -- motion pictures that did tremendously  creatively, as well as being commercial successes," said Mancuso, who had made  "Godfather III" a top priority of his regime. "You always attempt to achieve  that combination."  </P> <P> The latest episode brings back some of the original cast -- Al Pacino, Diane  Keaton, Talia Shire -- in a story about a Corleone family gone "legit" being  drawn back into the violent underworld by Michael's attempt to take over a  Vatican-connected conglomerate.  </P> <P> Andy Garcia plays Vincent Mancini, Michael's nephew and unlikely heir apparent.  Michael's daughter -- Vincent's lover and first cousin -- is played by  Coppola's own daughter, Sofia; it's a key performance, originally cast with  Winona Ryder, that has met with derision from many critics.  </P> <P> This wasn't always the cast or story line for "Godfather III." Not even close.  Before Coppola and author Mario Puzo got involved, Paramount commissioned 15  treatments and screenplays by at least nine writers. Even former Paramount  chief Michael Eisner once tried his hand at writing a story line.  </P> <P> At various times, the movie was to star Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta and  Eddie Murphy, and Coppola wasn't the only director the studio considered. The  names of Martin Scorsese, Richard Brooks and Dan Curtis were all mentioned. The  story's various backdrops included CIA plots, Colombian drug rings and the Las  Vegas casino scene. Even the original story that Coppola and Mario Puzo  finished in the spring of 1989 changed markedly over the course of  pre-production, production and post-production.  </P> <P> The scripts accommodated major cast changes, most notably the loss of Robert  Duvall's Tom Hagen, the trusted consiglieri of Vito and then Michael Corleone  in Parts I and II, when Paramount refused to meet Duvall's salary demands. And  there was Coppola's own frenetic style, his penchant for writing as he goes,  that caused even some of the new film's fans to lament the muddled complexities  of the story and to acknowledge that it is far from the level of perfection  reached by its predecessors.  </P> <P> "Godfather III" is dedicated to Charles Bludhorn, the late chairman of Gulf and  Western (which owned Paramount), who made the second sequel a kind of guiding  mantra for the company. "He felt it was a brand name, a valuable asset, that  you had to do it," said Mancuso.  </P> <P> Mancuso worked in Paramount's distribution department when Parts I and II were  released and got caught up in Bludhorn's passion for the series. Mancuso was  along when Bludhorn flew Richard Brooks to Paramount's Dominican Republic  resort and tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade him to direct the project.  </P> <P> But Paramount's West Coast office made its own attempts. In June, 1977, Michael  Eisner, then head of the studio, proposed a plot for "Godfather III" involving  a new Mafia family's offers to aid in a CIA assassination attempt in return for  drug-trafficking support. Eisner's regime also solicited screenplays -- all of  them focused on the next generation of the Corleone family.  </P> <P> In a 1978 screenplay by the late Alexander Jacobs (co-writer of "The French  Connection II"), Michael's son, Anthony, tries to legitimize the empire, but  his cousin embroils the family in renewed family warfare and a stock fraud  scheme. That same year, Puzo -- author of the novel that inspired the series,  and Coppola's co-writer on all three -- wrote a 53-page treatment in which the  CIA recruits Michael's son to assassinate a Latin-American leader, while  Michael, posing as a mentally ill recluse, actually runs the family business  behind the scenes.  </P> <P> Dean Reisner (co-writer, "Play Misty for Me," "Dirty Harry") then wrote a  treatment that appeared to build on Puzo's work. In his story, Michael is  killed by a bomb, and an innocent Anthony is drawn inexorably into family  affairs -- much as Michael was when his father was shot in "Godfather I." The  son of Sonny Corleone, Michael's hot-headed and doomed older brother in Part I,  turns out to be the mastermind behind Michael's killing.  </P> <P> An illegitimate son is invented for Michael in a 1982 treatment by Vincent  Patrick ("The Pope of Greenwich Village," "Family Business"). A big-time Mafia  don in Sicily, the son returns to the Corleone fold after Michael's death and  eventually tries to have the sons of both Michael and Sonny killed. Dan Curtis,  perhaps best known for directing TV's "War and Remembrance" and "Winds of War"  miniseries, was attached as the director at the time, Patrick said.  </P> <P> In 1983, Bruce Kawin, a University of Colorado professor and author of the book  "How Movies Work," wrote a treatment for then-Paramount production executive  Ricardo Mestres, in which Anthony becomes a corrupt senator from Nevada.  </P> <P> Two years later, Thomas Lee Wright, then a junior Paramount production  executive, teamed up with former theater owner Nick Marino to write a  screenplay that explored the near breakdown of the Corleone family, circa 1972.  Michael -- solidifying his business as a legitimate operation through a real  estate deal -- becomes the target of both his own family and outside mobsters.  Connie, grooming her son, Victor, to take over the family, seeks revenge on  Michael for murdering her husband (in "The Godfather") by masterminding his  poisoning.  </P> <P> Mancuso, who had become Paramount chief executive the previous year, didn't  like the Wright-Marino script, telling associates that it de-romanticized the  Corleones. Mancuso felt Michael should be redeemed in Part III.  </P> <P> Although their script was not produced, Wright and Marino earlier this year  sought story credits for the final "Godfather III" under the Writers Guild  arbitration process, claiming that much of the Coppola-Puzo script borrowed  from their work, particularly from the first act.  </P> <P> Under the union's guidelines, writers must prove that they contributed at least  one-third of the script in order to receive story credit. Wright and Marino  argued that there were 55 scenes with significant similarities. They point out  that they created the Andy Garcia character, Vincent (though he is Sonny's son  by a different mother in the Coppola script), and they contend that the mobster  Joey Zaza in the movie is a composite of three characters in their draft. They  also note that their script, like the movie, explored a tawdry business  transaction by Michael Corleone as he tries to leave behind the mob and  solidify his financial holdings as a legitimate businessman.  </P> <P> The guild ruled against Wright and Marino earlier this year, a decision that  Marino is now challenging in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> In 1985, Mancuso continued the search for a workable "Godfather III" story. He  told his creative staff that he wanted the plot focused inward, on the family  relationships.  </P> <P> "One of the things about 'The Godfather' was that there was a real model family  there at one time," said Mancuso. "How close they were, how supportive they  were of each other, in contrast to how they operated outside the family. That  was an important part of this: From the Corleones' point of view, the family is  often what drives the enterprise. They often think they are acting to protect  the family from forces outside. . . . Some of these scripts I read along the  way weren't 'Godfather,' they were nothing more than gangster films."  </P> <P> Despite all the past attempts to make a "Godfather III" without the original  cast and creators, Mancuso refused to give up hope that he could get Coppola on  board.  </P> <P> "Every once in a while, I would see Francis," Mancuso said, "and I'd always  bring up the subject. But I noticed that something was very consistent  throughout: He never said no. He always had some reason why he couldn't do it  now."  </P> <P> But there were others at the studio who didn't want Coppola to come back,  principally Paramount production chief Ned Tanen. Apparently, there was bad  blood between the two, sources said, and Tanen wanted to hire instead the  respected Russian filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky.  </P> <P> Still, hoping to spark Coppola's interest, Mancuso in 1987 hired Puzo to write  a screenplay based on a treatment by former New York Times reporter Nicholas  Gage. (Gage then rewrote that script.) Much like "Godfather II," the script  they wrote included flashbacks to the 1930s, when Vito Corleone was building  his power base, interspliced with contemporary scenes of Michael's battles with  drug cartels and other Mafia families.  </P> <P> In mid-1988, Mancuso asked Shire, Coppola's sister, to deliver the Puzo-Gage  script to Coppola at his Napa Valley home. "When I talked to him, he said this  was wrong and that was wrong," Mancuso said, "and then he started to articulate  what the story should be, that it should be the personal story of Michael  Corleone. . . . I said, 'If you think that's what it should be, why don't you  do it?' "  </P> <P> Fortunately for Paramount, Coppola at the time needed money. His Zoetrope  Studios was heading for bankruptcy and he faced a potential $8-million bill  from one of his lenders, Canadian industrialist Jack Singer. Sources say  Paramount offered Coppola $6 million, plus a percentage of the receipts to  direct and co-write the movie.  </P> <P> "I think two things came together" to persuade Coppola to agree to the project,  said Mancuso. "The fact that, yes, he had money troubles. . . . But also, one  of the reasons Francis never said no to me all those years was that if  everything else went wrong for him, 'Godfather III' was something he could  achieve, create. . . . The one risk he had was that we would do it without him.  What came together at one time was his understanding of my determination to get  it done."  </P> <P> Mancuso persuaded Coppola to outline his story, spent $50,000 on a feasibility  study and, in February, 1989, Coppola and Puzo began writing "Godfather III."  There is a widespread belief that the pair wrote the first draft in just six  weeks. Mancuso estimates that it was eight weeks, and Writers Guild records  obtained by The Times show that the pair submitted their first, 133-page draft  to the union May 10.  </P> <P> But that, of course, was only the beginning. Before Coppola began shooting in  November, the pair completed seven scripts, ranging from 113 to 145 pages. (The  final shooting script was 120 pages.) Even after production began, Coppola held  true to his reputation for improvising on the set and rewrote the script nine  more times.  </P> <P> Part of the reason the movie was released on Christmas instead of at  Thanksgiving -- as originally planned -- was Winona Ryder's 11th-hour retreat  from the project due to poor health. But Coppola's tinkering also appears to  have accounted for some of the delay. In September, the director shot 20 more  pages of screenplay, including scenes involving the film's stars and the coda  ending, which the director did use.  </P> <P> Intentionally or not, that ending raises the specter that there might be a  "Godfather IV," with one of Paramount's favorite rising stars, Garcia, leading  the Corleone family into the Mafia's rocky future. Whether Mancuso pursues yet  another sequel largely depends on how much his difficult, 14-year-effort to get  "Godfather III" to the screen pays off.  </P></p>

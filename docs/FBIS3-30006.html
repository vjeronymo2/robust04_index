The SDP had been hoping to join the union for a long time,  but other members from the Liberal Democratic Party, Democratic  Socialist Party and Komeito Party rejected it because the SDP  attached importance to North Korea and refused to change its  policy toward South Korea. The nine SDP lawmakers joined the  union on a personal level and the SDP's membership on a party  level is still not permitted.    Yamahana, who is now state minister in charge of political  reform in the cabinet, visited South Korea last September for  the first time as SDP chairman.</p>

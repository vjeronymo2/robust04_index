			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / UK Company News: HSBC doubles to Pounds 1.7bn - Strong growth in Hong Kong and Asia Pacific operations STRONG PROFITS in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific region helped HSBC Holdings to raise pre-tax profits by 94 per cent in sterling terms to Pounds 1.7bn for 1992 compared with Pounds 880m. The increase expressed in Hong Kong dollars was 56 per cent to HKDollars 20.1bn (HKDollars 12.8bn). Asia Pacific operations made a Pounds 1.3bn pre-tax profit (Pounds 878m). They contributed Pounds 430m of the rise in pre-tax profit, helped by an exceptional profit of Pounds 270m on the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific Airways. The charge for possible bad debts more than doubled to Pounds 1.19bn (Pounds 502m) after taking in Pounds 321m attributable to Midland, Pounds 297m from Olympia and York, and Pounds 90m from Concord Leasing, Pounds 49.5m of which relates to shipping loans. Provisions against Olympia and York now amount to 60 per cent of the Pounds 500.1m exposure. Mr John Bond, chief executive, said it was 'extremely unlikely that we would take another stand alone position like that in the future'. Sir William Purves, chairman, said that although economic growth in Asia had been robust, recession in several of its markets made 1992 quite a difficult year and resulted in 'a significant increase in the level of provisioning'. Sir William said this would be 'a year of consolidation' for Midland. 'The highest priority is for Midland to get its domestic retail business firing on all cylinders, and to improve service to customers," he said. HongkongBank's profit attributable to shareholders after tax and exceptional items rose to Pounds 1.01bn (Pounds 599m). Hang Seng Bank, in which HongkongBank has a 61.4 per cent shareholding, contributed Pounds 486m (Pounds 311m). Both Marine Midland, the US subsidiary, and HongkongBank of Australia returned to profit. Marine Midland showed a profit of Pounds 79.3m (Pounds 94.9m loss), while HongkongBank of Australia made a profit of Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 18.4m loss). Profits of James Capel, the group's stockbroking subsidiary, fell to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 17.7m), after restructuring and other charges. European results were 'disappointing,' while Asia and the US were 'highly profitable'. Net interest income grew to Pounds 3.34bn (Pounds 1.84bn) and other operating income grew to Pounds 2.63bn (Pounds 1.2bn). Despite a rise in operating expenses to Pounds 3.37bn (Pounds 1.78bn) the cost to income ratio fell to 56.6 per cent (58.4 per cent). The group's ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets stayed constant at 12.3 per cent, although its tier 1 capital ratio fell to 7.4 per cent (9.6 per cent). Its property revaluation reserve under tier 2 capital rose to Pounds 1.05bn (Pounds 381m). Earnings per share were 72 per cent up at 62p (36p). The final dividend is 14.2p, increasing the total to 19p (12.71p). Shareholders' funds rose to Pounds 8.01bn (Pounds 4.82bn) and assets grew to Pounds 170.5bn (Pounds 85.79bn). The return on average assets rose to 1 per cent (0.7 per cent). HSBC's 75p ordinary shares closed 20p higher at 624p. See Lex</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Chernyavskiy: "Concept of Economic Policy </F> and Implementation of Economic Reforms in the Republic of Crimea  in the Period 1994-1998"]    [Text]  <H5>  General Assessment of the Current Economic Situation in </H5> Crimea    The main purpose of this concept is to determine the  priorities of economic policy and economic transformations in  the Republic of Crimea for the period 1994-1998 and the  implementation by the Supreme Council, government, and organs of  state power and administration locally of measures pertaining to  organizational, legislative, and political backing for the  reforms.    The concept proceeds from recognition of the fact that the  economy of the Republic of Crimea is in a transitional phase  both from the viewpoint of the formation of a market mechanism  of operation and from the viewpoint of the creation of the  conditions for an escape from the crisis.    The main features of this transitional stage  (transformational recession, according to Kornai) in Crimea are:    transition from a supply economy to a demand economy;    a drastic slump in production;    inflation and hyperinflation;    decline in real personal income;    an investment crisis;    change in the structure of foreign economic relations.    The first proposition is reflected in the incapacity of the  majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises of Crimea  for independently undertaking marketing, drawing up business  plans, and actively seeking solvent consumers of their products  in Ukraine and abroad. Another expression of the proposition is  the incapacity of state-owned enterprises to rationally  distribute income in consumption and accumulation. Combined with  Ukraine's official policy of limiting the supply of money (in  addition to money and credit issue), this is causing a most  acute reciprocal arrears crisis.    The slump in production in Crimea could be characterized by  the following figures. Production in industry as a whole in 1993  declined 11.5 percent compared with the 1992 level. In 1994 the  decline in industrial production has accelerated appreciably. In  January-April of this year the decline constituted 33.1 percent  compared with the corresponding period of 1993. The greatest  decline in production was observed at enterprises oriented  toward imported raw material and intermediate products and sale  of the finished product to countries of the CIS. This applies  primarily to enterprises of chemical industry, light industry,  and building materials industry. The slump has affected consumer  goods production also. In terms of the most important  item--food--production in 1993 declined 12.6 percent compared  with 1992, and in four months of this year, 35.9 percent.    Agricultural production has been slumping since 1990. At the  present time Crimea's agriculture has been thrown back to the  1965-1970 level.    The inflationary processes characteristic of all the  postcommunist countries have in the past two years been  developing rapidly in Ukraine and, particularly, in Crimea. In  1993 the wholesale prices of industrial products grew by a  factor of 43. Prices of the products of fuel industry grew by a  factor of 283 here, food industry, by a factor of 50, and fish  industry, by a factor of 80. The retail price of foodstuffs in  1993 grew by a factor of 113, and of nonfood commodities, by a  factor of 89. On account of the tightening of monetary policy in  Ukraine, the increase in prices in Crimea has slowed  considerably in 1994. In the first four months of the current  year the prices of foodstuffs have increased by a factor of 1.5,  of nonfood commodities, by a factor of 2.3.    A consequence of the general economic crisis and  hyperinflation in Crimea has been a sharp decline in society's  living standard. Despite a growth in personal income in Crimea  in 1993 by a factor of 28, including a growth in wages by a  factor of 23, the price of goods and services grew by a factor  of 60. Thus the personal living standard declined in one year by  a factor of 2.5 approximately. Hyperinflation has hit employees  of the publicly funded sphere and retirees particularly hard.  Over 75 percent of the population of Crimea (according to  official figures) has an income below the minimum consumer  budget. The differentiation of society in terms of income has  increased, but has not yet assumed Russian proportions.    A most important ingredient of the general economic crisis  in  Ukraine and in Crimea has been the investment crisis. It is  manifested primarily in the fact that the amount of capital  investments is declining more rapidly than the volume of  production. In 1993 capital investments declined 34 percent  compared with the 1992 level and 51 percent compared with the  1991 level. Capital investments in production have been falling  at a preferential rate here. Hyperinflation devalues funds  allocated for investments within two or three months and makes  it impossible to recharge them. The corrosion of the production  potential that has been created and the postponement of the  period of the movement of the economy of Crimea onto a  production growth trajectory are the consequences of the  investment crisis.    The vast majority of industrial and agricultural enterprises  of Crimea was created by ministries and departments of the  former Union and functioned as part of the so-called national  economic complex. Following the disintegration of the USSR,  there was a severance of business ties, which exerted a  particularly strong influence on the enterprises of Crimea  oriented toward exports and the rendering of services chiefly to  Russian structures. In 1993 Ukraine's share of Crimea's  commodity turnover grew to 80 percent. Russia's share of the  total commodity exchange of industrial engineering products  declined more than threefold compared with 1991. A sharply  negative balance of trade arose in Crimea in consequence. Some 2  trillion karbovantsy of industrial engineering products were  imported into Crimea in 1993, some 432 billion karbovantsy were  exported, that is, imports exceeded exports by a factor of 4.2,  including consumer goods by a factor of 2.8.    Considering the analysis that has been offered, the goals  and  tasks of economic policy of the Republic of Crimea should  incorporate:    stabilization of the socioeconomic situation in the Republic  of Crimea and the creation of the base conditions for the  emergence of the main sectors of the economy from crisis;    the creation of the conditions for the progressive and  stable  development of the economy of the Republic of Crimea by way of  the formation of stable and effective components of the market  infrastructure.  <H5>  Basic Tasks of Economic Policy </H5>   Considering the specifics of the socioeconomic and political  situation in the Republic of Crimea, the concept proceeds from  the fact that the set goals of economic policy may be realized  if only in their essentials within a period of no fewer than  four or five years. But the situation in the economy and the  social sphere at the present time is such that the fundamental  tasks must be tackled as quickly as possible--within a year. It  is this that dictates the need for the implementation of  transformations in two stages.    At the first stage, which, it is surmised, will extend to  mid-1995, it is contemplated securing a stabilization of the  socioeconomic situation in the Republic of Crimea and  accomplishing the following tasks:    First, halting the decline in production at state-owned  enterprises and stabilizing product manufacture at the maximum  possible level corresponding to the level of demand and not  requiring appreciable expenditures from the state budget.    Second, stimulating a growth of production in the priority  sectors of the economy with the aid of a system of targeted soft  government loans or on the basis of interstate (between states  of the CIS and the Baltic) commodity exchange agreements.    Third, alleviating the negative socioeconomic consequences  of  the transitional period by way of the introduction of targeted  subsidies for individual categories of the populace (thanks to a  reduction in budget subsidies for the manufacturers of  individual types of product).    Fourth, beginning wide-ranging privatization in Crimea and  creating the conditions for the development of private  initiative.    At the second stage it is contemplated ensuring the  conditions for the progressive and stable development of the  economy of the Republic of Crimea. The accomplishment of the  following tasks is envisaged in the course of this stage:    First, evolutionary structural changes in the economy and  the  laying of the foundations for the formation of the optimum  structure of production thanks to an improvement in the system  of the allocation of credit and the taxation of private  investments and the creation of economic legislation conforming  to market conditions.    Second, completing privatization in Crimea, in the main.    Third, introducing the conditions of "smooth" bankruptcy and  providing for the privatization of state-owned enterprises not  capable of functioning without budget subsidies.    Fourth, overcoming the investment crisis and attracting  private, including foreign, investments to the priority spheres  of the economy on the basis of the political and economic  stability that has been established in Crimea.    Fifth, providing for the formation of a stable and efficient  system of foreign economic relations of the Republic of Crimea.  <H5>  Means of Realization of the Set Goals </H5>   The achievement of the set goals presupposes the pursuit of  a  consistent and balanced socioeconomic, structural, investment,  and foreign trade policy that should be built on the basis of  the optimum combination of state regulation of base economic  processes and the development of market relations. The main  means of realization of economic policy is law-making activity  bolstered by measures of organizational and political support  for the reforms.    It is essential to take into consideration here the fact  that  the measures implemented at the first stage geared primarily to  a stabilization of the socioeconomic situation of the country  cannot be regarded as a final version of the reforms. At the  same time they must not conflict with the strategic goals of  economic policy. Proceeding from this, the proposed measures  pertain chiefly to the first stage of the reforms and will be  adjusted subsequently or continued, depending on the results  that have been achieved and the revision (preservation) of the  main reference points of economic policy.    The implementation of the reforms will affect chiefly the  currency-finance and budget sphere, investment activity, and the  banking system and also foreign economic activity and the sphere  of customs regulation. At the same time, on the other hand, it  would be expedient, particularly at the first stage, to  concentrate efforts on two basic problems:    stabilization of the production sphere and the adoption to  this end of emergency measures in the sphere of industrial and  agricultural policy;    the adoption of programs of social support for the populace.  <H5>  Measures To Stabilize the Production Sphere </H5>   The main directions of industrial and agricultural  policy are dictated by the need to halt the slump in  production and to alleviate the negative consequences of  structural reorganization in sectors of the production sphere.  These tasks, while essentially local, will determine,  nonetheless, the success of all the strategic designs of the  Government of the Republic of Crimea. Despite the diversity of  causes of the crisis in the production sphere, it is proposed  putting the emphasis in industrial and agricultural policy on a  resolution of the following problems:    an improvement in financial and tax legislation and the  conditions of foreign economic activity;    the establishment of business relations between enterprises  of the Republic of Crimea and the suppliers of material and  technical resources from other countries of the CIS and the  Baltic;    an improvement in the system of centralized and commercial  lending;    the replenishment of enterprises' financial resources.    An improvement in financial and tax legislation and  also the conditions of foreign economic activity is an  essential condition of the stabilization in Crimea of sectors of  industry and the national economy. It is planned in the sphere  of taxation to implement a set of measures for easing the tax  burden. These measures will include a gradual lowering of the  tax rate (this applies primarily to value-added tax and profits  tax), a limitation of the number of levyable types of tax, a  simplification of the taxation procedure, and the establishment  of preferential tax rates for individual subjects of economic  activity. The government intends simultaneously implementing  measures to reinforce the tax system.    Currency legislation requires a certain liberalization. The  first steps in this direction have already been taken.  Nonetheless, the general approach to the problem of expansion of  the circulation of foreign currencies in cash and noncash form  should be balanced and cautious. It is essential to consider  that substantial numbers of the population of Crimea are  employed in the publicly funded sphere and that retirees have  income that is almost exclusively in the national currency of  Ukraine.    In the sphere of regulation of foreign economic activity it  is essential to switch to a more simplified procedure of the  issue of licenses for export-import transactions and to shorten  the list of commodities subject to export restrictions.    The system of accounting for the results of economic  activity  of enterprises of all types of ownership, specifically, the  current procedure of attribution of outlays to production costs,  requires improvement.    It is impossible to restore the business ties of  enterprises without serious state support, the sense of which  amounts to the creation of a guaranteed market of goods and  services.    As already observed, the balance of production and  consumption in the republic is shaping up such that a  substantial part of the gross product passes through foreign  trade channels. Negotiations and the conclusion of agreements at  government level with other states of the CIS and the Baltic on  reciprocal supplies of commodities in accordance with an agreed  product list could be a principal step, therefore, in the  creation of a stable market for the products manufactured and  consumed by enterprises of Crimea.    The government should contribute to the creation at  state-owned enterprises of a modern service for marketing and  the compilation of business plans and systems of determination  of the economic efficiency of investment projects. This also  should contribute to the establishment of business ties between  enterprises of the Republic of Crimea and suppliers and  consumers of their products in countries of the CIS, the Baltic,  and the far abroad.    Reciprocal supplies in accordance with intergovernmental  agreements could be undertaken not only by state-owned but also  private enterprises, and enterprises and firms could be enlisted  in the fulfillment of supplies on a competitive basis, what is  more. At the same time it would be expedient for the Government  of the Republic of Crimea, when negotiating, to proceed from the  commodity flows that had been established prior to the crisis  and in whose preservation both the governments and the local  authorities of other states are interested. This would  predetermine the enlistment in the fulfillment of the said  supplies chiefly of state-owned enterprises that have an  established list of manufactured products.    It is essential in parallel to stimulate the establishment  of  direct business ties between enterprises of the Republic of  Crimea and their partners in other states. The officially  approved formats of the supply of vegetables and fruit to the  northern parts of Russia and the sale of passes for health  center-resort treatment directly at enterprises of other  republics could constitute a basis for such mutual relations.    An improvement in the system of centralized and  commercial lending presupposes primarily the organization  of a negotiating process between the Government of Ukraine and  the National Bank of Ukraine for the normalization of the  allocation to Crimea of credit resources at the effective  discount rate. At the present time the National Bank makes  resources available to the ministries and departments, which  then channel them to the enterprises. Under these conditions an  acute shortage of credit resources has come about in Crimea, and  there is a large gap between the discount and commercial lending  rate. As a result of the negotiating process Crimea, as a  region, should obtain a certain quota of centralized credit  resources of Ukraine. These resources should be distributed by  the Republic Bank of Crimea in the priority directions  determined by the Government of Crimea. The commercial banks,  via which the credit resources would be channeled to the  consumers, must not raise the National Bank of Ukraine rate  above the margin established by the Republic Bank of Crimea.    The shortage of financial resources of the  enterprises may be overcome by use of the system of the  preferential financing and stimulation of commodity-exchange  transactions.    The system of preferential financing should differ  fundamentally from that employed earlier in Ukraine and in  Russia, in accordance with which financial resources were  allocated from the state budget via the central banks at an  artificially low rate. It is proposed putting the main emphasis  on the attraction of the financial resources of the commercial  banks, not only Crimean but also those of Ukraine, Russia, and  other states of the CIS, what is more, at the market interest  rate with compensation for the difference between the current  and preferential credit rate from resources of the state budget.  The recipient enterprise must guarantee here repayment of the  credit subsidies from an increase in taxes paid to the treasury.  The level of the preferential rate will be established at the  time of the adoption of the budget of the Republic of Crimea  with regard to the priority nature of the sectors of the  national economy.    Considering the limited possibilities of the republic  budget,  the agro-industrial complex should remain a most important  sphere of soft loans.    The stimulation of commodity-exchange transactions is a  forced step partially compensating for Crimean enterprises' lack  of financial resources. The system of stimulation should be  structured predominantly on the basis of the granting of  commodity-exchange tax privileges if the "product for raw  material components" or "product for production engineering  equipment" exchange format is observed. In this case the losses  of the state budget in the granting of these privileges would be  partially or even fully compensated thanks to the increased  taxes from the growth of the production of the enterprises in  receipt of these privileges.    The broad-based privatization of enterprises of state and  municipal ownership should begin in Crimea at the first stage.  It would be expedient beginning the privatization with small and  medium-sized enterprises. It is essential in the organization of  the privatization process to take account of the interests both  of the work force and of persons employed in the publicly funded  sphere and retirees with registered privatization accounts  (vatsily). It would be expedient in the privatization of  large-scale properties to organize investment bids to attract  additional funds for their reconstruction and development.    Privatization should lend new impetus to the development of  Crimea's enterprises, increase the interest of the work force in  the results of their activity, stimulate the more rational  distribution of the newly created value, and increase the rate  of savings in profits.    The broad-based privatization of the land and also  properties  of the recreational sphere is not contemplated at the first  stage of implementation of the reforms in Crimea.    The anticipated result of the proposed measures is  the restoration of business ties of the enterprises of the  Republic of Crimea and a partial resolution of the problem of  arrears and the lack of financial resources. The expenditure of  the state budget on implementation of the said measures would be  negligible and would not exceed the current level of subsidies  for the public sector. Time of implementation--within the first  stage of the reforms, with subsequent adjustment.</p>

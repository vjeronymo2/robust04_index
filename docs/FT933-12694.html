			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / EC acts on state subsidies THE European Commission yesterday took action over more than Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m) of state aid to industries in Italy and Austria. In separate decisions, the Commission recommended withdrawal of favourable EC tariffs for two motor plants and a television factory in Austria, involving General Motors, Steyr Nutzfahrzeuge, and Grundig respectively. It also banned payment of Dollars 120m of Italian government subsidies to Cartiere de Garda, a paper company in northern Italy owned by Bertelsmann, the German publishing empire. The Commission's decisions reflect the tough line on state aid adopted by Mr Karel Van Miert, the Belgian commissioner responsible for competition policy. In the Austrian cases, the Commission made clear that it could soften its stance if Vienna cut subsidies.</p>

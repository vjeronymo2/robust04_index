			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELTER IMPERATIVE  </P> <P> Half a million of the poorest men, women and children in Los Angeles live in  houses, apartments, garages or cardboard boxes that are either too expensive,  too dangerous or too flimsy. For a city with the wealth and potential of Los  Angeles, housing conditions are both scandalous and critical.  </P> <P> The creation of a new City Council housing committee headed by Gloria Molina is  a good sign that city officials finally are prepared to give the city's housing  disaster the attention it demands. Molina is determined to get a proper housing  effort organized, to get the hammers swinging and concrete pouring and to  concentrate on the areas of greatest need.  </P> <P> Molina soon plans to take up one proposal that is crucial to solving the  housing shortage. Her committee will consider creation of a strong commission  of housing experts, civic leaders and others who care deeply about the plight  of people without decent housing and who can, among other things, get the  city's many housing activities moving in the same direction.  </P> <P> Perhaps more important than a watchdog role, a commission of people dedicated  to cleaning up the problem could serve as a valuable source of ideas for  raising money, for long-range planning and creative new approaches to housing  without getting tangled up in politics. Mayor Tom Bradley's blue-ribbon housing  committee recommended such a body months ago; it is past time to act on the  recommendation.  </P> <P> The city needs more money to address housing needs and it must move  aggressively to get it. One potential source would be a fee on commercial  construction that would raise money for housing. That is a sound idea. The  workers in those new office buildings will need housing. A fee of $7.50 a  square foot would raise $75 million a year for housing. The City Council has  called for bids for a study, required by law, to determine if commercial  development has any environmental impact on housing needs. Also at issue is  whether such a fee would slow up development in the downtown area or other  parts of the city. Similar fees have been levied in other cities, including  Boston and San Francisco, without creating a drag on new development.  </P> <P> Thousands of families are trapped in poor housing. They live in old brick  apartments threatened by earthquakes, in housing projects invaded by crime, in  airless garages and in other cramped quarters. They can do no better. Los  Angeles can and must do better.  </P></p>

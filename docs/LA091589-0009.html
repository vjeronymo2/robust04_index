			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'INTERVENING IN ULSTER'  </P> <P> My response to your editorial was one of sadness and surprise.  </P> <P> Sad, because the editorial did not address what the bill is all about. The  implication that the only people who support this bill are IRA members is  simply false. The bill has already passed in 12 U.S. states in the East and the  Midwest. It has the support of all sorts of people as diverse as Sens. Orrin  Hatch (R-Utah), Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), to  name a few. Are you implying that these people are also IRA supporters?  </P> <P> Come on, I expect more from The Times.  </P> <P> JAMES CARTY  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

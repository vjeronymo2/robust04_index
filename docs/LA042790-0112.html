			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HEARING IS SCHEDULED ON INCORPORATION DELAY  </P> <P> A judge Thursday set a May 9 hearing to decide whether to prevent Los Angeles  County supervisors from delaying Malibu's incorporation until next year --  assuming voters approve cityhood June 5.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski agreed to hear the matter after lawyers for  the county asked that Judge Dzintra Janavs be disqualified from the case.  </P> <P> Under an order from Janavs, the supervisors last month approved going ahead  with the election, but voted to delay the actual incorporation date until March  28, 1991, if cityhood is approved. The delay is intended to allow the county  time to start work on a sewer system it has long wanted to build in Malibu  before a new local government has the chance to block it.  </P> <P> Cityhood backers have asked the court to disallow the delay.  </P></p>

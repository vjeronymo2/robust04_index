			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Edinburgh to top British growth table EDINBURGH will be the fastest growing of Britain's big cities in the 1990s, while economic activity in London will be held back by a fragile manufacturing base, traffic jams and a contraction in business services, a report published today predicts. The European Economic Research and Advisory Consortium, a group of European research institutes, says that out of 32 European cities, five of the bottom eight ranked according to their 1990s growth potential are in Britain. Edinburgh occupies a respectable 14th position, but London manages only a poor 28th. Manchester and Birmingham are at the bottom of the league table, and Glasgow and Cardiff rank 25th and 27th respectively. Frankfurt, Paris and Amsterdam - rivals to London as centres for financial services - rank higher at 11th, 12th and 13th. London scores highly as a centre for banking and investment and as a headquarters for multinational companies, but its growth potential may be constrained by poor transport links and failure by the UK to participate fully in European economic integration. The UK economy as a whole is expected to grow relatively quickly in the next year or so compared with other parts of Europe, but many big British cities will continue the trend of the past 30 years and lose out economically in relation to the countryside or suburbs. Of the 32 cities Barcelona, Dublin, Lisbon, Berlin and Hamburg come out with the highest ratings for likely economic growth. Barcelona is considered capable of average growth of 3.4 per cent a year up to 1997, but London is likely to achieve a comparable figure of just 1.2 per cent. Other also-rans in the bottom eight of the league table include Turin, Dusseldorf and Cologne. The report says that the declining share of manufacturing activity in the economies of many big UK cities during the 1980s is a pivotal reason for their relatively low growth prospects.

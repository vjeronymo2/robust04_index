			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press communique of the Office of the Royal Government's </F> Spokesman concerning the roundtable meeting" issued in Pyongyang  on 28 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] The roundtable meeting was held from 27 to 28 May  1994 at the Chhanghsu-on Royal Residence in Pyongyang, the DPRK,  under the lofty chairmanship of His Majesty King Norodom  Sihanouk Varaman, king of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KoC] with the  participation of Samdech Chea Sim, chairman of the National  Assembly; Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun  Sen, first and second prime ministers of the KoC and  co-commanders in chief of the Khmer Royal Armed forces [KRAF];  and Khieu Samphan, head of the Khmer Rouge delegation.    Attending the meeting as observers were members of the  King's  Council and especially the two Buddhist supreme patriarchs,  Venerable Mongkol Teppeacha, and Venerable Moha Khousananda.    The KoC, representing a legal and legitimate institution  established through the free and fair elections in May 1993,  concretely responded to His Majesty's initiative for the  roundtable.    This manifests the KoC delegation's strong support, full of  unswerving goodwill, for the King's policy for peace and  national reconciliation.    (?During the meeting), the KoC delegation proposed that the  roundtable should focus on a three-plus-two formula as clearly  stated by the King in his 21 November 1993 message. The KoC  delegation believes that the implementation of the  three-plus-two formula constituted a key solution and displayed  the real goodwill of all participants in striving to achieve the  King's policy for peace and national reconciliation.    The Royal Government of Cambodia [RGC]'s delegation  reiterated its unconditional, immediate, total, lasting, and  unchanging acceptance of an on-the-spot cease-fire throughout  the country.    The Royal Government's delegation also voiced support for  the  King's wise proposal for an immediate cease-fire on the spot to  begin at noon on 15 June 1994.    The RGC also voiced support for the King's initiative on the  establishment of an inter-Cambodian monitoring commission to be  made up of generals and high-ranking military officials from the  KRAF and the Khmer Rouge group with three neutral generals  representing the King as the chairman and vice chairmen of the  commission.    Moreover, the Royal Government's delegation warmly welcomed  the appointment of Samdech Chakrei Nhoek Chulong, General Um  Manorin, and General Buor Hol respectively as the chairman and  vice chairmen of the inter-Cambodian monitoring commission  proposed by the King.    In this connection, the KoC had earlier mentioned its  delegates to this commission.    The RGC delegation also proposed that simultaneously with  the  cease-fire, a [words indistinct] without delaying the cease-fire.    The RGC delegation voiced full support for the King's sacred  and wise idea solemnly declaring Cambodia as a unified state  without any division or secession within its territorial  integrity internationally (?respected and) recognized between  1963 and 1964 and as a state of peace, solidarity, national  unity, and progress in the joint effort for national  reconstruction.    But unfortunately, all of the King's ideas and initiatives  concerning the above-mentioned unconditional, immediate, total,  permanent, and on-the-spot cease-fire throughout Cambodia were  vehemently rejected by Mr. Khieu Samphan, leader of the Khmer  Rouge, despite an energetic appeal by the King and repeated  pleas by the two supreme patriarchs, and Venerable Patriarchs  Mongkol Tepeacha and Khousananda.    At first, Khieu Samphan proposed that the process of this  cease- fire must (?be participated by some foreign countries).  Five countries out of the 10 countries in the list that Khieu  Samphan proposed for consideration had been elected before as  cease-fire observers.    It should be noted that the proposed 10 countries are all  full-fledged members of the United Nations which had bitter  experiences of the Khmer Rouge in the implementation of the  Paris agreement.    Secondly, the Khmer Rouge proposed that the RGC delegation  accept a formula of so-called minimal political program before  continuing the discussion on the cease-fire proposed by His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of the KoC. There is  nothing in this minimal political program. But the Khmer Rouge  did this in an attempt to dismantle the KoC's legal and  legitimate institutions, namely the National Assembly and RGC  born of the general elections arranged and supervised by the  United Nations.    On 28 May, the participants agreed to issue a joint  communique [words indistinct] roundtable for peace and national  reconciliation was formed under the chairmanship of the King's  representative Samdech Chakkrei Nhoek Chulong so as to [words  indistinct]. This (?commission) will be made up of four  delegates from the KoC side and four others from the Khmer  Rouge. It will hold its first meeting on 15 June 1994 at Damnak  Chan Hall in the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh.    From this roundtable meeting, it is irrefutable that the  Khmer Rouge had displayed their intention not to seek a solution  to the remaining Cambodian problems through political means.  The Khmer Rouge had used the evil trick of attacking while  negotiating. They had tried to internationalize the remaining  internal problems of Cambodia [words indistinct] in order to  dismantle the Cambodian National Assembly and RGC, which are  internationally recognized through the free and fair general  elections organized by the United Nations in May 1993.    This means that cease-fire which [words indistinct] vehement  stubbornness of the Khmer Rouge.    [Dated] Chhanghsu-on, 28 May 1994</p>

This poll, cosponsored by "Beijing Nine-Day Technology Park"  and the State Statistical Bureau, was held at the end of last  month. From 20 neighborhood committee districts in Beijing,  1,000 resident households were selected at random and given a  questionnaire. The results indicated that 55 percent of the  respondents believed that a stable political situation was most  needed for the success of reform; 34 percent of the respondents  believed that building the legal system was most needed. On  these two points, public opinion was in line with the  understanding of the central authorities. Among all respondents,  76.7 percent believed that the main threat to the reform was  corruption, while 51.7 percent put bureaucracy as the main  threat.    As to which reform the public was most concerned about, 59  percent of the respondents thought it was reform of the housing  system and 56 percent thought it was medical insurance reform.  The levels of concern over other reform items were in the  following order: the pension system (36.7 percent), the  development of law (25 percent), the political system (23  percent), education (21 percent), labor employment and the  personnel system (19 percent), government organs (15 percent),  unemployment insurance (13.5 percent), and state-owned  enterprises (12 percent). Even people working in state-owned  enterprises put the level of concern over pension reform in  third place, next only to medical insurance and housing reforms.    In addition, on economic matters, 76 percent of the  respondents believed that the mainland's economic development  was very fast or relatively fast; 61.6 percent believed that the  mainland's economic growth rate should be kept within a certain  limit, which indicated that the concept of maintaining balanced  development has taken root in people's minds after several  twists and turns. Those who believed that China would become an  economic power in the world within 20 years took up 45 percent  of all respondents and 14.7 percent of them believed it could be  achieved within 10 years.</p>

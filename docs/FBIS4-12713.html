			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 11 (AFP)--Prime Minister Rafiq  al-Hariri said Monday [11 April] he was unhappy that Pope John  Paul II had decided to postpone his visit to Lebanon.    "I had hoped he would come on time," by the end of May,  al-Hariri told AFP.    "I am not happy by the delay and I hope he will set a date  as  soon as possible for his visit to Lebanon," al-Hariri said.    The pontiff's visit to Lebanon would be "a very good thing  for the Lebanese and the Christians in particular," al-Hariri  added.    The papal nuncio in Lebanon Monsignor Pablo Puente told a  news conference earlier Monday that the pope had decided to  postpone a long-promised visit to Lebanon, which has been hit by  recent bombings.    Puente did not say when the visit would take place.    A source close to the government said the visit was delayed  because of a lack of progress in Arab-Israeli peace talks, a  senior source close to the Lebanese government said on Monday.    The source, declining to be named told AFP that the pope,  whose visit would have been the first by a pontiff to a Middle  East country since 1964, hoped his Lebanon tour would "crown  positive achievements in the peace process."    Faruq Abu-al-Lam', a former ambassador to France and  supporter of renegade Christian General Michel 'Awn, said the  postponement "clearly marked a disavowal of the (Lebanese)  regime."    "He is not coming because of security reasons. They should  stop telling us stories about the government's positive  achievements to date," Abu-al-lam' told AFP.    The secretary general of the right-wing Christian Phalange  Party Karim Paqraduni told AFP the pope's decision to postpone  his visit to Lebanon was "regretable."    "It's a big disappointment for all Lebanese and a blow to  Lebanon's image abroad."</p>

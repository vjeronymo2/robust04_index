			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 6 June (EFE) -- The Chilean courts on 6  June sentenced Juan Andres Lagos, director of EL SIGLO, and  reporter Francisco Herreros to 541 days in jail for "serious  offenses" against Supreme Court members.    The process began with the charges filed by Supreme Court  President Marcos Aburto after EL SIGLO criticized the Supreme  Court decision to transfer the case of a missing political  prisoner to the military court.    In commenting on the decision made by Judge Maria Antonia  Morales, the director of the newspaper with communist leanings  said that, unfortunately, in Chile "freedom of expression and  press has serious limitations."    Lagos said: "We made a public judgment of political, legal,  and justified nature regarding a decision by a Supreme Court  chamber that created major commotion in our country that even  led a court member to leave his post after Congress studied the  situation."    Lagos said that time has proven their position right because  the military court definitely dismissed the case for the arrest  and disappearance of Alfonso Chanfreaux in 1974.    Defense lawyer Eduardo Contreras recalled that for a similar  case and during the same time the director and a columnist for  the conservative daily EL MERCURIO were acquitted.    The two men announced they will appeal the court sentence,  which they could serve in freedom but under the custody of a  penitentiary guard.    Lagos reiterated that with sentences like the one they  received, serious obstacles are being established against  freedom of expression and restrictions imposed on the critical  judgment of certain branches of government.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Bosnian Croats close Moslem supply routes FIGHTING was reported on several fronts in Bosnia yesterday as Moslems cut off by Serb rebels in the east waited for the US to begin an air-drop of emergency relief. Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said shellfire killed one person and wounded another in the besieged Bosnian capital. Shells also landed in the city's outskirts and sniper fire was intense at times, it said. A fresh row flared between Moslem-led Bosnian government troops and Bosnian Croats, nominal allies in the civil war, when Bosnian Croat forces announced that they were closing all supply routes between Croatia and Moslem-held territory. The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) accused the Bosnian government forces of deploying 25,000 troops in central Bosnia and abandoning the fighting against Serb forces. 'The HVO has therefore decided to close all roads between Croatia and Bosnia for supplies of the Bosnian army,' it said in a statement from Mostar, Croat military headquarters in Bosnia-Hercegovina. In spite of promises to allow aid convoys to Moslems, Bosnian Serb forces often block or delay overland convoys. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, banned a convoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from going to Cerska, eastern Bosnia, which has been without any outside relief in the last 11 months. 'He said the convoy would be allowed to go to Zepa, which means people would have to travel for miles and miles over the mountains, through snow and across front lines to pick up the aid.' said Mr Laurens Jolles of the UNHCR Belgrade office. Western journalists were also refused permission to travel Serb-held parts of Bosnia. Serb forces at the weekend continued to expel Moslems from the Banja Luka region, western Bosnia. Some 2,500 Moslems, clutching all the belongings they could carry, were forced to walk to Turbe, a Bosnian-held village. UN peacekeepers and western journalists helped carry children unable to walk over the snowy hillsides. At one point, Serb fighters reportedly fired on the queue of refugees.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Technology: Forecasters feeling under the weather - Nice days for a white wedding are still unpredictable, despite advances in meteorology The ability to control the weather has long been the stuff of science fiction novels. But real scientists have a hard enough time predicting conditions more than a couple of days ahead. A Dollars 4.2bn (Pounds 2.8bn) modernisation programme at the US National Weather Service may soon change that. 'Within the next 10 years, very accurate 10-day forecasts will be commonplace,' predicts Bruce Schwoegler, a meteorologist for WBZ TV in Boston. 'You'll see them on the nightly news and get them in the morning paper.' The National Weather Service recently launched a weather satellite which will provide information on temperatures and cloud formation every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. Resolution will be 4km instead of the 8km offered by older models. The satellite uses infra-red imagery, which enables it to see in darkness, and will be on-line by the end of the year. The service has also been investing in new generation Doppler radar, which provides information detailed enough for scientists to detect swarms of insects. 'The Doppler actually allows us to see inside storms, measure wind gusts and the exact amount of precipitation that's falling,' says Barbara Konrad, a meteorologist with Channel 56 in Boston. The Weather Service plans to have 175 Dopplers in place in the US by 1996, at a total cost of about Dollars 437m. The new systems will be well worth their high prices, says the Weather Service. A study by the National Institute of Science and Technology predicted the total Dollars 4.2bn investment in modernisation would pay for itself within 16 to 18 months. Uncertainty about the weather can be expensive. Weather delays cost the aviation industry Dollars 1.5bn last year, according to the US Commerce Department. Farmers suffered even more, losing some Dollars 20bn in crop damage in 1993. 'That's more than the entire corn (maize) crop was worth,' says Frank Lepore, a public affairs specialist at the National Weather Service. Marine transport and construction are other sensitive sectors. With more knowledge about forthcoming weather events, the Weather Service hopes many of these losses can be avoided. 'For every 1ft rise in the Portland River in Oregon,' explains Lepore, 'the river can take Dollars 100,000 in extra cargo business. If they know ahead of time how much precipitation there is going to be, they can call the barge haulers and take full advantage of a heavy rainfall'. Better weather predictions would give a boost to the information sector as well. A substantial industry based on weather forecasts already exists in the US. Local news programmes say weather forecasts are one of the main attractions for viewers. Computer services such as Internet and CompuServe offer detailed weather information to subscribers, and numerous fax and telephone services provide specialised forecasts to boaters, skiers, farmers and weather buffs. Cable television provides a Weather Channel, which runs forecasts 24 hours a day. 'If demand picks up,' says Raymond Ban, head of operations for the Weather Channel, 'we may launch new, more specialised channels, such as one for boaters. Specialisation by geography is also a possibility.' Accurate weather forecasts can be extremely lucrative. 'Precise weather forecasting is very valuable from a selling perspective,' says Gerard McNiff, a meteorologist for the popular television show Good Morning America. 'I would be a billionaire if I knew the weather 90 days from now. Imagine, people would plan weddings and vacations around the information. A film crew could lay out its shooting schedule. The better we can predict, the more the industry will grow.' Weather forecasting has already come a long way in recent years. Meteorologists used to content themselves with general descriptions, such as a 'cool, rainy day'. 'Now, people want to know what time the rain will start, exactly how much will fall, and when it will stop,' says Schwoegler. The main challenge for the weather industry over the next few years will be processing the overwhelming amount of data the modernisation programme will produce. To cope with the onslaught, the National Weather Service is investing in a Cray supercomputer, scheduled to come on-line this year. And news programmes say they will be investing heavily in computer and display equipment. Even with the new technology, weather forecasting will still maintain enough uncertainty to continue to be referred to as an art rather than exact science. 'It comes down to the chaos theory,' says Lepore. 'If a butterfly flaps its wings, will it cause a hurricane in China? The further out we go, the more uncertainty we'll face.' It will still be some time before meteorologists can guarantee a sunny vacation or cheerful weather for the wedding.</p>

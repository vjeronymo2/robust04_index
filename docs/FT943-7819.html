			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Markets: Fed tickles stock market behind the ears - Wall Street After the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy on Tuesday by raising two key interest rates, the financial markets rallied strongly. Bonds shot higher, and stocks soon followed, buoyed by optimism about the outlook for inflation. Wednesday was a day of consolidation, with share and bond prices mostly holding their own as investors digested the implications of the Fed's move. The implications, it was generally agreed, were positive. By Thursday, however, the mood had changed abruptly. The spectre of inflation reappeared, sending bonds into a nosedive. By the end of the day they had lost most of the ground gained two days before, and the stock market, following the bond market like a slobbering puppy on a leash, recorded similar losses. The developments illustrated how vulnerable the markets are, and how uneasy investors feel about the future. On the surface, the culprit behind this week's turnaround in sentiment was the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's report showing worrying rises in manufacturing prices throughout its region. The news set the inflation alarm bells ringing in the bond market, and forced traders and investors to reevaluate their judgment - made on Tuesday - that the five interest rate increases engineered by the Fed this year would be enough to keep inflation low for the foreseeable future. It seemed a rational judgment at the time. As expected, the Fed had tightened policy after its open market committee met on Tuesday morning. What was slightly unexpected was the vigorous nature of the move: an increase in the federal funds rate (the interest rate banks charge each other on overnight loans) from 4.25 per cent to 4.75 per cent, and an increase in the more important discount rate (the interest rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and other depositary institutions) from 3.5 per cent to 4 per cent. The markets had been looking for a 25-basis point increase in the two rates, but instead of reacting gloomily to the move, investors rushed to buy bonds in the belief that the Fed's action proved its determination to snuff out inflationary pressures in the economy. The hope on Tuesday was that the rate rises would be the last for some time, and that they would lay the foundation for a sustainable rebound in bond prices. The stock market felt in much the same way, at least at first - the Dow jumped 24 points after the Fed's tightening as equity investors looked forward to a relatively prolonged period of interest rate stability. After all, the problem that had been troubling stocks throughout the spring and summer was uncertainty about the immediate outlook for monetary policy. The Fed's decisive action appeared to remove that uncertainty. Within two days, however, those views had altered, and quite radically. Yet, while the bond market was worrying primarily about inflation in the wake of the Philadelphia Fed's data, the stock market was troubled by a more disturbing thought - that the tightening of monetary policy this year will not only slow down the economy, but also slow down (and possibly quite significantly) the rate of corporate earnings growth. The sharp sell-off in cyclical and car manufacturers' stocks on Thursday was clear evidence of this concern. Caterpillar and Boeing, and the big three car stocks of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler all tumbled because these companies' earnings are tied closely to the ups and downs of the economy. The selling showed that investors were looking ahead and seeing nothing but clouds on the horizon. As Richard Cripps, an analyst at the broking house Legg Mason, put it: 'Their stocks peak about a year and a half before earnings do. People now are looking over the mountain.' If Cripps is right, then the stock market could be in for an unpleasant period ahead. Amid all the worry about inflation and interest rates, the one thing that has propped up stock prices in the past few months has been the robust and sustained growth of corporate earnings. Now, Wall Street fears that the Fed's aggressive tightening of policy will to remove that prop from under the market. And as if this were not enough for the markets to fret about, the troubles of the dollar returned this week. On Thursday, talk by US and Japanese trade negotiators knocked the dollar-yen rate down from Y100.21 to Y98.57, a decline which contributed to the bond market's own slide that day. Stock market investors seemed to ignore it, but if the US currency's woes do not end soon, they may not be able to ignore it for long. As a difficult summer for the markets draws to a close, a difficult autumn looms.  ------------------------------------ Monday          3760.29 - 08.42 Tuesday         3784.57 + 24.28 Wednesday       3776.48 - 08.09 Thursday        3755.43 - 21.05 Friday          3755.11 - 00.32  ------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Leading Figures Deny </F> Knowledge of the Incident, But Jordanian Sources Say an Attempt  To Blow Up 'Arafat's Plane Was Foiled"]    [Text] Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Leading Palestinian  figures in Amman yesterday denied knowledge of an attempt to  assassinate Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat during his  recent visit to the Jardanian capital after signing the Cairo  agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.    Jordanian sources had stated that the attempt was discovered  hours before the arrival of 'Arafat's plane. Primitive missiles  were placed near the runways of the military airfield (special  section) in the "Marka" area in the Jordanian capital. That  prompted the security authorities to change the landing area for  'Arafat's plane and the plane was diverted to the deserted  civilian airport in the same area.    The sources added that stringent security measures were  taken  upon 'Arafat's arrival and during his reception. Reporters were  not allowed in the reception hall even though they had been  invited to participate in the reception for the Palestinian  president. Those who were there to receive him, including PLO  leaders, were physically thoroughly searched and their cars were  carefully searched. They included [Fatah] Central Committee  Member 'Abbas Zaki. For the first time, their cars were not  allowed in the reception area of the airport.    Meanwhile, Palestinian Embassy sources in Amman have denied  media reports of an attempt to assassinate 'Arafat in  Johannesburg while he was attending President Nelson Mandela's  inauguration last week.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Berlin airport plans could be financed by private sector Plans to expand Berlin's airport capacity are expected to be financed by the private sector in a move signalling a gradual shift from public sector borrowing for infrastructure projects, writes Judy Dempsey. Investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been appointed to advise Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding (BBF) how the existing structure, and the construction of a new airport, can be financed privately. Tegel, Tempelhof, and Schonefeld airports are all operating at close to capacity.</p>

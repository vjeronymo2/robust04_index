			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Arts: Columbus - Royal Shakespeare Company, Barbican AS the song has it: 'They all laughed at Christopher Columbus when he said the world was round. . . They all laughed at Wilbur and his brother when they said that man could fly'. There are very few laughs in Richard Nelson's play Columbus at the Barbican. Very few thrills either. Nothing indeed but encircling gloom, which lasts for 3 1/2 hours. Has the Royal Shakespeare Company really thought about what it is doing? Nelson is an American playwright who has written for the RSC before. Some people will remember his Two Shakespearean Actors. His Columbus, performed on the main Barbican stage, is a disaster. We should be clear why. No one is going reasonably to object about whether his version is historically accurate. After all, there is poetic licence. The only test is whether it stands up as a play. I can think of no single criterion on which it does - certainly not on this stage and at this length. The Nelson thesis is that Columbus was a snob and a creep. Possibly he was, though it would help to explore the theme, not just proclaim it. This Columbus is first seen getting out of bed with his mistress who appears washing her legs. As Columbus is promoted in the hierarchy, he drops the mistress because, he says, it would not do for a member of the nobility to consort with a peasant. His characterisation as totally obnoxious continues throughout. Columbus is nasty to anyone who ever helped him. There are no compensations. The language is appallingly stilted. When Columbus says he is the Admiral of the Ocean Sea, he might as well be mimicking a line from Gilbert and Sullivan about the Queen's Navee. There is a sequence about a pornographic dream which ends with a touch of Brighton pier: 'We won't have beans for supper again,' and some tougher garbage about defecating at sea. Even in the supposedly more serious parts, the language fails to take off. When there is near-mutiny in the fleet about Columbus's lack of leadership, someone remarks: 'I had hoped that we could settle this with some dignity.' When they pass a volcano, Columbus comments: 'I saw the volcano in Sicily when it erupted. It went on for days. You could read by the light.' The sets, and this is a remarkable comment on the Barbican of all places, are almost uniformly dreadful. Signs go up periodically to indicate the changes in time: for instance, 'just off the Canaries, late August 1492', then again 'later'. It looks like Euston station. The officers in their cabins look like amateur sailors on a day out off Essex. It is not remotely funny, or indeed particularly relevant, that Columbus thinks he is going to Japan. The only part that develops is that of Pulgar, a once wealthy landowner who is reduced to becoming Columbus's secretary. It is well played by Philip Voss. It would be unfair to criticise Jonathan Hyde as Columbus; it is just an unspeakable part in an unspeakable play. Jane Gurnett as the mistress has the misfortune (or perhaps the good luck) of disappearing early on. Does all this matter? Yes. Here is the RSC using some of the same stage devices it deploys so gloriously in Henry IV, and throwing them away on such a text. It is a terrible come-down. The best thing to do about John Caird's production is to forget it. In repertory at the Barbican Theatre (071) 638 8891</p>

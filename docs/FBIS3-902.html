The minister of information and culture, Professor Jerry  Gana, stated this today in Abuja at a ceremony to commemorate  the 39th anniversary of the Nigerian Union of Journalists.  Gbenga Onoyiga reports:    [Begin recording] [Onoyiga] Prof. Gana said journalists  should educate and mobilize people to resist the current  interference by France, which he said has benefited so much from  the sweat and resources of Nigerians. He called for the  promotion of internal cohesion to firmly resist any attempt by  that country to humiliate Nigeria.    [Gana] Enough is enough. We are a very peace-loving nation.  We are certainly leaders in Africa, but it is not always that  leaders ought to (?just be humiliated). We believe that we have  a responsibility, and we hope that diplomacy will solve it. But  even if diplomacy does not solve it, I (?quickly) warn Nigerians  to be united, to be mobilized, to be ready for any eventuality.    [Onoyiga] The minister urged journalists to take up the  challenge of defending human rights and social justice without  destroying the solid fabric of the society. They should also  protect the society from the growing abuse of the power of  communication by developed nations.    In a paper on government's past election, the chief press  secretary to the head of state, Mr. David Attah, advised the  media to keep clear the law as a catalyst in the development of  the nation by aiding government in identifying problems and  preparing solutions. He said the present administration should  be judged on the quality of its decisions. Mr. Attah noted that  the smear campaign by a section of the press has created  widespread disaffection and this is why he has called for  caution.    The minister of federal capital territory, Lieutenant  General  Jeremiah Useni, in a message, urged journalists to uphold the  enviable record of the past. The national president of the  union, Mallam Sani Zorro, urged newsmen to use the day of  solidarity to rededicate themselves to the great ideals of the  founding fathers of the union.

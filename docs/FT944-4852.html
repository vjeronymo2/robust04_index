			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Clipped wings for Mercury: The pressures behind retrenchment plans at the UK telecoms operator A senior official at Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, was heard muttering recently: 'What do we do if Mercury dies?' Yesterday's announcement of retrenchment at the UK telecommunications company reveals the question to be far from academic. Less than a month ago, Mr Mike Harris, Mercury's chief executive, was suddenly reassigned to another post in the Cable and Wireless group, of which Mercury is a part. The new management, led by Mr Duncan Lewis who was previously responsible for the north American operations of C &amp; W, insists the company has now laid the foundations for future growth. But some analysts believe that the company's best days are behind it as a serious competitor to British Telecommunications, the UK's telecoms giant which has just celebrated its tenth anniversary in the private sector. Yesterday Mercury announced job cuts totalling 2,500, withdrawal from a number of services including payphones, directory enquiries, mass market entertainment and customer premises equipment. It also listed the business areas - including telecom services for the oil and transport industries - on which it intended to concentrate and said its residential services would be provided through partnerships with cable companies. The changes will not affect Mercury One-2-One, the mobile phone company that is a separate venture. There have been repeated warnings that Mercury was under pressure. Analysts have been sounding alarms for more than a year, and statistics have long been available highlighting Mercury's difficulties. The most telling have related to the company's profitability and the erosion of its competitive edge over BT, upon which most of Mercury's business depends. Mercury's figures for the half year to September 30 revealed the extent of the company's plight and appear to have been the immediate spur for yesterday's bloodletting. They showed a fall in operating profit - down 3 per cent on the same period for 1993, with only a modest growth in turnover and barely half the level of growth in traffic witnessed in 1992 and 1993. Much of the problem lies in Mercury's declining competitiveness. In the business market, the gap between Mercury's charges and BT's has been narrowing fast (see chart). Savings of up to 20 per cent were common on long-distance prices in the late 1980s. But for large businesses, the savings now on offer can be trifling, allowing for the costs of switching and volume discounts available from BT. It is a similar picture in the residential market, which has been Mercury's main target for the past two years. A detailed BT study, published in October, claimed that after volume discounts and bonus schemes, BT worked out cheaper than Mercury not just for low-value residential users, but for many home users with large bills - Mercury's target market. The figures, verified by consultant Coopers &amp; Lybrand, were persuasive, and Mercury failed to produce a convincing rebuttal. As Mr Laurence Heyworth, telecoms analyst at Robert Fleming, the brokers, puts it: 'Mercury has seriously under-estimated BT, which over the past five years has ruthlessly cut costs and become a strong competitor on price as much as quality.' Oftel has been an accomplice in BT's transformation, since its tough price cap on the former monopoly operator has been a significant spur to its productivity improvement. The regulatory vice was further tightened by the government's decision in 1991 to allow new entrants into the telecoms market to compete with BT and Mercury. The ending of the BT/Mercury duopoly, which had been in place since BT's privatisation, has exposed Mercury to intense competitive pressure. In the business market, a host of new operators has focused on large companies, severely denting Mercury's business. Worldcom, one of the largest of the new operators, regards Mercury - not BT - as its principal competitor, and quotes its prices as a percentage saving on Mercury's 'best business price'. A recent survey of 100 large business users by broker James Capel concluded that Mercury was being 'squeezed from all sides' and is set for only modest growth in the next few years. Ironically, given the company's early success as the lean David fighting against a bloated BT Goliath, Mercury now finds itself up against competitors with far slimmer structures and lower cost bases than its own. Energis, the subsidiary of National Grid that recently launched a national fibre-optic network using the Grid's pylons, has about 400 employees, compared with Mercury's 11,400. In the residential market, cable TV companies have made significant inroads into BT's market in urban areas. They use Mercury for much of their long-distance traffic, but they have used the proliferation of long-distance carriers to force down the charges. Yesterday's surgery marks a change of strategy, the end of Mercury's attempt to present itself a mini-BT offering a full range of services. The closure of the payphones division is the most visible evidence. The company is also pulling out of the mass consumer market; it will continue to provide services to residential customers but largely through third parties such as cable television operators. Mr Lewis says: 'We cannot address the mass consumer market; the young upstarts of the cable television business are the kind of people we will partner.' More telling, perhaps, is Mercury's decision to withdraw from supplying equipment such as exchanges, to business customers. Its supply activities were built on the Pounds 320m acquisition of Telephone Rentals in 1988, hailed by the company at the time as an act of 'industrial logic' to extend Mercury's reach. Mr Lewis sees two models for Mercury to follow. One, outside the telecommunications sector, is Compaq, the US personal computer company that has become a world leader by providing quality systems at low prices. The other is MCI, the US telecommunications company whose rapid growth in the late 1980s was based on confronting AT&amp;T, the largest US telecoms operator, in its core markets. MCI - which, ironically, last year forged a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with BT - represents the best practice in telecommunications for Mr Lewis. MCI was one of the models used by Mercury in deciding to shed 20 per cent of the workforce. 'We are committed to benchmarking our operations against best-in-class carriers' practices and financial profiles,' says Mr Lewis. In facing the current challenge, Mr Lewis boasts of his US experience. Analysts argue, however, that MCI is a company that has done most things right, while Mercury has missed its opportunities. Even if costs are brought under control, growth has to be stimulated. Furthermore, Mercury is only one of the businesses of Cable &amp; Wireless - and one of the less successful. Although C&amp;W remains loyal to its offspring in public, in private some of those in charge of its more successful businesses are critical. Last year Asia accounted for nearly half of C&amp;W's Pounds 4.7bn turnover, and Hong Kong - C&amp;W owns a 57.5per cent stake in Hongkong Telecom - has long been the jewel in its crown. Hongkong Telecom accounted for 64 per cent of its operating profit last year. By contrast, in the competitive UK market, C&amp;W's turnover was three-quarters that in Hong Kong, yet its operating profit was less than a third as great. Until now, C&amp;W has resisted bids for its UK subsidiary. Earlier this year it even turned down a partnership deal with AT&amp;T that would have brought Mercury into the US group's 'Worldsource' international alliance geared to the telecoms needs of multinationals. The decision to close the door on AT&amp;T aroused anguished soul-searching within Mercury, with some believing it might be the UK group's last, best chance to secure itself against BT. Mr James Ross, C&amp;W's chief executive, said yesterday: 'The scale of this restructuring reflects our determination that all businesses within the C&amp;W federation must be fully competitive in their respective marketplaces.' But even for a company named after the god of commerce, determination is a long way from outcome.</p>

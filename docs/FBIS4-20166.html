			<p>BFN     [Text] Finland wants further clarification of Russia's  announcement that it will close the Vaertsilae border crossing  point for the duration of this summer. The Russian Foreign  Ministry has announced that the border is being closed for  construction work, which will start at the beginning of June.  Russia estimates that the work will be completed by mid-August.  Finland is seeking to gain further clarification about the  closure of Vaertsilae by organizing a meeting of Finnish and  Russian frontier delegates.    The Vaertsilae border crossing station near Niirala in  northern Karelia has been kept open by mutual agreement between  the frontier delegates. Thus far, it has not been open to  international traffic. During Vaertsilae's closure, the Russian  authorities recommend that goods traffic use the Uukuniemi and  that passenger traffic use the Vartius border crossing points.</p>

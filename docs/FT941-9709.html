			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: Questions of sex and death THE FERMATA By Nicholson Baker Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 305 pages WHAT'S WRONG WITH AMERICA by Scott Bradfield Picador Pounds 14.99, 196 pages Nicholson Baker made his reputation by possessing a keen eye for the small things in life, the benign gadgets and quiet moments other writers neglected. In his early novels, he depicted minutiae like plastic straws and diaper stays in a way that made them positively luminous. But in Vox, his third novel, Baker's gaze blurred somewhat as he focussed on the more often perused subject of sex. Now, with The Fermata, he seems to have gone positively myopic as he searches for a new way to look at, well, masturbation. The book's conceit is the stuff of a schoolboy's wet dreams. The narrator, Arno Strine, finds himself able to stop time, to create a cosmic pause in which all life (except his own) is placed in suspended animation. He uses this power not to rob banks or steal state secrets, but to undress and fondle women. Although the nerdy Arno never actually rapes the frozen females he encounters, he gladly uses them as three-dimensional pin-ups for some acrobatic self-abuse. At first, it is hard to know just how to take Baker's novel. There is no sense of Arno using time's suspension to achieve some sort of self-knowledge or personal growth. Supernatural conventions are easily acceptable in serious fiction when they provide some sort of satirical or thematic slant on a subject, though Baker seems too interested in his sweaty palmistry for that sort of sophistication. Before long, The Fermata simply becomes a numbing succession of pornographic set-pieces. But there would have been nothing wrong with even that - if the book were funny. But Baker's wit, so sharp in his earlier efforts, seriously misfires when focussed on the female anatomy. Having embraced the potentially fertile trickster myth, he delivers only the most obvious sort of gags, thereby passing up untold opportunities for real laughs. In the end, The Fermata reads like nothing more than the confessions of some pimply high school sophomore in the throes of unrelieved pubescent tumult. There is an equally bizarre pretext behind Scott Bradfield's second novel, What's Wrong with America. In it, Emma O'Hallahan, a 69-year-old Southern Californian grandmother, decides she has had enough of her husband, Marvin. So, being the red-blooded American woman she is, she lets him have it in the back of the head with a shotgun, buries him in the backyard and proceeds to get on with her life. Soon, however, a nosy next door neighbour begins to wonder what became of Marvin. She, too, finds herself pushing up daisies. Free at last, Emma starts drinking and dating a shy widower, only to find out that his wife's recent death was not from natural causes, either. The California suburbs, it seems, are not such a cosy place after all. Told in the form of Emma's thunderingly banal diaries, Bradfield's novel is an often hilarious black comedy about the twin demons of the American psyche  -casual violence and facile self-improvement. The author proves himself a master of the unreliable narrator technique, keeping the reader guessing from the first cheerily bloody pages whether or not to believe Emma. Is Marvin's decaying ghost really visiting her? Is he dead at all? And just who is buried in that third grave in the back garden? It is only at the end, when Emma's narration gives way to the babble of her airhead grandson, that the novel loses its edge. That said, What's Wrong with America remains a daring and largely successful satire on that vast insane asylum known as California.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Rio de Janeiro District Attorney Antonio Carlos  Biscaia has released an official list of 150 people charged with  receivding bribes from numbers game operators. Former President  Fernando Collor de Mello and Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf are on  the list. [passage omitted]    In addition to Collor and Maluf, the list includes Rio de  Janeiro Governor Nilo Batista and Deputy Cleto Falcao. Next to  the names of Collor and Maluf are entries indicating that they  received donations to their 1989 electoral campaign. There are  also documents indicating that donations were made for a rally  of then-candidate Paulo Maluf in Rio de Janeiro.    Sao Paulo Mayor Paulo Maluf has denied the charge that the  numbers game operators made donations to his electoral campaign.  He vowed to press charges against Biscaia.    [Begin Maluf recording] This is an individual who is  hysterically trying to get into the limelight. He is just an  impetuous, irresponsible rascal, and he is lying. I have never  received any help from anyone. I have put the case in the hands  of criminal lawyer Enio de Bastos Barros, who will bring this  irresponsible individual to court. [end recording]    Collor also issued a statement denying he received any  donations to his campaign from kingpins of the numbers game.  The former president contends that he fought the numbers game  during his tenure as governor of Alagoas State. He adds that he  was already found not guilty in the investigation of his  accounts during the impeachment process. He concludes by  stating that his executioners have already testified to the fact  that he has never received one cent from the illegal game he  tenaciously fought as governor. [passage omitted]    Federal prosecutors who are participating in the Rio de  Janeiro district attorney's investigations are increasingly  convinced that the numbers game was nothing but a front for more  lucrative businesses, such as arms smuggling and the  international drug trade.    The prosecutors were quite impressed by the volume of  transactions maintained by numbers game operators with some  South American countries, such as the ties numbers game kingpin  Rodomiro Garcia maintained with one of the most notorious  Paraguayan smugglers, [Governor of Alto Parana Department]  Carlos Barreto Sarubbi.    Rodomiro Garcia and Barreto Sarubbi own a casino in Ciudad  del Este, Paraguay, across the border from Foz do Iguacu.  Garcia also owns a large estate in Paraguay, approximately 10  km from the Brazilian border. Barreto owns an airstrip. He has  been charged by U.S. police with having used the airstrip for  many years for arms smuggling and drug trafficking operations.</p>

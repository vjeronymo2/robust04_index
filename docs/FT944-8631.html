			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Scope seen for more sugar price gains World sugar prices could break through their recent 4-year highs if supply tightness continues, in spite of recent price corrections, according to a review of the market by Czarnikow, the London brokers. 'The market has been expecting some sort of correction so it's not surprising that prices have been easier over the last couple of days. But there is a fundamentally tight situation and scope for that picture to tighten further,' said Mr Neil Meader, analyst at Czarnikow. Key consuming countries such as China, India and Russia are likely to have to source much of their supply from the international market next year following shortfalls in their own production. Czarnikow has marked the Chinese crop down from 6.54m tonnes to 6.3m tonnes this year with a further drop expected next year. Czarnikow believes that China will be turning to the international market for 1.4m tonnes of its raw supplies which will have an important influence on market behaviour next year. 'By the third quarter next year, these consuming countries will be facing a gap between the new crop and the old one,' said Mr Meader. 'If they all buy on a spot basis there will be a massive block of purchasing hitting the market at the same time.' Czarnikow estimates that world production in 1994-1995 will reach 111.9m tonnes, which marks an increase of roughly 2m tonnes over the previous season, but is not enough to make up for a rise in consumption to 115.5m tonnes next year. For this reason, the broker believes there will be a drawdown from world stocks of 4.2m tonnes over the coming crop cycle. The European Union sugar reform was unlikely to have any effect on the world market, Mr Meader said.</p>

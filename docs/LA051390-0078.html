			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPTON CITY COUNCIL HASTILY ELECTS REPLACEMENT FOR HOSPITALIZED MAYOR  </P> <P> There was a small crisis last week at the Compton City Council meeting.  </P> <P> Mayor Walter R. Tucker is hospitalized and, because the City Charter does not  provide for a vice mayor or mayor pro tem, the council had to find a way to  fill Tucker's chair until he returns.  </P> <P> At their meeting Tuesday, council members hastily selected Councilman Maxcy D.  Filer to act as mayor pro tem until Tucker returns.  </P> <P> Tucker, who was elected last year to his third council term, had surgery  Tuesday morning for an undisclosed illness. Gwen Robinson, an administrative  assistant to the mayor and council, said that Tucker weathered the surgery well  but that she did not know when he will be able to resume his duties.  </P></p>

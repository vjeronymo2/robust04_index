			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The selling season in the main wool producing countries ends this month and at some of the concluding sales this week offerings were low enough to limit price guidance. The market in general is just holding its own, with the emphasis on firmness or a continuing dearer tendency among finer merinos. The recent sharp upturn in prices seems to be adequately established although among wool consuming countries the burst of buying activity has definitely subsided. The AWC market indicator yesterday was 459c a kg. compared with 455c a kg. a week before.</p>

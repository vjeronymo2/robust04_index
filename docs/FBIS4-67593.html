			<p>BFN     [Text] The German reflyable science satellite Astro-Spas is  currently being fitted out for its next mission at the German  Aerospace AG (Munich-based DASA) Satellite Systems Division.  The German Space Agency, DARA, and DASA have presented the  satellite's new instruments and tasks at a news conference in  Munich: The science satellite, bearing the name Crista-Spas, is  scheduled to begin its "inspection" of the upper earth  atmosphere in October this year.    Crista-Spas has the job of studying the upper earth  atmosphere (10 to 150 km). The photochemical, energetic, and  dynamic processes that take place in the upper atmosphere are of  great significance to life on earth. An understanding of these  processes and the behavior of the atmosphere is central to an  understanding of current environmental issues, such as the ozone  problem and the much-feared climate problem.    The measurements will be performed with two instruments:  Crista and Mahrsi. Crista (cryogenic infrared spectrometer and  telescope for the atmosphere) is an infrared measuring device  with unprecedented three-dimensional resolution: 2.5 km  vertical and 500 by 600 km horizontal.    It was developed to study small-scale dynamic structures in  the upper atmosphere that have hitherto eluded measurement by  satellite. Small-scale structures in the several hundred to  several thousand kilometer range have only been detected to date  by rocket, balloon, or ground measurements. However, these only  gave local "snapshots," with the result that very little is  known of the frequency of small-scale structures in time and  space. Crista will make the first-ever global measurement of  these structures and attempt to determine their frequency.    The measurements performed by Crista will be complemented by  Mahrsi (middle-atmosphere high-resolution spectrograph  investigation), a device for measuring radicals in the  atmosphere. Mahrsi's main task consists in the global definition  of the vertical density profiles of the hydroxyl radical and  nitrogen oxide with 2-kilometer resolution at an altitude of 40  to 150 km. The experiment will also provide information as to  the neutral density and temperature in the atmosphere.    Responsibility for the development of the experiments, the  scientific preparations for the mission, and the analysis of the  parameters recorded is shared by the Bergland University in  Wuppertal (Crista) and the Naval Research Laboratory,  Washington, D.C. (Mahrsi).    The third Astro-Spas mission is scheduled for the fall of  1995 and will be a second flight by the Orfeus and Imaps  telescopes, which are being modified and enhanced in the  meantime in the light of experience acquired during their first  flight. A fourth mission -- with the Crista/Mahrsi payload --  has been firmly booked for fall 1996.</p>

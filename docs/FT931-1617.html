			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: EC proposal for Moscow to join free trade zone THE EC would negotiate an eventual common free trade zone with Russia, in an attempt to underpin its economic reforms and political stability, under a proposal the European Commission is expected to agree today. The move comes as a senior EC delegation, including foreign ministers, is due in Moscow to underline its solidarity with the reform process. Brussels wants a mandate from EC member states to widen current negotiations with Moscow on a so-called 'partnership' agreement. This is in response to requests from the Russian government for an accord more like the arrangements the Community now has with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak republics, Romania and Bulgaria - the so-called 'Europe agreements'. 'One of the principal requests from the Russian side which the Community is unable to fulfil within the existing directives is the inclusion in the partnership and co-operation agreement of an evolutionary clause opening the possibility at a future stage for free trade in goods, and for national treatment for the establishment of companies and cross-border trade in services,' according to a confidential Commission document. The document, prepared by Sir Leon Brittan, external economic affairs commissioner, in collaboration with Mr Hans van den Broek, external political affairs commissioner, was largely agreed by senior Commission officials on Monday. The central idea is to work towards a common free trade zone with Russia - and possibly other former Soviet republics - along with improved technical and financial assistance to make this possible. The EC and its member states, mainly Germany, already provide some two thirds of total financial aid to the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe. The Commission is looking for endorsement of the 'enlarged mandate' when EC foreign ministers meet in Luxembourg on April 5, and for the agreement with Russia to be politically rubber-stamped by June's Copenhagen summit of EC heads of government. The main difference between what it is seeking for Russia and what has been negotiated with the east and central Europeans is that the drive towards a free trade zone with the latter is linked to their eventual membership of the EC. This is not on offer to Russia. But the terms of trade Russia might get, according to the Commission document, could be more favourable than for the east Europeans.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / The Lex Column: The price of Mr Major After the turmoil of last Friday, the most pressing question for the UK markets this morning is how much foreign money is still heading for London. From the international investor's viewpoint, a stable right-of-centre government with a five-year term ahead of it is a scarce and valuable commodity. If it offers a yield of over 9 per cent on its bonds and nearly 5 per cent on equities, so much the better. The snag is a familiar one: currency risk. Despite the markets' preoccupation with Labour as the party of devaluation, it is worth recalling that all the overt hostility to the ERM in recent months has come from the Tory camp. Much of it can be ignored as disaffection among the Thatcherite old guard. But when a centrist Tory newspaper like The Sunday Times calls, as it did yesterday, for sterling to be devalued by 10 per cent within the system, the foreign investor is entitled to ask how much has changed. One answer is that Mr Major, who was responsible as chancellor for taking sterling into the ERM at its present rate, can now do just as he likes. If he did not crack when the Tories were behind in the polls, he is scarcely likely to do so now. Against that is the fact that discussion of the ERM, as of all things European, was suppressed in the run-up to the election precisely because the Tories were internally divided. If UK economic recovery proves prompt and durable, the issue should die. If not, the wrangling is all too likely to return to the surface. That apart, a great deal depends on how much demand for UK financial assets was suppressed in advance of the election. But it is sobering to compare Friday's reaction to what happened on ERM entry 16 months ago. Then, the FT-SE rose 130 points in the first two days. Over the next fortnight, it lost it all again. The reason, then as now, was that less had changed than the market first imagined.</p>

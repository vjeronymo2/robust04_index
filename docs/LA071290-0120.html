			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. TELLS OF '40S RADIATION IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> Residents of the Pacific Northwest were exposed to large doses of radioactive  iodine released at the Hanford, Wash., nuclear weapons plant during the 1940s,  the Department of Energy acknowledged Wednesday.  </P> <P> The radiation exposure, which will be detailed today in a report to be released  in Richland, Wash., by an independent panel of scientists, was sufficient to  cause illness among people living in parts of Washington, Oregon and Idaho, the  department said.  </P> <P> While the government has previously confirmed the release of radioactive iodine  from the plant, the statement Wednesday by Energy Secretary James D. Watkins is  the first official acknowledgment that the radiation could have affected the  health of people living in the region.  </P> <P> Watkins said he had conferred with John Till, a nuclear engineer leading the  scientific study, and conceded that it will show "significantly high" doses of  iodine were released from 1944 to 1947 at the site. "The implications of the  report are serious," Watkins said.  </P> <P> Watkins said the total radioactivity released during a single episode at  Hanford in 1945 was between 350,000 and 400,000 curies. A curie is the amount  of radiation emitted in one second by 1,400 pounds of enriched uranium.  </P> <P> Watkins said the scientific report would estimate that some residents had been  exposed over this period to as much as 3,000 rads. A rad is a measure of  radiation equal to what is absorbed in about a dozen chest X-rays. By  comparison, nuclear plant workers are limited by the government to an annual  radiation exposure of five rads.  </P> <P> Watkins said it was unclear what the exact health effects of the releases were.  "We don't know who was at the right spot at the wrong time," he said. "We're  primarily interested, of course, in the infants," who are substantially more  vulnerable than adults to such radiation.  </P> <P> A separate study by the federal Centers for Disease Control is addressing the  actual cases of illness that may have resulted.  </P> <P> Anticipating today's new disclosures about nuclear waste problems at the  Hanford weapons complex, the department Wednesday shook up management of the  sprawling plutonium production facility. It also announced it will sign an  agreement today giving the Army Corps of Engineers a major role in the cleanup.  </P> <P> Watkins said Hanford's future will be devoted to waste management and  environmental restoration rather than production of fuel for nuclear warheads.  He added that its new director and three deputies will report directly to the  chief of the multibillion-dollar cleanup of the department's contaminated  weapons facilities.  </P> <P> Hanford now has some 600,000 cubic yards of radioactive waste in storage,  including 2,100 tons of spent fuel rods from plutonium production reactors and  149 contaminated underground tanks that once held liquid wastes. So far, some  1,100 sites on the 560-square-mile reservation have been identified as  requiring remediation.  </P> <P> Investigators from Energy Department headquarters are now completing another  seven-week assessment and will shortly be reporting details of the cleanup  requirements, Watkins said.  </P> <P> In the management shake-up announced Wednesday, Watkins chose John Wagoner, a  veteran of both civilian and military nuclear power programs, to replace  Michael Lawrence, who will leave the department at the end of July.  </P> <P> While he praised Lawrence as a "wonderful person," Watkins acknowledged that he  wanted a more aggressive management organization to tackle the cleanup, whose  cost is still a subject of widely varying estimates.  </P> <P> A former admiral in the nuclear Navy, Watkins said he was shocked when he took  over the nation's nuclear weapons complex to find that it lagged far behind the  civilian nuclear industry in dealing with waste problems.  </P> <P> "When we start rattling the trees here, we get a lot more rotten apples down  than we expected," he said.  </P> <P> The memorandum of understanding to be signed with the Army Corps of Engineers  will lay out national guidelines for the corps' participation in the cleanup of  weapons installations across the country.  </P></p>

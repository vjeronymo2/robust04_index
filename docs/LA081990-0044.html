			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USE NEUTRON BOMB ON THE IRAQIS?;  </P> <P> WAR: RATHER THAN GET BOGGED DOWN IN ANOTHER INCONCLUSIVE CONVENTIONAL WAR, U.S.  SHOULD CONSIDER A MORE DISCRIMINATING AND EFFECTIVE WEAPON.  </P> <P> Since World War II, the United States has been involved in two major  conventional wars in Asia, both of politically and economically disastrous.  Thus the wisdom of getting involved in another in the Middle East is open to  serious question. Were this to happen, President Bush, as was the case with  Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson (Vietnam) and Harry S. Truman (Korea), might be  prematurely retired by a disgruntled American electorate, leaving behind an  economy badly battered by a costly conventional war. This need not happen if  the United States were to base its strategy for war with Iraq on the neutron  bomb.  </P> <P> When the neutron-bomb concept was devised in 1958, its possible use in NATO  defenses was not uppermost in defense-planners' minds. Rather, the bomb was  envisioned as a weapon for use in Asian ground wars, where any potential  opponent lacked a nuclear-response capability. In such circumstances, the  neutron bomb, which uses an instantaneous burst of nuclear radiation to  incapacitate enemy personnel without destructive blast and heat effects,  represented an extremely potent battlefield weapon. It is vastly more effective  and far more discriminating than conventional weapons. And it would enable a  quick military victory at a far smaller cost in American lives and national  treasure.  </P> <P> This possibility led to the highest priority being assigned to the development  of the weapon. In the early 1960s, a series of successful tests at the nuclear  test site in Nevada were conducted. Subsequently, it was proposed that neutron  weapons be produced and stockpiled. But the proposal was rejected out of hand  by the Defense Department. Meantime, the United States entered into and  suffered the consequences of the Vietnam War.  </P> <P> Which brings us to the possibility of a major ground war with Iraq. For the  precise reasons -- battlefield effectiveness at minium cost to U.S. lives and  treasure -- that led to its development, the neutron bomb's time may be at  hand. Bush might wish to include it as a military option before he commits even  more ground forces to the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> In 1981, President Ronald Reagan ordered the stockpiling of neutron weapons,  including hundreds of artillery shells that could be delivered by eight-inch  cannons. Because of West Germany's refusal to accept these weapons, they were  stored in sites in the United States.  </P> <P> Today these artillery shells would be ideally suited for use against Iraq's  armored forces. Such a capability could be achieved by deploying artillery  units with nuclear-trained crews to Saudi Arabia. These units are capable of  firing conventional rounds as well as nuclear. Delivery of the neutron shells  to Saudi Arabia could occur within a day's time, if the President so ordered.  </P> <P> Such a deployment, should it take place, must be announced openly, to send a  clear message to Iraq about the seriousness of U.S. intentions. What's  important is that the threat of such use could deter an attack from occurring.  </P> <P> No doubt, civilized nations would bitterly condemn the United States for again  turning to nuclear weapons, in this case, the neutron bomb. But perhaps these  nations should contemplate the economic chaos and social misery that could  result from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein dominating the world's oil supplies.  </P> <P> Aside from world opinion, however, there is a far more important issue for the  United States to weigh -- how to balance its choice of weapons to win a war  quickly versus the domestic political and economic consequences of fighting a  war that goes on interminably and inconclusively. An already strained American  economy might not hold up well under another large, protracted conventional  ground war. Thus the United States might want to come down on the nuclear side  -- in favor of the neutron bomb.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A. BARTLETT GIAMATTI 1938 -- 1989;  </P> <P> GIAMATTI AND PRESIDENT BUSH: YALE GRADUATES AND GOOD FRIENDS  </P> <P> A few days ago, Bart Giamatti telephoned George Bush at the President's retreat  here.  </P> <P> Bush just missed the call from the baseball commissioner but knew what his  longtime friend and fellow Yale University graduate wanted to talk about: Pete  Rose.  </P> <P> "I had not commented on it but I have talked to him at great length about it,"  Bush said Friday, shortly after Giamatti's death. "I told him I'd like to, just  as a baseball fan, know the aftermath, know exactly how this matter had been  resolved.  </P> <P> "That was not an easy matter for him. But all through that, I was thinking of  the difficulty that he had in setting these standards that high and staying  with it."  </P> <P> Bush called Giamatti's death a tragedy. "A young, certainly by my standards,  man. And just a wonderful person," he said.  </P> <P> "Bart was a close friend of mine for many, many years. I just want to pay my  respects. He loved the game of baseball and in a short time made a real  contribution to the game, standing for the highest possible ethical standards."  </P></p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wheway shares dive as McLeod talks end SHARES in Wheway plunged 6 1/2 p to 6p yesterday after the struggling environmental engineering group announced that merger talks with McLeod Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor, had collapsed. Both parties said they had been unable to agree on a suitable price for a deal. Wheway's current market value is Pounds 8.4m, compared with Pounds 17.5m before the announcement as shares rose earlier this month on hopes of a deal. Wheway, in need of refinancing after its costly move out of heavy engineering, warned of a sharp deterioration in year-end results in November, and turned a Pounds 2.8m pre-tax profit into a Pounds 3.51m loss in the 12 months to October 3. Mr Hugh Ashton, chairman, said the group had secured credit lines - necessitating a Pounds 1m after-tax provision - from its bankers to cover its working capital requirements until September. The group's 1992 results would receive a qualified auditor's report. The group's best prospects lay in merging with a larger financially robust company, and it had received a number of approaches from third parties since the breakdown in talks with McLeod. Wheway's turnover fell to Pounds 79.8m (Pounds 89.3m), while operating profit of Pounds 1.38m (Pounds 4.78m) was offset by interest charges of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 1.98m). Exceptional items related to retrenchment and business closure costs amounted to Pounds 2.11m and Pounds 1.1m respectively. Losses per share were 2.87p (2.08p earnings) and no final dividend is being paid - the interim was 1p and a 2p total was paid last year.</p>

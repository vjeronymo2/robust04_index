			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Colgate polishes its performance  -Mr Reuben Mark, the company's chairman IT HAS been a very busy few months for Mr Reuben Mark, chairman of Colgate-Palmolive, the US consumer products business best known for its Colgate toothpaste and Palmolive soap. In quick succession, the company has announced plans to close or reconfigure 25 of its 91 factories around the globe; has made the first public offering of stock in its history; has unveiled plans to enter the vast Chinese market and bolster its position in eastern Europe; and has made a small but significant acquisition in the the oral health care field. There are rumours on Wall Street that it may be considering another, larger takeover. All this is a far cry from the mid-1980s when Colgate itself was seen as a potential candidate for a bid, having some excellent brand names but a reputation for stodgy bureaucracy and lacklustre results. The 186-year-old company had lost its way in the 1970s when it diversified into unrelated fields, such as sporting goods and food. However, a bid never materialised and, in the seven years since he took over as chief executive, Mr Mark has transformed Colgate into a much leaner, more focused and profitable company. Although the performance has impressed Wall Street, analysts suggest just as hard a test may yet be to come, as the company faces intensified competition around the world from the Anglo-Dutch Unilever and America's Procter &amp; Gamble, which are much larger than Colgate and have reputations for greater aggression. Aged 53, Mr Mark has been with Colgate throughout his 28-year career since gaining a Harvard MBA. Yet he seems remarkably untouched by the stuffiness which can afflict senior executives in global organisations. He has a disarmingly informal style and irreverent sense of humour, and wears what is left of his hair distinctly longer than the conventional businessman. His interests include a non-executive directorship at Pearson, the British company which owns the Financial Times. The revolution at Colgate in the second half of the 1980s involved getting out of unprofitable businesses and focusing on just five areas. Four of them have a natural fit: oral care, where it is the world toothpaste leader, with a market share of over 40 per cent; body care, mainly through the Palmolive brand name; household surface care, led by the Ajax brand; and fabric care. The fifth, prescription food for pets, just happens to have very high margins and be growing strongly. The company's gross profit margins leapt from 39.2 per cent in 1984 to 45.2 per cent in 1990, while return on sales rose from 3.2 per cent to 5.6 per cent, helped by the closure of inefficient factories, a greater emphasis on high margin products, and simplification of Colgate's structure. Just over a year ago, Mr Mark outlined an ambitious set of goals for 1991-1995, including 13 to 19 per cent annual increases in earnings per share, on top of a 17 per cent annual rise over the past six. That is to be achieved through strong volume growth, focusing on higher-margin products, further cost-cutting (such as the current plant rationalisation) and making the company's culture more entrepreneurial - a complex task, given its far-flung global nature. Many Wall Street analysts argue that Colgate has been more successful over the past few years at rationalising the business than growing it. They say that to achieve these targets, it needs more new product introductions and a more powerful marketing punch, particularly in the US. Mr Mark dismisses this as so much 'bull'. US analysts, he argues, tend to focus too much on the US - where Colgate is usually overshadowed by P&amp;G - a market which only makes up a third of the group's sales. They do not look closely enough at the strengths of its global marketing network. He points out that Colgate's share of the world toothpaste market has grown from 29 to 43 per cent over the past decade. The only field in which it has lost market share - the cut-throat detergents business  - has been the result of a deliberate and successful plan to boost profits. In the US, moreover, the company is launching a range of new products, 'so I think you will find by the end of 1992 that that criticism is stilled'. 'The analysts,' he adds, 'keep asking 'where are the home runs?' But it's not a question of home runs. It's the classic thing of doing a thousand things 1 per cent better.' 'We're not going to discover the AIDS cure, we're not going to discover the baldness cure. It's just that all these thousands of people around the world are truly getting better - doing their jobs a little better, marketing a little better, financing a little better - and that cumulative effect keeps throwing off more profit.' Some of its fastest growth is likely to come in the oral health care field. Colgate wants to use its global dominance in toothpaste to ride a trend among developed nations to more sophisticated, quasi-medical dental products, offering higher margins. For example, it has strengthened its presence in the 'professional' market - products sold to dentists  - through a string of acquisitions, and last October it bought the international business of Plax, the anti-plaque mouthwash business, which claims to be the market leader outside the US. It will also continue the painstaking task of building brand loyalty in the developing world, where it spends some Dollars 20m a year on dental education. The world oral care market, says Mr Mark, is far from mature, with demand growing by between 4 and 6 per cent a year in the developing world, and about double that in the West. Last November's stock offering, which raised some Dollars 400m, brings the company's debt-to-capital ratio down from around 51 per cent to 35 per cent. This, Mr Mark says, is 'a little on the low side, but we want to have a little reserve capacity to do what we think is right'. Wall Street expects that to include more takeovers. Mr Mark will not be drawn, but stresses any future acquisitions will only be in core businesses and will either help give global dominance in a key business or give critical mass to a local company. He says: 'You will not see a bet-the-bank acquisition at Colgate. . . things are going well, so there's no need to bet the bank'.</p>

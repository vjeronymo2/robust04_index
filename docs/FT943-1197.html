			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / US court reverses ban on nuclear waste ship A potentially embarrassing setback for US nuclear non-proliferation policy was averted late on Friday when a federal appeals court reversed a lower court's injunction blocking the arrival in South Carolina of a shipment of spent nuclear fuel from European research reactors. The earlier injunction, issued after a Danish freighter had set sail carrying casks of highly enriched uranium from research reactors in Denmark and Sweden, had prompted some nuclear proliferation experts to raise the spectre of a radioactive Flying Dutchman, barred from docking at its intended destination but forbidden also to return to its home port. The injunction had also jeopardised the US's credibility in the Geneva negotiations over the extension of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, because it was seen by some countries as further evidence of the US's inability to live up to its side of the bargain implicit in the treaty. The spent fuel, which is much closer to bomb-grade uranium than the less enriched fuel used in power generation reactors, and therefore much more of a proliferation threat, is the product of the US's 30-year-old off-site fuel programme. Under this programme, the US agreed to accept spent fuel from participating foreign reactor plants. In return, they committed themselves to switch to less dangerous low enriched fuel. This shipment is part of an emergency programme to relieve the urgent storage problems experienced by some research reactors as a result of the US's five-year suspension of the programme. The US is now working on an environmental impact statement to allow the programme to be fully restored. However, the Department of Energy is still a long way from settling on a long-term solution to the problem of storing spent nuclear fuel, including the much larger quantities of less enriched but still highly radioactive waste from US commercial reactors.</p>

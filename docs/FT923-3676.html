			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: JCI profits increase by 5.2% SOUTH AFRICA'S third largest mining house, Johannesburg Consolidated Investment (JCI), yesterday revealed a 5.3 per cent rise in earnings to 298 cents a share for the 12 months ending June 30 from 283 cents a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Johannesburg. Net profits rose by 5.2 per cent to R439.6m (Dollars 159.80m) from R418.0m while the annual dividend is being raised to 133 cents a share from 132.7 cents. JCI expanded its coal operations in 1990 with the purchase of 40 per cent of the Middelburg Colliery. Mr Pa Retief said the company had no intention of listing its coal interests on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange while the business was so vulnerable. 'We'd rather go to the market at a more opportune moment,' he said. Platinum profits fell by 39 per cent to R120.1m from R196.2m, which had a big impact on the group's overall earnings. Diamond contributions to the group were down 13 per cent to R68.8m from R78.8m. He said the diamond industry was very difficult to forecast at the moment. JCI's gold interests suffered from higher costs stemming from the country's average 15 per cent inflation rate as well as low gold prices, it said.</p>

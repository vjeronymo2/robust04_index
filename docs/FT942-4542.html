			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Statistics tell nothing about individual poor Sir, Following publication of the Institute for Fiscal Studies report on the distribution of incomes, you comment in your editorial ('More unequal than others', June 3) that 'the evidence that the poorest in society are not benefiting from the economic growth enjoyed by the majority is mounting'. However, what the IFS figures show, very clearly, is just how misleading some statistics can be. It needs to be pointed out that the figures tell us nothing about how individuals fared over any of the time periods studied in the report. Its data contained no information about how individuals, or households, who appeared in the 'poor' category in one year progressed in subsequent years. A different group of people appeared in each of the years under investigation. This rather limits the usefulness of the findings when it comes to policy implications, especially when we note that the level of state benefits for the poorest has increased by 49 per cent in real terms between 1961 and 1991.

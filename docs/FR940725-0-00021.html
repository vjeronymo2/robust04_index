			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA assumes that nearly all aircraft operating in the vicinity of the Billings Class C airspace area already have Mode C transponders and two-way radio communications capability. All aircraft (except those without an electrical system, balloons, and gliders) flying in the vicinity of the Billings Logan International Airport have been required (under 14 CFR Section 91.215(b)(5)(ii)) to have a Mode C transponder since December 30, 1990. Aircraft with Mode C transponders are usually equipped with two-way radio communications capability because radios are considered a more basic piece of avionics equipment. Since the cost of the Mode C requirement has already been addressed (Phase II of the Mode C Rule), it is not considered separately here in order to avoid double counting. This final rule will terminate the exemption from the Mode C requirement for gliders, balloons, and aircraft certified without engine-driven electrical systems. The overall economic impact will be very slight because there are not many of these aircraft, and ATC will have discretion to authorize deviations from the Mode C requirement for these aircraft on an individual basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area is not expected to have any adverse impacts on the operations of the two small satellite airports (Laurel Municipal and Airpark Oscars) located in the vicinity of Billings Logan International Airport. Pilots using these airports who do not have the required equipment can circumnavigate the Class C airspace area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The benefits of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will be enhanced aviation safety (lowered risk of midair collisions) and improved operational efficiency (higher air traffic controller productivity with existing resources). These potential benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Thus, such benefits have been analyzed in qualitative terms and are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAR Task Group found that airspace users, especially GA users, encountered significant problems with terminal radar services. Different levels of radar service offered within terminal areas caused confusion about existing restrictions and privileges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standardization and simplification of operating procedures provided by Class C airspace is expected to alleviate many of these problems. All these benefits of the Class C airspace program, however, cannot be specifically attributed to individual airports. Rather, the benefits will result from overall improvements in terminal area ATC procedures realized as Class C airspace is implemented throughout the country. Establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will contribute to these overall improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Billings, MT, Class C airspace area will lower the risk of midair collisions due to the increase of controlled airspace around Billings. Due to the proactive nature of the Class C airspace, the potential safety benefits are difficult to quantify in monetary terms. Traffic trends indicate an increased probability of a midair collision at Billings. The FAA is, therefore, establishing a Class C airspace area to prevent the development of a potential safety problem. These traffic trends consist of an increased volume of passenger enplanements and an increased complexity of aircraft operations. Complexity refers to air traffic conditions resulting from a mix of controlled and uncontrolled aircraft (pilots that are not in contact with ATC) that vary widely in speed and maneuverability. Enplanements at Billings, MT, for 1992 were 285,378 and are projected to be 397,000 by the year 2000. The number of aircraft operations at Billings is projected to increase from 112,000 in 1992 to 156,000 by the year 2000. The current volume of passenger enplanements and aircraft operations have made Billings, MT, eligible to become a Class C airspace area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has conservatively estimated that the Class C airspace program will reduce the risk of midair collision by 50 percent at TRSA locations. This estimate is based on studies of near midair collision (NMAC) trends and radar tracking data from the original Columbus, OH, Class C airspace location and a review of the National Transportation Safety Board's (NTSB) midair collision accident records from January 1978 to October 1984. This 50 percent reduction translates into one midair collision prevented nationally every one to two years. The FAA currently values the prevention of a human fatality at $2.6 million and the prevention of a serious injury at $640,000. The quantifiable benefits of preventing a midair collision (based on the aforementioned reports) can range from less than $172,000 (1993 dollars), a minor non-fatal accident between two GA aircraft in which both aircraft need to be replaced, to $409 million (1993 dollars), the weighted average of a midair collision between an air carrier and a GA aircraft in which there are no survivors. The benefits of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area and other designated airspace actions that require Mode C transponders cannot be separated from the benefits of the Mode C Rule and the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) Rule. These airspace actions will share potential benefits totaling $4.4 billion (discounted 7 percent, 15 years, 1993 dollars).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> International Trade Impact Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule will only affect U.S. terminal airspace operating procedures at and in the vicinity of Billings, MT. This final rule will not impose a competitive trade disadvantage on foreign firms in the sale of either foreign aviation products or services in the United States. In addition, domestic firms would not incur a competitive trade disadvantage in either the sale of United States aviation products or services in foreign countries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Federal regulations. The RFA requires a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis if a final rule will have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' FAA Order 2100.14A outlines the FAA's procedures and criteria for implementing the RFA. Small entities are independently owned and operated small businesses and small not for profit organizations. A substantial number of small entities is defined as a number that is 11 or more and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of this evaluation, the small entities that will be potentially affected by this final rule are defined as fixed-base operators, airport operators, flight schools, agricultural operators, and other small aviation businesses operating in the vicinity of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area. Sport aviation interests that may be affected include ballooning, parachuting, and gliding. Mandatory participation in the Class C airspace and special conditions around Billings could potentially impose certain costs (i.e., avionics equipment) on aircraft operators. The FAA will develop special procedures to accommodate these activities through local agreements between ATC and the affected organizations. For these reasons, the FAA does not expect any adverse impacts to occur as a result of the establishment of the Billings, MT, Class C airspace area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

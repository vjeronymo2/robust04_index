			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TO THESE FANS, NCAA MEANS NO CLUE AT ALL  </P> <P> I am appalled by the audacity of the NCAA in its refusal to grant Cal State  Long Beach basketball a berth in the postseason tournament.  </P> <P> On one hand, these deities harass numerous coaches and their programs for  archaic infractions, yet on the other hand, the NCAA cozies up to CBS and  blames their subsequent malfeasance on the late timing of the final Big West  match.  </P> <P> The officials of the NCAA should be subject to the same scrutiny and virulent  judgment that they parcel out -- and heading the inquisition should be Jerry  Tarkanian, Neil McCarthy and Joe Harrington. I'm sure those three gentlemen  would not be at a loss to locate transgressions of the accused.  </P> <P> LENORE HAYES  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

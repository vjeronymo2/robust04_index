			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From 17 January PAEVALEHT, p 3] </F>   [Excerpt] Monday, January 17 -- New Foreign Minister Juri  Luik said that he accepted the offer of the ministerial post  since he already had some experience in foreign politics. He  had also stressed the political aspect in his work as the  defence minister, Luik added.    Luik commended the intellectual potential of the Foreign  Ministry and hoped that he could exploit it efficiently. He  also expressed his confidence that the new Defence Minister  Indrek Kannik will manage well.    The main guarantee of Estonia's statehood is its impeccable  reputation and other countries' awareness of Estonia, Luik went  on. It is extremely difficult to interfere in the politics of a  peaceful and stable country and there are few states ready for  an outright aggression, he stressed. [passage omitted]</p>

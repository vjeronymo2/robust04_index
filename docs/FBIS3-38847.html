			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRG Defense Minister Volker Ruehe by Ute </F> Bruessel; place and date not given: "Ruehe: Weapons for  Bosnian Muslims!"]    [Text] [Bruessel] Will air strikes now become more likely  [in Bosnia]?    [Ruehe] The United Nations has to decide whether and how it  wants to punish the culprits. If necessary, the humanitarian  measures have to be temporarily suspended. It is not enough to  protect the UN troops. The protection of the population is far  more urgent, and it requires a different strategy than before.    [Bruessel] What can Germany do?    [Ruehe] I have advocated for a long time that the Bosnian  Muslims be armed so that they can better defend themselves.  Germany will not recognize borders that are changed by force.  The aggressor will not get a single mark for reconstruction.  Now we are supporting vigorously the decisionmaking process of  the United Nations, NATO, and the European Union. We agree with  Washington on what has to be done.    [Bruessel] How can the Bundeswehr participate in a NATO  mission?    [Ruehe] For months, our Luftwaffe has been taking food and  medicine to Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia every day. Our ships  and aircraft have been helping to enforce the embargo. The  unclarified constitutional issue does not permit more.  Moreover, the participation of German soldiers in a NATO combat  mission would complicate the conflict rather than help to solve  it.    [Bruessel] Is NATO unable to act?    [Ruehe] The UN Security Council must now show that it is  able to act resolutely, quickly, and responsibly. It would be  unfair to criticize NATO since only the United Nations can make  the decision.</p>

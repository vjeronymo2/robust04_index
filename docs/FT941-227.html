			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Berlusconi tries to fill cracks in alliance Mr Umberto Bossi, leader of the populist Northern League, was under pressure yesterday to drop his reservations about forming a government with media magnate, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance party of Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr Bossi's reluctance is the principal hurdle to forming a new government in the wake of the Freedom Alliance's obtaining 366 of the 630 seats in the general election. Mr Berlusconi sought to overcome Mr Bossi's objections to the presence of the MSI in a future government in their first meeting since the elections. Afterwards a spokesman for Mr Berlusconi said the meeting had been 'positive'. He went on to voice optimism about the early formation of a government composed of the League, Forza Italia, the MSI and the small break-away faction of the former Christian Democrats, the Christian Democratic Centre. However, from the limited comment it was clear serious differences remain between Mr Bossi and his putative partners in government. Mr Bossi has argued strongly that he formed an electoral alliance with Forza Italia and no other political grouping. The Forza Italia electoral alliance with Mr Fini's MSI did not concern the League, he maintains. Thus he is not obliged to associate in government with the MSI whom he has labled as 'reactionary fascists'. At the same time, Mr Bossi's has insisted - at least in public - that a League figure become the next prime minister rather than Mr Berlusconi. Mr Bossi maintains that the premiership should go to the party with the most deputies. The League has 118 against Forza Italia's 101 and the MSI's 105. This, however, ignores the support provided by Forza Italia to ensure the election of most League deputies. While the pressure was on Mr Bossi to drop his reservations, the other political parties made it clear the Freedom Alliance was under an obligation to form the next government. Several political leaders said if the Alliance had fought the election as a bloc, then it owed a responsibility to the electorate to form a government now that it had a majority in parliament. The outgoing government also signalled a degree of impatience yesterday with the politicians. After a cabinet meeting, it issued a statement saying it hoped to be able to hand over to the new executive 'as soon as possible'. As efforts concentrated on the difficult task of forming a new government, the first political fall-out occurred among the losing parties. Mr Mino Martinazzoli resigned as leader of the Popular party. Mr Martinazzoli had been brought in from retirement in late 1992 to guide a demoralised Christian Democrat party.</p>

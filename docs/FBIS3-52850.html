			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report, followed by Gil'ad 'Adin studio </F> report]    [Text] The Defense Ministry has detailed plans for the  Judaea and Samaria roads after the Palestinian autonomy is  established. Our correspondent has learned that the Defense  Ministry has prepared a map showing all the bypass roads that  will be paved when the negotiations with the PLO end. Our  correspondent Gil'ad 'Adin has the details:    The negotiations on the second stage of the implementation  of  the autonomy have not yet started, but a map of the autonomy  roads is ready. The Defense Ministry defined the autonomy's  areas considered dangerous and its presumed borders. The  definitions were handed over to the Construction and Housing  Ministry, and Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer instructed the  Public Works Division [PWD] to prepare detailed plans for paving  the new roads.    According to the map of the autonomy roads, 620 km of new  roads will be paved. The work will be on an enormous scale,  including bypass road for dangerous areas, safe access routes to  the settlements in the territories, and roads along the autonomy  borders which will serve those wishing to avoid the entire area.  The new map was designed to be incorporated into the map of the  peace roads, of which we reported some three months ago. That  map provided a general plan for roads to the neighboring Arab  countries, and not roads leading to specific settlements. The  autonomy roads project will cost some 2 billion new Israeli  shekels. It is not included in this year's PWD budget, which is  why an additional budget is currently needed.    The Defense and the Construction and Housing Ministries are  keeping the plan secret. We have learned that a detailed map  has been prepared, and now it is clearer what the finance  minister was referring to when he said, after the state budget  was approved, that an additional budget will be required for  plans connected with the establishment of the autonomy.</p>

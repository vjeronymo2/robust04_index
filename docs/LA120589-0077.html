			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY SELECTION BEGINS IN MONTOYA'S BRIBERY TRIAL  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), the first legislator indicted in a federal  corruption probe in the state Capitol, went on trial Monday on 12 counts of  extortion, bribery, racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Milton Schwartz, joined by prosecutors, Montoya and his  attorneys, spent much of the day questioning individual jurors in private in an  effort to impanel a jury that has not been influenced by media coverage of the  case.  </P> <P> Lawyers predicted that a jury would be selected by today and that attorneys  would deliver their opening statements Wednesday.  </P> <P> The charges against Montoya stem from a sting operation in which undercover FBI  agents gave the senator $3,000 during a breakfast meeting. The exchange of  money -- later reported by Montoya as an honorarium -- was secretly videotaped  by another agent. Federal prosecutors also have alleged that Montoya solicited  bribes in exchange for his vote on specific bills.  </P> <P> But Michael Sands, Montoya's attorney, expressed confidence in the senator's  innocence. "We're ready to try a very good case," Sands told reporters.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, U.S. Atty. David Levi, who is prosecuting Montoya, filed a  list of 63 probable witnesses, including actor Ed Asner, Gene Upshaw, executive  director of the NFL Players Assn., and former sports agent Michael Trope.  </P> <P> Among those on the list of prosecution witnesses were six current and former  members of Montoya's staff, 14 lobbyists and various state officials, including  former acting State Treasurer Elizabeth Whitney.  </P> <P> Also included were Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), himself a subject of the  federal probe, Sen. Rose Ann Vuich (D-Dinuba), and former Assemblyman Bruce  Young, whose conviction of mail fraud in an earlier Capitol corruption case was  overturned.  </P></p>

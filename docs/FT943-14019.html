			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / UK Company News: ASH ahead 19% but interim omitted Automated Security (Holdings), the international electronic security systems company, yesterday revealed a 19 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits, but announced that it would not pay an interim dividend. This follows a furore over the 1993 interim dividend, which was paid in scrip form, but was not adjusted when the shares dropped after a profits warning. The company said 64 per cent of its shareholders held American Depositary Receipts, and preferred cash to be reinvested in the company, but a new dividend policy would be developed during the year. ASH's pre-tax profits for the six months to May 31 amounted to Pounds 5.79m (Pounds 4.86m). ASH Europe, primarily the group's UK operations, remained the main engine for growth, with revenue increasing 12 per cent to Pounds 59.4m, and operating profits up 5 per cent at Pounds 10.1m. The US business has suffered from a recession-hit Californian market, with turnover rising only 0.1 per cent to Pounds 22.2m. Operating profits fell by 8 per cent to Pounds 3.63m, reflecting an increased depreciation charge at its API subsidiary. However, US sales are recovering, and showed a 21 per cent increase in the second quarter. Overall, group turnover amounted to Pounds 81.6m (Pounds 78.2m), while operating profits fell marginally to Pounds 11.79m. ASH is launching a second generation TVX system next year, which will substantially reduce costs for its successful alarm verification units. The latest figures were adjusted for the restructuring of the company's Dollars 54m (Pounds 35.5m) of stapled units, which have been replaced with a Dollars 55m placement of debt. Previously, interest charges on this debt had been accounted for as minority interests, but Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.2m) was charged as interest in the latest interim profits. Earnings per share amounted to 3p (2.1p).</p>

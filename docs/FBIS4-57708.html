			<p>BFN     [Text] General Rodolfo Stange travelled to the northern  region of the country this afternoon. He delegated his duties to  Carabineros Deputy Director General Fernando Cordero. Having  arrived in Iquique this evening, Gen. Stange asserted that his  relations with the government are normal.    Gen. Stange travelled to Iquique accompanied by his wife and  retinue aboard a commercial flight. The defense minister had  previously issued a brief communique stating that before  leaving, Gen. Stange had officially delegated to the Carabineros  deputy director general, General Fernando Cordero, all the power  and duties that the Carabineros Organizational Law permits him.  Following his arrival in Iquique this evening, Gen. Stange said  that the issue of the command was not under discussion. He said:    [Begin recording] [Stange] I have not handed over command.  It  is one thing to delegate some normal duties, but quite another  to delegate command. The command of the Carabineros is vested in  the director general.    [Unidentified reporter] General Stange, how are your  relations with the president of the Republic at present?    [Stange] Well, normal. Here there is no...[changes thought]  There is no reason why they should have changed.    [Reporter] What is your assessment of the problematic  situation you have had to face?    [Stange] In what sense problematic?    [Reporter] In the sense that you had to be on leave for a  considerable period of time.    [Stange] Well, yes, I was on vacation.    [Reporter] [words indistinct] how do you evaluate the case  of  the murder of the three Communist leaders?    [Stange] That is another subject about which I am not going  to comment; you are asking me questions I cannot answer, as this  involves a lawsuit which is at another stage. [end recording]    Gen. Stange will stay in the northern region for  approximately two weeks inspecting various Carabineros units.  The trip is being made within the framework of a study he is  doing to draft a plan to streamline the institution, a task  entrusted to him by the defense minister.</p>

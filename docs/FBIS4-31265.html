			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ejup Ganic, vice president of the Federation </F> of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Geneva; date not given -- recorded]    [Text] The talks with Butrus Butrus-Ghali were very  interesting because Europe is celebrating D-Day, the day when it  united itself against fascism and against Hitler.  Unfortunately, we here in Geneva are holding talks with those  who have started fascism, and I think the United Nations should  draw a parallel between these two days, today and the day that  is being celebrated in Europe -- this is very euphoric -- the  day when all forces united against Hitler. However, they have  allowed the Belgrade fascism to promote its ideas here in the  heart of Europe.    Butrus-Ghali said that the United Nations has had many  problems recently. Problems are appearing everywhere. Of  course, we have stressed that this is, above all, the  responsibility of the United Nations, which did not act  preventively and did not stop the ethnic cleansing and genocide  in Bosnia. They have verified and bred the virus of ethnic  cleansing that is now spreading throughout the world. I think  the situation is very alarming and that the United Nations must  demonstrate consistency in Bosnia; it must stop fascism to  somehow regain its credibility and do something in other parts  of the world.    The talks are continuing. Of course, the aggressor is using  the tactics of freezing. It wants the United Nations to protect  the territories that it has captured as well as its trenches on  the front lines; its soldiers are tired and are demanding to be  replaced. However, we will not agree to that. The negotiations  are still going on.</p>

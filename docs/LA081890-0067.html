			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GOOD SURFING STORY  </P> <P> Bravo, yahoo, excellent, great!  </P> <P> The article about Mitch Thorson (Ventura County Life, Aug. 2) was the best  surfing article to come out from any area newspaper ever! Perfect! The focus  was on a transplanted local, local board-builder, (Malcolm's, the best we have  in Ventura County), etc.  </P> <P> Thanks very much for depicting surfers as intelligent human beings and not  going for the stereotype "Jeff Spigoli"!  </P> <P> You have endeared the Ventura County Edition of the Los Angeles Times to every  surfer in Ventura County. Please more, more, more surfing of the Ventura County  variety.  </P> <P> MICHAEL RICHARD  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

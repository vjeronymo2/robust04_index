			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: City lukewarm on gilts funding move MR LAMONT yesterday announced a move to allow purchases of government bonds by banks and building societies to count towards the public sector borrowing requirement. However, the City warned that further significant changes would be needed to the way the PSBR is funded to relieve pressures in the gilts market. The extent of the government's borrowing needs in the coming financial year became clear as the chancellor announced an expected PSBR of Pounds 50bn. This topped most City expectations by at least Pounds 5bn and led to a fall in gilts prices by one percentage point. The move away from the so-called 'full-funding' rule to one of 'underfunding' had been urged on the chancellor by the City. By reducing the amount of gilts that need to be sold to other investors, the intention is to ease pressure on gilts and prevent long-term interest rates from rising. Banks and building societies have bought Pounds 5.5bn of gilts in the first 11 months of the current financial year, up from less than Pounds 1bn in the whole of 1991-92. However, most said yesterday that they would be unlikely to increase their holdings unless the Bank of England designed some of its gilt sales to suit the particular needs of credit institutions. A change in policy to issuing more shorter-dated gilts, with maturities of less than five years, would encourage more buying, a number of them said. This is because banks prefer to hold short-dated bonds for liquidity purposes, and because longer-dated gilts are more vulnerable to changes in inflation and other factors. Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank, said he anticipated discussions among banks and the Bank of England to ensure the issue of more short-term gilts such as one-year notes. Banks also said that the difference between money market interest rates and short-dated gilt yields would have to widen to make it more attractive for them to buy gilts. Money market rates are now just below 6 per cent, while five-year gilts yield only around half a percentage point more. This difference would need to rise to encourage banks to buy more gilts, said Mr Philip Guy, treasurer of Hill Samuel. The City reacted with disappointment to the announcement that stamp duty on share transactions would stay for at least another year. The tax was scheduled to be abolished with the introduction of Taurus, the Stock Exchange's planned paperless settlement system which was scrapped last week.</p>

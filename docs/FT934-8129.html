			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (11): It's all about image  -Profile: Roger Hayes of the British Nuclear Industry Forum THE TRADITIONAL route to the top in UK nuclear organisations has been long years of work, usually technical, in the industry. Outsiders have found it difficult to penetrate a secretive and inward looking world. But the introspective culture has been slowly changing following the appointment in recent years of Mr Bob Hawley and Mr James Hann, both outsiders recruited from the private sector, as chief executive of Nuclear Electric and chairman of Scottish Nuclear respectively. The latest outsider is Roger Hayes who has been chosen for the job of director general of the British Nuclear Industry Forum, an umbrella for some 72 nuclear-related companies including Rolls-Royce and GEC. It is reflective of the industry's desire to break out of its egg-headed, closeted image that his background is in public relations. There is plenty of scope for him to make use of his skills. The next six months or so could be crucial to the future of nuclear power in the UK. Following the decision not to privatise Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear in 1989, when the rest of the electricity supply industry was sold off to the private sector, the British government is due to start a nuclear review by the end of next month. Although the review is unlikely to rule out construction of more nuclear power stations it will have a decisive influence on the speed of development. There could also be a greater role for the private sector and Nuclear Electric is pressing hard that it be privatised. Rarely has the UK nuclear industry needed an effective spokesman more strongly. Mr Hayes, 48, has experience both in corporate and political lobbying. After a spell as Reuter economics correspondent in Paris in the late 1960s and early 1970s he joined Burston Marsteller to specialise in corporate affairs for multinationals and governments. In a decade with BM he was involved both with British politics through the 'Britain in Europe' campaign and as a founder of the Tory Reform Group. In the 1980s he had spells with Thorn EMI as corporate communications director and developing his own consultancy before moving to Ford of Europe in 1991 as vice president of public and government affairs. His tenure at Ford ended this year after the appointment of Mr Jacques Nasser as head of Ford of Europe. Hayes puts it down to strategic differences but admits that it was difficult for an outsider at Ford, a company which like the nuclear industry normally expects senior executives to be products of the motor sector. 'The average Ford employee has about 23 years with the company. I did not know the industry well and it was quite difficult to gain credibility.' Part of the difficulty was lack of time, says Hayes. He was at Ford for two years but expects to spend longer at BNIF. His aim is to 'bring the forum and the industry more into the centre of events' partly by playing a bigger role internationally and partly by making it more active. 'Like many other people I think the industry has been timid and defensive. We must answer the views of our critics in Greenpeace and other organisations but we should not get too bogged down in that. We also need to stake out some territory of our own. 'We must certainly put the business case for nuclear power and demonstrate the industry's role to reduce global warming. It is also important for the big companies to sing the same song. Maybe I will need to knock some heads together.' That may prove difficult. Although the nuclear industry is at one on some obvious issues, such as pressing for expansion, there are significant differences between Nuclear Electric and British Nuclear Fuels over contract prices and between Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear over privatisation. Privatisation will be a crucial element of the nuclear review if Nuclear Electric has its way but Scottish Nuclear is much less convinced about whether it is the right way ahead if the industry wants to expand. Mr Hayes says the role of the forum should be to reconcile and balance interests. 'There are some issues where it will not be possible to have a forum view. There may be others where we have a view but do not want to communicate it.' Generally, however, Mr Hayes will preach the communications gospel. 'Any industry that fails to communicate suffers but particularly one, like ours, that is sensitive to public opinion.' He promises a broad brush approach that will include seminars and literature but also wants to investigate the targeting of specific audiences such as members of the CBI and women.</p>

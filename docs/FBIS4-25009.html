			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Billy Wong Wai-yuk and Beverly Chau in Longgang and </F> Queenie Wang in Hong Kong]    [Text] More than a hundred workers are believed to be  trapped in a mainland factory which collapsed yesterday, killing  at least six people. Reports suggested that 200 people were  sleeping in the five-storey building in Longgang, near Shenzhen,  when it collapsed at 7.30 am -- and the death toll seems certain  to rise today as rescuers delve further into the debris.    Hospitals said 63 people, mostly women aged between 15 and  25, were injured in the tragedy. Nine were in a critical  condition. Chinese officials claimed that the building, the Xie  Cheng toy factory, was owned by a Hong Kong businessman known as  Mr Wong. It had been built without permission, they said.    Last night reports said he had been arrested by Shenzhen  police, although workers at the site maintained the owner was  from Fujian. Local government spokesman Huang Xinhua said: "We  have learned that the factory boss had not obtained permission  to build and had not taken out insurance for the work.    "Workers, mostly women from the countryside, were sleeping  in  the building when the disaster occurred." The factory comprised  about 2,000 square metres and was situated about 40 kilometres  from Shenzhen, outside the Special Economic Zone.    Li Xiaogan, a spokesman for Shenzhen Municipal Government,  said the rescue effort would continue overnight and into today.  He said construction of the building began about two months  ago. Three storeys had been completed and work had started on  the remaining two. Most of the workers, believed to have come  from Sichuan, Hunan, Henan and Anhui provinces, were given  temporary accommodation on the first and second floors. As a  result, said Mr Li, identification of the dead could take some  time.    Shenzhen's mayor, Li You-wei, rushed to the scene to help  organise the rescue effort as soon as details of the tragedy  emerged.    Weeping eyewitness Deng Suo, 20, who was employed at the  factory, recalled the fatal moment when she lost many of her  friends and colleagues. "I heard a very big crash when I was  waking up. I knew something terrible must have happened. I  rushed out and saw the five-storey building collapse into  rubble," she said. "I didn't know what to do. My friends were  inside. We sent someone to call the police and did what we  could to help." Deng Suo said there was so much chaos and heavy  masonry that they were powerless to help. Some people were so  distraught they just clasped each other and cried.    Another eyewitness, Deng Maoling, 19, said she felt the  ground move when the building collapsed. "I felt the ground  shake. I thought I was in a dream. When I realised what had  actually happened, it was worse than a nightmare," she said.    The development originally comprised one five-storey block,  accommodating more than 1,000 workers, she said. The ground  floor was used as a factory and the upper four floors were  dormitories. "The owner wanted to develop the business and was  trying to employ more workers. So they started to build a new  block two months ago. They moved more than 200 workers from the  original block to the second floor of the new building which was  still under construction," she said.    Deng Maoling said she had been waiting 10 hours to see if  any of her friends would come out alive. She claimed she had  counted many people, including six dead bodies, being brought  out. "I'm sure many of them are still in the rubble," she added.    Victims were taken to Longgang County Number Two People's  Hospital, the biggest in the area. An employee there said some  were seriously injured, suffering broken arms and legs. One  victim was seen in the casualty ward lying motionless on a  stretcher with his head bandaged and bleeding profusely from the  nose. Further eyewitness accounts were prevented by Public  Security Bureau officials "acting on orders from above," who  briefly detained reporters and confiscated film.    The accident is expected to renew debate over the safety of  factories -- particularly those owned by Hong Kong entrepreneurs  -- in China. Last November, 84 people died in a blaze which  swept through a toy factory owned by a Hong Kong businessman in  the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone. The businessman, Lo  Chiu-chuen, is currently in jail in China awaiting trial.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Floating in a much colder climate - Richard Tomkins reports on Northwest's problems and prospects Pity Northwest Airlines. Back in January, it might have made sense for the fourth-biggest US carrier to plan a return to the stock market this month with an initial public offering worth about Dollars 400m. With hindsight, the timing could hardly have been worse. The company's executives must have watched aghast as the climate for the offering turned from fair to abysmal. First, the US domestic air fare war was given fresh momentum by the outbreak of a new battle in the east coast market. Then USAir, the sixth-biggest US carrier, warned that competition from low-cost carriers would cause it to lose even more money than last year's net loss of Dollars 349m. Next, stock market analysts started reassessing their forecasts of a current year recovery for the US airline industry. On Wednesday this week, Northwest slashed the expected asking price from its earlier target range of Dollars 19-Dollars 21 a share to Dollars 13 or Dollars 14. Yesterday produced yet another blow to the offer when American Airlines, the second-biggest US carrier, confirmed reports that it was heading for worse-than-expected losses in its first quarter. Northwest then announced it was indeed opting for the bottom end of its new range by pricing the shares at Dollars 13 each. Even before the spate of bad news began, enthusiasm for the offer had been tepid. Just six months earlier, in July 1993, the airline's heavy debts and mounting losses had come within a whisker of taking it into bankruptcy. Northwest was not the only airline losing money: the US industry as a whole had lost Dollars 10bn in the preceding three years. But Northwest's problems were worse than most other companies' because the airline had been taken private in 1989 through a highly-leveraged buy-out that left it burdened with Dollars 3.4bn of debt. Unable to service its debts, Northwest narrowly avoided bankruptcy by deferring Dollars 3.1bn worth of new aircraft deliveries over the next eight years and reaching an agreement with its unions cutting Dollars 886m from labour costs over the next three years. These moves persuaded its creditors to defer the maturities of Dollars 1.8bn worth of debt obligations due between now and 1996. Since then, the airline has done relatively well. It was the only one of the five biggest US airlines to turn in a profit in last year's fourth quarter. (It made a net profit of Dollars 10.5m compared with net losses of Dollars 695m the previous time.) Analysts have predicted that the combination of Northwest's lower debt and labour costs combined with a pick-up in the US air travel market could bring net profits of Dollars 300m to Dollars 400m this year. By some measures, the airline's prospects are attractive. Its markets are less exposed to low-cost competition than those of some other US carriers; it is building a global route network through its strong strategic alliance with KLM, the Dutch carrier, which holds a 21 per cent stake in the company; and it is by far the strongest US carrier in the US-Japan market. Investors, however, remain cautious. Many of the measures that have led to Northwest's recovery sound more like a temporary reprieve than a permanent solution. The labour cost agreement, for example, was for three years only, so wages will snap back to pre-concession levels in August 1996; the deferred debt of Dollars 1.8bn will still become payable in 1997; and aircraft renewals cannot be put off forever. Nor does it help that Fortune magazine recently ranked the company as far down as number 400 in a list of the 404 most admired US companies. At the top of the original targeted range, Northwest's initial public offering would have raised Dollars 420m before underwriting fees, with the bulk of the money being applied towards debt reduction. Yesterday, that figure shrunk to something nearer Dollars 260m. The figures may seem almost irrelevant in the context of the airline's Dollars 4.4bn of net debt at the end of last year. But analysts assume the offering was aimed at re-establishing the company on the stock market to open the way for further, larger scale fund raisings. A flop now will augur badly for the future.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: London cocoa market breaches Pounds 1,000 barrier THE LONDON cocoa futures market yesterday broke through the Pounds 1,000-a-tonne barrier for the first time in more than five years as technically-inspired buying by New York investment funds continued to fuel the recent uptrend. Early trading saw the March position leap to Pounds 1,025 a tonne, but expectations of strong resistance between that price and Pounds 1,060 - a former support level - took the steam out of the market and the price dipped back below Pounds 1,000. It steadied again in late trading, however, to close at Pounds 1,013 a tonne, up Pounds 20 on balance. Analysts were divided about the technical picture. Some saw it as unequivocally bullish, while others were concerned about the big 'chart gap' left by the Pounds 66-a-tonne surge over the past week. And there were doubts about the timing of the move - when west African crops were just beginning to be harvested. Unanimity remained, however, on longer term factors, which London trader GNI said pointed to the start of a bull market that could see prices tripling over the next three years. After two production deficits demand is generally expected to outstrip production for several more years.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Reich on a 'third way' to jobs: David Goodhart records the US labour secretary's 'flexible' views Creating not only more jobs but better jobs, in an increasingly insecure economic environment, was one of the promises that propelled a Democrat into the White House 18 months ago. This week, Mr Robert Reich, the loquacious US labour secretary, is touring Europe with a progress report on that promise and advocating a 'third way' between the low unemployment/low social protection US model and the high unemployment/high social protection European model. Mr Reich, with a flair for coining phrases reminiscent of his fellow economist, Professor J K Galbraith, paints a bleak vision of the future unless the gap between the labour market's privileged and its deprived is closed. He describes how US society is already divided into an elite 'over-class' of 15 per cent of the population, increasingly segregated from the rest of society, and a deprived 'under-class' of a similar proportion. This division has been a blessing for the US private security industry, which has more employees than the public police forces. Squeezed between the over- and under-class is the 'anxious' class, what used to be called the middle-class, whose incomes have been static for 20 years and who are increasingly prey to demagogues demanding an end to free trade. 'The coming political battle will be for the souls of the anxious class,' says Mr Reich. So how is the Democratic administration doing in this battle? Some 3m mainly private-sector jobs have been created in the past 16 months, an improvement on the previous four years but one that is substantially cyclical in nature. The 'structural' reforms - aimed at raising the quality of the workforce and creating more good jobs - take longer. There are three basic ideas: to improve the school-to-work transition with better vocational training, to provide more tax credits for low earners, and to turn the social safety net into a lifelong learning 'springboard' to re-employment. 'Legislation we now have before Congress will begin to turn our unemployment system into a re-employment system that launches workers into new jobs. Security comes from maintaining a flexible set of skills,' says Mr Reich. He insists that it is not just a matter for the state - rather for government, employers and employees. What relevance does this have for the Europe Mr Reich is visiting - yesterday in London, today in Paris at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and on Wednesday at the International Labour Organisation conference in Geneva? Yesterday, to his hosts in London, the left-of-centre Institute for Public Policy Research, he stressed that increased flexibility is not the same as the labour market de-regulation favoured by British Conservatives. But he did not only say things that raise a cheer from a left-of-centre audience. He argued against traditional job subsidies, saying that, in 70 per cent of cases, employers are being subsidised for employees they would have hired without a subsidy. Mr Reich was also circumspect about whether trade sanctions are the right means to enforce basic labour and human rights standards in the developing world. He does believe it is legitimate to press developing countries on some basic standards but he believes this pressure should be exerted through 'a menu' of levers, not just through trade.

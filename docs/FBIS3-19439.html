			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said that  Greece will veto The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  [FYROM] participation in the European Union's [EU] PHARE  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program,  which provides financing for the economic restructuring of  Central and East European countries. FYROM's participation in  the program was announced by the EU Commission's legal  department, but as Venizelos explained, the extension of the  program to countries of the former Yugoslavia is decided by the  EU Council of Ministers where agreement is necessary. FYROM  participation in the program requires a special regulation as  happened in the case of Croatia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing the EPA's preliminary views on how the EPA intends to review SIPs and SIP revisions submitted under Title I of the CAA, including those State submittals containing moderate CO nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992) and 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). Because the EPA is describing its interpretations here only in broad terms, the reader should refer to the General Preamble for a more detailed discussion of the interpretations of Title I advanced in this action and the supporting rationale. In this proposed rulemaking action on certain elements of the El Paso, Texas, complete moderate CO SIP, the EPA is applying its interpretations, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 23, 1992, the Governor of Texas submitted to the EPA a SIP revision for CO concerning El Paso, which included the general SIP revision and the oxygenated fuels regulations. The State also submitted to the EPA a completed emissions inventory on November 17, 1992, and a commitment to upgrade the existing I/M Program on November 15, 1992. These elements were intended to satisfy the CAA CO SIP requirements due on November 15, 1992. The required items for the El Paso CO SIP, due November 15, 1992, unless otherwise noted, specifically include: (1) A comprehensive, accurate, and current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of CO in the nonattainment area (sections 172(c)(3) and 187(a)(1) of the CAA); (2) no later than September 30, 1995, and no later than the end of each three year period thereafter, until the area is redesignated to attainment, a revised inventory meeting the requirements of sections 187(a)(1) and 187(a)(5) of the CAA; (3) a permit program to be submitted by November 15, 1993, which meets the requirements of section 173 for the construction and operation of new and modified major stationary sources of CO (section 172(c)(5)); (4) contingency measures due November 15, 1993, that are to be implemented if the EPA determines that the area has failed to attain the primary standards by the applicable date (section 172(c)(9)); (5) a commitment to upgrade the current I/M program and submit a SIP revision for the I/M program by November 15, 1993, (section 187(a)(4)); and (6) an oxygenated fuels program (section 211(m)). As outlined below, the State of Texas' CO SIP revision concerning El Paso, a moderate CO nonattainment area, was reviewed against the applicable requirements. The reader is referred to the El Paso CO SIP submittal and the EPA's supporting technical information, Technical Support Document (TSD), for pertinent details regarding each requirement. The TSD is available for public review at the addresses indicated above for the EPA Regional Office in Dallas, the EPA Washington, D.C. office, and the TNRCC Austin office.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 110(k) of the CAA sets out provisions governing the EPA's review of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;66). In this FR action, the EPA is approving only some of the elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, specifically the 1990 base year CO emissions inventory, and the oxygenated fuels program. The inspection and maintenance (I/M) committal was addressed by the EPA in an FR notice published on September 27, 1993. The remaining elements of the complete El Paso CO SIP, to be submitted to the EPA by November 15, 1993, will be acted upon in separate FR actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed approval action does not include any approval for the El Paso Post-1982 SIP submittal. That SIP proposal was the result of a SIP call on February 24, 1984, and one to which the Texas Air Control Board (TACB) responded. However, the EPA did not take action regarding the SIP submittal, and the CAAA of 1990 have negated the need for the EPA to take further action on that SIP action revision submittal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

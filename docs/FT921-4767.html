			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Sharp rise in US employment figures A JUMP in US payroll employment last month was seen by Wall Street analysts yesterday as signalling a gradual improvement in economic prospects and a reduction in the chance of another interest rates cut. Employment in all sectors excluding agriculture rose 164,000 in February, compared with analysts' expectations of a rise of only 10,000. However, the politically-sensitive unemployment rate rose from 7.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent, the highest level for nearly seven years. The unemployment data are based on a survey of households. The rise in unemployment, seen by political analysts as a key measure of economic health, is embarrassing for President George Bush who is campaigning in southern states ahead of the critical 11 Super Tuesday primaries next week. With the economy the central campaign issue, Mr Bush is trying to convince disgruntled middle-income Americans that growth is about to resume after three years of stagnation. Financial markets, on the other hand, focus on the payroll employment figures which they view as more reliable. The employment figures are based on a survey of companies. The sharp rise in non-farm employment, coupled with an increase in the length of the average working week, was seen as reducing the chance of the Federal Reserve easing monetary policy. Indeed, many analysts now fear the Fed will have to push rates higher later this year. Mr Jim O'Sullivan, economist at J P Morgan, the New York bank, said the employment figures indicated the 'worst was over', but cautioned that the economic recovery was unlikely to be rapid. Morgan is forecasting growth of only 1 per cent at an annual rate in the second quarter of this year. The rise in payroll employment follows other mildly encouraging signs, including stronger home sales and a slight improvement in department store sales. Most analysts expect the economy to grow modestly in the second quarter, but many fear the recovery will not be robust enough to give Mr Bush a big lift in the election campaign. The effect of the rise in employment was partly offset by a revision of January's figures to show a drop of 149,000 rather than 91,000. Over both months, the underlying trend was only slightly positive. Much of last month's employment gain reflected a possibly erratic 133,000 increase in retail jobs, where seasonal adjustments are often unreliable. There were also small gains in other service sectors such as finance and real estate. Manufacturing employment was little changed after a 200,000 decline in recent months. Construction shed 30,000 jobs. Bush looks to South Carolina Page 2 In defence of his realm Page 6</p>

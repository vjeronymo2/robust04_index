As the agency has not  received the package in question, Zhang Junsheng stated that he  would decide on public comment only after he has learned the  details of the package.    When asked by a reporter about his view on the airport  financial arrangement package after attending the closing  ceremony of A China Cultural Journey, Zhang said: The airport  MOU was signed by the leaders of the two governments in  September 1991. It has been two years since the document was  signed. The British Hong Kong authorities ought to have  conducted affairs conscientiously according to the provisions of  the MOU and should not have stalled. Therefore, he believes that  Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's analogy of a Lunar New Year  gift to Hong Kong people and China is wrong.    Zhang criticized Britain for coming up with so many  packages,  but they either did not comply with the MOU or threaten to leave  the special administrative region [SAR] government with a huge  burden. Naturally, China could not agree. Thus it is not a gift  from British Hong Kong to the public; it is something that  everybody is entitled to.    Zhang continued: The airport is in Hong Kong and the money  spent is all Hong Kong taxpayers' money. It should benefit Hong  Kong people and should not increase their burdens, and in  particular, it should not leave a burden on the future SAR  government. There are only three years and five months left  before Hong Kong reverts to China. Therefore, it should not  leave a burden on Hong Kong; the SAR is going to be in Hong Kong  for a long, long time.</p>

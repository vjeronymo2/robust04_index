			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Torpstein and Shlomo Dror] </F>   [Excerpts] Dozens of sealed houses in East Jerusalem and  the West Bank were unsealed on 17 and 18 June without the  permission of the Israeli authorities. The operation was  organized by Dr. Mubarak 'Awad, the head of the Palestine Center  for Non-Violence. Palestinian political figures, who were  invited to take part in the activity, failed to show up. The  Israeli security forces did not attempt to stop the operation,  nor did they station troops around the reopened structures. The  organizers said they would continue their activities until all  the sealed houses had been unsealed. [passage omitted]    The organizers claimed that up till now, at least 50 houses,  which had been sealed up by the Israeli security forces over the  past few years, had been reopened by activists in East  Jerusalem, West Bank towns, villages, and refugee camps. The  organizers said that approximately 1,300 houses had been sealed  before and during the autonomy.    Al-Haq, the Ramallah-based Palestinian human rights  organization, estimates that the number of houses sealed or  destroyed since 1967 is approximately 2,000.</p>

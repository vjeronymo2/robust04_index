Completed the Omsk Tank  Technical School and the Armor Academy with distinction, and  then the faculty of the command and engineering personnel of the  same academy with a gold medal. He has served both in the field  and in production--in the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, in  the Far East and Carpathian military districts, and in various  command and engineering posts. He has been chief of the  Directorate for Industrial Orders and Liaison of the armaments  staff of the armed forces of Ukraine since November of 1993.    He is married, with a son who is a senior lieutenant  following in his father's footsteps, serving at a repair  enterprise.    [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, a map of Ukraine takes up a  good  half of the wall in your office, with the enterprises that make  up the defense industry marked on it. I have heard that the  production potential of the VPK [military-industrial complex]  here is quite strong, but it turns out that I did not imagine  the true scope of it. Quite a `domain' for just your  directorate...    [Vashchylin] It is indeed still a novelty that a unified  directorate for orders of weaponry and military hardware has  been created here. Another two structures actually exist that  perform some of these tasks, but the principal burden falls on  us.    I would say for comparison that there were 39 directorates  that placed orders in the former Union, with personnel numbering  some 3,900. They did not make it to a unified structure then,  even though they tried...    I would thus like to emphasize that we are not only new  people in the system of procurement of weapons and hardware that  are series-produced, but that we do not even have the  opportunity of making use of experience in that work. True, such  a system exists in the highly developed countries--the United  States and France, among others--but there the unified body is  subordinate to a specially assigned deputy secretary or minister  of defense. This emphasizes the importance of the development  and ordering of weaponry and military hardware, which should be  under unified supervision.    If we take the life cycle of an item as a whole, then there  are the stages of development, the production itself and  operation... Those stages were concentrated in the same hands,  but in different directorates, in the former Union. So the items  were created, so to speak, nearby. Though the departmental  barriers were not always helpful...    I thus feel that the unification of orders for industry in a  directorate is the most expedient. Moreover, under conditions  where military acceptance offices monitor the development and  production at the design bureaus and we have information  pertaining to operation through complaint work and trips to the  field, we come to encompass the whole cycle in general.    [Vachayev] I know that discussions have been underway for a  long time with regard to where the orders to industry should  originate. If this work is concentrated in the directorate, does  that signify that the question has been removed from the agenda?    [Vashchylin] This is quite a difficult problem. The  viewpoint  used to exist that money for procurements had to be given only  to us and no one else. But life has shown that the supply  directorate should have some procurement functions. There has to  be a lead or general customer who fills orders for the armed  forces as a whole, with regard to scientific developments, a  large range of items and so on. Certain spare parts and  materials should be partially procured by the supply structures  as well.    Why? Because the regiment needs funds, and little gets to  the  units under centralized procedure, as life has shown. They are,  moreover, linked with local industry; it is easier for them to  acquire everything they need. The regiments, divisions and  districts must be given that money, but supply services, which  are above them, are able to obtain funds for procurements. But  the chiefs of the directorates to which the units are  subordinate have to designate and ascertain the range of what is  needed by the troops. Experience shows that all of these tasks  are accomplished faster through local capabilities and knowledge  of their own requirements.    Territorial supply bodies exist as well. The directorates  themselves, concluding the corresponding agreements, should  obtain what goes through them. Otherwise, there would be an  unjustified rolling of mat&eacute;riel and money across all of  Ukraine.    And, on the contrary, what comes from the plants, from heavy  industry, has to be received by a unified body. The security  measures, transport, distribution and other issues are adhered  to in that case.    If we are to speak of the long term, then there should be  bodies, albeit small, within the concerned directorates that  place orders in the local areas. This is because there are  issues that need to be resolved in the interests of one's own  branch of the service or subordinate units. But all of this can  happen provided that we become, so to speak, richer.    [Vachayev] The question arises of interaction between you  and  other bodies. Is there understanding?    [Vashchylin] Work has become considerably easier since those  directorates delegated to us some functions pertaining first and  foremost to large orders, the major items. Moreover, the chiefs  of departments and groups in our directorate visit the chiefs of  other directorates every week, where they have an exchange of  information and seek out opportunities for the common resolution  of their problems. We are actively involving the directorate in  checking the field offices at enterprises on the pursuit of  cadre policy. We already have a Statute on Interaction that has  been approved by the deputy minister of defense for armaments  and chief of armaments for the armed forces of Ukraine and  coordinated with the chief of every directorate and legal  scholars. It clearly defines where our work and where the work  of the directorates begins.    This work procedure will also ease the signing and  coordination of all the necessary documents at various levels.  Imagine if every directorate chief would have to run around from  office to ministry with his questions, wasting time in vain and  repeating the same work. And there will be no order then at  all...    [Vachayev] The next question, no less important, is what the  directorate is engaged in. I have in mind the field or  acceptance offices. I know that when the problem of the  co-existence of your structure and the supply directorates was  being debated, the latter wanted them to be left with them...    [Vashchylin] The number of personnel at the acceptance  offices was reduced by 37 percent through combinations and the  existence of a unified directorate for placing orders. There  used to be four or five offices operating at each plant, with  each branch of the service performing their own acceptance. Now  that is gone. But unified acceptance at the enterprises, after  all, works in the interests of the tankers, the engineers and  the truckers.    We have a decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine on  the procedure for the organization and interaction of field  offices and industry and a document on acceptance that has been  coordinated with all of the directorates, in which we have  assumed all of the contemporary requirements for that body,  questions pertaining to monitoring and product quality.    A uniform approach has been devised for the organization of  complaint and claim work as well, but it still requires  refinement from a legal standpoint.    [Vachayev] Viktor Petrovych, whatever issues I may raise  with  you, it all comes down to questions of financing and money. I  know that these problems exist with you as well, as with all of  the defense industry as a whole. I would like to clarify a thing  or two in that area as well.    I'll start with our own sore spots. It happened that we in  the directorates that place the orders do not have a single one  of our own business accounts. All of the transactions are  performed through the Financial Directorate of the MO [Ministry  of Defense]; that is, it takes all of the responsibility upon  itself. And that deprives us of the right to lodge any  complaints against suppliers. We do not have the opportunity of  having any direct influence on the matter in which we are  engaged from the economic and legal standpoints. What a paradox!    Another problem consists of the fact that the absence of our  own business account leads to our financing according to the  whatever's-left-over principle. The money that is allocated only  to the Financial Directorate (and we are not able to have any  influence on the Ministry of Finance) goes to maintain the armed  forces, and some of the leftovers to the things we do.    True, it is not just a matter of the lack of a business  account here, but rather the need for a budget as such. The  experience of many countries, however, shows that the funds that  are required just for the development and procurement of  armaments and hardware are from three to seven percent of the  gross national product. Here, the minimum value of that  indicator goes to maintain the armed forces as a whole. However,  if you take my own question of procurements, then last year we  procured 12 percent of the new weaponry and hardware, and the  rest went for spare parts. Talking about the budget, meanwhile,  we received half of the minimum we were planning on.    The situation this year is even worse. They did not want to  leave even a line on financing a series of matters, including  procurements, when they were formulating the budget; even though  we are planning to obtain a little more than 20 percent of the  new models of weaponry and hardware...    It is not just a matter of the fact that the armed forces  require new hardware and weaponry. There are more than 700  enterprises in the defense industry standing behind these  figures that do not have enough work. And that, as they say, is  threatening unforeseen consequences.    If the question of creating a national program of  shipbuilding and financing for it is not resolved in the next  couple of years, for example, the slipways will be engaged in  just so-called dollar projects, and we will not be able to place  a single order there. Whereas they used to feel in the defense  industry  that getting work from the MO was a guarantee of stability, the  opposite idea prevails today: Have as little as possible to do  with defense orders as quickly as possible, because there are no  guarantees of payments. And that could lead to the disappearance  of the defense industry, as such.    [Vachayev] Stock offerings and privatization, which could  affect the former enterprises of the defense industry, are  beginning nonetheless...    [Vashchylin] I am convinced that the basic enterprises of  the  defense sector must be subordinate to the state, and perhaps to  the Ministry of Defense. We could perhaps go the way of  acquiring 51 percent of the shares of stock in those  enterprises. Turning to the experience of the developed  countries, it must be pointed out that a state sector remains in  the defense industry in them. And we should spare no funds in  this, since no owner will accept an order if it does not satisfy  him ahead of time on a financial plane.    The very acute question of organization within the framework  of a reasonable cycle of production of weaponry and hardware of  our own also arises here. It is considered expedient when that  cycle is 40-60 percent self-contained; that is, it is virtually  nowhere self-contained within the framework of a single state.  When resolving this issue we should decide, figuratively  speaking, who we are. Keeping in mind that we have 100 percent  weaponry and hardware from the former Union, and almost a  quarter of the entire defense output was made by Ukraine, it is  not hard to find the answer. I am convinced that full-fledged  and mutually advantageous ties with Russia will provide work for  our enterprises, will provide the necessary funds and will  facilitate the maintenance of combat readiness in the armed  forces of Ukraine at a suitable level.    There is another reserve that we are able to utilize -- the  arms trade on the world market. Recall that the USSR received 29  billion dollars a year from sales. There is no more Union, but a  vacuum has not been created in the arms market, since the  developed countries have instantly taken its place. They felt  this in Russia, and they began thinking about their own weapons  program and access to trade somewhere around a year and a half  ago. The corresponding structure, along the lines of a defense  export organization, has appeared. So why are we marching in  place? We have a thing or two to sell, believe me.    There is another problem that exists that I would put in  first place -- the preservation of scientific potential. The  lack of funds and orders is leading to the fact that the smart  ones are leaving for commercial structures. The scientists and  designers, in my opinion, must be paid -- and paid good money --  even when there is no work. If work should appear, and I am sure  it will, and there is no one to do it, enormous amounts of money  will not help.    In summing up our discussion, I would like to say that I see  a threefold task, on which both our directorate and the defense  industry as a whole are working, namely to preserve scientific  potential, industry and the output of defense products, both in  peacetime and during special periods.    [Vachayev] Thank you for the interesting conversation.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Who Pulled the Trigger?"] </F>   [Text] The general strike that paralyzed the country  yesterday tested the mechanisms for coexistence that the entire  Paraguayan people want and yearn for. An event that should have  gone unnoticed -- because it is an unavoidable part of the  political and legal system -- took on a tragic significance with  the death of a young peasant and the unprovoked aggression  against various journalists, including four Private  Communication Network reporters.    One fact that encourages us to meditate was clearly visible  at the end of the demonstration yesterday: Paraguayan democracy  needs to mature. Intemperance, authoritarianism, arrogance, and  resentment is still a very heavy burden on many fellow  Paraguayans' minds. It requires only a spark, or the slightest  encouragement, for these negative feelings to erupt in the most  irrational way imaginable.    That is what happened yesterday with the consequences we  must  all regret today. We have said in this column that the strike  was a right established by law and a legitimate weapon for union  struggle. We have also said that the exercise of that right  should never mean infringement on other people's right to go to  their work places. Traffic interruption and the attacks against  bus drivers are, without doubt, acts that we cannot in any way  approve.    We also believe that the attack against journalists was  totally unjustified. We must make here a basic analysis: If  only one journalist had been injured we could have accepted it  -- in a preliminary way -- as an unfortunate accident, something  that could occur anywhere in the world. But we had several  attacks and must, therefore, conclude that the incident was more  serious, that journalists were seen as necessary targets of  physical aggression for their responsibility in the events.    We cannot forget that for months the government has been  formulating the odd accusation that it is the press which  invents the problems. The president of the Republic has made  this accusation on several occasions in the angry tone that has  become part of his communication style.    And what is even worse, during a meeting between the  president and political leaders at government palace we heard  threats in a tone that Paraguayans are no longer used to hearing  and which seemed taken from the last months of 1988. What was  most serious was the fact that the president, forgetting his  position as president, accompanied those threats in general  terms against all those who use their legitimate right to  dissent against the government.    If the president forgets that he is, first, the president of  all Paraguayans and becomes incomprehensibly intemperate, it  will be very difficult to expect common sense and rationality  from modest police agents who receive orders from their  superiors. Their reaction is no accident, but a true response  to the message they heard at the highest levels.    We cannot expect too much from those who must stand in the  front line if those responsible for governing the country single  out the press as being responsible for all wrong doings and  then, when the social conflict explodes, travel to a cattle fair  abroad. They only act within the context of the ideas and  opinions being aired at the highest levels. So we must ask:  Who, in fact, pulled the trigger?</p>

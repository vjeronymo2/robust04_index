Sextant Avionique and the U.S. group Allied Signal, who had  been talking of a potential joint venture in the avionics field  since August, have agreed to abandon this project. "Exhaustive  studies (...) have confirmed that the two companies are well  positioned on their markets, but that it would not be possible  to find satisfactory arrangements for an effective integration  of Allied Signal's civilian activities and Sextant Avionique's  civilian and military operations," says the French firm in a  communique.    "The confidential nature of our defense activities (45  percent of avionics sales) required too complex a structure," is  the rationale given by Sextant Avionique, which is approaching  the event philosophically. "Such things happen; however, all  the work we did together in the last few months will not be  wasted. We shall be able to arrange more flexible partnerships  with Allied in the future." An agreement with the U.S. firm  would have broadened Sextant's business opportunities in the  United States, where the French equipment manufacturer has  already made some headway through work done on the Boeing 777.    Sextant Avionique, which has been restructuring after going  private and after Aerospatiale's partial withdrawal from its  capital in favor of Thomson-CSF (which now controls 66.6 percent  of the firm's shares) as well as the sale of Crouzet  Electromenager [household appliances] to Emerson Electric, is  currently locked in an wage dispute. After announcing, in early  January, a wage freeze which led to a walkout last Monday, the  company offered individual raises, a proposal which, according  to the CFDT [French Confederation of Labor], was rejected as  "discriminatory" by a majority of unions.</p>

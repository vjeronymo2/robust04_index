			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Industry welcomes contaminated land plans The government yesterday unveiled proposals to deal with contaminated land based on a suitable-use approach which has been broadly welcomed by industry. The approach requires remedial action only where the contamination poses a risk to health or the environment and there are appropriate and cost-effective methods of doing so. This will significantly reduce the cost to industry of cleaning up sites and moves decisively away from the hardline US policy of strict liability. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, said in a written parliamentary answer that the proposed Environment Agency should take over research work and guidance on contaminated land now being carried out by the Department of the Environment. He added that legislative amendments to the provisions would be proposed to enable regulators - the Environment Agency and local authories - to require the prevention or abatement of contamination. One move which was applauded by industry groups was the decision to repeal section 143 of the Environment Protection Act 1990. This proposed that district councils should maintain publicly available registers of all contaminated sites. Mr Gummer said that the regulatory authorities would have the task of identifying problems caused by contamination. They would keep a register of all significantly polluted sites in their area, recording actual rather than suspected contamination. He added that the government did not consider that a general register of land subject to potentially contaminative uses was warranted. The government will also propose legislative amendments to remove statutory exemptions for abandoned mines where escaping water pollutes controlled waters. Mine operators will have to give the agency six months notice of any proposed abandonment. During formal and informal talks held by the government, financial institutions had expressed concerns that they might be held liable for pollution caused by their clients, and Mr Gummer made the assurance that they would not be subject to open-ended liabilities. Mr Tim Sweeney, director-general of the British Bankers' Association, welcomed government conclusions that the act of lending did not of itself open the lender to liability. The proposals were generally welcomed for ending the uncertainty that business and the property industry had faced. The Confederation of British Industry said it believed the framework would help encourage investment in the development of contaminated land, bringing more land back into use and reducing the pressure on green-field sites. However, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that clarification of a number of key elements would be crucial to the success of the proposals. These included the degree of flexibility local authorities would have in implementing their new duties and what standard of clean-up would be required.</p>

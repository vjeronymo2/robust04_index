			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / How to Spend It: Be charitable and let the postman be your Father Christmas - Christmas is coming. The mailbag's growing fat. Lucia van der Post picks the seasonal gift catalogues that serve a good cause and selects some of the most attractive and interesting gifts When the piles of Christmas catalogues arriving on my desk and doormat reaches mountainous proportions then I give in . . . Christmas is coming and nothing short of Armageddon will stop it. So for those who believe in planning Christmas rather as Rommel might have approached the desert campaign, it is once again time to get out the catalogues, to think of one's nearest and dearest, to start the lists. The catalogues whose proceeds go to support charities are as good a place as any to start - they may be short on expensive knick-knackery and truly sumptuous luxury but they nevertheless offer a multitude of cheerful presents that do not cost a fortune. From the most remote relation who needs just a token acknowledgement that the season of goodwill has arrived to the very best- loved there ought to be something in them for almost everybody. If nothing else, all of them offer the statutory selection of Christmas cards and holly-bedecked paper. Here then is a run-down of some of the catalogues on offer. ***** Oxfam, Oxfam Trading, PO Box 72, Bicester, Oxon 0X6 7LT. Tel: 0869-245011. Perhaps the grandaddy of them all - the company that first promoted the notion of fair trade, of helping poorer countries by buying their products rather than handing over money. From rug-makers in Mexico to printers in Ahmedabad and batik artists in Indonesia, buying their wares will keep them in work. The slant is, of course, ethnic but that is the catalogue's charm. Brightly coloured waistcoats from Guatemala, cotton rugs from India, jewellery from Chile . . . most of the products are brightly-coloured, cheerful if short on sophistication. Prices are excellent - a pretty mirror-worked wall-tidy for Pounds 7.95, soapstone solitaire set from Kenya for Pounds 9.95 and some enchanting Loro Blonyo figures from Indonesia (usually given at weddings) for Pounds 59.90. ***** WWF, PO Box 49, Burton-on-Trent. Tel: 0283-506105. Nice fat catalogue with the profits going to what Robin Pellew, its director, describes as the 'business of saving wildlife'. Not surprisingly, many of the products have an animal theme - needlework cushion covers featuring leopards (Pounds 39.99), wooden tortoise book-ends (Pounds 19.99), plenty of animal Christmas cards, a beautiful crystal bowl with a school of dolphins sand-blasted round the edge (Pounds 79.99) and a tough coir doormat featuring a panda (Pounds 14.99). Also, for more everyday use, some beautifully plain, simple and fine clothing - a creamy cotton and linen sweater (Pounds 51.99) and creamy cotton T-shirts and night-shirts. ***** Help the Aged, PO Box 28, London N18 3HG. Tel: 081-803 6861. Hot water bottle covers, floral-bedecked bags to hold knitting, door guard alarms, lightweight gardening shears, foot-relaxers, folding walking sticks and an alarmingly large 'pill organiser' are the kind of presents that Help the Aged feels might enliven the scene around the Christmas tree. The emphasis is on the useful rather than the charming or the beguiling. Nevertheless, there can hardly be anybody who could not use at least one of their handy gadgets. I rather fancy the moonlight lamp myself (Pounds 12.99, it runs off batteries and is just what one needs for reading when camping in the bush). ***** British Red Cross, Britcross Ltd, PO Box 28, Burton-on-Trent, Staffs. DE14 3LQ. Tel: 0283-506767. From the most deliciously kitsch brightly-coloured tulip doorstop (Pounds 9.99) to a Fleur-de-Lys throwover (excellent value at Pounds 24.99), wooden bookends embellished with carved apples (Pounds 17.95) and warm furry-lined suede slippers (Pounds 12.99), this is a small catalogue to help the charity that 'cares for people in crisis . . . whether . . . in Bosnia or Bolton, Somalia or Sheffield'. Not the biggest or the best but enough to choose from. ***** The National Trust for Scotland, 5 Charlotte Square, Edinburgh EH2 4DU. Tel: 031-243 9399. Some unusual presents here - a ready-to-sew hat kit, for instance, at Pounds 15.95, and a sturdy wooden Victoria garden tray (Pounds 32.25). Then there is a charming travelling games compendium (backgammon, chess, checkers, two packs of cards, dominoes and dice in a little black box for Pounds 22.95), some silver-plated spoons for butter (with a cow on top), pate (topped by a fish), mustard (with a mustard pot) and honey (with a bee) all at Pounds 8.50 each and some useful tartan picnic rugs (Pounds 49.50). ***** NSPCC Trading Company, PO Box 39, Burton on Trent, Staffs. DE14 3LQ. Tel: 0800-444280. As is only right and proper for a charity devoted to the welfare of children, this one has more for the small set than most - fun watches (water-resistant with funnyman figures, Pounds 14.99), a beginner's microscope (Pounds 12.99), friendly soldiers laundry bag (Pounds 6.99), wooden puzzles and construction sets. There is quite a lot of choice, too, for the grown-ups - an enchanting Peruvian Dancer's hairslide (Pounds 5.99), virginal white cotton nightdress with pintucks and white embroidery (Pounds 27.95), cassette carriers (a staple of charity Christmas card catalogues), candlesticks (plain blue glass at Pounds 5.99 each or verdigris-finished ones at Pounds 23.99). ***** Shelter, 88 Old Street, London EC1V 9HU. Tel: 0983-821303. Not so much a brochure, more a pamphlet with not a lot of choice but some nice things nevertheless - cone-shaped candles and beeswax ones (a very 'in' present), wooden puzzles for small children (housing jigsaw, Pounds 6.75, and elephant jigsaw, Pounds 6.75), good notebooks and stationery. ***** WaterAid Trading, PO Box 10,Gateshead NE8 1LL. tel: 091-487 0399. Another charity that goes in for just a folded pamphlet and not a full-scale catalogue but it has some nice things on offer - sturdy sisal carriers (Pounds 19.95), high-quality ground coffee from Cafedirect, the company that insists on paying fair prices for the beans, silver ear-rings from Thailand (Pounds 3.25) and notebooks made from paper made from jute fibres (think of all the trees you're saving). ***** Notting Hill Housing Trust, Mail Order, Notting Hill Housing Trust Shops, Aspen House, 1 Gayford Rd, London W12 9BY. Tel: 081-563 4888. Another pamphlet with a limited but excellent selection - blue or jade green glass pudding dishes at Pounds 3.99 each, thick blue and white throw, embellished with gold sea motifs (Pounds 59.99), metal verdigris-finished coat rack with fish motif (Pounds 14.99), naif, Colonial-style navy-blue and white cotton rug (Pounds 6.99) and lots of candlesticks. ***** Traidcraft, Kingsway North, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, NE11 ONE. Tel: 091-491 0591. Traidcraft has a whole series of catalogues - Interiors; Alternatives (primarily fashion); Paper and Cards; Foods, Teas, Coffees and Tissues and Christmas Cards and Gifts. All are based on the idea of 'combining the skills of 'third world' producers with a concern that these craftspeople get a fair deal from international trading'. They are mostly all-year-round catalogues but you could find something for everybody by trawling through all these catalogues. Here we have sketched some sweet brown velvet slippers embroidered with gold stars at just Pounds 29.95 a pair as well as a naturally dyed sisal carry-all (Pounds 19.95) but there is lots, lots more.

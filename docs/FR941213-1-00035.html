The FAA estimates a total of 6.2 billion total enplanements with a total of CRM training over the next 10 years of about $581 million. Hence, the per emplanement cost over the next 10 years for part 121 carriers increases by about $0.09 per enplanement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA) was enacted by Congress to ensure that small entities are not unnecessarily and disproportionately burdened by Government regulations. The RFA requires agencies to review rules that may have ``a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule would affect those small entities regulated by parts 121 and 135. The FAA's criteria for ``a substantial number'' are a number that is not less than 11 and which is more than one-third of the small entities subject to the proposed rule. For air carriers, a small entity has been defined as one who owns, but does not necessarily operate, 9 aircraft or less. The relevant FAA criteria for ``a significant impact'' is an incremental cost of $61,000 per year for a scheduled air carrier with a fleet size of 60 seats or fewer, and $110,100 for a scheduled air carrier with aircraft fleet size of more than 60 seats. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has identified 35 part 121 operators who operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA assumes that an average crew size consists of one pilot-in-command, one second-in-command, and three flight attendants. The FAA also assumes that operators employ two crews per plane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that annualized CRM training for each aircraft would amount to $6,120 annually. This estimate includes initial training and recurrent training averaged over the decade for a crew of two pilots (PIC and SIC) and four flight attendants. The analysis assumes three crews per aircraft and a 20 percent turnover. Hence, the expected CRM training cost will not exceed $55,080 (9 times $6,120). This cost falls below the ``significant impact'' threshold cost of $110,100. Hence, CRM training costs would not impose a significant burden on a substantial number of small part 121 operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Seventy-three part 135 scheduled operators affected operate 9 or fewer aircraft. The FAA estimates an annualized cost of $13,180 for part 135 training upgrade for crewmembers for one aircraft; CRM would carry an annualized cost of $4,000. The total training costs equal $17,180 ($13,180 + $4,000). This estimate assumes three crews per aircraft with each crew consisting of a PIC, a SIC, and two flight attendants. This estimate includes initial training and recurrent training averaged over the decade and a 20 percent markup for turnover. Training costs for small entities with 4 to 9 aircraft would exceed the threshold (4 &times; $17,180 = 68,720). However, FAA data shows 16 scheduled part 135 operators of the type affected by this NPRM that operate between 4 and 9 aircraft. Since the number of companies represents about 22 percent of the 73 operators affected by this proposed rule, the FAA concludes that the proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a significant number of small part 135 scheduled operators. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Implications <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations do not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Government backs away from row over Maastricht: Hurd says defeat would not stop ratification THE GOVERNMENT yesterday made an embarrassing about-turn as it sought to limit the damage in the latest confrontation over its European policy. It declared that new legal advice meant that a defeat in parliament over the social chapter would still allow it to ratify the Maastricht treaty. Amid rowdy scenes in the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, made the embarrassing and unexpected admission that the previous legal interpretation provided by Foreign Office lawyers had been mistaken. The new advice has come from Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general. Facing derision from the opposition and anger from some Tory Euro-rebels, Mr Hurd apologised to MPs as he explained that the government had wrongly advised the Commons when it said that passing the controversial Labour amendment on the social chapter would wreck the treaty. 'I regret that the legal advice then given to the House was not correct,' he said. Many at Westminster saw the turn-about as a manoeuvre intended to save the government from humiliating defeat in the vote in a few weeks' time. There were already signs last night that it had taken some heat out of the issue, with Tory Euro-rebels divided over whether to vote against the government if the amendment was meaningless. Mr Hurd said the government would still oppose the amendment, but added: 'If the amendment were carried, it would have no effect on our ability to ratify the treaty.' There was opposition mockery as he said that it was 'for the sake of completeness and tidiness' that the social protocol should be incorporated into domestic law. The new legal advice draws a sharp line between changes to the bill which would make UK law incompatible with the treaty, making it impossible for Britain to ratify, and those which would not affect ratification. The government now says that since the social protocol, which the amendment would exclude from the bill, does not apply to the UK because of the 'opt-out', Labour's proposed change falls into the second category. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was scathing about the backtracking. Accusing the government of putting expediency above principle, he said there was 'confusion and disarray in government circles' because of ministers' determination not to accept the social chapter. The new stance made the weeks of detailed debate at Westminster a charade, he said. Mr Cunningham said that Labour would still press the amendment to a vote, and Labour is also working on how to devise a further amendment which would be effective in forcing the government to choose between accepting the social chapter and abandoning the treaty. Yesterday's change of tack came after Mr Hurd had asked the attorney-general whether he agreed with the advice from Foreign Office lawyers presented to the Commons by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister, in last month's debate on the social chapter. Since that debate it had become clear that support for Labour's amendment 27 to the bill was widespread enough to jeopardise the government's majority of 21. The amendment united opposition MPs, who believed it would lead to the UK's adoption of the social chapter, with Tory Euro-sceptics who believed it would scupper ratification.

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Industry says half of waste should be recycled The UK should aim to recycle half of its waste packaging by the end of the century, leading industrialists said last night. Meeting that target would add only 1p to every Pounds 10 food shopping bill 'and will therefore have little inflationary effect', they said, in a report presented yesterday to Mr John Gummer, environment secretary. The UK should also incinerate nearly a tenth of its waste packaging in schemes to extract energy, the report said. Last year the UK produced 7.3m tonnes of waste packaging, half household and half commercial, but recycled less than a third. The waste total is forecast to rise to 8m tonnes by the year 2000. The group of 28 leading retailers and manufacturers has been working on the plans since last autumn, when Mr Gummer challenged them to find ways of recycling between half and three-quarters of the UK's waste packaging. Mr Ed Falkman, chief executive of Waste Management International, the environmental services group, said yesterday that the industry plans 'are probably achievable if the government really gets serious'. He added that the delay in bringing in tougher rules on landfills - licensed rubbish dumps - had kept landfill prices low, undermining the incentive to recycle. Publication of the industry's targets comes against a background of crisis in the German scheme for recycling packaging, which has left mounds of unwanted rubbish at sites across Germany and in neighbouring countries. The 28 companies - called the Producer Responsibility Group - say that ill-designed schemes, such as the German example, could add 1 per cent to the UK cost of living. Under a new European packaging waste directive to be presented soon to the European Parliament, countries must recycle between 25 per cent and 45 per cent of packaging waste within five years of the directive coming into force. In total, between 50 per cent and 65 per cent of packaging must be recovered. Mr James Devereux of Incpen, the packaging industry trade association, said there were concerns about how the scheme would be financed. Industry estimates suggest the proposals could cost Pounds 100m to implement.</p>

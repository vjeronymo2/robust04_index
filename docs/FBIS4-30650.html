			<p>BFN     [Text] The parliamentary Functional Group has asked all  sides, particularly security forces and demonstrrators, to  exercise self-restraint. Several members of the group made the  appeal during a news conference in Jakarta today. On the  occasion, Abdullah Alatas Fahmi, chairman of the Department of  Information, Publication, and Mass Media of the Functional Group  Central Executive Council, asked the security forces to handle  demonstrations proportionally and not execessively. On the  other hand, the demonstrators were asked to exercise  self-restraint in order not to complicate the situation.    Meanwhile, Abu Hassan Sazili, vice chairman of the  parliamentary Functional Group, stressed the need for all sides  to coolly respond to the situation in the wake of the license  revocation of several publications.    Sugeng Wijaya, member of parliamentary Commission I [Roman  numeral one, in charge of foreign affairs, defense, security,  and information] reminded the press circles not to be afraid of  carrying out their duties and roles if they are carried out in  accordance with the journalistic ethics.</p>

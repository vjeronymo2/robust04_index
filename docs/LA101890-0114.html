			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF : MALIBU CITYHOOD FACES DELAY TILL SPRING OF  1992  </P> <P> Cityhood for Malibu, now set for March 28, could be delayed until the spring of  1992 if Los Angeles County's effort to build a proposed $43-million sewer  system is stalled by a recent decision of the California Coastal Commission, a  county official has hinted.  </P> <P> "Under the applicable statute (a further delay) of cityhood is an option,"  Assistant County Counsel Bill Pellman has said.  </P> <P> The county's new position follows the Coastal Commission's decision to delay  until at least December the county's request to speed construction of the  sewer.  </P> <P> The commission's staff said it needs more information before scheduling a  hearing on the project.  </P> <P> The delay came after the Mountain Recreation and Conservation Authority  questioned county plans to dispose of up to 1.3 million gallons of effluent a  day from a planned waste treatment facility near Pepperdine University into  nearby Corral Creek.  </P></p>

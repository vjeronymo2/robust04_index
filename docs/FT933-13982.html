			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Technology: A global concept - Virtual companies In the corporate battle zone of the 1990s, even successful companies have to move fast to avoid defeat. As the travails of IBM, General Motors, Volkswagen and others have shown, the proven business methods of the past are no guarantee that sales and profits will continue to flourish. Increasingly, executives are turning to alliances, partnerships and joint ventures, often formed to produce particular products and then disbanded. These enable costs to be shared, development times to be shortened and effective use to be made of design, manufacturing and marketing skills inside and outside the company. Such linkages - variously described as virtual corporations or agile enterprises - are made easier by computer technology. They can be set up, controlled and reshaped quickly and flexibly so companies can draw on worldwide resources to achieve their objectives. 'Information technology, because it's going to become as ubiquitous as the telephone system, is going to enable people to have totally different concepts of how they work together,' says David Allen, director of European strategic marketing at Ungermann-Bass, the US-based computer equipment company. He sees ideas like the virtual corporation as part of the business re-engineering process by which many companies are fundamentally changing the way they operate. Ungermann-Bass, owned by Tandem Computers, has produced a series of combined hardware and software products which enable companies to link up their terminals, workstations and printers almost as they please, without incurring heavy extra expenditure on new equipment or running the risk that this will be outmoded. These products, described as Virtual Network Architecture, are designed to allow information to flow where it is needed and not just be restricted to small groups of users. Allen believes Europe is at least a year behind the US in corporate re-engineering. He cites the example of German companies which want to cut traditionally high costs and employment levels while remaining global players. 'The virtual corporation is going to start giving them concepts they can use.' With the associated technology - other aspirants in this field include SynOptics and Kalpana, both of the US - this allows companies to draw on international resources in a way that would previously have been difficult. 'Why shouldn't you have somebody in an office in England designing a product, having it produced in Japan or Taiwan and marketed in America, with all this being controlled totally at arms' length but appearing to be linked together,' says Allen. There are plenty of examples of link-ups in the motor, computer, electronics, aerospace and other industries. Roger Nagel, operations director at Lehigh University's Iacocca Institute in Pennsylvania, cites US Car (an electric car venture between Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler), Sematech (in semiconductors) and the tie-up between Apple, IBM and Motorola in computer systems and equipment. Nagel, who recently spoke at a series of European seminars on computer networking technology organised by Ungermann-Bass, says such partnerships do not depend on electronic integration, but are certainly enhanced by it. VNA enables computer systems to be linked without the need for extra components. This, the company claims, makes it cost effective. It works with existing user networks and is capable of being upgraded to the next stage of networking technology, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) which will enable information to be passed between computers at extremely high speeds. With VNA, life is made easier for those controlling computer networks. Instead of extensive recabling, managers can simply identify various layers of their networks on a screen and reconfigure the different user groups at the push of a button. Ungermann-Bass's products, DragonSwitch and NetDirector/VNA, are designed to make these links - up to 65,000 groupings can be set up in one organisation - in individual sites and across the world. They can be used with systems operating on any software, chiefly Microsoft and Lotus, and satisfy user's desire for speed of operation. A businessman will be able to call up information at will on, for example, his company's activities in the Far East or research developments. 'For the first time,' Allen says, 'he will be able to get information on anything from anywhere on one terminal.' This will allow companies to share information on a 24-hour basis between continents. Multi-media applications, with pictures, sound and data on screen, will also be possible. If, however, businesses are to assess the benefits of such products properly, computer companies must stress the applications clearly. 'Networking is a great bore for them (executives). They don't understand it or want to. They just want the information there when they need it,' says Allen.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rhone-Poulenc again cuts profit forecast RHONE-POULENC, the French state-owned chemicals group scheduled for partial privatisation by the end of the month, yesterday estimated that operating profits rose between 5 per cent and 10 per cent last year and that net earnings would also rise. The announcement, the third time Rhone-Poulenc has downgraded its 1992 operating profits forecast, comes a fortnight before the February 1 deadline which the government has set itself to sell to the public at least 6m Rhone-Poulenc shares, 10.6 per cent of the total. Company forecasts for growth in operating profits this year have already been halved from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. By mid-morning, Rhone-Poulenc investment certificates - or non-voting shares - had fallen to FFr516 and ended the day down FFr15 at FFr511. Analysts in London were divided about the implications of the announcement. Some believed it had effectively released all available information in preparation for the share sale. However, Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, said it was possible market conditions were such that the government could postpone the issue. The lowest price is set by a Comite d'Evaluation des Entreprises Publiques, a body which ensures the government receives a fair price for its shares. The lowest price is unknown, but some analysts believe it could be about FFr500. Mr Jean-Pierre Tirouflet, finance director, said the end of the year had been difficult for chemicals because of the fall of the dollar and delays in purchases of agrochemicals by farmers, fearful of the consequences of European Community agriculture policy reform. Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group, recently revealed that its fertiliser sales had suffered from the same effect. Rhone-Poulenc's net profits should rise in 1992, thanks to more asset sales than expected and a fall in debt servicing costs, Mr Tirouflet told Le Figaro newspaper. The group sold FFr4bn (Dollars 740m) of assets last year, FFr1bn more than its initial forecast, on which it made a FFr1bn capital gain. He estimated debts fell to less than 80 per cent of shareholders' funds by the end of 1992 and said Rhone-Poulenc was holding to its objective of cutting gearing to 50 per cent by 1994. Net distributable profits fell by 21.4 per cent to FFr1.11bn in the first nine months of 1992, or declined by 2.6 per cent before payments to preferred shareholders. Net profits in 1991 rose by 3 per cent to just over FFr2bn. Mr Tirouflet expected group operating profits to rise again this year, despite the fact that Rhone-Poulenc is expecting economic conditions to get worse. Lex, Page 14</p>

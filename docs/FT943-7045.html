			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Dunedin Income Growth revenue up Dunedin Income Growth Investment Trust yesterday declared an interim dividend of 8.9p, up from 8.75p, as earnings per share for the six months to July 31 rose from 13.72p to 15.24p. Net revenue after the preference dividend improved to Pounds 4.88m (Pounds 4.35m). The trust said, however, that the earnings growth reflected the timing of dividend payments and was unlikely to be repeated in the second half. Net asset value at the period end was 656.4p per share, down more than 16 per cent on the December figure of 784.6p.</p>

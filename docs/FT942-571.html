			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (11): New dimensions in messaging - Electronic data interchange and electronic mail Electronic data interchange (EDI) and electronic mail (e-mail) have become embedded in the way that many companies work. They are the basic components of a more potent group of applications, sometimes known as document interchange and groupware. These provide the ability to interconnect groups of people who may work in different locations or even time-zones, but nevertheless need to work as a team. These methods have become almost a 'lifestyle' for their users, so much that it becomes difficult to separate out the technologies from the applications which use them. Nor should one want to: the whole point about the benefits of using document interchange or e-mail is that they should be to integral to operations, just as water pipes distribute the benefits of central heating. The great increase of 'IT-aware' PC users has brought a new dimension into the use of messaging. Initially, PC networks started as a way of sharing expensive resources among several users - typically printers or other peripherals. The potential of connecting people so that they could share documents, and participate in special interest groups and 'electronic diaries' really began to dawn with widespread adoption of PC products such as Lotus Notes. For many years, the mainframe had provided a proportion of these facilities. A remote 'dumb' terminal (with no local processing power, such as a PC or workstation provides) could be situated almost anywhere with a dedicated phone line, allowing many pioneering 'teleworkers' to do their programming from home. Some mainframes also provided a messaging system, fairly rudimentary and limited, inevitably, to the IT elite (already removed from the common herd) who were likely to have a terminal in the first place. But now, 'client-server' systems have begun to displace - or at least work alongside - mainframes, and are used by people at every level of an organisation. Using a far more complex structure, these systems provide a great deal of local processing power, connected to a 'file server,' often remote, which delivers the data across the network, from a master repository that can be located anywhere on it. E-mail often becomes the 'glue' in some organisations who support heterogeneous networks. There are three phases in the development of document interchange, according to Steve Sheppard, European marketing manager of GE Information Services, one of the largest providers of electronic trading services globally - 'in terms of the benefits organisations can realise out of electronic trading, they need both the document and the data exchange - that's structured information, representing business processes, such as invoices - and the interpersonal communication as well,' he says. 'In practice, if an organisation exchanges a purchase order, that's structured, but there might be a dozen interpersonal messages to support that transaction. 'So, by using interpersonal services, such as electronic mail, we can make that exchange of information more efficient.' Some of the pioneer industries in developing EDI were banks, retailers, and automoative companies. GE Information Services owns International Network Services, INS, set up jointly with ICL to service the burgeoning electronic trading market. Mr Sheppard uses examples from experience to illustrate his 'three phases:' First comes exchange between parts of an organisation - 'one pharmaceutical customer originally set up e-mail in subsidiaries, different offices in remote locations to allow people within the organisation to exchange information. In phase two, users exchange data with organisations outside their own company. That was typically structured information, such as usually meant by EDI: invoices, payment, and so on,' he adds. 'It's important to note the distinction: it was an automation of existing processes of organisation and trading with partners. That can bring big benefits in cost-cutting.' Mr Sheppard gives an example of the cost of processing an invoice, reduced for one customer from Pounds 15-Pounds 20 per invoice to between Pounds 5 and Pounds 10 - 'a significant saving if you are processing tens of thousands.' Nevertheless, it's in the third phase that the benefits come home, he says. The external value chain may start with structured messaging, but many interpersonal messages begin to take place to support the business processes. These can be in the form of structured and unstructured: e-mail, intelligent 'decision-making' applications, anything to support the business transactions. 'It's easy to connect e-mail systems even where there are different hardware hosts. That's where the value-added service providers come in, to connect the different services. The role of the network is in the integration of management, security, and tying together various systems to enable better information exchange.' E-mail has a respectable history of 'empowering' applications, especially where it has been used to package ready-formatted information. For example, for some years, Whitbread Beefeater restaurants have used simple pre-determined forms to file weekly reports, using the mainframe Verimation Memo system. The system can also used for urgent needs, if, for example, one branch run short of beefburgers and need a consignment from another. But its most imaginative growth has been its use for ad hoc questionnaires, research on competitive menus locally, and proposed price rises. Just as typical of e-mail use are highly complex applications built by third parties, which use electronic mail and document interchange as part of an application. For Royal Mail, the recent re-organisation from 64 districts and four national territories into nine geographical divisions triggered a re-think about communication. What Royal Mail wanted was an open flow of information among its divisions, and the ability to allow remote groups of people to work together as it they were in the same office. Electronic mail had already proved itself by the mid-1980s, in an initial experiment with 3Com's local area network and 3+Mail. Assisted by the consultants KPMG, Royal Mail implemented a system based on Lotus Development Corp's Lotus Notes in 1992. Called InfoRMac, (Information and Communications system for the Royal Mail), it connects Royal Mail's divisional general managers and directors so that they can communicate with local managers, and co-ordinate their activities with one another. All work with the same up-to-date information. Royal Mail's system is based on a network of IBM AS/400s computers, one in each of its 64 areas, running OfficeVision. The InfoRMac project now pulls together all the Royal Mail locations in to one X25 wide area network. Four hundred of the organisation's managers are users, and as part of a three-year rollout, Royal Mail has bought 15,000 copies of Lotus Notes.</p>

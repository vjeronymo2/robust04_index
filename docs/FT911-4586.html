			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Business Law: Concluding digest of Hilary Term cases IN RE HARRODS (BUENOS AIRES) LTD (FT, March 26) By a majority the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal against a refusal to set aside proceedings served against Intercomfinanz SA brought by a minority shareholder, Ladenimor SA, which had alleged that the company's affairs were being conducted in an manner which was unfairly prejudicial to its interests. The company was incorporated in the UK and made returns to the Companies Registry but had its registered office in Argentina from where it conducted its business. At first instance the judge had found that while the Argentine court was the one with which the dispute had the most real and susbstantial connection, nevertheless the remedy under section 459 and 461 of the Companies Act 1985 was such that leave to proceed in the UK should be given. However, the Court of Appeal stated it was not established that the remedy available in Argentina was significantly of less value than the UK remedy. A stay should be granted because of the very close ties between the case and Argentina and the huge advantage of holding the trial there. OFFICE ANGELS LTD V RAINER-THOMAS AND ANOTHER (FT, March 27) The plaintiff employment agency stipulated in its contracts with its own employees, inter alia, that the employee would not, within six months after termination of employment, 'engage in. . . the business of an employment agency' in Greater London within a 1km radius of the branch where she had been employed (clause 4.5(b)). In allowing an appeal against a decision that the restrictive covenant was valid with regard to clause 4.5(b) by the defendants, who were former employees of the plaintiff and had set up their own business, the Court of Appeal stated that while a covenant containing a territorial restriction in a suitably drafted form might well have been justifiable as a means of protecting the company's connection with its temporary workers, a covenant containing territorial restriction was not necessary to protect its trade connection with clients. Further, the clause placed a disproportionately severe restriction on the defendants' right to compete with the plaintiff after leaving its employment and went beyond that which was reasonable in the parties' interests.</p>

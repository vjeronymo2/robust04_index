			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Nikolay Goncharov] </F>   [Text] Orenburg April 29 TASS -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin came here on Friday to participate in  festivities on the occasion of the 250th anniversary of the  Orenburg Province.    "Russia needs uniting and consolidating all forces now as  never before - the fact is reflected in the treaty on social  accord and we had to cover such a long way towards its signing,"  Chernomyrdin said.    "The government is to accept much of the responsibility for  the fulfillment of the treaty and it will do its best. As a  head of government, I am responsible for the fate of our  homeland before the people and Russia. We shall overcome  difficulties. We need (to turn Russia into) a country where a  man will live happily. And the new Russia already takes shape,"  he added.    According to Chernomyrdin, he believes in his government and  does not map out to replace or fire anyone; its political course  remains unchanged.    The Russian prime minister visited a gas-processing plant  and  discussed ways to increase the volume of oil and gas extraction,  use new and old bore-holes effectively, speed up the processing  and secure the ties inside the fuel-and-energy complex.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Leading Article: A watershed for Hong Kong With yesterday's vote to approve Mr Chris Patten's political reforms, Hong Kong's Legislative Council has begun the final chapter of Britain's tenure. Elections this year and in 1995 will have the degree of freedom and fairness sought by the governor. But China promises to reverse the reforms. So we will not know until after it resumes sovereignty on July 1 1997, whether Mr Patten's contribution to Hong Kong's political structure will be lasting. Nevertheless, Mr Patten's role has been positive in several respects. The very fact that an impassioned and lengthy debate on democratic reform took place at all in LegCo reflects greater political maturity in Hong Kong for which the governor can take credit. He has forced open discussion of issues which many - whether in Hong Kong, China or Britain - did not want to face. China has had to consider, and to make clearer, what it means by 'one country, two systems'. Politicians in Hong Kong have had to stand and be counted on an issue central to its future. As a result, the transition to Chinese rule is likely to be less of a voyage into the unknown. Although the vote did not go as China wanted, the way should now be clear for important practical aspects of the handover to be dealt with. There have been welcome indications from Beijing that it is willing to set disagreements on politics to one side and make progress on other issues. It is to be hoped that agreements will soon be reached on defence lands and on financing for the airport, and that progress can be made on topics such as air services and the many necessary legal changes. Democratic franchise Also on the positive side, the reforms themselves broaden the democratic franchise of indirectly-elected seats, and make voting arrangements fairer, though leaving Hong Kong a long way from full democracy. This is a modest advance, which should help to strengthen the underpinnings of Hong Kong's economic success. However, it will have been of little value, and possibly counter-productive, if it lasts for only two years - the LegCo elected in 1995 is supposed to last until 1999. China will have noticed that most LegCo members who gained their seats by contested election voted for Mr Patten's reforms, and most who were appointed to their seats voted against them. But it will also see that the vote nearly went its way in spite of the governor's lobbying efforts. New elections Beijing's instinct will naturally be to carry out its promise in 1997 and arrange new elections to secure a more compliant legislative body. But it can await the results of the 1995 elections, and the subsequent behaviour of LegCo, before deciding whether to do so. Even if LegCo, and in particular some of its members, are objectionable to China, there would seem little need to disband it if its make-up were broadly acceptable. It should be remembered that China remains committed to the Basic Law, which sets out steps towards a fully directly-elected LegCo. Thus Mr Patten's reforms may not be reversed. Even so, the overall result of his exercise is to leave Hong Kong in an unfortunate limbo. It may be that this uncertainty was unavoidable and that it will make little difference to people in Hong Kong, especially in business, who have long adapted themselves to the prospect of Chinese sovereignty. But that the uncertainty exists results from Mr Patten's failure to achieve his original goals: to improve relations with China and to reach an agreement on the electoral arrangements. If his up-front approach to China had really paid off, everybody would be able to view Hong Kong's future with optimism. Yet these remaining reservations do not prove correct the British ex-diplomats who would prefer Britain to have settled, on a quiet afternoon in Beijing, for the best electoral arrangements it could get. The last such effort to accommodate Beijing before Mr Patten's appointment, an agreement on the airport secured through a visit to Beijing by Mr John Major, hardly proved definitive: China then delayed approval for the project's financing terms in an effort to derail the governor. Mr Patten's victory at least clarifies the range of options, even if it is not known which of them Beijing will take.</p>

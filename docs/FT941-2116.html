			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading Derivatives traders reported a dull and uneventful session as they awaited the outcome of today's US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, writes Joel Kibazo. In Liffe futures, the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,207. Early selling saw it fall to the day's low of 3,192 within the first hour of trading. The release of favourable UK economic data, and a rally in the bonds helped bring about a recovery in June over the lunch time period. The retreat on Wall Street brought about another fall in the contract before it finished at 3,198, at parity with cash but down 17 on Friday's close and around 10 points below its fair value premium to cash of about 10 points. Volume at the official close was a poor 9,869. The FT-SE Mid-250 on Liffe was also dull with 2 contracts dealt as June closed at 3,855. The screen showed no contracts traded in the same contract on the OMLX. The Liffe traded options sector had one of its poorest days in recent sessions with turnover reaching only 21,575 contracts. The FT-SE 100 option traded 6,094 lots while the Euro-FT-SE 100 option saw business of 3,141 contracts. HSBC was the busiest stock option with a total of 1,805 contracts dealt.</p>

			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Investors invited to run Tube line Private-sector rail companies have been invited to take over the six-mile Epping to Ongar section of London Underground's Central Line following a government decision to approve the ending of Tube services on it. Mr John Watts, transport minister, yesterday gave approval for London Underground to close the east London branch, which is losing Pounds 184,000 a year. He instructed the company not to sell or dismantle the track and buildings for three years to allow another operator to acquire the assets. The line, which carries a shuttle service during weekday rush-hours only, is used by fewer than 80 passengers a day. London Underground said that at least Pounds 4m would have to be spent on it if it were to remain open to Tube services. The company said yesterday that the only private-sector interest shown since the closure was mooted had come from the Ongar Railway Preservation Society, which had plans for a limited passenger service using steam engines. The minister also approved the closure of Aldwych Underground station in central London and the single-track link to nearby Holborn station. The station provides a weekday rush-hour service only, used by 450 people a day. The line loses Pounds 150,000 a year and would require investment of more than Pounds 6m if kept open. Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, welcomed the decisions, which will save Pounds 10.8m.</p>

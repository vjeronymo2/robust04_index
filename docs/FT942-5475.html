			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Housing slowdown confirmed: New net mortgage lending falls 14% Growing concerns about a slowdown in the housing market after April's tax increases were confirmed yesterday by figures on mortgage lending from the Bank of England. The statistics also highlighted a large drop in new net mortgage lending - a figure which takes into account repayments of principal - being undertaken by banks. Seasonally adjusted figures showed a 14 per cent drop in new net mortgage lending, to Pounds 1.61bn in April from Pounds 1.87bn in March, and a 9 per cent fall in new gross lending over the same months, to Pounds 4.59bn from Pounds 5.04bn. While the statistics showed a fall in new lending undertaken both by banks and by building societies, the steepest drop was in banks' new net lending. That fell by more than 50 per cent - to Pounds 283m from Pounds 646m in March. The figures also showed the return to the mortgage market of specialist lenders, such as centralised lenders which do not operate through branch networks. The net lending they undertook during April totalled Pounds 266m, while in the previous month it had amounted to only Pounds 11m. Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said that banks' apparent 'lack of aggression' in this area was surprising when margins were still wide and were sufficiently attractive to bring specialist lenders. The total number of loans approved in April fell back on both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted bases to below the equivalent figure for last year. After seasonal adjustments, some 79,000 mortgage loans were approved compared with 83,000 loans in April 1993. The total value of loans approved totalled Pounds 4.60bn in April, while in the corresponding month last year it amounted to Pounds 4.76bn. Commenting on the figures, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, which represents banks, societies and other lenders, underlined the warning given to the government on Thursday by Halifax building society, the UK's largest mortgage lender. Mr Peter Williams, the council's head of research and external affairs, said it was particularly important 'that income support arrangements for the payment of mortgage interest are left intact and that interest rates remain stable'.</p>

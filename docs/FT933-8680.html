			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Korean reform touches a raw nerve SOUTH KOREA'S financial markets yesterday discovered what President Kim Young-sam meant when he said that his political and economic reforms involved 'pain-sharing'. The Korean stock market tumbled and other financial institutions were thrown into paralysis after President Kim's surprise announcement ordering an immediate ban on use of aliases in financial transactions, his latest move against corruption and the large underground economy. Businessmen were seen weeping in restaurants when news of the swift presidential action broke Thursday night, but the general public welcomed the move as an appropriate come-uppance for the wealthy and powerful who tried to hide their fortunes from tax collectors. 'I'm in real trouble. What am I going to do?' said a 23-year-old false name account holder working for a foreign firm. Although stock trading was restricted to two hours in the afternoon, brokers were inundated by selling orders, totalling 100m shares with an estimated value of Won2,000bn (Pounds 1.6bn), as investors tried to liquidate stock portfolios held under false names. However, trading limits prevented the market from crashing, curbing the decline to a 4.46 per cent fall for the Korean composite index, which ended at 693 against 725 on Thursday. All but three shares declined to their daily bottom limit on the bourse. The lack of buyers meant that stock trading was unusually light at 1.3m shares, compared with last week's average of 15m shares. Under the emergency presidential decree, those engaged in financial transactions had to produce identification to prove ownership of their accounts, a procedure that brought some financial operations to a grinding halt. Tempers flared at banks as customers came to withdraw money for the Independence Day holiday weekend and were told they had to prove that their real name matched the name on the account. Customers complained they were unable to make withdrawals from their own accounts. 'This is ridiculous,' said a European businessman who had to wait an hour to identify himself due to computer problems that plagued the banks yesterday. The problem was particularly difficult for wives who wanted to make a withdrawal from an account held in their husband's name, since it is common practice in Korea for them to keep their maiden name. Many had to go to local government offices to get a certificate proving their married status. The problems occurred despite intensive training given yesterday morning to bank staff on how to identify customers before the banks were opened late at 2 pm. But troubles in identifying customers were not confined to the banks. 'I couldn't recognise one long-time client when he identified himself on the phone because he used his real name for the first time,' said one Korean broker. Brokers themselves were thrown in a panic over the real-name system since many use aliases in stock trading to evade a law banning them from making investments. Some of those who pulled money from their false-name accounts were trying to keep their wealth hidden from the authorities by buying gold and jewellery, prices for which rose sharply on the black market yesterday. Meanwhile, many short-term lenders on the kerb market remained closed as they complemented the threat of a liquidity drain as false-name account holders pull money from the market, which has been the traditional centre for speculative investments. A squeeze on the kerb market could cause problems for small and medium companies, which rely on the market for capital. Mr Lee Kyung-shik, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, acknowledged that this and other problems may be caused by the introduction of the real-name system. 'The real-name system may affect the financial and stock markets, cause financing difficulties for small and medium business, encourage property speculation and trigger capital flight in the short-term. We are taking steps to minimise these short-term effects,' he said. "But in the long term, it will promote economic growth as it is expected to channel underground money into the industrial sector.' Some analysts predict that the shock to the stock market will ease by the middle of the next week. 'We expect the market will bottom out at around 650 as investors take advantage of buying opportunities,' said Mr Richard Samuelson of S G Warburg Securities in Seoul.</p>

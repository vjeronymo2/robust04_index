			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Suspended agents return to work Sales agents in Norwich Union's life and pensions business return to giving financial advice today after a month's suspension for retraining. The entire direct sales force and a further 200 agents in companies which act as the life insurer's appointed representatives were suspended last month. Lautro, the self-regulating organisation for the life industry, had uncovered serious flaws in the way Norwich Union was implementing new standards in training and competence. Not all the 600-strong direct sales force have yet been cleared by Norwich Union to re-enter the market, but about 200 will start to give advice again today. The process of putting sales agents back to selling should be completed by the end of next month. Those who do not pass the tests at the end of the training programme will be given a chance to try again. Mr Philip Scott, Norwich Union life and pensions general manager, said the training for the sales agents comprised three elements: a 'core curriculum', product knowledge and sales skills. The direct sales force accounts for about 10 per cent of Norwich Union's new life and pensions business.</p>

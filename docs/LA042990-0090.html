			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VACCINATION PRICES  </P> <P> I am responding to a recent letter from a woman who felt that more children  would receive their vaccinations if the prices charged by private physicians  were more in line with what they used to be.  </P> <P> When I started pediatric practice in Orange County about 17 years ago, vaccines  were supplied free by the county health department to physicians who agreed not  to charge for them.  </P> <P> Many things economic have changed over time.  </P> <P> Today there is only one source for measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. The price per  dose that I must pay is $24.11. Please note that this price includes $4.44  federal excise tax to fund the federal vaccine injury program. The $24.11 cost  does not include the cost of a syringe or other office overhead.  </P> <P> DR. MARTIN J. ROSENFELD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

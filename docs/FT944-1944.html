			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Land Securities' Pounds 76.5m sale Land Securities has sold its Milton Gate office block in the City of London to AP Fonden, the Swedish national pension fund, for Pounds 76.5m. The building is let to Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, on a 25-year lease from June 1990, when the building was first occupied, with a break in 2002. The annual rent is Pounds 6.9m, or about Pounds 44 per sq ft. This is well above the current headline rents for top City offices of about Pounds 35 per sq ft. The exit yield of 8.85 per cent reflects the fact that the building is unlikely to show rental growth for some years. Mr Ian Henderson, a director of Land Securities, said the building had been sold at above book value, which is based on its revaluation at March 1994. 'The disposal reflects our policy of adjusting the balance our portfolio away from City offices,' he said. The acquisition is AP Fonden's second large deal in the City this year. In the summer it acquired nearby Angel Court for about Pounds 60m. The fund also owns Four Millbank, near Westminster.</p>

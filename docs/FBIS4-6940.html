			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- Continuing  political consultations of the leaderships of the Mongolian  National Democratic Party, Mongolian Social Democratic Party,  Mongolian Democratic Association, Union of Mongolian Students  and Union for New Progress with the participants of the hunger  strike lasting for 15 days already who are demanding the  resignation of the government have so far resulted in nothing.  The disagreement existing between the participating sides is  apparently telling on in reference to the issue of the further  ways and perspectives for continuing the political struggle.    The press conference scheduled to be held today at the  headquarters of the political strike has not been held and the  reasons for its postponing to tomorrow have not been announced.</p>

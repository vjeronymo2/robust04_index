			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken in SKr5.8bn deficit NORDBANKEN, the Swedish state-controlled bank, yesterday reported an earnings loss of SKr5.8bn (Dollars 966m) for 1991 as credit losses and provisions climbed to SKr10.5bn. The Nordbanken results coincided with an announcement from the Swedish Bank Inspection Board that total credit losses for the country's financial institutions reached SKr48.1bn in 1991, almost triple the 1990 figure of SKr17.8bn, mainly due to falling property values. Banks accounted for SKr35.6bn of these losses, while finance companies lost SKr9.9bn. The banks' credit losses amounted to 2.9 per cent of their total lending volume in 1991 against 1.2 per cent in 1990. The agency predicted that credit losses would also be large this year because of the recession. But it added that the financial system was stable since the banks had reserves of SKr120bn and most benefited from income growth. Nordbanken, which made a profit of SKr855m in 1990, has fared worst among the big Swedish banks in 1991 with the collapse of several large property and finance companies that borrowed heavily from the bank. Its loan loss-provisions more than doubled from the 1990 figure of SKr4.2bn and these credit losses accounted for 3.9 per cent of total lending volume. The bank was also forced to write off goodwill of SKr2.1bn from its 1989 merger with PKbanken that made it Sweden's second largest bank. Nordbanken's profit before provisions also fell by 9 per cent to SKr4.66bn, although several of its competitors, including Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, have reported increases in pre-loss earnings. The bank blamed the lower profits on a 7 per cent fall in interest income to SKr8.5bn, reflecting an increase in the amount of non-performing loans, which grew SKr8.9bn to SKr19.3bn over the past year. But Nordbanken managed to stabilise costs at SKr6.7bn, the same amount as in 1990. The bank's capital asset ratio increased from 7.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent after the government subscribed to a SKr5.2bn share issue in December. A shrinkage in the bank's assets to SKr339bn from SKr407bn was another reason for the improvement in the capital asset ratio, which now exceeds the 8 per cent level established by the Bank of International Settlements for the end of 1992.</p>

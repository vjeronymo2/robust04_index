			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PASSES MOTORCYCLE HELMET BILL LIKE ONE DEUKMEJIAN VETOED  </P> <P> The Senate on Thursday approved a virtual carbon copy of a bill vetoed last  year by Gov. George Deukmejian to require that all motorcycle riders and their  passengers wear safety helmets.  </P> <P> The legislation by Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) was passed on a  24-10 vote and returned to the Assembly for concurrence in Senate amendments.  The bill cleared the lower chamber last spring with no votes to spare.  </P> <P> "Given that the bill is essentially the same as last year's and the same set of  circumstances exist, if the bill reaches the governor, the same result will  ensue," warned Tom Beermann, Deukmejian's deputy press secretary. "He will veto  the measure."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deukmejian Veto  </P> <P> Last year marked the first time in more than two decades of trying to enact a  mandatory helmet law that the Legislature passed the measure. Deukmejian  refused to sign it, saying he would only support the helmet requirement for  motorcyclists 21 years of age and younger.  </P> <P> A separate bill supported by Deukmejian to beef up motorcycle safety and  training contained a provision requiring 16- to 21-year-old motorcyclists to  wear helmets. But that feature was struck from the measure last March.  </P> <P> Currently, none of the estimated 822,000 licensed motorcycle drivers in  California are required to wear protective headgear, although passengers 15 1/2  and younger must do so. However, for the last year and a half, motorcyclists  under 18 have had to complete a training program before receiving a motorcycle  operator's license.  </P> <P> Foes of the mandatory helmet proposal, including the Hells Angels and other  motorcycle organizations, have successfully fought the bill since 1967.  Government, they argue, has no business interfering with their "freedom of  choice" to wear a crash helmet or not.  </P> <P> But their argument has been co-opted by helmet supporters and given a new spin.  The supporters argue that taxpayers who must pay the substantial medical,  hospital and other public assistance costs of injured motorcyclists have been  denied a choice. They say tax dollars could be better spent on other  health-related matters.  </P> <P> Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) said safety helmets could save taxpayers  several million dollars a year. He said the costs to taxpayers of even a single  helmetless motorcycle crash victim without insurance can exceed $1 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changed Mind  </P> <P> Torres drew support Thursday from Republican Assemblywoman Rebecca Morgan of  Los Altos Hills, who said the measure "flies in the face of my basic philosophy  of keeping government out of our lives."  </P> <P> But she said that after viewing motorcycle crash victims in hospitals she had  concluded that "these are individuals who have not taken responsibility for  their own lives and have put the responsibility on taxpayers -- you and me."  </P> <P> However, an opponent of the bill, Sen. Don Rogers (R-Bakersfield), said wearing  a safety helmet may create a "placebo effect" in which a cyclist might drive  faster and take unnecessary risks because he falsely believes he is protected  against injury.  </P> <P> "Wearing a helmet may work against their safety," he said.  </P></p>

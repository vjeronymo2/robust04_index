			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Improved second-quarter profits at three US banks SIGNS of recovery among US commercial banks emerged yesterday as improved second-quarter earnings were unveiled by JP Morgan, Chase Manhattan and First Chicago. Although the trend may not extend across the board as US banks report their results over the next week or two, analysts said their forecasts indicated that the worst of the US banking industry's recent woes appeared to be over. JP Morgan, the bank that has bucked the sectoral trend, led the way with a sparkling 67 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits, to Dollars 385m. Earnings per share increased to Dollars 1.94 for the three-month period, from Dollars 1.17 a year ago. While Morgan achieved strong revenue growth in each of its main business activities, the second-quarter net profit figure was lifted by a special Dollars 124m pre-tax gain from the sale of Mexican government securities that were acquired by the bank during debt refinancings in 1988 and 1989. Although the after-tax impact of the gain on Morgan's earnings was not disclosed, analysts estimated that the bank's second-quarter profit would have improved by less than one-third had the gain been stripped out. Chase Manhattan produced a 15.1 per cent improvement in its second-quarter earnings, to Dollars 152m. Earnings per share were 83 cents, against 80 cents in the second quarter of last year. First Chicago, announced a 19 per cent increase in second-quarter net income, to Dollars 68.2m. Earnings per share at the bank were 79 cents against 73 cents a year ago. Highlights from the JP Morgan results included a very small Dollars 25m bad debt provision, up from Dollars 10m a year ago. Non-interest revenues, including the Dollars 124m special gain, jumped to Dollars 844m from Dollars 557m a year ago. Net interest revenue rose by 23 per cent to Dollars 434m. Operating expenses were Dollars 745m, up from Dollars 585m because of higher bonuses and increased hiring. In the non-interest revenue stream, trading revenues rose by 22 per cent to Dollars 287m, led by increases in swaps and other interest rate contracts as well as foreign exchange. Morgan's corporate finance revenue was 21 per cent higher at Dollars 110m; its investment management fees increased by 19 per cent to Dollars 92m; operational service fees were Dollars 102m, up by 7 per cent and credit-related fee rose by 32 per cent to Dollars 50m. Chase Manhattan said its net interest revenue was Dollars 878m, up from Dollars 834m a year ago. The bank's bad debt provisions were Dollars 295m, against Dollars 265m in the second quarter of 1991. Net loan write-offs were Dollars 297m, down sharply from Dollars 682m a year ago, when heavy charge-offs were taken on loans to Brazil and Argentina. First Chicago's bad debt provisions were Dollars 105m, up by 17 per cent year-on-year. Net interest income was 9 per cent higher at Dollars 300.9m, while non-interest income was also 9 per cent improved at Dollars 336.6m. On Wall Street, JP Morgan's share price closed unchanged at Dollars 61 5/8 ; Chase's price was Dollars 1 1/4 lower at Dollars 27 7/8 , and First Chicago's price was Dollars 35 7/8 , down Dollars  5/8 .</p>

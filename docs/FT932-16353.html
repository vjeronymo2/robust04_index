			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: A pig's ear over book keeping A GROUP of Cumbrian farmers and auctioneers has been forced to send out a circular to shareholders after it made a pig's ear of its 1992 accounts. Following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the UK's accounting standards watchdog, Penrith Farmers' &amp; Kidd's has distributed a supplementary statement to the accounts. NT O'Reilly &amp; Partners, the company's auditors which has had to issue a new audit report with the statement, said: 'In our opinion it is now clear that the original financial statements on which we reported . . . failed to comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.' In a covering letter to the 600 shareholders dated April 1, Mr David Hibbert, company secretary, says the new statement revises a number of differences between the 1991 accounts and the 1991 comparative figures shown in the 1992 accounts. The Review Panel ordered the distribution of the supplementary note - the first time it has taken such action. Mr Hibbert estimated the cost would be Pounds 200-Pounds 300. 'This has pulled us up short and made us look more closely at the accounts,' he said yesterday. 'But the changes were just cosmetic. They did not affect the profit or balance sheet totals.' The errors were first highlighted at a stormy annual meeting last autumn, which led to a complaint to the review panel by Coss &amp; Mounsey, one of the shareholders. The supplementary note shows that turnover, administrative charges, income from investment, interest payable and other operating income for 1991 were all shown differently in the 1992 account than in the previous year's report. A freehold property disposal had been incorrectly classified as a leasehold disposal in the 1991 accounts, an amount of ACT has been re-credited to a different category, and directors' remuneration includes benefits, which were not shown in the 1991 accounts. Mr Joseph Rain, chairman, could not come to the phone yesterday. A secretary said he was out 'weighing sheep'.</p>

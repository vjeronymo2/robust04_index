			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- The head of the U.N.  nuclear monitoring agency predicts the problem of North Korea's  alleged development of nuclear weapons may be brought up again  at the U.N. Security Council if there is no progress on the  issue by early May, a top Japanese Foreign Ministry official  said Thursday [14 April].    Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), made the remark in a meeting with Vice  Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito, the official said.    Saito told Blix that Japan wants to seek a solution to the  North Korean nuclear problem through dialogue, he said.    The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, declined  to  elaborate on the meeting.    Blix is in Japan to attend an annual meeting in Hiroshima of  the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum.    He said in Hiroshima that the IAEA has sent a letter to  North  Korea asking that inspectors be allowed access to a  radiochemical laboratory but that Pyongyang has not responded  yet.    IAEA inspectors were allowed into North Korea in March for  their first look at nuclear facilities there in more than a year.    But they were unable to determine if radioactive materials  had been diverted to military purposes because North Korea  blocked the inspectors from a key laboratory.    North Korea says its nuclear program is peaceful.</p>

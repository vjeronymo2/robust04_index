			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / International Company News: Emirates airline discloses results for the first time Emirates, the fastest growing Middle East airline, which yesterday won the Executive Travel Magazine 'Airline of the Year Award,' made a net profit of Dh10.6m (Dollars 2.9m) for the year ending March 1993 on turnover of Dh1.8bn. Mr Maurice Flanagan, the Dubai-based airline's managing director, yesterday disclosed its financial performance for the first time since the Dubai state-owned carrier was set up nine years ago. He said Emirates had operated profitably every year since its constitution except in its second financial year, ending March 1987. The airline expects net profits to increase in the current year, although the total would depend on its expansion plans, Mr Flanagan said. Net profits for 1992-93 were sharply lower than the Dh67.5m reported for 1991-92 on turnover of Dh1.46bn. Although 1991-92 coincided with the Gulf war and the most difficult year in the airline's short history, the record profits that year reflected the fact that Emirates continued to operate all its flights to Europe and to India and south-east Asia. 'Although the market diminished significantly during the Gulf war we massively increased our share of the market,' Mr Flanagan said. The lower profits last year reflected a 54 per cent increase in the airline's capacity at a time when the rest of the world airlines industry was seeking to reduce expansion. Emirates now flies to 32 destinations and expects passenger numbers to increase from 1.7m in the year to March 1993 to more than 2m in 1993-94. Mr Flanagan said the airline received no subsidies from its government shareholder and was expected to operate under the same tough financial conditions as other market driven companies. 'We get no favours from our owners,' Mr Flanagan insisted. The airline and its associate airport activities employ 7,800 people and operate a fleet of 13 Airbus wide-body A310 and A300 aircraft and two Boeing 727 narrow-body aircraft. The airline also has firm orders for seven Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and options for an additional seven, all powered by Rolls-Royce Trent engines. Mr Flanagan said Emirates was planning to expand its services to London next summer, with additional flights to Gatwick on top of the two daily services to Heathrow. In the longer term, the airline is considering using its new Boeing 777s to start non-stop services from Dubai to New York.</p>

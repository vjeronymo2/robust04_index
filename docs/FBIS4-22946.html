This article is based on the results of analysis of HIV  infection cases recorded in the Russian Federation in 1987-1991  and results of screening population groups designated by decree  [for such screening] over the same period of time for presence  of HIV antibodies.    We used the main parameters used to describe epidemiological  patterns of this infection: breadth of spread, distribution  according to sex, age and social structure. This enabled us to  compare development of the epidemic process in Russia to this  process in other territories, and to determine the distinctions  of its manifestation.    The possibility of intramural spread of HIV infection was  studied on the model of viral hepatitis B (HBV). For this  purpose, 63 HIV positive children and 162 children who had been  in contact with the former in pediatric hospitals and residing  in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts were tested for HBV  markers. Children in one of the rayons of Moscow Oblast under  clinical observation due to contact in a hospital with  HIV-infected children (122) served as a control group.    HBV infection markers were demonstrated by the method of  enzyme immunoassay using test systems of the DIA-Plus firm.  Cases of demonstration of HBsAg were confirmed in the  conformation test.    The first cases of HIV infection in the republic were found  in 1987. In 1988, there was a build up of HIV-positive cases  mainly referable to adults; in 1989, 4 sites of HIV infection  were recorded in Kalmykia, Volgograd and Rostov oblasts, and  Stavropol Kray, which caused a dramatic rise in number of  HIV-infected individuals. The nature of the sites of HIV  infection, namely detection of group involvement in pediatric  hospitals, caused predominant involvement of children. In 1990,  the number of new cases dropped considerably because of fewer  cases of detection of infected children at the above sites.    In 1988, the incidence of HIV infection among adults  doubled,  as compared to 1987; in 1989 and 1990 the same number of  HIV-positive cases was found -- 68 people in each year. In 1991,  no trend toward rise was noted, which is indicative of  invalidity of the forecast.    In all, as of 1 January 1992, there were 518 recorded cases  of HIV infection, including 266 children up to 14 years old. The  HIV-positive cases were recorded in 45 administrative  territories. In 1991, 6 new territories, where only adults were  infected, became involved in the epidemic process. In 1990,  there were 8 such territories. This means that there is rather  broad spread of infection in the republic, although the vast  majority of HIV-infected individuals reside in major cities of  its European part.    The diagnosis of AIDS was made in 61 cases, including 45  children; there were 45 deaths, including 33 children. As a  rule, 76 percent of adult AIDS victims expire within 1, 2 and 3  years after the diagnosis is established. Such rapid evolution  of the disease in adults is probablydue to late detection.    The ratio of HIV-positive men to women constituted a mean of  1.5:1, ranging from 6:1 to 1:7 in different territories. Such  fluctuations could be attributed to differences in social groups  involved in the infectious process.    Analysis of the social structure of HIV infected adults  revealed that most cases (50.4 percent) are referable to the  so-called high risk groups (individuals who had sexual contacts  with HIV-positive and AIDS cases, homosexuals and bisexuals,  those with venereal diseases). However, in 1991, there was a  decline in their share to 38.9 percent, versus 92.0 percent in  1988. There was an absolute and relative increase in share of  HIV-positive cases screening because of pregnancy: from 7.5  percent in 1988 to 46.2 percent in 1991. Thus, at the present  time, a considerable part of those who are infected, mainly  women, is detected by chance.    We were impressed by the fact that in all these years we  failed to detect a single case of HIV infection among drug  addicts, or in the last 2 years among women who are promiscuous.    We observed a rise in incidence of HIV infection among  individuals tested anonymously and for clinical indications.    The dynamics of age structure of adults infected with HIV  have not changed. There is prevalence of individuals 20-44 years  of age both in the total number and in different years, and they  account for 94.4 percent of the cases.    In the case of adult infection, there is prevalence of the  sexual route of transmission of the infection, and there was the  same incidence of infection for both homosexuals and  heterosexuals in different regions.    Of interest are the cases of HIV infection among adults in  the southern part of the republic, where large sites of HIV  infection among children were formed. In 1989, adults  constituted 12 percent of all HIV-positive cases found in this  region, and about half of the cases were related to the  above-mentioned sites. In 1990, we found 20 HIV -positive  adults, which constituted 30 percent of all HIV-positive adults  recorded in 1990. Only three of these cases were related to the  sites.    The total number of HIV-infection cases found is indicative  of activity of the epidemic process in this region. There, the  indicator of HIV infection constituted a mean of 0.16 per  100,000 population, which is almost 2.3 times higher than the  mean for the republic (0.07/100,000).    The indicator of HIV infection of the adult population in  the  southern region is also high: 0.2/100,000 and it equaled or  exceeded the figure for territories where HIV infection is  recorded mainly among adults (in Moscow this indicator  constituted 0.1/100,000).    Only 15 percent of the cases of HIV infection in the  southern  region applies to individuals in the high risk groups, and this  is 3.5 times lower than the mean for the republic. At the same  time, 40 percent of the infected cases are women who were tested  because of pregnancy. This warrants the assumption that  individuals in the high risk groups, and first of all those who  are promiscuous, are ``hiding'' under code 109.    The high intensity of HIV spread among adults warrants the  belief that expressly they, including donors, were the primary  source of infection for children in the region of the sites.    Of those who are HIV positive, 51.4 percent are children.  Almost 87 percent of the child cases were found as a result of  screening contacts at sites of HIV infection; infection of 23  children was established on the basis of clinical indications; 1  child was infected after receiving a blood transfusion from an  infected donor; 14 children were born to HIV-positive mothers.    As compared to 1989, the frequency of detection of infected  children at the sites diminished in 1990 and 1991; 5 children  were picked up in 1991.    Analysis of the age structure of the child cases revealed  predominant involvement of the younger ones: more than 75  percent were children up to 3 years old.    We still are not clear as to the sources and routes of  spread  of infection caused by HIV in children groups. Unfortunately, as  time passes the possibility of settling this question  diminishes. The most popular opinion is that there was  nosocomial infection in most such cases. However, by far not all  of the cases fit into this version.    In this regard, it would be interesting to investigate the  possibility and intensity of nosocomial spread of HIV on the  model of an infection that has the same routes of spread as HIV.  HBV infection could serve as such a model, particularly since  the indicators of HBV for the population are considerably higher  than HIV infection.    The results of screening children who were not infected with  HIV andresided in territories where sites of HIV infection were  recorded, revealed a high incidence of the infection caused by  HBV. The incidence of detection of HBV infection markers  constituted 29.0 percent, which is 3 times higher than in the  control group. HBsAg carriers were demonstrated in 4.9 and 1.6  percent of the cases.    Investigation of the results of screening children from  Volgograd Oblast and Kalmykia revealed that the child population  is more infected: the indicators of detection of HBV markers,  including HBsAg carriers among children from Kalmykia were  considerably higher (by 3 or more times) than for children in  Volgograd Oblast (43.9 percent versus 14.3 percent, as well as  9.7 percent versus 2.9 percent, respectively).    The wide distribution of HBV infection among children in  Kalmykia warranted the assumption that virtually all HIV  infected children will be stricken by HBV. However, the  indicators of infection with this pathogen did not differ among  HIV infected and noninfected children: the incidence of  detection of HBV infection markers constituted 50.0 and 43.9  percent, respectively. At the same time, among HIV-positive  children from Volgograd Oblast, the frequency of detection of  HBV-infection markers was reliably higher than in children who  were not HIV positive: 75 percent versus 16.2 percent. A  substantially higher percentage of HBsAG carriers was also found  among them. These findings may be indicative of nosocomial  spread of HBV infection.    In Rostov Oblast, only 30.0 percent of the HIV-positive  children revealed markers indicative of HBV infection, and HBsAg  carriers constituted 4.7 percent at this site.    Analogous figures were obtained in an analysis of the  results  of screening children 3-5 years old who made up to main (77.8  percent) group of HIV-positive cases and noninfected child  contacts, and they characterized the actual situation.    Thus, HBV infection as a model of HIV infection makes it  possible to demonstrate differences in intensity of the epidemic  process in different sites.    The low level of HBV infection among HIV-positive children  at  the site in Rostov Oblast, and absence of differences in  frequency of demonstration of markers of HBV infection among  HIV-infected and noninfected children in Kalmykia do not give us  grounds to discuss active nosocomial spread of infection at  these sites. It is only in Volgograd Oblast that we can assume  there was rather intensive transmission of infection under  hospital conditions.  References    1. Pokrovskiy, V. V., Yeramova, I. Yu.

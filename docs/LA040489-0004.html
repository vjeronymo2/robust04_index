			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> SEOUL JAILS 2 IN TRIP PROBE  </P> <P> South Korean authorities jailed two dissident leaders and questioned others  about an illegal trip to Communist North Korea by a colleague, the Rev. Moon Ik  Hwan, police reported. Opponents accused the government of using Moon's trip  last week as an excuse to crack down on dissent, and students supporting him  battled police in seven cities. Dissidents have sought their own contact with  North Korea on the subject of reunification, but the government insists that  all dialogue be handled through official channels. Meanwhile, Moon was reported  on his way to Beijing and planning to return home by way of Japan later in the  week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NBA NOTES;  </P> <P> KNICKS LOOK LIKE TITLE CONTENDER  </P> <P> All you had to do was look at their faces. Watching the New York Knicks'  players and coaches as they walked off the Forum floor Tuesday night, you saw  young faces enlightened by possibility, and by the knowledge that they can win  anytime, anywhere and under any circumstances.  </P> <P> They had just become the first team to beat the Lakers at the Forum this  season, and they had done it by coming from behind in the fourth quarter, just  as they had two nights before in an equally uplifting victory in Portland, Ore.  </P> <P> Certainly those were not the faces of players who believe their team is one  season, or one player, away from being contenders. Coach Rick Pitino can dodge  the question all he likes, but by winning back-to-back games in two of the  league's most difficult arenas, the Knicks proved once and for all that they're  a legitimate contender for an NBA championship.  </P> <P> One distinguishing quality of all of Pitino's teams is that they are stronger  in the second half -- in the second half of games and seasons. Well-conditioned  by half a season of running and pressing, his Providence teams improved  dramatically in the latter days of winter. Last year's Knicks were 14-28 at one  point, a .600 team thereafter.  </P> <P> There is no reason to believe they can't do better than 27-14 the rest of the  way. The worst part of the schedule is behind them. When their current trip is  finished, they don't have to go to the West Coast again. Of their final 39  games, 23 will be at Madison Square Garden, where they're 17-1.  </P> <P> Yes, they have their shortcomings. Aside from Patrick Ewing, there's no  reliable post-up scorer. They're overly reliant on the three-point shot. They  give up too many easy baskets off their press (in five games on the Western  trip, opponents shot 54.7 percent from the floor).  </P> <P> But the bottom line is, they know how to win. Even more important, they now  expect to win the big games.  </P> <P> The half-ourt defense is getting better all the time, largely because opponents  are leg-weary at the end of games. They held Detroit to 16 points in the fourth  quarter in their Jan. 11 road win. The Lakers scored 18 points in the fourth  quarter Tuesday.  </P> <P> They are a flawed team, but the league has become a collection of flawed  contenders.  </P> <P> Rick Barry says he isn't a betting man, but if he were, he would be willing to  wager that his old friend Larry Brown won't make it to the end of his five-year  contract as head coach of the Spurs.  </P> <P> "I don't see how he's going to make it through this contract," said Barry, who  roomed with Brown during their playing days in the American Basketball  Association. "He really needs to be in college. You get to the pros and you  can't treat players the same way. You can't have that same kind of control."  </P> <P> Brown's return to the pro game has, to be sure, been a trying one. His Spurs  finished Wednesday night's game against Utah with an 11-28 record, and he  almost surely will experience the first losing season of his 17-year coaching  career.  </P> <P> What's more, there is an uneasy feeling around San Antonio these days. Brown  hasn't been able to communicate his system to the players. Players are sniping  at one another. And team management sat down with the coaches recently and  decided that major changes might be needed.  </P> <P> Observers in San Antonio also are coming to the slow realization that David  Robinson's arrival next season isn't likely to have an immediate impact, and  Brown might have to endure several losing seasons before his fortunes turn  around.  </P> <P> "See, I don't know if Larry can ever be happy," said Barry, who does NBA color  commentary for TBS. "Anyone who knows him feels the same way. Nothing ever  seems to be just right. No matter what it is, something's wrong."  </P> <P> During a recent radio call-in show in Philadelphia, Charles Barkley took a few  long-distance cheap shots at the Atlanta Hawks.  </P> <P> "The Hawks won't win because the NBA will not allow you to play with more than  one basketball," Barkley said. "They've got five great players who are not  willing to sacrifice. The Hawks are the most selfish team in the NBA. You can  have too much talent. That's one of their problems."  </P> <P> After Barkley's remarks appeared in an Atlanta newspaper, Coach Mike Fratello  brought the paper to practice and stomped on it in front of his players. Even  the usually taciturn Moses Malone, no doubt one of Barkley's targets, was moved  to comment.  </P> <P> "(The 76ers) have the five most selfish guys in the league in one guy," Malone  said. Suffice it to say he was not referring to Scott Brooks.  </P> <P> In case you're wondering, the 76ers and Hawks don't meet again in the regular  season. Do you suppose Prince Charles was aware of that when he decided to run  his mouth?  </P> <P> Is Chuck Daly sending a message to Trader Jack McCloskey? Detroit's coach was  bemoaning his team's lack of inside scoring early this week and suggested it  might be time for his general manager to find help.  </P> <P> "I think we need another player," said Daly, "an offensive player, a big guard,  or someone who can post up down there. We're still fighting the problem of no  post-up guy. We're the only team in the league without one. (Adrian) Dantley is  not a true post-up player."  </P> <P> Notes  </P> <P> Golden State's Ralph Sampson, who has missed 13 games after undergoing  arthroscopic surgery on his left knee, is expected to rejoin the Warriors  Friday in Philadelphia. The Warriors, who were 10-14 when Sampson left, are  10-4 without him. But anyone who claims the Warriors are better off without him  is mistaken. ... Amid all the talk about Portland's off-court woes, no one  bothers to mention one of the team's main on-court problems: One-dimensional  center Kevin Duckworth might be the most overrated player in the league. All he  can do is score. ... The 76ers' Mike Gminski will be an unrestricted free agent  after this season, and he expects to command a salary in the $1.5 million to $2  million range. The Lakers, who will have $1.5 million to play with when Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar retires, are said to be interested.  </P> <P> Denver, which won 54 games last season, has lost 13 of 18, dropping to ninth in  the West at 20-20. After scoring at a record 128.7-point pace in their first 20  games, the Nuggets have averaged 113.2 since. They've been hampered by minor  injuries, but assistant coach Allan Bristow says that's not the problem. "We're  just going through a spell where our confidence is down," he said. "The players  we're going to win with are suited up. It's just that we're not clicking." ...  The Celtics, desperate for backup help behind Robert Parish and Kevin McHale,  are reportedly looking to deal for 6-10 Utah rookie Jose Ortiz. ... The NBA has  received an application for reinstatement from Mitchell Wiggins, the former  Rocket who received a lifetime ban for drug use two years ago.  </P></p>

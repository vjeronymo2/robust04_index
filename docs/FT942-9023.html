			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Heseltine defends business links plan The government is to press ahead with creating a network of 200 business links advisory centres during the next two years, in spite of doubts among some chambers of commerce and business leaders. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday dismissed opponents as representing vested interests. He said people would change their minds when they saw the new business links at work. Business links are designed to pull advisory services into one-stop shops and use information technology to link them in a national network. They will charge for services and target medium-sized companies. Mr Heseltine was opening Manchester's business link which - with satellite offices in Trafford, Salford, Tameside, and East Manchester - counts as five business links towards the 200 target. Manchester's business link is the biggest of 22 approved so far and is seen by the government as a flagship for the whole initiative.</p>

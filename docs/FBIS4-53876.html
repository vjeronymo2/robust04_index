			<p>BFN     [Text] The Air Force is reviewing its plan to buy G-222  transport aircraft from Italy, previously approved by the  Cabinet, Air Force Commander Air Chief Marshal M.R. Siriphong  Thongyai said.    ACM M.R. Siriphong said the Air Force had told Supreme  Commander Air Chief Marshal Woranat Aphichari of its position.  He said some aspects of the purchase agreement draft needed  correction. The contract could not be signed until this was  done as it could cost the country a lot more money.    He declined to elaborate apart from saying the issue had not  been finalised.    The Air Force has provided the Supreme Command with a number  of options in dealing with the problem.    Air Force sources said the urgency of the deal appeared to  have been overtaken by other priorities after a long delay in  the purchase process.    Supreme Commander ACM Woranat declined to comment. He is  awaiting an official explanation from the Air Force.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-FRAUD LAW'S MERITS DEBATED;  </P> <P> JUSTICE DEPT. DECISION MAY HAVE BIG EFFECT ON WHISTLE BLOWERS  </P> <P> For several months, Justice Department officials have engaged in intense  internal debate over the merits of a 1986 law designed to encourage citizens to  become "whistle blowers" and expose fraud against the government.  </P> <P> Some Justice Department lawyers want to challenge the constitutionality of the  law, while others contend that this would be a foolhardy decision, according to  government sources and attorneys representing both whistle blowers and defense  contractors.  </P> <P> The Justice Department's position could have a significant impact not only on a  major constitutional issue but also on efforts to ferret out fraud by defense  contractors, Medicare providers and other companies that do business with the  government. Millions, perhaps billions, of dollars could ride on the outcome.  Since the law was passed, $26 million has been recovered from government  contractors in 11 cases. More than 150 lawsuits, many in California, are  pending.  </P> <P> The law in question is called the False Claims Act, originally enacted in 1863.  As amended in 1986, it permits a private citizen to file a civil suit in the  name of the government alleging fraud by a contractor and to share in any  financial recovery by the government. The act also provides that any whistle  blowers who lose their jobs or experience any career discrimination as a  consequence of filing the suit can sue for damages.  </P> <P> The possibility that the Justice Department might challenge the law's validity  has prompted a bipartisan coalition of U.S. senators, led by conservative Iowa  Republican Charles E. Grassley, to press Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to take a  clear stand supporting the law's constitutionality.  </P> <P> Grassley also has lobbied Solicitor General Kenneth Starr. The senator  maintains that the law has had a significant deterrent effect on fraud and that  its impact will grow as knowledge of the statute and how it can be used  spreads.  </P> <P> The senator said he is particularly disturbed by reports that the Justice  Department, which had supported enactment of the whistle-blower amendments in  1986, might now come out against the law.  </P> <P> The Justice Department's position could become known as early as this week.  U.S. District Judge David Kenyon has given the department until Wednesday to  inform him if it plans to take a stand on constitutionality in a Los Angeles  suit by former employees of Northrop who have accused the company of knowingly  using defective parts on guidance systems for the Air Force's MX missile.  </P> <P> Deputy Solicitor General Tom Merrill and Gina Talamona, a Justice Department  spokeswoman, said the department has "no comment" on its constitutionality  stance.  </P> <P> Defense contractors contend that the law violates the separation of powers and  appointments clauses of the Constitution and that private citizens do not have  standing to sue because they have not been individually injured by the alleged  wrongdoing. They also assert that the law encourages unfounded suits by  disgruntled, money-seeking employees who file cases hoping that companies will  settle simply to avoid costly litigation.  </P> <P> Whistle-blower lawyers maintain that the law is clearly constitutional. They  note that the Justice Department has the ability to take over any of these  cases or to veto settlements in those it does not take over. The plaintiffs'  lawyers also contend that courts have "consistently recognized the  congressional prerogative" to grant standing to a person to sue on behalf of  the government.  </P> <P> Solicitor General Starr has held private meetings with lawyers on both sides of  the issue. Among those attacking the law in the meetings was former Solicitor  General Rex Lee, now president of Brigham Young University, who filed a brief  last week in Los Angeles challenging the law on behalf of two defense industry  lobbying organizations and Brad Brian and Carolyn Kuehl of Los Angeles' Muger,  Tolles and Olson, a firm defending Northrop and Litton in whistle-blower cases.  </P> <P> Among those supporting it were Robert Montgomery, former chief counsel at the  Energy Department who is the attorney for Business Executives for National  Security and who represents whistle blowers in cases against Raytheon and  Singer Co., and Herbert Hafif, a Claremont lawyer with several cases against  Northrop.  </P> <P> This year, three federal judges in California -- William D. Keller and Mariana  R. Pfaelzer in Los Angeles and Robert Aguilar in San Jose -- have upheld the  constitutionality of the law. The Justice Department did not take a stand in  any of those cases or an earlier one in Ohio.  </P> <P> But sources inside and outside the government said several lawyers in the  department's civil fraud section, including its chief, Michael F. Hertz,  believe that the whistle-blower law tramples on government prerogatives to make  decisions about who will be prosecuted for fraud. Hertz could not be reached  for comment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fast Decision Required  </P> <P> Sources said that some Justice Department officials resent the fact that after  a private citizen files suit, the department is required to make a decision  within 60 days on whether it will join the action. "It's like having someone  looking over their shoulder," said a source in the Washington legal community  who has closely followed the issue.  </P> <P> Other sources said that Hertz also is troubled that the law, by requiring a  prompt decision, sometimes forces the civil fraud division to alter its  investigative priorities.  </P> <P> If the Justice Department took a position that the law was unconstitutional,  this would give weight to the defense industry's challenges and could have a  chilling effect on the campaign to ferret out fraud, said John R. Phillips, a  Los Angeles lawyer who has several fraud suits pending against defense  contractors and who helped draft the 1986 amendments.  </P> <P> "The whole purpose of the law was to unearth information that otherwise  wouldn't have come to the surface," Phillips said.  </P> <P> A Defense Department investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity said the  1986 law has "brought people out of the woodwork."  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  and Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.), ranking minority member on the committee, are  among the 10 committee members who joined Grassley in signing a letter to  Thornburgh earlier this month reaffirming the support they gave to the 1986  whistle-blower law "and our belief in its constitutional validity."  </P> <P> The letter states that one of the major goals in amending the statute in 1986  "was to encourage assistance from private citizens in the fight against fraud  by enhancing the qui tam provision of the act." Qui tam is an ancient Latin  phrase that means "he who sues for the king as well as himself."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Law Works  </P> <P> The law works as follows: If a private citizen thinks he has a valid claim  under the law, he files a suit in the appropriate federal district court under  seal and informs the Justice Department that the suit has been filed. The  Justice Department has 60 days to investigate the merits of the claim and  decide whether to join the suit, though sometimes extensions are granted.  Keeping the case under seal enables the department to investigate without  informing the company.  </P> <P> When the department has made its decision, it must announce whether it is  joining the case, and if not, why not.  </P> <P> Even if the Justice Department decides to take over a case, the private  plaintiff retains a role in the litigation. The plaintiff receives copies of  all papers filed by the department and has a right to file objections to any  settlement agreement.  </P> <P> The citizen plaintiff can gain a substantial share of any recovery, from 10% to  30% depending on the extent of the private plaintiff's role in prosecuting the  case and on whether the Justice Department joined the case.  </P> <P> Since 1986, 167 suits nationwide have been filed under the law, Justice  Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said, and a healthy share of them are in  California because the state garners about $35 billion a year in defense  contracts.  </P> <P> Brown said the Justice Department joined 27 of the suits and declined to enter  66 others. The remaining 74 cases are still under seal pending further Justice  Department investigation.  </P> <P> Thus far, 11 of the suits have been settled, resulting in a recovery of $26  million to the federal Treasury, less several million dollars that went to the  private plaintiffs, Justice Department officials said. The law was designed  primarily to help curb defense procurement fraud, but two of the settled cases  involved Medicare fraud.  </P> <P> None of the cases have gone to trial yet.  </P> <P> In several suits, including some currently pending in federal district court in  Los Angeles, private citizen plaintiffs could recover more than a million  dollars if the cases are successfully prosecuted.  </P> <P> In March, the Justice Department announced that it would take over the largest  such suit to date -- a case filed in Baltimore by Christopher Urda, a former  Singer Co. pricing administrator who asserted that the company overcharged the  Pentagon $77 million between 1980 and 1985 by maintaining two sets of books on  contracts for flight simulators.  </P> <P> The statute entitles the government to triple damages -- in this case up to  $231 million. In a False Claims case taken over by the government, the private  plaintiff can get up to 25% of the recovery, meaning Urda could take home  nearly $58 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defense Firm Challenges  </P> <P> But several constitutional challenges to the law have been launched by large  defense contractors, including General Electric, Litton, Lockheed, McDonnell  Douglas and Northrop, as well as two industry lobbying groups, the Aerospace  Industries Assn. of America and the National Security Industrial Assn.  </P> <P> Thus far, all federal district court judges who have ruled on the issue have  upheld the statute. However, other constitutional challenges are pending,  including ones raised by Litton and Northrop in Los Angeles. Legal observers  said it is likely that at least one of the defense contractors will take a case  all the way to the Supreme Court.  </P> <P> In an interview, Sen. Grassley said he was stunned at the possibility that the  Justice Department might come out against the law's constitutionality. He  stressed that department officials had supported the whistle-blower amendments,  citing a 1986 letter from then-Assistant Atty. Gen. John R. Bolton to Grassley  that said the Justice Department "strongly supports" the Senate's amendments to  the False Claims Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A More Effective Tool'  </P> <P> Grassley's office also provided a November, 1986, letter from President Reagan,  who said after signing the law, "The amendments . . . will make this  123-year-old statute a more effective tool for the prosecution and recovery of  losses suffered through fraud against the United States government."  </P> <P> Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), who spearheaded efforts to get the  amendments passed in the House of Representatives, said, "Never once did  Justice raise the specter of constitutionality while this bill was moving  through the legislative process."  </P> <P> "There's nothing" in the 1986 amendments "that fundamentally changes" what  President Abraham Lincoln was doing when he pushed for enactment of the False  Claims Act in 1863 in an attempt to bring to justice contractors who were  selling the government gunpowder diluted with sawdust during the Civil War, the  congressman said.  </P> <P> Still, James B. Helmer Jr., a Cincinnati attorney who has successfully  prosecuted several qui tam cases against defense contractors, including four  settled en masse last March that compelled General Electric to pay $3.5 million  to the government, said he would not be surprised if the Justice Department  came out against the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resistance at Justice  </P> <P> During negotiations on amending the False Claims Act four years ago,  representatives of the Justice Department "resisted making it easier for  private citizens to sue," Helmer said.  </P> <P> Paul Gewirtz, a Yale Law School professor, has filed friend-of-the-court briefs  on the constitutionality issue on behalf of the Aerospace Industries Assn. and  the National Security Industrial Assn.  </P> <P> "One of the central arguments we're making is that if there is a wrong to the  government, a wrong to all of us that is being complained about, a suit should  be under the control of public officials, not self-appointed private citizens  with their own self-serving objectives," Gewirtz said. "If private people can  claim to speak for all of us, there's a terrible danger that private interest  will govern litigation decisions." But Los Angeles federal district Judge  Pfaelzer spurned this argument in upholding the constitutionality of the law in  a decision issued last Monday in a whistle-blower suit alleging that Northrop  overcharged the government by at least $2 billion on the B-2 Stealth bomber  project. "In authorizing private prosecutorial action on the government's  behalf in the False Claims Act . . . Congress is making a policy decision based  on its perception of how best to serve the public interest," Pfaelzer wrote.  </P> <P> Oral arguments on the next constitutional challenge to the law are scheduled  before Los Angeles federal district Judge David V. Kenyon on Sept. 12. That  suit alleged that Northrop, based in Hawthorne, defrauded the Air Force by  knowingly using defective parts on the electronic guidance system for the MX  missile. Northrop has vigorously denied those charges, as well as those leveled  in the Stealth bomber case.  </P></p>

"I see no reason for our negotiating teams  to continue to sit around tables for a month-and-a-half  restating over and over things which we have discussed ad  nauseam since July 2, 1993."    Mr Buthelezi did not spell out what his idea of opposition  politics was, although he briefly referred to mobilising against  elections. He was addressing a kwaZulu legislative assembly  caucus in ulundi in his capacity as chief minister. "I believe  it is time for us to move from a reactive to a proactive mode  and to develop our own political initiative."    He said the IFP and kwaZulu government faced two choices:  "either we continue to negotiate with the ANC for another  month-and-a-half...or we call their bluff now and we say enough  is enough." By opting for the first alternative, Mr Buthelezi  said, precious political time would be wasted.    By pulling out of talks, the IFP and kwaZulu would gain the  time needed to develop "political alternatives and bring to the  country a clear message of opposition".    The IFP president reiterated his "total commitment" to a  negotiated constitutional settlement but said the government and  ANC had "our balls in their court (sic)". The IFP and kwaZulu's  demands were minimal and it was up to the ANC to indicate  whether or not it wanted to discuss them.    Mr Buthelezi accused the ANC of negotiating merely to  manoeuvre itself into a position from which it could avoid any  substantive discussions on the IFP and kwaZulu's amendments to  the constitution.    "Their major political goal is to ensure that they can drag  us along with the process after the date of elections. By doing  so, they can reduce the strength and the effect of our  opposition politics and ensure that we can not mobilise against  elections if we choose to do so."</p>

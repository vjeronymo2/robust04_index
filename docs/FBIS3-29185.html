International opinion  interested in peace calls for the denuclearization of Northeast  Asia, regarding it as an important issue for peace and security  in Asia and the world at present.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: To abolish  nuclear weapons and prevent nuclear war, nonnuclear, peace zones  should be established in various parts of the world and should  be continuously expanded.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an urgent demand  for the situation prevailing in this region which includes the  Korean peninsula. Northeast Asia is an area where the danger of  nuclear war is greater than any other in the world. Today with  the end of nuclear confrontation between superpowers, nuclear  disarmament is an international trend. In contrast, however, in  Northeast Asia, factors increasing the danger of nuclear war  remain and constantly threaten the peace and security of this  region and Asia as a whole.    Above all else, numerous nuclear bases and nuclear means are  concentrated in the Northeast Asian region. Nuclear weapons and  nuclear bases that exist in the Northeast Asian region are the  remnants of the Cold War era. Under the pretext of deterring  someone's attack and of preparing for nuclear retaliation, the  United States built numerous nuclear bases in Northeast Asia,  such as in South Korea and Japan in the Cold War era, and  deployed enormous quantities of nuclear weapons and their  delivery vehicles in forward positions. Under the U.S. nuclear  umbrella protection strategy, South Korea has turned into the  largest nuclear weapons arsenal in the Far East, and Japan has  become an unsinkable U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier.    Today, with the Cold War over and with nuclear disarmament a  prevalent trend, there is no reason why nuclear weapons and  nuclear bases should remain any longer in Northeast Asia.  Although the United States declared a few years ago that there  were no nuclear weapons in South Korea, no convincing practical  steps have been taken for this [kugosul naptuk sikilmanhan  silchejok chochiduri chwihaejiji anko issumnida]. Numerous  nuclear war means are deployed on U.S. military bases in Japan,  such as those in Misawa and Okinawa. These bases are basic  factors increasing military confrontation and the danger of  nuclear war in this region.    The danger of nuclear war in Northeast Asia is increasing  all  the more because nuclear war commotions continue in this region.  It is a well-known fact that the United States has frequently  conducted nuclear war exercises, mobilizing its nuclear weapons  in the Asia-Pacific region and its mainland as well as into the  Northeast Asian region. The Team Spirit test nuclear war is a  typical example of it. The United States is going against its  own promise in attempting to enforce large-scale nuclear war  exercises, including the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  referring to the possibility of someone's nuclear development  and war provocation. As long as nuclear armed forces exist in  Northeast Asia and as long as nuclear fire games continue there,  the danger of nuclear war cannot be removed, nor can the people  of Asia free themselves from the constant nuclear threat.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia becomes an even more  serious and urgent problem particularly because a new hotbed of  nuclear war is rapidly growing in this region. This new nuclear  war force growing in Northeast Asia today is Japan. The  possibility of Japan's nuclear armament has now surfaced as an  international concern, with increasing worries about it. This  is far from surprising. In fact, Japan's nuclear armament has  reached a dangerous point. It is a well-known fact that the  Japanese reactionaries are dashing toward becoming a military  and nuclear power, raving that Japan lost the war in the past  because it was not strong enough.    Japan will soon be operating [monju], its first fast breeder  reactor in its nuclear power plant with the largest-scale  reprocessing capacity in the world. Needless to say, this  emerges from Japan's dangerous attempts to produce nuclear  weapons in a fullfledged manner at any time by securing large  quantities of plutonium on its own. Japan apparently plans to  maintain a large stock of plutonium from which it can produce  some 6,200 nuclear bombs by the year 2010.    Japan has all the factors and the technology, including an  electronic explosion device, that enables it to immediately  produce nuclear weapons at this time. Moreover, Japan has  already manufactured nuclear warheads, which will operate only  if the required amount of plutonium is loaded. Japan recently  fired a satellite delivery rocket. Thus, in actuality it came to  possess a long-range missile system. This means that Japan's  nuclear armament has become a reality before the people's eyes.  It is not an imaginary thing.    Experts in nuclear issues believe that it is simply a matter  of time for Japan to develop nuclear weapons. With the opening  of the door for dispatching troops overseas, Japan's nuclear  armament maneuvers take even a more grave and dangerous hue.  Japan's acceleration of its nuclear armament lays obstacles on  the course of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. In  addition to the United States, Japan is attempting to become our  other nuclear offender [haek kahaeja]. We absolutely cannot  become the nuclear victim of Japan.    Under the circumstances that Japan is accelerating its  nuclear armament program, we, its neighbor, are forced to cope  with this situation with vigilance [pudukbuk kaksongul kajigo ie  taechohajianulsu optta]. Because Japan's nuclear armament has  reached a dangerous stage, the denuclearization of the Korean  peninsula became meaningless. The denuclearization of Northeast  Asia must be realized to check Japan's nuclear armaments.    It is necessary that the world, not to mention Asia, should  direct due attention to Japan's nuclear armament maneuvers, and  should wage an international movement to check them. It is also  necessary that the international community raises its voices for  realizing the denuclearization of Northeast Asia, including the  Korean peninsula.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia is an important  demand  for building a nuclear-free world. To realize the  denuclearization of the entire world, the district which has  become a most dangerous nuclear spot should first be made a  nuclear-free zone. If the denuclearization of Northeast Asia is  realized, the most dangerous hotbed of a nuclear war will be  removed and a nuclear war can be prevented in Asia, thus  effecting a remarkable advance in building a nuclear-free world.  The denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be linked to the  overall abolishment of nuclear weapons throughout the world.  Only when this is achieved, can an overall and complete  abolishment of nuclear arms be realized throughout the world and  can a new era be opened in guaranteeing durable peace and  security in the world.</p>

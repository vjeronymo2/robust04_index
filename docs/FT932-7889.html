			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords move on homes for elderly THE government last night accepted a Lords backbench move to allow councils to refuse to sell homes reserved for the elderly. At present applications by a sitting tenant to buy such a property are referred to the environment secretary. But junior environment minister Lord Strathclyde accepted a change, moved by Tory peer Lord Monk Bretton during the Housing and Urban Development Bill's report stage, allowing town halls to decide, subject to any appeal by tenants.</p>

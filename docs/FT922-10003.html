			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Investment trust completes fund - In A Nutshell Candover Investments, a listed investment trust which finances management buy-outs and development capital projects, has completed fund-raising for its Candover 1991 Fund with Pounds 37.5m of money raised. When it launched the new fund, which will back buy-outs and buy-ins valued at up to Pounds 5m, last September, Candover set a target of between Pounds 30m and Pounds 60m. A tough fund-raising climate has prevented several recent funds from reaching the top of their target range. The new fund succeeds a Pounds 30m fund raised in 1987 also intended for smaller investments and now fully invested.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Dubai--An Arab economic report says that for Arab  world economies, 1993 was a year to further build on the  positive developments that occurred in the region in 1992.  Instead of burdening their economies with additional ambitious  projects, countries of the region focussed instead on sustaining  their previous year's accomplishments in the areas of confidence  and investment. The optimism generated by the resolution of the  Kuwait crisis in 1991 continued to prevail. The Arab states also  reduced their borrowing and focussed on attracting international  investors. The report added that 1993 brought with it more  recognition of the need to administer economic conditions with a  more reasoned and studied approach if they are to be sustained  in the long-term.    The report, issued by the Arab Banking Corporation, pointed  out that foreign economic developments greatly impacted the Arab  world in 1993. Recession in Europe, which is the major market  for Arab non-mineral exports, and the general softening of oil  prices, contributed a measure of moderation to economic  developments in the region. Other exporting countries,  especially phosphates producers, suffered the consequences of  reduced world demand. But the producers of minerals chose not to  succumb to that negative actuality and, instead, adopted  effective marketing strategies in their major markets, not  merely to maintain market-shares but also to expand them. Those  strategies were successful to a degree and are expected to  remain in place beyond 1993, since several of those producer  countries enjoy the lowest production costs in the world.    The report noted that future difficulties in 1994 will  relate  to maintaining the rate of investment at a time when returns are  low on investments needed to expand the goods-producing sectors  and supporting industries [as published] which have been  considered important elements of the development strategies of  Arab governments since the end of the Kuwait crisis. It pointed  out that even though the Arab states, by offering a number of  incentives, succeeded in 1991 in attracting private domestic and  foreign investments to additional economic sectors, those states  found it most difficult to attain their goals in the state-owned  sectors that they place at the top of their priorities.    The Corporation noted that most of the states that suffered  that predicament had enough borrowing power in 1993 to tap  domestic and regional capital markets for the funds needed to  finance their projects. Even though this was exactly what some  of them did in 1991 and 1992, they chose to exercise that option  as little as possible in 1993. [The Corporation] further stated  in its report that, instead of borrowing, the countries  concerned found it an easier strategy in the long run to  concentrate their efforts on attracting international partners  to major projects and on selling stock in other [enterprises].  Those strategies achieved a degree of success in 1993, but a  number of countries faced the problem of raising enough domestic  capital to equal the amounts obtained from foreign sources for  the implementation of new development projects.    The Corporation said it was regrettable that Arab capital  markets were lagging in development and that they did not become  operational at the right time, especially that such markets will  be an important source of minimum low-risk capital. It added  that, although incomplete or undeveloped at present, many Arab  capital markets did well in 1993, renewing confidence in the  direction of local and regional economies amid expectations of  future expansion.    The report revealed that, thanks to government-imposed  financial controls, the Arab financial sector also enjoyed the  benefit of expanding local economies due to several factors  including low demand on that sector by public-sector  enterprises. There was more freedom in a large number of  countries in setting interest rates for deposits and loans. A  reduction in interest rate controls was necessary to guarantee  continued availability to the private sector of the additional  funds offered by banks and others' financial institutions. But  the aforementioned facilities were accompanied by extremely  strict controls on banks concerning risk measurements in order  to guarantee their compliance with international standards and  to bolster the competitive positions of domestic institutions.    The report pointed out that the financial sectors in a  number  of countries have undergone changes introduced by radical reform  programs, some of which have been in effect for years while the  others were only recently introduced with support from the  Privatization Fund, whose programs received a new push in 1993.    The agricultural sector, which has also benefitted from  reform programs in recent years, remains a function of  meteorological conditions. It managed adequate production in  most of the Arab states, even though rainfall in certain areas  was below their requirements. That sector's output, however, was  not sufficient to change their agricultural trade deficits.    In order to lessen dependence on the weather, huge  investments were necessarily maintained in irrigation and  damming projects with support from regional and multi-national  institutions. The tourism sector settled back in 1993 after  sharp expansion in 1992.    The report added that conditions in certain Arab states  remain desperate, having shown no sign of improvement year after  year. Those countries, lacking any noteworthy developments in  1993, continued to be recipients of Arab and international aid  in order to keep them from further deterioration. Aid tied to  projects or to trade with the rest of Arab countries, especially  from individual Arab states and from development funds, was an  important component of the investment programs implemented by  those nations in 1993; as was the case with similar aid extended  since the late 1970s.</p>

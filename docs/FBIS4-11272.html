			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 25 Apr (EFE) -- Cuban exiles who last night  attended the reception given by Fidel Castro for the  participants in "The Nation and the Emigrants" conference, said  that his health seemed perfectly normal, although some indicated  that it is not in vain that years pass.    At the conclusion of the conference, Castro met with all the  guests at the Palace of the Revolution. He did not participate  in any of the three days of meetings between the Cuban  Government and 225 representatives of the moderate exile  community. The conference closed last night.    Officials of the Batista government, former combatants of  the  thwarted Bay of Pigs invasion (1961), fierce anti-Castro  activists of other eras, and people with less active backgrounds  filed by the Cuban leader, who greeted them one by one.    "The rumor that he was seriously ill is a lie because it  would have been impossible for him to be on his feet for more  than one hour greeting everyone," Lazaro Farinas told EFE.  Farinas was a member of an armed group that in the early years  of the 1960's struggled against the revolution. "It is true he  is an elderly person, he carries his age, but I found him alert  and receptive. I do not know whether he is ill, but I saw him  calm and relaxed, very normal," Farinas added.    Juan Manuel Rodriguez, a former captain of the revolutionary  army who left Cuba in 1960 and today is a prosperous businessman  in Costa Rica, said that "if someone says he is dead, I have  spoken with a dead man, and in addition, he asked me about  financial moves that might help the country."    Castro embraced Luis Ortega, a journalist who left Cuba 41  years ago, and then confessed to him that he had a little flu.    Juan Manuel Martinez, who was spokesman of the Batista  government and fled the island on 1 January 1959, the day of  victory for the Revolution, was surprised by "Fidel's great  memory." Martinez said Castro recognized him immediately, that  he had faithfully followed the development of the conference,  and that they both agreed that "they must jointly travel a long  stretch until the goal is reached."    Max Lesnik, one of the founders of the Cuban Change [Cambio  Cubano] organization led by former revolutionary combatant and  former political prisoner Eloy Gutierrez Menoyo, said that "for  his years, it did not seem to me he had negative symptoms."  Lesnik also said that with this reception all the guests -- not  a single one was absent -- Fidel "endorsed the results of the  conference."    Those results were the formal promise that these contacts  will continue -- although there is as of yet no date for the  next meeting -- and the possibility that most of the Cubans  residing abroad will be able to return whenever they want.    They were also encouraged to invest in the country under the  same conditions as other foreign businessmen, in other words, in  partnership with Cuban state capital, something that, for the  time being, rules out small businesses for them or their  relatives. This was apparently an objective of a good number of  the participants at the meeting.    Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina also said that a department  will be created in the Foreign Ministry to deal with the  emigrants' problems and he indicated that the Cuban Government  has communicated to the U.S. Government its desire to open a  consulate in Miami.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Observer: NatWest's fast track The speed with which portfolios and titles are changing hands at the top of National Westminster Bank is such that no one should be surprised that Martin Owen, the man from the Salvation Army with a PhD in business administration, should beat NatWest veteran Roger Byatt for the plum job of running NatWest Markets. NatWest chairman Lord Alexander seems determined to give his forty-somethings their head and long service in the bank seems more of a liability than an asset these days. Owen, who has done everything from setting up and selling his own financial services business to supervising dodgy banks in the Isle of Man, certainly has a much broader range of experience than the typical NatWest banker. Even so, the pace of his promotion since joining NatWest is unusual. It is the sort of appointment that Midland Bank used to make when it was struggling to find its feet a few years ago. Owen may well turn out to be an excellent choice but one wonders what sort of signal his appointment is sending to anyone in NatWest who is approaching 50 and has not been mentioned in dispatches recently.</p>

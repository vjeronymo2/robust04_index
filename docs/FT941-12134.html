			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Observer: Penny wise? The spirit of the Raj lives on. An elderly shareholder of Titaghur, the jute manufacturing company which lost its London listing in 1990, objected vehemently to the use of the term 'pee' to describe the currency of old England in a resolution being read to the annual meeting in London. 'I don't like this word 'pee' - it's very disrespectful in the presence of the ladies,' he said, urging the use of 'the proper words'. It was duly re-read as pence.</p>

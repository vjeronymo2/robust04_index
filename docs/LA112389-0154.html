			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OH, THANK GOODNESS;  </P> <P> THE EARTH MOVED AND SHE GOT OUT ALIVE  </P> <P> In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled  and revolutions swept the globe. In Los Angeles, gang violence claimed yet more  victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of  oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few  of many stories worth sharing on a day of feasting, family and friends. They're  enough to remind that it's still worth saying: "Oh, Thank Goodness."  </P> <P> Out of the corner of her eye as she drove north on Pacific Coast Highway two  weeks ago, Bobbi Phillips saw dust coming toward her down a hill.  </P> <P> Before she had time to react, earth and rocks slammed into the side of her  Mercedes sedan "like a fist," spinning it across the highway and flipping it on  its roof. The Santa Ana housewife worried that the car would blow up.  </P> <P> But she walked away with two broken ribs, cuts and bruises.  </P> <P> "I have a lot to be thankful for," Phillips, 47, says of her Pacific Palisades  mishap. "I was in a large, very heavy car. My seat belt protected me, even  though it hurt my ribs. The lifeguard from the beach was there so quickly to  help. As soon as I started to open the door, he was pulling on it.  </P> <P> "The paramedics were so thorough. The doctors and nurses (who treated us) at  Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center were wonderful. They were very caring."  </P> <P> Phillips says when she first saw the moving earth, she thought it wouldn't do  much damage. "I assumed it was a landslide, but I never expected it to be a big  one," she says. "Then when it hit me and started to throw the car all around,  it really scared me.  </P> <P> "It happened really fast. I just remember being flung around. Somehow, I hit my  left cheek bone severely, but I don't know how. When the car came to rest and I  knew I was going to get out, I was just thankful to be alive."  </P> <P> Phillips, who was on her way to see her daughter play volleyball when the  accident occurred, will celebrate Thanksgiving with her husband, Jerry, a  lawyer, and three children Laura, 21; Joe, 19 and Ben, 14.

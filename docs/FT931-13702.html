			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Mayhew renews Ulster contacts SIR Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, told MPs yesterday that he had begun informal consultations with local political parties about the resumption of talks on the province's future. He is to meet Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, in Dublin today. However an early resumption of talks is unlikely. Britain and Ireland are expected to first hold two Anglo-Irish conference meetings, under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, before a suspension for the talks' duration. Local politicians may also want to wait until after May's local elections in the province. Differences of emphasis between unionist and nationalist leaders emerged at Commons questions yesterday. Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party, hinted he wanted the province's links with the Irish republic higher on the agenda. Sir Patrick came under pressure from Unionist MPs for saying in December that he was just a 'facilitator' of talks. Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, asked if the Conservative party was still a Unionist party. Sir Patrick replied that so long as a majority of Northern Ireland's population wanted to remain part of the UK it would. 'If, on the other hand, the day should come when the majority should wish some other citizenship then the UK government would not stand in the way of that,' he said.</p>

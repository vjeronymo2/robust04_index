			<p>BFN     [Text] The only way of ending violence in the Balkans is to  send one Russian army division to each of the five former  Yugoslav republics and bring down any NATO warplane before it  flies over the region, LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy said on Monday.    He held out promises of an immediate peace in the Balkans,  Georgia and Nagorno-Karabakh as soon as his party came to  office. Zhirinovskiy, who is confident about LDP's chances of  power, outlined plans of sending Russian crack units, now  withdrawn from Germany, to ex-Yugoslavia. "Trainloads of troops  will head for Belgrade instead of eastwards, there will be calm  and quiet in the Balkans where the Russian Army will remain  forever", he promised.    On Moscow's rescheduling of Russia's entry of the  Partnership  for Peace plan, the LDP leader accused the foreign ministry and  President Yeltsin of procrastination saying "their decisions  come only after thousands of people have died".    He is also confident that Moscow will cancel planned  exercises with US troops in the Urals scheduled for July. The  forthcoming event is of public concern and our people should not  have any cause for anxiety, he said.</p>

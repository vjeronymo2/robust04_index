			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Tata Steel plunges to Rs46m Tata Iron and Steel, India's second-largest private company, saw first-half net profits plunge to Rs46.3m (Dollars 1.47m) from Rs502.2m a year ago, as a result of worldwide recession, writes RC Murthy in Bombay. Sales rose by 2 per cent to Rs15.05bn as the company focused on exports, which jumped to Rs3.74bn from Rs2.61bn in a year, to increase plant capacity utilisation. Operating profits rose by nearly a fifth to Rs2.19bn, partly due to changes in accounting practices. But the higher interest burden at Rs973.9m, compared with Rs786.6m, and depreciation provisions of Rs1.34bn cut net profits drastically to Rs46.3m from Rs502.2m in the same period last year.</p>

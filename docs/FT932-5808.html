			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / People: Wright takes a second retirement Brian Wright, who recently supervised the sale of most of the insurance business of Municipal Mutual Insurance, retired at the end of last month - for the second time. Two years ago, Wright, who is 63, retired after 30 years with Sun Alliance, the leading composite insurer. But he was soon back in the industry to take charge of efforts to stave off the liquidation of the troubled MMI, which ran up heavy losses in 1990 and 1991. Under his guidance, large chunks of the company have been sold off and 1,500 jobs saved. MMI remains intact to administer a portfolio of property and sell off two small subsidiaries: Prime Health and Prosperity UK. Philip Gregory, who joined MMI in 1989 and is currently finance director, takes over from Wright. Gregory, an accountant for 13 years at Peat Marwick, is 37.</p>

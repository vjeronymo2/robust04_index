			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TOLD OF LINCOLN S&amp;L'S ADVANCE TO ITS HOLDING CO.  </P> <P> Aides to millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. ordered Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  Assn. to advance its holding company $14.2 million for taxes a month before it  was due in 1986, a federal judge was told Monday.  </P> <P> However, the government alleges that the money never was paid to the Internal  Revenue Service.  </P> <P> The contention came in the 13th day of a hearing in U.S. District Court on  Keating's lawsuit, which alleges that the government takeover of the Irvine,  Calif., S&amp;L was capricious and arbitrary. He wants the thrift returned to  him.  </P> <P> A June 30, 1986, memo containing the instructions was introduced to support  government allegations that Keating was illegally siphoning federally insured  deposits from the thrift.  </P> <P> Regulators say the subsequent collapse of the $5.5-billion thrift could cost  taxpayers as much as $2 billion, making it the most expensive S&amp;L failure  in history.  </P> <P> In the memo, Lincoln's chief financial officer was instructed by her  counterpart at the thrift's holding company -- Keating's American Continental  Corp. of Phoenix -- to make the $14,186,000 payment a month earlier than it was  due.  </P> <P> Government lawyer James Murphy said the memo bolsters regulators' contention  that Lincoln was using complicated real estate, stock and junk bond  transactions to book phony profits to bolster Keating's faltering real estate  empire.  </P> <P> In its April takeover of the thrift, the government contended that American  Continental looted Lincoln of $94 million through the tax-sharing arrangement.  Under the agreement, the holding company collected taxes due on the phony  profits but never paid them to the IRS, the government contends.  </P> <P> Although an outline of the tax-sharing arrangement had been approved by  regulators on the West Coast, government attorneys contend it was illegal.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Andre Niebling, Lincoln's chairman from mid-1985 through mid-1987,  has refused to testify, citing a Fifth Amendment protection against  self-incrimination.  </P> <P> In an affidavit, Niebling cited a federal grand jury in Los Angeles that is  weighing possible criminal charges against Keating and other American  Continental and Lincoln officials.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] The summit of the heads of state of the franc  zone has just ended at the Presidential Palace in Libreville.  It began late this morning and its purpose was to take stock of  the financial situation in the 14 countries of the franc zone  six months after the devaluation of the CFA franc. This summit,  proposed on the sidelines of the funeral of late President  Houphouet-Boigny of Cote d'Ivoire in Yamoussoukro, was aimed at  harmonizing the economic policies of the countries concerned to  cushion the impact of the devaluation.    In the same vein, while opening the summit in his country  this morning, President Omar Bongo of Gabon, called on his peers  to work towards a genuine integration:    [Bongo] What is needed here is to take stock of what  has been achieved so far and to define some orientations for our  common future. We will look at the progress made in the  implementation of various programs set up by the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank and the effective mobilization  of aid promised in Dakar both by France and the other financial  backers. As for our countries debts, the monetary adjustment  has contributed to increase (?taxes) and the present treatment  no longer appears to be adapted to enable progress in the  implementation of the policy of new integration instruments  within the zone of West African Monetary Union and the Bank of  Central African States.    Today, more than in the past, the fate of our countries  lies in our own hands. We have the duty to resolutely commit  ourselves to implement a genuine integration process, without  any ulterior motives and without selfishness.    The summit continued in the afternoon behind closed doors  and  12 of the 14 heads of state attended. Persistent rumors have  been circulating on a possible devaluation of the CFA franc.  The rumors are denied by the Africans and their economic  partners along with the IMF, the World Bank, and France.    Correspondent Franck Medome talked to Niger president  Mahamane Ousmane on a possible devaluation. President Ousmane  said that the devaluation rate decided in Dakar was fixed at 50  percent to prevent further devaluation:    [Ousmane] First of all, I would like to say that this  decision will not be made now. These rumors are circulating  just because people are seeing the 14 heads of state of the  franc zone meeting here in Libreville with other partners. This  makes people think of a new devaluation, especially when they  remember the Dakar summit in January. They saw the heads of  state meet in Dakar and saw the outcome and now the same heads  of state are meeting in Libreville and think that this is to  devaluate the CFA franc once again. No. This is not the case.  People should understand that at the Dakar summit we agreed to  devaluate the CFA franc by 50 percent in order to ensure a  further devaluation was unneccessary. We said this was once and  for all and would last for years to come. And this should be  clear, there will be no other devaluation. It would be  nonsense.    [Medome] We can therefore be sure that President  Mahamane Ousmane will not be contradicted. There will be no  other devaluation of the CFA franc, at least not for the time  being.    [Ousmane] That is the truth. [passage omitted]    Several resolutions were adopted at the end of the  Libreville  summit. Among them, the resolution on Rwanda:    [Unidentified rapporteur] Preoccupied by the massacres  of the Rwanda civilian populations and the massive destruction  taking place in Rwanda for several months, satisfied with the  decision made at the OAU summit and the efforts made recently by  the international community to end this intolerable situation,  including Resolution No. 929 of the UN Security Council on 22  June 1994, and [words indistinct] in line with the same  resolution on humanitarian grounds by several members of the  United Nations at the initiative of France and some African  states, and while waiting for the reinforcement of troops of the  UN Observer Mission in Rwanda, we call on the entire  international community and especially on African states to  contribute and increase the UN troops in Rwanda in order to make  them more operational. We also call on the heads of state of  neighboring countries to pursue their mediation efforts in order  to find a lasting solution to the conflict, and stress the need  for urgent action from African states to find a peaceful  solution to the conflict and to ensure the protection of the  population and the return of civil peace.</p>

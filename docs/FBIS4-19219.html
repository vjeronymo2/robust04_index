			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Megaloan for Italian Rebuilding of </F> Russian Gaslines"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 14 -- SNAM SpA [National Gas  Pipeline Company], the group in the public Ente Nazionale  Idrocarburi (ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation]) energy and  chemicals holding company in charge of the natural gas sector,  said it was greatly satisfied today with the completion of a  package of 1.6 billion dollars in financing for Russia's Gazprom  which will boost the flow of Russian natural gas to Italy.    The operation to finance the restructuring of Russian  natural  gas pipelines by Italian companies, the first of its type for  the republic, was managed by Italy's Mediocredito Centrale,  Banca Commerciale Italiana and the West Merchant Bank. The loan  will assure, said SNAM, an increase in imports of Russian  natural gas within the terms of the agreement signed with  Gazprom in 1969.    The ENI company also said the signing of the loan will  further consolidate relations between Italy and Russia in this  sector through a contract valued at 1.9 billion dollars for  rebuilding and upgrading gaslines in Russia over the coming five  years.    Mediocredito Centrale said the construction work will be  done  by the Tragaz Consortium made up of the ENI companies Nuovo  Pignone SpA, planning and construction of the plant for the oil  and chemical industry, and Snamprogetti SpA, another engineering  company working in the fields of mining, chemicals and petroleum  plants.    The work will lead to additional supplies of natural gas,  estimated at 5.5 billion cubic meters, not now economically  recoverable.    The financing, said Mediocredito, "is the most important  completed in support of Italian exports" and the funds made  available by the markets came to more than two billion dollars,  as compared to the target of 1,615,000,000 billion dollars. The  loan, at the fixed rate 5.71 percent, will be underwritten by  the three sponsoring banks plus 40 credit institutes in 10  nations. The Italian Export Credit Insurance Agency (SACE) has  provided coverage of 95 percent of the financing with the  remaining share covered by the exporters.    The funds will be earmarked for the Russian Federation  purchase of Italian machinery, materials and services for the  reconstruction of the gasline leading from Russian territory to  Italy.    Since the signing of the 1969 contract, Italy has imported  some 160 billion cubic meters of Russian natural gas and, at  present, SNAM brings in 15 billion cubic meters of Russian  natural gas which account for 27 percent of the volume marketed  here by the ENI company. Russia also supplies Germany with 37  percent of its natural gas requirement and France with 21  percent.    SNAM natural gas sales last year came to 50 billion cubic  meters and estimates of the nation's requirement by the year  2000 put the figure at 75 billion cubic meters annually. The  share of Italy's energy market accounted for by natural gas rose  from 8 percent in 1967 to 25 percent last year.</p>

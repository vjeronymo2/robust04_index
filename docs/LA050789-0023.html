			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLEO'S RACE  </P> <P> In reference to Bob Stanford's April 29 letter about the race of Cleopatra: She  was black.  </P> <P> Her father, Ptolemy XIII (Neus Dionysius), was black. He called himself "The  New Osiris." (See "Sex &amp; Race," Vol. I, by J. A. Rodgers). You will see  that the racial features of Ptolemy XIII are the same features as the Nubian  pharaohs also pictured on the page.  </P> <P> Also, if Bob Stanford didn't know, a lot of the ancient Greeks were Ethiopians  or had Ethiopian blood (see "What They Never Told You in History Class," by  Indus Khamit Kush).  </P> <P> KIELA JAMAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

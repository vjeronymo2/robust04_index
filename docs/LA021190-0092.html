			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MESSAGES AND SIGNALS FROM THE WORLD OF RAP  </P> <P> I'm sure the cause to "tell it like it is" is a prevalent and urgent theme to  many rappers. But which rappers are in it to enlighten black society, as  opposed to those who seek rags-to-riches fame?  </P> <P> King, Malcolm X and Evers put their lives on the line to establish the  groundwork for black self-esteem; it's a huge responsibility to use their names  in any rap song.  </P> <P> Sincerity will come if rappers put back some of their rewards into their  culture. Rappers who wind up in America's Betty Ford rehab centers or who sow  seeds of destruction will only fuel the fire for separatism for years to come.  The next generation will live with the words they speak.  </P> <P> WAYNE MITCHELL  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

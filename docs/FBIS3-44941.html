			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Reporter Chen Jiaying (7115 1367 3841)] </F>   [Text] Lisbon, 4 Jan (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Foreign  Minister Durao Barroso said today that "quite satisfactory  progress" was made in the development of relations between  Portugal and China in 1993.    He made this remark while speaking about China at a forum on  Portugal's foreign policy at the Foreign Ministry. He  emphasized: The greatest progress Portugal has achieved in  developing bilateral relations is with China. Last year,  Portugal welcomed the visits of PRC President Jiang Zemin and  Vice President Rong Yiren. There were also frequent exchanges  of visits by high-ranking officials of the two countries.    Barroso also pointed out: On the question of Macao, the  Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group has carried out its work in  a way both sides consider very positive.    He said that his visit to China last year enabled him to  develop closer contacts with Chinese leaders and enhanced his  understanding of the current extremely dynamic period in China's  development.</p>

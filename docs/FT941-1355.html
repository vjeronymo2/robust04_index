			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Wellcome The 8 per cent drop in Wellcome's shares seems a particularly virulent response to a company which has had the good grace to raise its interim dividend 79 per cent. But Wellcome's results confirmed many of the market's worst fears about its earnings prospects. Volume growth fell to 3.5 per cent. The 2.4 percentage point growth in margins to 32.9 per cent was striking but may quickly be reversed. The withdrawal of an anti-herpes compound fuelled further worries about Wellcome's drugs pipeline, while the looming expiry of Zovirax's patents causes great uncertainty. By valuing it on 11 times historic earnings, the market clearly views Wellcome as a dud investment story. That may prove justified in the immediate future. But from a long-term perspective it seems faintly absurd. Wellcome boasts a solid balance sheet and strong cash generation. It retains impressive expertise in anti-viral medicines. Health is the most certain growth business in the world. Given the low penetration levels of its main drugs and the substantial under-utilisation of its manufacturing capacity, Wellcome could yet grow its markets by driving volume and dropping price as theory would suggest. The sums are hugely complicated by the regulatory restrictions affecting the marketing and distribution of drugs. Even so, Wellcome's experience reinforces the view that pharmaceuticals companies should rethink the basic economics of their business.</p>

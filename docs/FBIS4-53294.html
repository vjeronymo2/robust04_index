			<p>BFN     [Text] Mati, Davao Oriental -- President Ramos began his  development blitz of southeastern Mindanao yesterday, putting in  place an P870 million [Philippine pesos] network of  infrastructure facilities to help propel the country's  participation in the East ASEAN Growth Area or EAGA.    The president also urged the people of Mindanao to unite and  work hard to help achieve the government's objective of  transforming the country into a newly industrialized nation by  year 2000.    "Let us do our jobs and create a momentum so that the  younger  Filipinos will have a better future and more prosperous life,"  the president said during a multi-sectoral meeting to launch  projects and services for the region.    The infrastructure facilities include the P300 million  Davao-Digos Road; the P400 million Digos-General Santos Road;  the P11.7 million water impounding system for Digos; a P115  million fund for the province for various development projects;  and, a P44 million housing project for low-salaried government  employees.    Ramos said the construction would be completed soonest,  adding that funds had been made available so that builders could  immediately start constructing the facilities.    Bidding for the projects will be finished in two months  time,  he said.    Ramos also released to the province P97 million representing  its share of the internal revenue allotment for the first four  months of the year.    He said the province's allotment for the rest of the year  could be released on time by the budget department.    Aside from this, the president released P18.5 million  representing funds for pet projects of lawmakers from the Davao  provinces which are included in the budget law.    These projects include the construction of a tourism complex  and the improvement of the police headquarters.    Other projects given funding commitments were:    -- Concreting of the Mati Coastal Road;    -- Rehabilitation of numerous farm-to-market roads; and,    -- Completion of the unfinished Tandag-Bislig Road in  Surigao Del Sur.    The housing project, undertaken by the National Housing  Authority will benefit some 116 homeless families.    The president said his administration was determined to  improve the economy of southeastern Mindanao, seen as a major  player in implementing the EAGA with provinces of Brunei,  Indonesia, and Malaysia.    The general thrust is to make the country, through the  economic development of sub-regions, more competitive in the  global trade, tourism, and investment market, he said.</p>

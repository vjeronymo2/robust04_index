			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Dollar hits high against D-Mark THE DOLLAR yesterday hit its highest levels against the D-Mark in Europe for 16 months, amid signs that the world's leading nations are happy to see the currency continue its recent rise. Although the currency slipped in New York on profit-taking, European foreign exchange dealers had been encouraged to buy the dollar because the Group of Seven leading industrial nations failed to mention its persistent strength in their final statement after a weekend meeting in Washington. While the US failed in its short-term goal of persuading Germany to cut its interest rates, the discussions among the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada are expected to lead to lower interest rates in coming months. US officials have pressed for easier borrowing conditions worldwide, as part of an effort to spur economic growth. Although the dollar closed below the day's highs, it kept up the momentum which has seen it jump by 22 per cent against the D-Mark since hitting an all-time trading low against the Germany currency in mid-February. The dollar's rise has been due to increasing optimism about the outlook for the US economy, while the D-Mark has been affected by worries about the economic cost of German re-unification. The German currency's recent weakness has worried the Bundesbank, which wants a strong D-Mark to constrain inflationary pressures. Last night, the dollar closed in London at DM1.769, up more than 1 pfennig on Friday's close. At the start of trading in Frankfurt, it was quoted at DM1.786, its highest opening there since December, 1989. Later in New York, it eased to close at Dollars 1.7512. On the lack of reference to the dollar in the G7 communique, Mr Jim O'Neill, head of financial markets research at Swiss Bank Corporation in London, said: 'It seems that, outside Germany, no one is worried by the low D-Mark.'

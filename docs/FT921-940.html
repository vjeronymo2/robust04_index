			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories condemn pension proposal THE Conservatives yesterday sought to underpin their attack on Labour's tax policies with a claim that Mr John Smith's plan to end incentives for personal pensions would hit those on average incomes. Mr Tony Newton, social security secretary, said the shadow chancellor's proposal to abolish next year the 2 per cent incentive paid to those who opt out of the State Earnings-Related Pensions scheme would cut the incomes of 4.5m people. As the Conservatives continued to focus their offensive on the impact of the Opposition's policies on the skilled working classes, or C2s, Mr Newton stressed that most of those affected by the pensions issue were on average or below-average incomes. His calculations suggested that the cost next year to someone on average earnings would be Pounds 5.50 per week. The Labour plan to drop the 1 per cent incentive which the Conservatives would pay in the following three years would add to that loss. The overall effect for about half of those with personal pensions would be a cash loss of Pounds 700 from their pensions. That in turn would hit the level of retirement incomes, with losses of up to Pounds 3,000 in the capital accumulated.</p>

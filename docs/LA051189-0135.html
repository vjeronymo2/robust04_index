			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MURDER SOLICITATION CHARGES DISMISSED  </P> <P> Charges against a Canoga Park insurance agent accused of soliciting the murder  of a client were dropped after the "star witness" in the case confessed that he  had committed perjury, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin on Tuesday dismissed the  murder solicitation charge against Esmail Shokri, 34, at the request of Deputy  Dist. Atty. John C. Spence.  </P> <P> Shokri was accused of soliciting the murder of Iranian national Farhang  Goudarzi, 38, of Woodland Hills, who twice in January, 1988, had cars he was  driving damaged by bombs. Shokri was accused of offering Afshin Rahmani, 23, of  Encino a cut of an insurance policy on Goudarzi if Rahmani killed him.  </P> <P> Rahmani contacted authorities in March, 1988, and agreed to cooperate, later  testifying against Shokri during a preliminary hearing in August. But Spence  said that earlier this year, Rahmani went to the office of Shokri's attorney  and admitted during a taped interview that he had lied during the  investigation.  </P> <P> Although Rahmani later claimed that he had not committed perjury, "his entire  credibility is highly suspect," Spence said. "We did not feel we had a provable  case with him."  </P> <P> Spence said his office is considering filing a perjury charge against Rahmani,  who Monday faces sentencing on an auto theft conviction in Van Nuys earlier  this year.  </P></p>

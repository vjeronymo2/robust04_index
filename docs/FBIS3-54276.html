Koirala and Azuma also discussed Japan's Asia-Pacific  regional policy, the source added.    The vice minister, who arrived here early Thursday, signed  two separate agreements to assist in improving facilities at  Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport and the construction  of the Tripureswore-Bagmati bridge.    The existing bridge was built with help from India, but has  been weakened by heavy traffic.    The Japanese official also had an audience with King  Birendra  late Thursday at the royal palace.    A Japanese Embassy spokesman said the main purpose of  Azuma's  visit was to promote goodwill and mutual understanding and  strengthen relations between the two countries.    Azuma is scheduled to leave Friday after attending the  inauguration of another bridge here, which Japan also assisted  in building.    He is to make stops in India and Pakistan at the weekend  before returning to Japan.</p>

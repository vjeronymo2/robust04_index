After the talks, Churkin told journalists that appropriate  and rapid action is needed to help the three sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina find the best solution. He continued: I  expect that next week we will launch a peace process which might  finally resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Vitaliy Churkin also had talks with Croatian Foreign  Minister  Mate Granic and informed him about his talks in Sarajevo and  Belgrade with representatives of the Bosnian Serbs and with  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. They agreed that the  Bosnian Serbs should be included in the negotiations as soon as  possible in order for an integral solution, as well as peace and  stability in this region, to be found.</p>

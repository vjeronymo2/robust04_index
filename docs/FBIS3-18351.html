			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Marco Panara report: "Occhetto Supports Alliance: </F> `Justified Attack'"]    [Text] Brussels -- [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS,  Secretary] Achille Occhetto received the second piece of good  news of the day from NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner  himself. It was the news that NATO's headquarters in Brussels  was waiting for but feared that it might not hear. For Achille  Occhetto, the first PDS secretary to be invited to NATO  headquarters, who happened to be in Brussels on the very day  when NATO carried out the first military operation in its  history, it was like scoring a goal just as the final whistle is  sounding.    The first news -- about the four Serbian aircraft downed by  the NATO fighters -- created an anxious atmosphere around his  visit, distracting people and creating a mood of expectancy.  There were some certainties -- that the Serbian aircraft were  flying in the no-fly zone, that they were armed with  air-to-surface missiles and bombs, and that the NATO pilots  issued three warnings. And there was an uncertainty: What  would the political cost of this "policing" operation be? The  problem was that it was Moscow that would determine this  political price.    Speaking with journalists after his first round of meetings,  Occhetto defined his position as follows: "As far as we know,  the operation was carried out in implementation of the UN  decisions and is therefore entirely legitimate. I am worried  about the danger that this event could disrupt the equilibrium  which, by means of military pressure and political action, it  has been possible to establish in Bosnia, partly by involving  Russia. I hope that Moscow will not change its position  following today's events."    Then when, a few minutes before 1800 hours [1700 GMT],  Manfred Woerner entered room 8 at NATO headquarters to meet with  the PDS delegation, the report from Moscow was enough to dispel  the anxiety and to break the ice at the same time. Reassured by  Moscow's attitude, the PDS secretary and the NATO secretary  general were able to reassure each other with a sense of relief.    "Mr. Woerner was pleased to receive confirmation from Mr.  Occhetto personally that even with the PDS in government Italy's  membership in NATO would not be called into question," one  witness said after the meeting, "and Mr. Occhetto was happy to  feel that he was being examined and not to perceive any signs of  doubts about the possibility of a progressive government in  Italy."    Achille Occhetto's visit to NATO headquarters and his  meetings with the organization's most senior officials had been  postponed several times in recent weeks because of Woerner's  health, and by chance happened to fall at the very start of the  election campaign. Occhetto took advantage of this fact in order  to issue a message of reassurance for both domestic and external  consumption.    In the morning the PDS delegation met with Ambassador Sergio  Silvio Balanzino, NATO's deputy secretary general; then over  breakfast with the permanent representatives of the  organization's various member countries and a number of military  officials including Sir Richard Vincent, chairman of NATO's  chiefs of staff committee, and General Dangerfield, commander of  the international military staff; and at last in the afternoon  with Manfred Woerner.    "I reaffirmed that our position includes NATO membership for  Italy." Occhetto told journalists at the press conference  following his meetings. "It does not make sense to say that  Italy should leave it, but neither is it enough to say that we  will remain within it. We are aware that there is a problem  regarding the redefinition of NATO's role; moreover, this is not  an issue that we raised but one on which is already being  generally discussed. The end of the bipolar system has resolved  the problems of European security, and NATO, which was organized  to guarantee peace within a bipolar system, must now be equipped  to deal with the new and different challenges that present  themselves to peace."    The PDS' position sees NATO maintaining relations of close  cooperation with other international organizations, especially  with the United Nations, whose supranational aspect must be  accentuated, according to the PDS.    "Over breakfast," Occhetto said, "we discussed the UN  Security Council, whose structure stems directly from the  outcome of World War II. Around the table we talked about  granting membership to major regional areas in the future so as  to eliminate the perception by poor countries that any  operations decided on by the United Nations are in the interests  of individual wealthy countries or groups of wealthy countries  and to avert jealousies and misunderstandings among the wealthy  countries.    "We intend to impart a dynamic approach to NATO's role which  takes into account the new post-communist situation. I was  pleased to note that Mr. Woerner welcomed this stance on our  part."</p>

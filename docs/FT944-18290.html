			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries retreat on rate rise fears US Treasury bonds retreated yesterday on the release of economic data which reinforced expectations of an imminent increase in short-term interest rates. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  7/16 lower at 95 29/32 , with the yield rising to 7.85 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down  1/8 at 99, to yield 6.653 per cent. Early on, prices improved as the dollar gained ground against other leading currencies. The move reflected partial agreement reached by US and Japanese negotiators at the weekend in negotiations over an array of trade issues. However, bonds quickly surrendered their gains on the release of the monthly survey conducted by the National Association of Purchasing Management. The results showed continued strength in the manufacturing sector and further pressure on prices. The NAPM's overall index of business activity climbed to 58.2 per cent in September, from 56.2 per cent the previous month. The price component of the survey reached a six-year high of 77.1 per cent, up from 74.5 per cent. The inflation-sensitive long end of the maturity range was most unsettled by the news, with the yield on the 30-year issue climbing a little closer to the 8.00 per cent level. But the short end was also down, as the data provided a little more evidence which might support a move by the Federal Reserve to put up short-term rates for the sixth time this year. Many traders are expecting the Fed to act before the end of the month, as it becomes more apparent that the five policy tightenings so far have failed to slow the economy. The timing of the central bank's next move could be determined by the strength of this Friday's report on August employment conditions. European government bonds followed US Treasuries lower on the NAPM data, and sentiment was jittery amid continued speculation over a near-term increase in US interest rates. 'Fears of imminent Fed tightening are likely to be a depressing factor for European markets all week,' said Mr John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International. With Germany closed for a national holiday, turnover was relatively thin and price movements were mainly futures-led. Hopes of fresh cash allocations at the start of the fourth quarter were dashed by the renewed market weakness. UK gilts were particularly badly hit, closing nearly a point lower on the day. After briefly breaching technical resistance at 100 and rising to 100 3/16 , the December long gilt futures contract on Liffe fell by 29/32 to 98 27/32 . The market began to weaken in the morning on news of a stronger than expected rise in M0 money supply growth, raising fears that inflationary pressures could prompt another increase in base rates. M0 posted a seasonally adjusted year-on-year rise of 7.1 per cent in September, compared with market forecasts of a 6.3 per cent rise. The news eclipsed data from the Nationwide Building Society showing a 2.9 per cent decline in UK house prices in September from August. The sharp price decline, especially among longer-dated gilts, caused the UK yield spread over German bonds to widen markedly to 151 basis points from 137 on Friday. Although Germany was closed, the bund future on Liffe fell  1/2 point to 88.30 in the wake of the US numbers. The October 16 federal elections were also weighing on the market. While most market participants are betting on a re-election of the governing centre-right coalition, there is widespread talk of a grand coalition including the opposition Social Democrats. However, the market does not seem to be discounting a change in government. Consequently, 'if polls continue to show a close outcome in coming weeks, the risk remains for somewhat higher bond yields near-term', warn analysts at Salomon Brothers. Italian bonds fell nearly a point, depressed by the NAPM numbers and fears that Italy's budget could face a struggle through parliament. The December BTP future on Liffe fell by 0.87 to 98.90.</p>

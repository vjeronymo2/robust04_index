			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Savills returns to the black SAVILLS returned to profitability in the half year to October 31 as the property group drove down costs and expanded its lucrative commercial property consultancy and valuation services. The pre-tax profit emerged at Pounds 163,000 compared with losses of Pounds 762,000, on a small increase in turnover from Pounds 11.8m to Pounds 11.9m. Mr George Inge, chairman, said a Pounds 826,000 reduction in costs was chiefly responsible for the improved results. Staff numbers were cut again to about 530 - down by nearly 30 per cent from 740 in 1989. Commercial turnover rose by 6 per cent to Pounds 5.1m, of which nearly two thirds came from consultancy and valuation work. Savills was advising the administrators of Canary Wharf, but its City agency had performed well throughout central London with good demand for quality accommodation. The residential sector was 'dull', although there were signs that the London market had picked up in November and December, with interest from overseas buyers spurred by the sterling devaluation in September. Cash reserves stood at Pounds 2.5m at the end of October, against Pounds 1.9m six months earlier. The group was benefiting from the absorption of a Pounds 1.6m property write-off last year and the continued depreciation of office equipment bought after its listing in 1988. 'I am quietly confident the improvement in our results is sustainable in the current six months, but we have seen false dawns before,' Mr Inge said. Earnings per share were 0.03p (1.7p losses).</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Hypo-Bank stagnates in first six months Operating profits at Bayerische Hypotheken-und Wechsel-Bank stagnated at DM483m (Dollars 296m) during the first six months of the year in spite of a 15 per cent increase in interest income to almost DM2bn. Earnings from own-account trading were down 83 per cent to DM14m in comparison with the first half of last year. But partial operating profits, which exclude this factor, rose 14 per cent to DM930m. Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank last week reported large declines in earnings from their own-account trading activities, but while they managed to reduce debt provisions, Hypo-Bank set aside DM571m, almost 16 per cent more. Net commission income rose 5 per cent on the year-earlier figure to DM442m, and strong demand for housing was reflected in a 29 per cent surge to DM733m in net interest income from its mortgage business, in which average interest margins rose to 1.03 per cent compared with 0.99 per cent throughout 1993. Interest income from general banking, where margins narrowed slightly to 1.89 per cent from 1.90 per cent, was 9 per cent higher at DM1.265bn. Yesterday's interim report was the first in which Hypo-Bank presented direct comparisons with the comparable part of the previous year. On the basis of German banks' traditional reporting methods - comparing half-year results with 50 per cent of the full 1993 outcome - full operating profits were down 6.6 per cent, and partial earnings were 3.6 per cent higher. On this basis, risk provisions were down 1 per cent. The difference between this figure and the direct comparison with the first half of 1993 reflects in part the impact of the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property business. According to recent statements, the bank set aside about DM150m to cover its share of the risk.</p>

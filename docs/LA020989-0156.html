			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL SET FOR ACTIVIST IN LONG BEACH STING ARREST  </P> <P> Don C. Jackson, an activist against alleged police misconduct, pleaded innocent  Wednesday to a charge of resisting arrest during a videotaped "sting" operation  intended to uncover brutality and racism by Long Beach police officers.  </P> <P> A Hawthorne police sergeant who is on long-term administrative leave, Jackson  was arraigned before Long Beach Municipal Court Commissioner Joseph W. Blocker,  who set trial for March 15.  </P> <P> Jackson, 30, was confident he will be cleared of the misdemeanor charge, which  he said was filed in an effort to divert attention from misconduct by the  officer who arrested him Jan. 14 after a routine traffic stop on Pacific Coast  Highway in Long Beach.  </P> <P> He and another man had donned shabby clothes, rented an old car and drove to  Long Beach to document alleged harassment of blacks by the police. A television  camera was hidden on the rear deck of the car.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Followed by TV Crew  </P> <P> They were followed in separate vehicles by a television crew from the NBC  "Today Show" and members of the Police Misconduct Lawyers Referral Service, a  group fighting alleged police brutality.  </P> <P> In a videotape shown nationally on television, Officer Mark Dickey spices his  orders with obscenities when Jackson objects to submitting to a weapons  pat-down. The officer then appears to push Jackson's head through the window of  a motorcycle shop and throw him against a police car for handcuffing.  </P> <P> Airing of the videotape has sparked investigations by the FBI, the Los Angeles  County district attorney's office and the Police Department.  </P> <P> It has renewed calls in Long Beach for a citizens' review board to probe  allegations of police misconduct.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Working a Desk Job  </P> <P> Dickey is working a desk job as an auto theft detective pending outcome of the  investigations.  </P> <P> Long Beach City Prosecutor John Vander Lans said in an interview that the  charge was filed against Jackson because it appeared he was taunting the  officer.  </P> <P> "As far as this office is concerned, we saw nothing affected by the race, creed  or color of Mr. Jackson," Vander Lans said. "We saw the acts of Mr. Jackson."  </P> <P> After the arraignment, Jackson said the case will put the American justice  system on trial. He added that he is only "guilty of being a black man in the  United States."  </P> <P> He said Dickey, not himself, should be put on trial. The officer, Jackson said,  has "no excuse for the violence."  </P> <P> If convicted, Jackson could be sentenced to up to a year in county jail and  fined $1,000.  </P></p>

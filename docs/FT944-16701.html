			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mopping up the sleaze Some years ago, it might not have seemed incongruous for a British minister to boast of the unparalleled honesty of his country's politics. It does today. No government can claim to be free of self-serving behaviour by elected or appointed officials. But standards of public life in Britain have fallen too far. Mr John Major should respond by exposing past corruption, and acting to prevent future lapses. Much of this is a matter of perception; some is proven wrongdoing. Questionable individuals have donated large sums to the Conservative party. Tory MPs have been willing to accept fees for asking parliamentary questions. Ex-ministers have joined the boards of industries privatised by their former offices, or moved to merchant banks that handled departmental business. Trading in Anglia Television shares is believed not to have profited Lord Archer personally, but he should further amplify his denials of insider dealing. Former public officials, sitting as executives of state-owned industries, have become hugely enriched by privatisation. The network of quangos is managed in dark secrecy by ministerial placemen and women; many are redundant party functionaries or past donors to Conservative funds. Some are thought to have put business in the way of companies they previously served. The most dramatic accusations have arisen from arms deals. This week it has been alleged that Mr Mark Thatcher, son of the then prime minister, benefited from commissions paid to middlemen who brokered the Al Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia. It is hardly surprising that 61 per cent of respondents to a Gallup poll in the Daily Telegraph agreed that the Tories appear 'very sleazy and disreputable'. Some of them are. Mr John Major cannot be responsible for individual actions, but he must be seen to be aware of the problem, and act to stop the rot. He could usefully begin with his predecessor. If Mr Thatcher profited from the Saudi deal, the breach of rules for ministerial behaviour would have been his mother's. She set up the deal; no relation of hers should have profited. A public inquiry into the issue, as demanded by Labour's Mr Robin Cook, would be impossibly laborious. But Mr Major could publish the notes on Al Yamamah prepared by the then permanent secretary at the ministry of defence, the National Audit Office report, and other relevant documents. He could prevail upon Lady Thatcher to make a more detailed statement than her brief assertion of probity this week. He could tighten the rules of ministerial behaviour, both in office and within a couple of years of leaving it, and legislate to make the quangocracy transparent and accountable. He could subject appointments to NAO scrutiny, hold all names on a publicly available national register, and publish audited accounts of all relevant bodies. He could tighten executive remuneration procedures in regulated utilities. Sleaze is a serious issue. Mr Major must tackle it.</p>

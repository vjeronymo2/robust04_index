			<p>BFN     [Text] "If there are any attempts to `take away' confidence  in the government during the Senate vote, then the Northern  League will ask for immediate elections." The statement was  made by Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Northern League, who  added that the "alliance currently in office was the only one  capable of providing a democratic government."    Bossi said that the opposition would have "to bear the  responsibility of provoking fresh elections, which would not  only impose on the country an irresolvable and dangerous crisis,  but would also go against the will of the the Italian people who  expressed their will at the ballot box."</p>

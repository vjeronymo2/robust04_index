			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 22 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said here today that he was "deeply grateful" to late  former U.S. President Richard Nixon "for his wise counsel on  many occasions" over the past year.    Clinton made the remarks from the White House Rose Garden  when formally announcing that Nixon had died in New York at  09:08 PM, U.S. Eastern Standard Time.    He hailed Nixon's contributions in reaching out to countries  such as China and the former Soviet Union.    Clinton said that Nixon "had the wisdom to know when the  time  was right to reach out to the Soviet Union and China."    He said that his relationship with Nixon was "warm and  constructive" and that "he went out of his way to give me his  best advice."    Clinton said that he would attend Nixon's funeral in  California.    The U.S. national flag, the Strip and Star [as received],  will flow at half mast for 30 days, beginning this evening, to  honor the passing away of Nixon.</p>

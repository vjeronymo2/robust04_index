			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY: HE'S ALWAYS IN AT THE FINISH  </P> <P> The photographs of Herb Yaka generate an enormous amount of interest. Yet, he  works in virtual anonymity.  </P> <P> Yaka's photographs are worth a lot of money, but he never sells them.  </P> <P> And his photographs can cause people to cheer or utter profanity. But, he's not  a controversial fellow.  </P> <P> Herb Yaka is the photo-finish photographer at Los Alamitos Race Course, whose  work ultimately helps the judges decide the winners and losers.  </P> <P> Is that a lot of pressure?  </P> <P> It can be when you consider that more than $1 million a night is wagered. But  for Yaka, who has photographed more than 50,000 finishes, experience gives him  confidence.  </P> <P> The 55-year-old photographer plies his trade in a 12-by-12-foot darkroom with  two specially made slit cameras that are designed to capture nose-to-nose  finishes. Unlike conventional still cameras, where a shutter opens and exposes  the film in an instant, his shutter is a slit that is always open and aimed at  the finish line. In order to make the exposure, the film moves across the slit  at the same speed the horses travel.  </P> <P> From his rather barren perch five stories above the race track, he photographs  every race, and the pressure is on when "PHOTO FINISH" is flashed across the  infield tote board. While ticket-holders wait and worry, he turns out a print  in less than a minute. Only one thing slows him down: the last horse. He must  photograph every horse as it crosses the line.  </P> <P> It's a routine that happens 10 to 13 times a night during the harness and  quarter-horse racing season. As the horses leave the gate, he starts timing the  race. It's an unofficial time during harness racing, but it's the official time  during the quarter-horse season.  </P> <P> He watches each race closely from one of the best vantage points at the track.  As the horses near the finish, he flips two switches and the film starts to  move in his cameras. He uses both a main camera and a backup in case the first  camera malfunctions.  </P> <P> If a horse wins by less than a length, it's considered a photo finish. When the  last horse crosses the finish line, he turns off the camera and shuts a sliding  door across the window facing the track turning his office cubicle into a  darkroom.  </P> <P> He unloads the film in darkness and develops the film in chemicals heated to  135 degrees. Kodak recommends that most film processing be done at temperatures  between 68 and 75 degrees. However, Yaka uses the hot developer to cut down on  the time. It takes only six seconds to develop the film and six seconds to fix  it. It then goes into a water wash for a few seconds.  </P> <P> After inspecting the picture, Yaka adds a white line to the photograph during  the printing process to easily see which horse won. He clips the photo to a  clamp attached to a wire and the photo is pulled up to the five judges above  him who decide the finish.  </P> <P> Because of his processing technique, the film is certainly not up to archival  quality but, by state law, it must be kept for at least two years.  </P> <P> The idea of stopping the action of a racehorse at just the right moment may  sound complicated. However, it's actually quite easy because there is no  shutter, just a vertical slit that captures all the action.  </P> <P> "Most people are accustomed to shooting one frame at a time," Yaka explains.  "Even when you watch TV, it's one frame at a time but it goes so fast that your  eyes can't see it. It's a continuous motion. It's the same with motion  pictures.  </P> <P> "But with this camera, there are no frames at all. The film goes by the slit at  the same speed as the object you're photographing. All race track photographers  use the same style camera."  </P> <P> His camera uses a film-timing negative film that is 62-millimeters wide. It  doesn't have any sprocket holes and the emulsion is tougher so that it will  withstand the heated chemicals used in development. It takes 90 days to receive  the film from Kodak by special order.  </P> <P> The closest race Yaka has ever photographed was 10 years ago for a triple dead  heat -- three horses crossing the finish line at exactly the same moment. Yaka  is proud of the fact that he's never missed a finish.  </P> <P> Yaka grew up on a dairy farm on the island of Kauai in Hawaii, but, he said,  "Horses and I really never got along." After a stint in the Army, he came to  California with his brother in 1956. Yaka studied electronics and his brother  became a jockey. When he was visiting his brother at the track, he was invited  to become the video camera operator because of his electronics background.  </P> <P> In 1969, after three years working as a cameraman, he was hired by Photo Chart,  a company that provided photo-finish pictures for local tracks. The company  worked at Hollywood Park, Santa Anita, Los Alamitos and Del Mar.  </P> <P> "I had an idea of what to expect," he said. "I wasn't afraid of it. If you are  afraid of something then it's harder to learn."  </P> <P> He started his own business in 1981 called Acculine Photo, shooting at Los  Alamitos and the Pomona Fair race track.  </P> <P> After 21 years, Yaka has no plans to retire.  </P> <P> "I love my work," he said. "I'm outdoors, yet I'm indoors. I'm watching a  sporting event from the best seat in the house and getting paid for it."  </P> <P> Although a constant observer of horse racing, Yaka never picks winners because  as a state licensed employee of the track, he's not allowed to bet.  </P> <P> Yaka can only watch and shoot pictures -- two of his favorite activities. And  that alone means he leaves the track each night a winner.  </P> <P> The Photography Column, which runs every other Saturday in Orange County Life,  is intended to help the serious amateur and weekend shooter.  </P></p>

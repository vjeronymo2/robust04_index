			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> TEACHERS WIN 5.62% RISE IN SALARIES  </P> <P> After a yearlong labor dispute, teachers in the Santa Paula Elementary School  District ratified a salary increase Thursday, and the board of trustees  approved the agreement at its regular meeting.  </P> <P> Teachers will receive an overall 5.62% increase in salaries and benefits,  retroactive to September, 1989, union and district officials said.  </P> <P> The salary increase falls under a contract that expired June 30. Negotiations  for a new contract will begin this fall, probably in October, said Randall  Chase, assistant superintendent of business services.  </P> <P> The new schedule includes incentives such as higher salaries for new teachers  and bonuses for bilingual teachers, designed to make Santa Paula schools more  attractive to teaching recruits.  </P> <P> Carolyn Ishida, president of the Santa Paula Federation of Teachers, which  represents 134 teachers, said most teachers will receive an increase that will  amount to about 5.42%. The rest of the increase will boost salaries for  beginning teachers, she said.  </P> <P> Of the 99 teachers who voted, six opposed the pay proposal, Ishida said.  </P> <P> Chase said the district's salary schedule "was redesigned because we need to  increase entry-level and lower-level salaries."  </P> <P> According to the Ventura County superintendent of schools office, teachers at  the Santa Paula Elementary School District earned less under the old schedule  than those in three other school districts in the city.  </P> <P> The increases will bring minimum salaries for most new teachers -- depending on  their education and experience -- to more than $24,000 a year. The previous  minimum was slightly more than $20,000 a year. The new maximum salary for  teachers with 11 years of experience and a master's degree will be $42,331 a  year, Chase said.  </P> <P> Annual anniversary bonuses for teachers with at least 15 years of experience  will increase from $975 to $1,000 a year, Chase said. The district will  continue to pay full health benefits, which have risen by about 6% over the  past year, he said.  </P> <P> In addition, the new salary schedule includes a $500-a-year bonus for bilingual  teachers with full credentials, Ishida said. That bonus will increase by $100  annually, she said.  </P> <P> Costs of the salary increases are expected to be close to $400,000 and will be  taken out of this year's budget, district officials said.

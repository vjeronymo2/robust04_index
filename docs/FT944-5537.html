			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Drugs claim on Gibraltar border Spain yesterday countered British claims of harassment at the border with Gibraltar with allegations that the Rock had become a big drugs smuggling and money laundering centre. 'Gibraltar's narcotics business is industrially organised. The situation has degenerated to a very serious level,' official sources in Madrid said. Long traffic queues have developed at the border as police conduct searches and question drivers whether their vehicles are properly equipped. On Thursday Mr David Davis, the UK's minister for Europe, summoned Spain's ambassador in London, Mr Albert Aza, to the Foreign Office and expressed the British government's 'strong concern' over 'intrusive' checks by Spanish police at the frontier. The row has surfaced as foreign secretary Mr Douglas Hurd prepares to meet Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister, in London this month to discuss Spanish claims to the British colony and has added an embarrassing new twist to existing tensions between Whitehall and Mr Joe Bossano, the independent-minded chief minister of Gibraltar. Attempts by the UK to supervise the the colony's finances have prompted Mr Bossano to allege that London is strangling Gibraltar's attempt to achieve self-sufficiency as an offshore banking base. It is now feared that the virtual siege on Gibraltar, reminiscent of the blockade imposed by the Franco dictatorship, could serve to strengthen Mr Bossano as he campaigns for 'a hands off the Rock' policy and seeks UK counter measures against Spain. Gibraltar residents say double checks on vehicles leaving the colony, as two teams of Spain's paramilitary civil guards corps laboriously conduct searches and question drivers, have caused queues of up to six hours at the border. 'It's ludicrous, a never-ending list of things you have to have which changes at the whim of the police,' said a Gibraltar barrister. 'Apart from spare fan belts and all that, the car's first aid kit has to include surgical gloves and if you wear spectacles you have to have a second pair.' In London, the Spanish ambassador was told the checks 'could not seriously be presented as a search for drugs and tobacco.' A Madrid official said the border controls were creating a detailed data base on those entering Spain. 'We are obtaining very useful information which is directly linked to illicit activities in Gibraltar. Smuggling is tolerated by the Gibraltar authorities and London looks the other way.' Last Monday the civil guard intercepted 43 fast launches based in Gibraltar trying to land tobacco and drugs on three nearby Spanish beaches. Officials in Madrid say Gibraltar risks a Mafia-type takeover. There is certainly little use other than that of illegal activities for the 200-odd fast launches, painted black to help avoid detection at night, that are moored in Gibraltar's marina. 'The illegal activities have increased, we have not seen a serious single effort to curb them, and they have to stop,' the officials said.</p>

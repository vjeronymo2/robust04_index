			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Working Life: A few days in history - Reading Matter Choosing a book to read for the summer break? There are a number of histories that are worth considering. Frauds, crashes, insider dealing and rampant anti-semitism - the racy world of 19th century London was the subject of David Kynaston's The City of London: A World of its Own: 1850-1890 (Chatto), the first of a trilogy exploring how the City came to be regarded as the world's leading financial centre. Kynaston explains how Queen Victoria took a while to warm to the new breed of hustling money-makers, preferring to honour, according to a confidant, 'the men who have raised themselves by patient industry and unswerving probity to positions of wealth and influence.' Quite what she would have made of unadorned table legs in the dining room was one of the themes of Michael Mason's The Making of Victorian Sexuality (OUP), which overturns many of our most cherished stereotypes of an age which was not that much more repressed than our own; 40 per cent of Victorian brides, reports Mason, were pregnant on their wedding day. More sex and violence embellish Peter Gay's The Cultivation of Hatred: the Bourgeois Experience, Victoria to Freud (HarperCollins), the third of a four-part series on 19th century middle class culture. Moving up the social scale, it has been a rocky period for books on the aristocracy. First, there was Tim Card's Eton Renewed: A History from 1860 to the Present Day (John Murray), an essentially friendly book which was over-shadowed by disclosures that the school's former headmaster, Anthony Chenevix-Trench, derived unhealthy pleasure from beating his boys. This furore was accompanied by the publication of David Cannadine's Aspects of the Aristocracy: Grandeur and Decline in Modern Britain (Yale University Press), in which the author completed the demolition job he started with his The Pleasures of the Past: The Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracy. The pick of the history paperbacks over the last few months is Linda Colley's epic Britons: Forging the Nation 1707-1837 (Pimlico) and Roy Porter's Myths of the English (Polity Press).</p>

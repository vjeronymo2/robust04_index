			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report LONON Metal Exchange COPPER prices continued to stall at overhead resistance above the Dollars 2,300 a tonne level, and ended with pared gains yesterday. In sterling terms the cash position closed Pounds 22 higher at Pounds 1,450 a tonne, but some Pounds 7 of the rise reflected the pound's further fall against the dollar. Dealers said copper's bounce from early lows around Dollars 2,280 a tonne indicated that the technical picture was becoming constructive, although upside targets around Dollars 2,315-Dollars 2,320 needed to be cleared to sustain advances. Other LME metals were relatively quiet, although ALUMINIUM briefly moved back above the Dollars 1,180 a tonne level for three months delivery. It quickly ran into overhead selling, however, and subsided to close just Dollars 3.50 up at Dollars 1,176.50 a tonne. At the London Futures and Options Exchange COCOA prices extended Wednesday's downturn on lack of buying interest, compounded by a New York opening below key chart support. The March position ended Pounds 8 down at Pounds 710 a tonne. Compiled from Reuters</p>

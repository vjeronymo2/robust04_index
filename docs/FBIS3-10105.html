In the latest magazine edition, Aracelis Careaga, vice  president of the National Commission of Social Attention and  Security, attributed black market related crimes, such as  robberies and misuse of resources, to the lack of controls.    The official also cited as a cause of the phenomenon "the  slackness of those who must guard the people's properties,  coupled with the existence of unscrupulous individuals who take  advantage of the situation in which we find ourselves to enrich  themselves."    Cuba is facing a serious economic crisis characterized by a  lack of products, rampant inflation, an excess of financial  liquidity, and a resulting increase in black market activity.    Nearly 11 million Cubans receive a reduced basket of basic  foodstuffs at subsidized prices via a ration card which has been  limited in the last few years as a result of the economic crisis.    According to analyses made by independent economists, the  people barely satisfy 40 percent of their food needs via the  ration card, but they are forced to resort to the black market  for the rest.    "There is no doubt many of the items that are sold at  exorbitant prices on the black market come from state-owned  stores, enterprises, and units that are supplying that market,"  Careaga affirmed.    "The social cost of these actions is so high that if no  authority exists, we must look for one to act against it, but we  must do it urgently," the official remarked.    Cuban authorities have been maintaining since last August a  police offensive against crime, particularly against the illicit  economic activity of robbery and speculation.</p>

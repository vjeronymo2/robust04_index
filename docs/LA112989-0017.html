			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER VIEWS: THE SO-CALLED 'ONE-ARMED BANDIT' CAN HOLD A MIGHTY HAUL  </P> <P> Question: My husband and I have just come back from one of our frequent trips  to Las Vegas. Both of us are impossible slot machine addicts. How many coins  (dollars or quarters) does the average slot machine hold? They must have a  fantastic capacity the way people like us pour money into them.  </P> <P> Do they ever run out of coins?  </P> <P> How come we never see anybody from the casino emptying them? How profitable are  the slots to the casino, and is there any control over how much they have to  pay out?  </P> <P> Finally, if I wanted to buy one for my own use, how much would it cost? -- L.  McA.  </P> <P> Answer: I'm sure you're not alone in your curiosity. The slots have had an  almost hypnotic fascination for people since a Bavarian immigrant named Charles  Fey -- a mechanic employed by an electric supply company in San Francisco --  tinkered around in his spare time and introduced the Liberty Bell (a nickel  machine) in 1905.  </P> <P> How much the average slot machine "holds" is an interesting question, because  it's a little more complicated than it sounds. The payouts, according to Judy  Sullivan, a public relations representative in Chicago for Bally Manufacturing  Corp., one of the big three makers of slots, all come from a "hopper," or large  tray, in the body of the machine -- naturally.  </P> <P> And, while the capacity of the hoppers will vary, Sullivan said, the average $1  machine will hold about 600 to 800 coins, and the average quarter machine will  hold about 2,000. But, sure enough, the machines take in a whale of a lot more  coins than that in the course of a day or night, so why aren't the coins  squirting out the seams of the machines?  </P> <P> Well, you probably thought that those heavy wooden stands on which every slot  machine sits were there to elevate the machine to a comfortable playing level.  Actually, the stands underneath the machines are more like small safes; they  contain buckets into which the bulk of the coins go as you feed them in. And  they do, indeed, have an impressive capacity.  </P> <P> Does a slot ever go dry -- run completely out of coins?  </P> <P> "Oh, sure, it happens all the time," says Jack Deremer, a Bally sales  representative in Las Vegas. "The hoppers all have a weight-activated sensor in  them so that when the machine starts getting low, the incoming coins will be  diverted directly into the hopper to build it back up instead of going into the  stand. But, things happen, and the slots suddenly go dry. The floor man fixes  it, pays the player what's owed him and that's all there is to it."  </P> <P> And yes, obviously, the buckets under the machine have to be emptied  periodically in spite of their capacity.  </P> <P> "Normally," Deremer said, "the casino will do this during the off-hours,  sometime between 3 and 6 a.m. Some are emptied every day, others every other  day, depending on how much play they get."  </P> <P> How profitable are the slots? Oh boy! The casinos make more from slots than all  other games combined.  </P> <P> "It'll vary a lot, of course," Deremer said, "but a dollar machine in a good  location -- where it gets pretty steady play all the time -- will net the house  about $300 to $400 a day."  </P> <P> That's profit, of course, and it is related to how many dollars are actually  passing through the slot.  </P> <P> How much does a slot cost? Well, they're pretty sophisticated and complex. If  you walk in off the street to buy one, figure on spending "$4,200 to about  $4,500," Deremer added.  </P> <P> Getting back to profits, consider that aforementioned heavily played $1 machine  that nets the house, on average, $350 a day. Even at full retail price  ($4,500), it will pay for itself in a hair under 13 days; in a year it has  grossed $1.2 million and has returned a profit to the house of $127,750.  </P> <P> And how seriously the casinos now regard the slots -- once dismissed as  something appealing to little old ladies in tennis shoes with rolls of nickels  in their purses -- can be seen in the recent upswing in slots appealing to the  traditional "high rollers."  </P> <P> Both $5 and $25 slots have become commonplace, "and a few of the casinos here  in Las Vegas," Deremer said, "now have $100 and $500 slots."  </P> <P> There is an edge of awe in his voice: "Can you imagine it -- playing a  three-token, $500 machine? That's a $1,500 bet on one pull of the handle."  </P></p>

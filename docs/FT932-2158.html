			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / As They Say in Europe: A good thing about bad news HAVING last week drawn heavily on international statistics to demonstrate the delights of Britain as a place in which to live, this week I note another virtue. It is the least parochial of nations, the only one of any size and wealth whose citizenry seems actively concerned with events in all parts of the world. This revelation stems from a numbing trawl through continental papers in search of editorials that do not focus on purely domestic concerns. Often an apparently international debate turns out to be a device to raise a domestic matter by other means. German comment on the situation in Bosnia or Somalia is in fact about Germany: the need to suppress the ancient enemy, Serbia, or the need for Germans to play a world role. When such commentators do confront the problems of distant nations, they lack a certain sophistication. Last week, you may recall, the US, acting under the authority of the UN, attacked the forces of the warlord General Aideed in Somalia. There was, noted the august Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 'Clear resentment against the UN among Aideed's followers.' No British analysis would have concluded with 'Warlords' followers 'resentful' at being bombed.' American comment ranges far and wide but the imperial view again leads to foreign events being interpreted in terms of American interests. The situation in Afghanistan or Indochina in the New York Times, one of the two American imperial dailies, is seen rather as it might have been a hundred years ago in The Times. But for real insularity there is nothing like the Russian press. No Moscow paper since democracy broke out has carried a single editorial on the domestic affairs of another country, at least one outside the old Soviet Union. There are two reasons: one is a hangover from the official communist doctrine of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The advent of democracy means that this doctrine is now honoured to the letter rather than in the breach. The other was epitomised in a row that broke out ten days ago which was witnessed by a colleague. A Russian friend of his was berated by some western Russian specialists for the fearful insularity of his compatriots - 'You don't even really care about Serbia.' The reply was violent and extreme: 'You westerners have such soft, easy lives where no difficult choices have to be made that you have to take on the troubles of others. You have not got enough problems of your own so you worry about Somalia.' That was my second revelation of the week: the real role of newspapers is to ensure that the basic human demand for bad news is properly met. Britain is the country that goes, literally, furthest towards meeting this demand. It is also currently torn by a row which started when a TV news reader said there should be space for good news on outlets such as his own. But the truth is that people want the news to inform them about those worse off than themselves. And they are actually doing good by learning of the plight of others; there is virtue in being concerned. The apparent demand for good news is based on what people say they want: nobody would reply, 'I don't want any good news on my TV screen' when asked the relevant question. It was the same when the opinion pollsters asked British voters last year if they would pay more tax to support the welfare state rather than than see it cut back. They said 'Yes,' then ensured that the party which advocated this policy was beaten for the fourth time in a row. The distinction of the better British papers is that they seek bad news from the four corners of the earth and have a vast corps of bad news specialists at their disposal. If you want a picture of how horrible things are in, say, Burma you have little choice but to skim through British newspaper cuttings. To be sure individual continental papers will do their best to cover such exotic matters - Le Monde and the Neue Zurcher Zeitung being the most notable - but only in Britain can you obtain a proper diversity of approach. And it is done with little attempt to tell readers why they should care. The British broadsheet assumes its readers want to be informed about events in Burma, even if not very often. In El Pais or La Repubblica, the reader would have to be told where Burma is, in Pravda, what it is. So if the Russian view is correct, the British not only have unusually catholic tastes, but their concern with others' problems must reflect the serenity of their national life. Maybe this is not as absurd as it might seem: the other impression I got from my trawl through other peoples' papers is that the mood they reflect is even more sour than that which reigns here.

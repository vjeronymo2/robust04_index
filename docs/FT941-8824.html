			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP slips Debate over whether or not the US is selling down its holding of British Petroleum continued to overhang the UK traded shares. BP failed to benefit from the general gains within the market and closed marginally lower at 366p. The company said a shift of 3.6m shares out of the US over the course of last week was minimal considering that it coincided with the company's results. However, at its morning meeting, stockbroker Nomura said the American Depositary Receipt holding in BP had dropped by 1.4 percentage points to 25.9 per cent over the past four months and technical position-taking by marketmakers meant the UK weighting could be substantially higher than the 74 per cent implied by the amount held in the form of ADRs. The conclusion is that UK institutions have a less pressing need to pick up BP stock than some might believe. High street banks received support from James Capel, with National Westminster the main beneficiary. The agency broker upgraded to buy from a hold and raised its 1994 profits forecast by Pounds 140m to Pounds 1.455bn. More significantly it has lifted its 1995 estimate by Pounds 269m to Pounds 1.859bn. The house believes NatWest's exposure to small businesses in the south of England will also be beneficial as economic recovery gathers pace. NatWest shares rose 8 before closing a net 4 up at 559p, with turnover heavy at 7.5m. Capel moved Abbey National to a buy from a hold and Barclays to a hold from a sell. Abbey rose 9 to 522p, while Barclays was flat at 583p. A Capel downgrade on HSBC was given further impetus by a weak Hong Kong market. The broker lowered its predictions to 1994 profits of Pounds 2.687bn, against Pounds 2.93bn previously, and to 1995 profits of Pounds 3.085bn, against Pounds 3.40bn previously, bringing them back to the middle of the range of analysts' estimates. HSBC fell 17 to 992p, while other Hong Kong related stocks, Standard Chartered and Cable and Wireless, retreated 16 to 1285p and 9 to 483p respectively. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson fell 16 to 652p ahead of full-year figures due today. Profits are expected to have at least doubled but the shares have run up sharply. Composite insurer General Accident recovered 21 to 681p after recent underperformance. SGST reiterated its buy stance on the stock. Insurance broker Willis Corroon was held back by US selling and dipped 6 to 209p. Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries slipped a penny to 497p after an insurance company managed by Farmers, its US subsidiary, said it would have to pay out about Pounds 400m in claims resulting from January's Californian earthquake. The release of the latest batch of retail sales figures provided inspiration for a variety of moves among stores stocks. The dip in clothing and footwear purchases was behind a retreat in Sears, off 1 1/2 at 121p, a lacklustre showing by Next, up 2 at 226p, Stylo, stuck at 249p, and Austin Reed, unchanged at 194p. But better mixed retail sales, up 0.3 per cent in January, helped several stocks, including Marks and Spencer, up 6 1/2 at 432 1/2 p. Great Universal Stores climbed 7 to 609p, encouraged by the latest statistics and underpinned by the current share buy-back story. Increased prescription charges lifted Boots and Lloyds Chemists 7 to 543p and 16 to 347p respectively. However, Kingfisher remained a weak market, slipping 3 to 634p. The stock has now declined 18 per cent in six weeks, as a bearish trading statement was compounded by concern over Darty, the French electrical retailer. The shares have been further unsettled by the resignation of Woolworth's managing director over the weekend. Independent oil and gas company Enterprise Oil eased 4 to 435p after NatWest Securities reiterated a warning that continuing low crude oil prices would make it difficult for the group to cover its dividend. Television company Yorkshire Tyne Tees, which has been heated up by bid speculation, came off the boil when some investors took profits and the shares fell 28 to 336p. Specialist engineering group James Wilkes, the subject of bid speculation in recent sessions, declined 6 to 176p after saying it was not in talks with stakeholder Suter, 2 ahead at 219p, or any other company. The conglomerate last week increased its holding in Wilkes by 8.7 percentage points to 29.53 per cent. APV put on 3 at 130p, with SG Warburg said to have recommended the stock. British Airways brushed aside Tuesday's downgrades that followed the release of third-quarter results. The shares bounced 6 to 479p. NatWest Securities reiterated its buy recommendation, saying: 'Continued cost control combined with rising load factors will result in rapid profits growth in future years.' Fears about the future of transport leasing group Tiphook saw the shares lose 4 more to 54p. Building and construction stocks were firm on the hope of interest rate cuts and reports of strong mortgage demand in January. Bid talk added flavour to the positive sentiment, with Wimpey, up 5 at 235p, mooted as a possible target. Building materials issues were strong, with Strauss Turnbull and UBS said to be behind the rise of Redland, ahead 8 at 600p. Rugby Group added 7 at 338p and Tarmac 8 at 194p, with Cazenove said to be pushing the latter.</p>

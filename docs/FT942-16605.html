			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Yeltsin spokesman flies G7 kite President Boris Yeltsin's spokesman, who has been known to announce foreign policy initiatives that are subsequently dismissed by the government, yesterday suggested linking Russia's joining Nato's Partnership for Peace with its admission to the Group of Seven. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov said he believed the military co-operation foreseen by Nato's partnership plan might be difficult without closer economic co-ordination between Russia and the world's seven richest industrialised nations. 'How can we talk about such co-operation, abstracting ourselves from economic co-operation?' he said. 'You know that Russia wants to join G7. Why shouldn't these two problems be linked? If we are invited to co-operate in political and military spheres, why shouldn't this be expanded to economic co-operation?' The G7 countries, all Nato members except Japan, have invited Kremlin chiefs to their summits in the last few years, but have stopped short of expanding G7 to include Russia. However, Mr Kostikov's demand that Russia be given G7 status appeared more of an effort to impress domestic opinion than a practical proposal. Mr Sergei Karaganov, a foreign policy expert and member of the president's advisory council, expressed surprise at Mr Kostikov's declaration. 'I do not believe that could be the official position of any relevant ministry or of the president's administration,' he said. Only a few weeks ago Mr Kostikov said that Russia might take six or seven months to sign up for Partnership for Peace, thereby risking embarrassing isolation as the odd man out after its neighbours had joined. But that statement has since been dismissed by the Foreign Ministry, which has suggested that Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, might sign as early as April 21. Mr Karaganov said that on that occasion Mr Kostikov had been trying, on his own initiative, to protect the Kremlin from possible new attacks from the conservative state Duma, which would use the Nato agreement as an excuse to denounce the president and the government. In a similar vein, Mr Kostikov yesterday suggested that the Partnership for Peace might not be signed by Mr Kozyrev, but by a lower-ranking official.</p>

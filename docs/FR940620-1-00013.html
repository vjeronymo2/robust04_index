February 11, 1993 Proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On February 11, 1993, EPA proposed a streamlined, reduced regulatory management structure for certain widespread hazardous wastes currently subject to full RCRA Subtitle C regulation, in an effort to facilitate their collection and proper management (58 FR 8102). The proposed reduced regulatory structure, known as a special collection system, is designed to ensure that management of these hazardous wastes is conducted in a manner that is protective of human health and the environment, given the diffuse and diverse population of generators of these wastes. Proposed regulatory language was included for hazardous waste batteries, and suspended and/or cancelled hazardous waste pesticides that are recalled. Several other wastes, including hazardous waste thermostats, were also discussed briefly in the preamble as possible additions to the special collection system. The Agency also included a proposed petition process to be used to add additional wastes to the special collection system in the future, and criteria to identify wastes that would be appropriate for addition. See 58 FR 8102, February 11, 1993 for a detailed discussion of the proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of Available Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the February 11, 1993 ``universal wastes'' proposal (58 FR 8126) the Agency committed to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Analyze the costs of the current regulatory requirements for generators and collection facilities and of the requirements [proposed]'';  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Analyze whether there are significant reduced environmental benefits from the modifications being proposed''; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Notice the analysis for comment prior to promulgating a final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The document made available for comment by this notice, ``Analysis of Potential Cost Savings and the Potential for Reduced Environmental Benefits of the Proposed Universal Wastes Rule,'' U.S. EPA, April 1994, presents these analyses. Part I of the document summarizes the proposed universal wastes regulations and introduces the analyses. Part II discusses and compares estimated costs of the existing Subtitle C regulations and of the proposed changes to these regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed regulations will result in total annual savings of approximately 93 million dollars. A sensitivity analysis is also included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part III of the document discusses whether the proposed regulatory changes will significantly reduce the environmental benefits provided by the current Subtitle C regulations. The conclusion of this analysis is that the proposed reduced regulations will not significantly diminish the environmental protection currently provided by the full Subtitle C regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is requesting comment on the methodology used and the results of both the cost analysis and the analysis of potential significantly reduced environmental benefits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Elliott P.

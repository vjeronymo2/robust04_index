			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / International Company News: First Chicago lifts profits to Dollars 179m FIRST CHICAGO, the mid-western US bank with Dollars 48.5bn of assets, yesterday unveiled first-quarter 1993 net profit of Dollars 179.1m (Dollars 1.97 per share), up significantly from the Dollars 86.8m (Dollars 1.08) earned a year ago. The first-quarter comparison is based on stripping out an extraordinary accounting gain a year ago that resulted from the valuation of venture capital investment securities. Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said core earnings were improving and noted that the burden of bad debts was decreasing as revenues increased. First Chicago also said it had entered an agreement with GE Capital during the quarter, under which it would sell up to Dollars 1bn of real estate loans for about Dollars 500m. Non-performing assets declined by 9 per cent to Dollars 377m during the first three months of 1993, while bad debt provisions were 44 per cent lower year-on-year at Dollars 65m. Net write-offs were Dollars 74m, of which commercial write-offs accounted for Dollars 46m and consumer write-offs Dollars 28m. Non-interest income rose by 29 per cent to Dollars 490.5m, while net interest income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 305m. First Chicago strengthened its capital position by issuing Dollars 200m of convertible preferred stock. The bank's Tier One risk-adjusted capital ratio - the ratio of capital to assets used by US regulators - stood at a healthy 7.7 per cent as at March 31. On Wall Street, First Chicago's share price declined by Dollars  1/4 to close at Dollars 43 5/8.</p>

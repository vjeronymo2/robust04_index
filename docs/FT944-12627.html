			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / ITV urges division of activities at BBC The independent television network has expressed concern about the potential conflict between the BBC's status as a publicly-funded body and its commercial interests. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of both the ITV Association and Central Television, said the association had stressed the need for the BBC to have 'a genuinely arm's length relationship between its public service activities and increasing commercial activities'. The concern was voiced in response to the white paper on the BBC. The paper recommended that the BBC should retain its status as a public service broadcaster while expanding its commercial activities. The ITV companies welcomed the decision that the BBC should continue to be funded chiefly by the licence fee, but warned of the need for transparency in its accounting procedures and activities such as programme sales. The Independent Television Commission will today invite applications for the Channel 5 licence. The licence was last advertised in 1992 but attracted only one bid.</p>

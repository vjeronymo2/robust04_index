			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / School inspectors' role may be changed THE GOVERNMENT yester-day ordered a review of the schools inspectorate which may lead to significant changes in its role, writes Andrew Adonis. Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, said the review would cover 'all possible options for an inspectorate capable of delivering an effective system of quality control'. Mr Eric Bolton, head of the inspectorate, will retire in August, and one of his deputies will be appointed temporary head until the review is finished. The inspectorate has often criticised the state of schools, and Mr Clarke was immediately attacked by the National Union of Teachers for 'punishing' the inspectorate for being 'too honest, too often'.</p>

Section 330.205 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;330.205 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Employment restrictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The restrictions in paragraph (b) of this section apply to the filling of all competitive service vacancies, regardless of whether an agency plans to make a temporary, term, or permanent appointment. This means an agency must consider RPL registrants for nonpermanent as well as permanent positions when they have indicated such interest on their RPL application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When a qualified individual is available on an agency's RPL, the agency may not make a final commitment to an individual not on the RPL to fill a permanent or temporary competitive service position by: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A new appointment, unless the individual appointed is a qualified 10-point preference eligible; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Transfer or reemployment, unless the individual appointed is a preference eligible, is exercising restoration rights under part 353 of this chapter based on return from military service or recovery from a compensable injury or disability within 1 year, or is exercising other statutory or regulatory reemployment rights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply to actions involving employees on an agency's rolls, as authorized below, or in filling a specific position: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) When all qualified individuals on the RPL decline an offer of a specific position or fail to respond to an official agency inquiry about their availability for it; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) By a current, qualified employee of the agency through: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Detail or position change (promotion, demotion, reassignment); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Conversion to competitive appointment of employees currently serving under appointments that carry a noncompetitive conversion eligibility (e.g., Veterans Readjustment Appointee, 30 percent disabled veterans, disabled employees under Schedule A appointment, Presidential Management Interns, cooperative education students under Schedule B appointment, and TAPERS); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Reappointment without a break in service to the same position currently held by an employee serving under a temporary appointment of 1 year or less (only to another temporary appointment not to exceed 1 year or less and not to a permanent appointment); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Extension of an employee's temporary appointment up to the maximum permitted by the appointment authority or as authorized by OPM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) By a 30-day special needs appointment or 700 hour temporary appointment of a severely disabled or mentally retarded individual, when the agency's staffing policies provide for these exceptions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) An agency must clear the RPL at the grade level at which it fills a position (regardless of the full performance level). Similarly, if an agency advertises a position at multiple grade levels, it must clear the RPL only at the grade level at which the position is ultimately filled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Once an agency has cleared its RPL and made a final employment commitment to an individual, the later registration of another employee on the RPL does not prevent the fulfillment of the original commitment, regardless of when the individual actually enters on duty. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

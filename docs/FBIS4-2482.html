			<p>BFN     [Text] Changsha, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Traffic on the  Xiangjiang River, a major waterway in central China's Hunan  Province, will soon increase greatly, in size and number.    Official sources here said that preparations have started to  make the 182 km section from Zhuzhou to Hengyang cities  navigable in all seasons for ships under 1,000 tons.    This requires the building of a dam 62 km from Hengyang, the  dredging of the 120-km river channel from the dam to Zhuzhou,  the building of six berths in the two river ports, and auxiliary  telecommunications and navigation facilities.    Feasibility studies to improve the water channel of the  river, a major tributary of the Chang Jiang River, was started  as early as 1986 by the State Council and the Hunan Provincial  Government.    The approved feasibility report proposed that the 439 km  section between Yueyang and Hengyang should be made navigable  for vessels up to 1,000 tons, through an investment of two  billion yuan.    The first phase of the work was finished some while ago,  resulting in the passage capacity being raised from 300 tons to  1,000 tons on the 257 km section from Yueyang to Zhuzhou.    The authorities believe that the project, a national model  work in improving inland waterways, will be of great  significance to the development of the many manufacturing  centers along the Xiangjiang River.</p>

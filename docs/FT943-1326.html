			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Watmoughs, the printing and binding company, has just announced interim results that were fairly strong and Patrick Walker, the chairman and chief executive, gave an up-beat statement reflecting improved demand. Following the announcement, he sold 19 per cent of his holding: 190,000 shares at 369p. He is left with more than 800,000. The considerable sale by John Haynes, chairman of Haynes Publishing, is a good example of how important it is to judge a share transaction in terms of the director's existing holding. Haynes holds about 60 per cent of the company, which is capitalised at Pounds 69m. His sale, therefore, represents only 1 per cent of his holding. Blenheim Group, the company that organises exhibitions and conferences, used to enjoy a golden spot in the market as its growth rocketed. But the momentum slowed and, over the past year, the stock has underperformed by 32 per cent. Since January, directors have been buying their own shares, and the most recent transaction is by chairman Neville Buch. He bought 15,000 ordinaries and 400,000 convertible cumulative preference shares to take his holding to more than 5,340,000 shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         No of Company              Sector      Shares    Value     directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Airsprung            HGod         9,000       24         1 Haggas (J)           Text        30,500        4         2 Haynes Publ          Mdia       100,000      445         1 Legal &amp; Gen          LifA         2,500       11         1 Lilleshall           BM&amp;M         7,500       11         1** Logica               SSer         3,750       12         1 Prov Financial       OthF         7,500       41         1 Ptarmigan Intl       InvT        50,000      120         1 Watmoughs            PP&amp;P       190,000      701         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES BET                  SSer        30,000       32         1 Berisford Intl       BM&amp;M        20,000       39         1 Blenheim (cu. cv. pf)  Mdia       423,000      315         2 Coutts Consulting    SSer        35,000       19         3 Eldridge, Pope A     Brew         6,324       13         2*** Filofax              OS&amp;B        20,000       42         1 Forth Ports          Tran         5,000       24         1 London Forfaiting    OthF       300,000      348         1 Mercury Ast Mgt      OthF        16,000      100         1 Nestor-BNA           Hlth        50,000       23         1 RIT Capital Ptnrs    InvT       250,000      470         1 Ryl Bk of Scotland   Bnks        11,810       49         1 Siebe                Eng          3,600       20         1 Willis Corroon       Insu        40,000       64         1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

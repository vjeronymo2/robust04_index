			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Time, gentlemen, to unravel the knot - Morland bid talks pose a heady problem NEWS THAT Morland, the Thames Valley brewer, is talking to potential bidders has focused attention on one of the most complex knots yet to be unravelled in the government's efforts to loosen the national brewers' hold on pub retailing. Whitbread, the national brewer and retailer, and the associated Whitbread Investment Company hold substantial stakes in five regional brewers and pub operators - Morland, Marston's, Brakspear, Devenish and Boddington. Maintaining these ties threatens Whitbread's competitive position; breaking them endangers the independence of the regionals. Whitbread still has 1,500 pubs from its own estate to lease or sell during the next seven months to comply with government orders. But it could be forced to release another 1,000 pubs from exclusive beer supplies because of the stakes it holds directly, and indirectly, through its 49.9 per cent interest in WIC, in the five regionals. Under the terms of the government orders, large brewery groups as well as individual brewers owning more than 2,000 pubs must free half of the pubs above that limit from tied beer supplies by November 1. The orders define a large brewery group as the combination of any one company with every other company in which it has a shareholding of 15 per cent or more. Whitbread's holdings in the regional brewers clearly put it at the head of such a grouping. It has a direct stake of 27 per cent in Brakspear, the Oxfordshire brewer, and an indirect stake of 21.8 per cent in Morland through WIC. A combination of direct and indirect holdings gives it effective interests of 21.6 per cent in Marston's and 16.8 per cent in Boddington. Unless these holdings are reduced to less than 15 per cent, Whitbread will have to count the pubs owned by the four companies, more than 1,800 in total, as part of its estate. It would then have to free a further 900 of its own pubs from the tie to satisfy the government orders. Further complications stem from the Office of Fair Trading's view that a second large brewery group exists with the Whitbread Investment Company at its head, since WIC holds 28.9 per cent of Whitbread's shares. WIC's 15.3 per cent stake in Devenish would then mean that Whitbread would have to free another 190 pubs - equivalent to half the Devenish estate. It seems unlikely that Whitbread will resolve the situation by freeing all these additional pubs. The market for pubs remains in the doldrums; at one London auction recently, only one of 19 lots was sold. Disposal of an extra 1,000 pubs would also leave Whitbread with a tied estate of a little over 3,000 pubs - less than three-quarters the size of the estates of Allied-Lyons, Bass and IEL, the GrandMet/Courage joint venture. Changes in the shareholdings are thus inevitable - with WIC, as well as Whitbread, forced to reduce its holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent. At present, the WIC stakes amount to 43.6 per cent of Morland, 33.1 per cent of Marston's and 23.6 per cent of Boddington. Simply selling excess shares in the market would pose problems for Morland, Marston's, and Brakspear. It would mean that 28.7 per cent of Morland's equity would be up for grabs. More than 18 per cent of Marston's shares and 12 per cent of Brakspear's would also be on offer. It seems safe to assume that all three are vigorously opposed to such a solution. Whitbread, too, would be loth to see blocks of shares placed with possible predators given its own substantial sales of Heineken and Stella Artois lagers to the three companies. Another way out of the dilemma would be for Whitbread, itself, to bid for one or more of the brewers. It already sells Marston's and Morland ales as part of its guest beer portfolio. 'The drawback to such a move,' says Mr John Spicer, analyst at Warburg Securities, 'is that it would incur significant costs - perhaps Pounds 34m for Brakspear, Pounds 250m for Marston's and Pounds 80m for Morland  - and could invite referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.' There is a bewildering range of other options. A transfer of shares between Whitbread and WIC would slightly reduce the number to be sold. That number would be reduced further if WIC cut its shareholding in Whitbread to 14.9 per cent. But Whitbread would be reluctant to have 14 per cent of its equity placed in the market. In theory, says Mr Spicer, the regional brewers could seek shareholders' approval to buy in some or all of the shares for disposal  - but the cost would be high and leave less money available for acquiring pubs. Rights issues by both Marston's and Morland could reduce the Whitbread and WIC holdings below the critical level, provided both refrained from taking up their rights. But again the scale of the issues would be a problem - and Morland made a Pounds 10.8m cash call only last June in which WIC took up its full entitlement. Whether intentional or not, the government orders have posed a problem which only a stroke of genius is going to resolve without leaving some, at least, of those involved poorer or weaker.</p>

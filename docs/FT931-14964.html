			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Drivers cool on rail-bus switch GOVERNMENT hopes that traffic congestion and environmental concerns might encourage car users, particularly commuters, to switch to public transport received a setback from a survey published yesterday. The annual Lex Report on Motoring says that even if rail privatisation achieves its objective of higher service standards, it will have little effect on car use and driving habits. The survey covering last year of more than 2,000 drivers found that a swing towards public transport in the late 1980s has been thrown into reverse. In the survey, only 35 per cent of respondents said they would use their cars less if public transport were better. London was an exception where 49 per cent said they would use public transport more. But company car drivers were less enthusiastic, with only 25 per cent prepared to consider switching. One in eight drivers said they would be more likely to use rail after privatisation. The survey highlights some of the effects of the recession on car ownership and maintenance. It helps to explain last year's steep slide in new car sales to non-business buyers and dealers' service business. Eighteen per cent said they had delayed purchasing a car, up from 16 per cent the previous year. Private buyers last year had kept their cars on average 4.4 years, up from 4.1 in the previous survey. About 13 per cent said they serviced their cars less frequently - that was partly offset by the 5 per cent who serviced their cars more frequently to keep them longer. Nearly 15 per cent sought cheaper ways of servicing. Lex Report on Motoring. Lex Service Corporate Communications Department, Lex House, 17 Connaught Place, London W2 2EL. Pounds 195.</p>

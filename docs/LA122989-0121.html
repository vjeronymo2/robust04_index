			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PARKING FEE NEEDS REVIEW  </P> <P> San Juan Capistrano's decision to impose a $2-a-day parking fee for Amtrak  commuters is shortsighted and could cost the city much more than it hopes to  earn.  </P> <P> In levying this local charge at the same time that the South Coast Air Quality  Management District is working to bring the county into compliance with federal  clean-air standards and transportation officials are promoting rail and bus  commuting, San Juan Capistrano is ignoring its local responsibility. The city  will pick up a few extra dollars, but San Juan Capistrano -- and the entire  area -- will pay a heavy environmental cost for every commuter who goes back to  the car and onto the freeway.  </P> <P> For years the 99 parking spaces at the depot have been free to commuters.  Starting Tuesday, those spaces will have a three-hour limit, and commuters will  be forced to use one of the 131 parking places set aside in a new parking  garage across from the depot. Those new parking spots carry a $2-a-day fee, a  charge sure to have an adverse effect on commuter train travel.  </P> <P> The use of the passenger trains running from San Diego to Los Angeles has been  growing each year, until it is now one of the most heavily traveled rail  corridors in the nation. San Juan Capistrano is a major station in the Amtrak  system, in terms of passenger loads. And all county transportation plans that  aim to get motorists out of their cars and into public transit rely heavily on  the train as a workable alternative, with San Juan as a vital link in the rail  park-and-ride system.  </P> <P> Other county cities with stops along the line -- Santa Ana, Anaheim and  Fullerton -- do not charge commuters for parking. San Juan Capistrano  shouldn't, either.  </P> <P> If it doesn't remove the fees entirely, it should at least sell monthly passes  to keep them within reason.  </P></p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: Employers must show enthusiasm for offering childcare facilities Sir, In your article, 'This little penny is for childcare' (June 9), it was ludicrous to suggest that a fair and rational approach to this highly topical and important issue would be to tax mothers (Yes] it would be mainly the women) for using workplace nurseries and use the revenue to provide better facilities. For two years now my company has funded and run its own workplace nursery, and the setting up of this by a medium-sized private company (the first to be opened in the north-west for many years) attracted the attention of the then secretary of state for employment, Michael Howard, who officially performed the opening ceremony. Consistently, all places have been taken and I must point out that our mothers do not have to 'drag' their children to work every day. They actually find it easy and convenient to have them looked after on the same premises where their children are in a happy and secure atmosphere. We also offer a number of places to other local companies to help ease the problems of finding affordable and accessible provision close to their place of work. We're not talking 'high-flyers' here, but ordinary working women and it would be sheer lunacy to impose even greater barriers preventing women taking their rightful place in the world of work by introducing tax burdens on childcare. The government has laid foundations by giving Pounds 45m to Training and Enterprise Councils for after school-care pilot schemes, so let's hope that more companies have the foresight to build on them to safeguard their chances of attracting the best employees in the future. We cannot expect the Treasury to keep providing funds without help and enthusiasm from employers.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Observer: Just desserts Whoever defined satire as 'the sour cream of wit' has been given the lie by the Californian arm of Ross Foods. It is lampooning the US political establishment with a box of assorted sweets. 'A government fit for human consumption]' it declares on the lid. The contents include: 'One nut-fudge president, one marshmallow vice-president, a filibuster of jelly bean senators, a caucus of gum- drop representatives, and a sprinkling of red-hot congressional companions' (appropriately cinnamon-flavoured). If any reader cares to suggest an alternative selection fitting the UK's administration, Observer will convey the idea to relevant manufacturers - besides awarding a bottle of malt whisky for the best- judged entry.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In statements to this station, Spanish Foreign  Minister Javier Solana has repeated his criticisms of the  leaders of the three warring factions in Bosnia who are making  the work of the UN blue helmets difficult.    Javier Solana said it is frustrating and a scandal to see  how  these political and military leaders disregard their own  citizens by hindering the arrival of aid the citizens need to  survive the severe winter.    The minister also referred to the visit his Algerian  counterpart, Mohamed Salah Dembri, is making to Spain. Algeria,  said Javier Solana, is a country going through severe political  and economic problems, as well as suffering from terrorist  violence. Algeria has a great potential; however, it needs help  to develop. Solana added that risks to Spanish companies and  citizens in Algeria have to be minimized.</p>

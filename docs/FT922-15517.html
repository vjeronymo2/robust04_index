			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Arts: The Wallace Collection - Music in London John Wallace is a cheerful Scot who plays the classical trumpet. He has been a Philharmonia principal for years, but also runs a sort of brass sewing-group, neatly called the 'Wallace Collection', and with them or solo he hunts up new music. In the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Monday, the group got together with the Philharmonia itself for a bracing programme. The first half was doubly perverse. Not only did it begin with Britten's all-strings Simple Symphony arranged for chortling brass and percussion (by Colin Matthews and Simon Wright), and a Gabrieli Sonata for five mixed-instrument choirs suavely arranged for 23 strings (by Wallace), but it required two long, fascinating ballets of stagehands to rearrange the seating for the different performing forces. The third work, Michael Torke's Copper with concertante brass quintet - a European premiere - showed Torke in typically buoyant form. Which is to say, not quite typical: nearly every piece by this young American composer slips a new device or two into his shiny but austere post-minimalist kit. In Copper there were vinegary new modulations, more intriguingly disruptive than before, and much off-beat interplay between quintet (heavy brass: two trumpets, horn, trombone and tuba) and orchestra. Also dewy Impressionist linkages from the strings, and shamelessly naff paragraph-ends by carolling woodwinds; and the usual Torke effect of tough musical muscle rippling beneath that slick surface. The muscle was what was missing in Tim Souster's 1988 Concerto for trumpet, live electronics and orchestra. That boasted a rich, eclectic panoply of sounds, with Hollywood-evocative aims confirmed by the taped wave-noises in its central 'Beach' movement (Dover Beach, as in Matthew Arnold), without any guiding musical idea. Though Wallace delivered his broken phrases in the first two movements with searching eloquence, the final 'Dawn' movement resorted to the merest Technicolor. Souster is an admirably unclassifiable composer, but he should leave this kind of thing to David Bedford, who does it with far greater conviction.</p>

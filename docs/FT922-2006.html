			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: P &amp; I case will be heard in UK THE STANDARD STEAMSHIP OWNERS' PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY ASSOCIATION (BERMUDA) LTD V GANN AND ANOTHER Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: June 5 1992 AN ENGLISH jurisdiction clause in the rules of a P &amp; I club constitutes an agreement between the club and its members to which the court will give effect unless there is good reason for not keeping the parties to their bargain; and where proceedings are begun in a competing jurisdiction, an English choice of law clause in the club rules is a significant factor in favour of England as the appropriate forum. Mr Justice Hirst so held when refusing an application by the defendants, Mr Edmund A Gann and Caribbean Marine Services Co Inc (CMS), to set aside Mr Justice Evan's order granting the plaintiff club, the Standard Steamship Owners' Protection and Indemnity Association (Bermuda) Ltd, leave to serve the proceedings on the defendants out of the jurisdiction. HIS LORDSHIP said that the club was a shipowners' mutual assurance association, which issued and provided insurance on the basis of its rules from year to year. Its claim, amounting to more than Dollars 1.8m, was for loss and/or damages arising from non-payment of supplementary calls and relief calls. It submitted those sums were due from the defendants. It alleged they were parties to the insurance policy. The defendants' case was that the parties to the policy were not the defendants, but individual shipowning corporations. Mr Gann was a US citizen resident in San Diego California. CMS was a Californian company based in San Diego. Mr Gann was beneficially interested in a number of individual corporations which owned vessels engaged in tuna fishing off the west coast of the US, managed by CMS. The defendants alleged those companies were the assured. Reference to the 'defendants' was without prejudice to that point. From 1983 onwards the defendants' P &amp; I risk business was insured by the club, following an approach from Lloyd's placing brokers instructed on the defendants' part by San Diego brokers. From 1987 the club made a number of supplementary calls on members. Also the defendants sold a number of their vessels and as a result the club claimed release calls in respect of the cessations. The claims were resisted by the defendants on various grounds, including the ground that the insurance was on a fixed premium basis, and that the club was not entitled to require them to meet supplementary or release calls. It was the defendants' case that in relation to that ground the club was unable to sustain an arguable case sufficient to justify maintenance of the order for service out of the jurisdiction. If they failed on that point, they submitted that San Diego, not London, was the forum conveniens (appropriate forum) for the proceedings. Rule 2(2) of the club rules provided that 'these rules and any contract of insurance between the association and an owner shall be governed by and construed in accordance with English law'. Rule 32(1) provided 'the owner hereby submits to the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice in England'. Mr Bueno for the defendants submitted that the burden was on the club to persuade the court to reach a tentative conclusion that it had a good arguable case. He was probably right. (See The Olib (1991) 2 Lloyd's Rep 108; Overseas Union Insurance v Incorporated General Insurance, FT, December 4 1991.) A telex dated November 17 1983 from the club to the defendants, stated 'it is not possible for us to offer owners a fixed premium quote'. The club had demonstrated a good arguable case on the merits on this point. Mr Bueno contended that the burden of proof was on the club to satisfy the court that England was clearly and distinctly the appropriate forum for trial of the action, relying on Spilidia (1987) AC 460. Were it not for the defendants' submission to the jurisdiction, that would be correct. But the authorities plainly established that the court would give effect to the jurisdiction clause, though still retaining a discretion to grant a stay if the defendants could show strong reasons against holding the parties to their bargain (Chaparral (1968) 2 Lloyd's Rep 158; El Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119). Mr Bueno invited the court to disregard or at least to attach very small weight to the jurisdiction clause, and argued it was one-sided. That submission was unacceptable in relation to a clause drafted in standard form typical of the rules of P &amp; I Clubs generally, where the member was both insurer and insured. Approximately three months after issue of the writ the two defendants together with all the individual vessel-owning corporations, issued proceedings in San Diego against the club, its management companies, and a number of other defendants including individuals who were executives in various broking firms. They sought declarations that they were not liable for the supplemental and release calls. Against the club and its managers, they sought damages for fraudulent misrepresentation; and against the brokers, damages for fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation, and for breach of duty. Mr Bueno submitted that the centre of gravity of the dispute was San Diego. He said the disputes must be looked at as a whole, and it was essential that they should all be tried in one action to avoid the risk of inconsistent decisions. For that purpose, he submitted that the San Diego action, in which the parties involved in all aspects of the dispute had already been joined, was the appropriate forum. He submitted that the English choice of law clause should be given little or no weight, since there were no difficult issues of English law which would appropriately be reserved for decision by an English court. He said the main area of dispute would be on issues of fact. That was not accepted. Serious questions of law would arise as to the relationship of principal, agent and sub-agent vis-a-vis the club. Those questions would turn on issues of principle and construction of documents. Construction of the documentary material was, as the authorities plainly showed (see The Magnum (1989) 1 Lloyd's Rep 47, 51), best undertaken by the English courts employing English law canons of construction. If the task were undertaken in San Diego the court, in applying English law, would need to rely on the expert evidence of English lawyers brought to California at considerable expense. That was a serious disadvantage. The English choice of law clause was a significant consideration in favour of English jurisdiction. The centre of gravity of the case was in London, not California, because: (i) On all main issues the crucial point of contact was in London between London brokers and the club. The witnesses relevant to those aspects were in London and the relevant documents would mainly be in London. (ii) The defendants' claims against third parties, which were by no means all London based, would only arise if the club succeeded in its claim. (iii) It seemed likely that the number of witnesses for each jurisdiction would be evenly balanced, and that the preponderance of documents would be in London. The crucial point was the risk of inconsistent decisions, which the court must strive earnestly to avoid (El Amria). There should be no difficulty, if the defendants chose to do so, in their joining the US third parties in the English proceedings as necessary and proper parties. The present action was in being for a considerable period before the defendants launched their San Diego proceedings, and it was their decision to sue in San Diego which created the possibility of a conflict. Those considerations, coupled with the conclusions that English choice of law and the English centre of gravity strongly favoured proceedings in England, led to the conclusion that the appropriate forum was London. For the club: Jonathan Gaisman (Richards Butler). For the defendants: Antonio Bueno QC and Robert Bright (Hill Taylor Dickinson).</p>

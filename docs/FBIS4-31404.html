			<p>BFN     [Text] The reputation of the UN forces engaged in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has plummeted to its lowest level due  to their incompetence, [word indistinct], and powerlessness to  stop the aggressor, will be increasingly more difficult to mend,  among other things, also because of the presenting of numerous  unsubstantiated justifications for the United Nations' passivity  on the ground in their addresses to the public, a statement by  the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says.    The 1st Corps points at, conditionally speaking, two  deceptions of the international public committed by UN spokesman  Major Rob Annink at a press conference. He tried to justify the  aggressor's attacks on the defense lines of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the region of Breza, Vares, and  Ilijas by the fact that neither the Bosnian nor the Serbian side  would allow them access to the critical areas and thus their  observers could only register explosions but could determine the  place from which projectiles had been fired. At the news  conference, Major Annink did not present the true reasons for  the lack of engagement by the UN forces. The true reason is  that the Chetniks do not allow the UN members to move along the  Temizovac-(?Trebnje) route, precisely because of the constant  offensives that they have been undertaking in this region. The  members of the Canadian Battalion justify their not going into  the field with the fact that the zone that they are supposed to  supervise is the responsibility of the French Battalion, which  has its headquarters in Sarajevo.    Because of such misinformation of the international public  and the open siding with the aggressor, the soldiers and the  officers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the territories of  Breza, Ilijas, and Vares favor Major Annink being proclaimed  persona non grata and being denied hospitality in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement by the Information Service of  the 1st Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL TO DISCUSS SUIT OVER DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council will hold a special meeting today to discuss and  possibly reconsider its recent decision to sue the Los Angeles County Board of  Supervisors to block a 2,555-unit housing tract in the Stevenson Ranch  development west of the city.  </P> <P> In an unusual move, Mayor Jo Anne Darcy called the meeting so the council can  discuss the potential impact of a lawsuit, particularly on plans by the Newhall  School District to build schools near the proposed development.  </P> <P> The meeting will be held at 4 p.m. in the council chambers at City Hall.  </P> <P> In return for county approval of its project, Dale Poe Development Corp. has  promised to donate a 13-acre school site and $2.4 million to the school  district. School officials have said they are concerned that a lawsuit could  delay construction of new schools in the fast-growing district.  </P> <P> The council voted to file the lawsuit last week on grounds that the  environmental impact report for the project was inadequate.  </P> <P> The lawsuit will be discussed in closed session.  </P> <P> In the public portion of the meeting, the council will review its recent  appointments to the Parks and Recreation Commission. The council has come under  fire for using a numerical ranking system to make appointments. Critics said  the system unfairly led to the ouster of incumbent Laurene Weste, who was the  only commissioner not reappointed this month.  </P></p>

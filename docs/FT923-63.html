			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Referendum uncertainty puts pressure on Canadian bond prices CANADIAN government bond prices dropped 1 1/4 points yesterday, as the Canadian dollar came under fire in the foreign exchange markets. The currency fell below key resistance levels against the US dollar, following pressure during re-cent trading sessions, and suffered against the yen, prompting some Japanese investors to sell Canadian bonds. Fears about the outcome of the October 26 referendum on a package of constitutional measures have contributed to volatile conditions in Canada's financial markets. Yesterday, opposition leaders criticised Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for causing panic on financial markets with warnings that Canada could break apart if the No side wins the national unity referendum. Support for the package has slipped since the deal was struck a month ago, according to recent polls. The bond market was further undermined by concern about the reception of yesterday's CDollars 1.5bn government bond auction. GERMAN bond prices ended slightly higher in thin trade yesterday. Activity was concentrated in the German money market where the government both drained and added liquidity in different areas of the market, prompting continued confusion over the Bundesbank's intentions over interest rates at Friday's council meeting. However, the strength of the D-Mark, combined with growing fears over the German economy, may tip the scales in favour of a rate cut, according to some analysts. Speculation that the fluctuation band between the D-Mark and the French franc will be tightened is encouraging hopes of an interest rate cut, which would help support the franc. The German bund futures contract on Liffe ended at 90.50, up from 90.34 at Monday's close. FRENCH government bonds ended  3/4 point lower, as hopes that France would join a fast-track to monetary union faded. High money market rates continued to hamper activity in the bond market, where it is now very expensive to finance trading positions. The market has also become rather nervous about the French government's 1993 budget plans and the monthly auction of bonds later this week. GILT prices recouped earlier losses to end the day virtually unchanged, as the market continued to trade nervously within a fairly narrow range. Comments by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, suggesting that sterling's weakness would not leave room for further substantial rate cuts, helped depress sentiment. The market 'is still reorganising itself' in the wake of sterling's suspension from the ERM two weeks ago, according to Mr John Kendall, an economist at Baring. Nevertheless, expectations of some reduction of interest rates in the near future continue to benefit the short end of the market, while longer-dated bonds have steadied. The long gilt futures contract on Liffe ended at 97.17, slightly lower than Monday's close of 97.21. JAPANESE government bonds rallied again yesterday as the yen continued to strengthen against the US dollar. However, worries that the government may issue deficit-financing bonds pulled both the cash and futures market down late in Tokyo trading and the market closed lower on the day. The yen reached a high of 119.38 to the dollar in Tokyo trading, and climbed further to reach 119.10 to the dollar in the London session. The strength of the Japanese currency has revived hopes recently of an easing in interest rates, pushing up bond prices. The futures contract, which opened at 106.62, reached a high of 106.75 on the yen's strength. However, shortly before the market was due to close, a Japanese news service reported that the government would probably have to issue deficit-financing bonds. Dealers said the reports pushed bond prices down and the futures contract closed at 106.52. Deficit-financing bonds are issued specifically to finance deficit spending in excess of revenue. Traders said some of the selling at the end of the session may have been hedging ahead of today's expected Y800bn auction of 10-year bonds. US Treasury prices eased slightly across the maturity range yesterday, despite further bad news on the economy. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  9/32 at 98 19/32 , to yield 7.361 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly weaker, down  3/32 at 100 13/32 to carry a yield of 3.804 per cent. The day's figures continued to paint a bearish picture of economic conditions. The Conference Board's survey of consumer confidence fell from 59.0 in August to 56.4 in September, the third straight monthly fall and a worse figure than analysts expected, while the leading index of economic indicators fell 0.2 per cent in August. Although both sets of data increased the chances that the Federal Reserve may ease monetary policy again, possibly after Friday's employment report, investors are cautious about pricing an interest rate cut into the market.</p>

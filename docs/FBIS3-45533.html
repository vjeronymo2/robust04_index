Located in Qingyuan City in central Guangdong, the Qingyuan  Experimental Economic Development Zone last year had a total of  some 1.6 billion yuan in investment, 48 percent of which was  investment from overseas.    Construction of 42 projects started last year after the  inauguration of the zone, which covers an area of 9.6 sq [square  km.] Twenty-nine of the projects became operational the same  year, producing a total of more than 300 million yuan in  industrial output value.    To date, the zone has provided jobs to more than 1,000  people  from the relatively poor counties and towns around the city.    This year the zone envisages employing in stages more local  people from such areas of the province.    According to a zone executive, the service industries in the  zone are gaining increasing development momentum.    He said a 28-story building is under construction in the  zone  and is expected to be the zone's center of finance, stocks,  futures and science and technology. A series of high-rise  buildings, meanwhile, are planned for this year.    Experts hold that the zone has, in addition to greatly  promoting local economies, also set a good example for poor  areas across the country to shake off poverty in a faster way.    The impact and influence of the zone has been felt in a wide  area of China, with similar zones blueprinted in the Tibet  Autonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region as well  as Hunan, Guizhou, Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces.</p>

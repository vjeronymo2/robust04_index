			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLERS: NEW IN APRIL  </P> <P> Competence, yes. Professionalism, of course. But there's the mysterious other  ingredient -- the flair -- that spells the real difference. This is what  separates the writer of popular fiction who commands the high-six-figure  advances from the rest of us. But whether the flair evolves gradually over a  number of works or whether it bursts into full flower on the strength of one or  two novels is the eternal fascination. And the current crop is an interesting  balance of old hands, and relatively new ones, with the flair already firmly in  place.  </P> <P> After a six-year silence, fans of Arthur Hailey should be happy to see the  meticulous researcher/storyteller back in harness with The Evening News  (Doubleday: $21.95; 576 pp.). Just as "Airport," "Hotel" and "Wheels" stripped  the mystery away from the air travel, hotel and automotive industries, so does  Hailey's latest novel take us behind the scenes of a major television network  news operation at a time of both internal and external crisis.  </P> <P> In today's society where a network anchorman may have a greater name, and face,  recognition than most international political leaders, the plight of cool and  heretofore unflappable Crawford Sloane when terrorists zero in on his family  makes for high drama. Calling upon long-time colleague and ace war  correspondent Harry Partridge for assistance may be the most natural thing in  the world, but it's sticky, too -- the two men are not only on-again,  off-again, rivals for precious air time since they covered Vietnam together,  but the terrorist attack on Sloane's family focuses on the lovely Jessica,  Sloane's wife and Partridge's one-time lover (and still, at least with  Partridge, a delicate and sensitive issue).  </P> <P> As CBA-TV News throws its worldwide resources into the seemingly  needle-in-a-haystack search for the terrorist-kidnapers, strains within the  organization, newly acquired by an international conglomerate, also reach the  breaking point as the power-hungry, hard-as-nails, president of the network,  Margot Lloyd-Mason, weighs human lives against the parent firm's global  financial interests and -- as is usual with her -- opts for the bottom line.  </P> <P> Flitting between New York and its suburbs and the steamy jungles of Peru, "The  Evening News" is a fast-paced, hide-and-seek story as the CBA-TV news team  finds itself fighting terrorists who are every bit as faceless as, and only  slightly less treacherous than, the corporate villains undermining the team's  effort from within. A few loose ends are never quite resolved, but the climax  in "The Evening News" is a dandy. The novel is a Literary Guild Main Selection.  </P> <P> What did poor old, much-maligned Hollywood do to deserve the barbed attention  of Judith Rossner? In His Little Women (Summit Books: $19.95; 366 pp.),  Rossner, probably best remembered for her moody exploration of self-destruction  in "Looking for Mr. Goodbar," turns a jaundiced eye on Tinsel Town as  exemplified by producer Sam Pearlstein and his four daughters by three  different wives as they vie for their easily distracted father's attention.  </P> <P> But the focal point is the love-hate relationship between the two oldest  daughters, the irreverent, rowdy and talented Louisa and Nell, a lawyer and her  father's favorite (when it occurs to him to have a favorite). At the heart of  the matter is Louisa's best-selling novel about a Hollywood producer, a book  that triggers a libel suit that threatens the Pearlsteins' fortunes and prompts  Nell, via "His Little Women," to write her own version of what really happened.  </P> <P> Alternately brittle and tongue-in-cheek, Rossner has many wise things to say  about the offhandedness of love and family relationships in Hollywood; about  the hedonism that surrounds the movie industry, and about the practice of law  when the throats of the rich and famous are on the chopping block. Rossner's  novel is a Literary Guild Main Selection.  </P> <P> For an almost jarring change of pace -- as far away from Hollywood,  geographically, as you can get and even further away in casting -- turn your  attention to Ya Ding's absorbing story of life during Chairman Mao's Cultural  Revolution, The Earth Sings, translated by Jon Rothschild (Harcourt Bruce  Jovanovich: $21.95; 224 pp.). A best- seller in France, where the young Chinese  novelist now lives, "The Earth Sings" is a slice of life in rural China as seen  through the eyes of 9-year-old Liang, a bright little boy with infinite faith  in his family and a beguiling acceptance of that family's dedication to the  harsh Communist doctrines laid out in Mao's Little Red Book.  </P> <P> Ardent Communists themselves, Liang's young parents are dispatched from Beijing  to a primitive peasant village to "modernize" it -- a neat trick, as the "old  ways" -- reverence for ancestors, superstitions and ceremonies -- clash with  Mao's teachings. Rebelling, subtly, while at the same time appearing to  conform, the villagers are hard nuts to crack and, as was apparently par for  the course during the Cultural Revolution, Liang's father ultimately falls from  grace with the party leadership and is jailed.  </P> <P> When the father ultimately is freed, the family trudges on with even fewer  possessions to even poorer villages, still spreading Mao's word. It is a  touching story of old and new beliefs clashing in an exercise of what history  later demonstrated was a political tilting at windmills that was doomed from  the beginning.  </P> <P> "Sweeping" is the first adjective that comes to mind with Michael Petersons' A  Time of War (Pocket Books Hardcover: $19.95; 580 pp.). This big novel, while  going over ground that has become familiar -- the Vietnam War -- may have put  that sad conflict into clearer perspective than most, if not all, of its  predecessors.  </P> <P> This is the story of Bradley Marshall, a personal "ambassador" of beleaguered  Lyndon B. Johnson, sent to Vietnam in '67 and '68 to find some graceful way out  of that mess. What Marshall uncovers, alas, is what most of us now concede was  the true horror of that war: treachery rampant among political factions within  our own government and among hangers-on from the days of French rule; the  cynical buying and selling of information and misinformation; the numbing  lethargy of American officers become hardened to the task of sending their  young wards into suicidal engagements that they know are suicidal.  </P> <P> Peterson's story, which some reviewers have compared -- and not inappropriately  -- to Norman Mailer's "The Naked and the Dead" and Herman Wouk's "The Winds of  War," is a sprawling and compelling narrative that blends fiction with such  real-life players of the era as L.B.J. and Gen. William Westmoreland. But as  fiction alone, "A Time of War" is a blood-chilling adventure story.  </P> <P> As our protagonist, Marshall, finds himself the target of forces within Vietnam  who know his mission and who know that only his elimination can assure  continuation of the deadly, hypocritical, game of the no-win war. Locales range  from the Oval Office through the jungle outposts of Khe Sanh to the squalor of  Saigon's Chinese quarters in this brilliant second effort by the author of  1983's "The Immortal Dragon."  </P> <P> In a popular fiction field that teeters on the brink of overkill in the  international-intrigue department, it is refreshing to pick up a new work that  reminds us of how it should be done. Enter Robert Ludlum's The Bourne Ultimatum  (Random House: $21.95; 640 pp.).  </P> <P> What separates successful international intrigue from its imitators are the  characters -- living and breathing heroes and villains alike, with whom we  instantly relate. The art of the craft, as Ludlum once again demonstrates, is  not only the step-by-step progression of many characters but the delineation of  each, so he remains indelibly etched in our memory even as the plot speeds on.  </P> <P> This, of course, is the third Bourne novel ("The Bourne Identity" and "The  Bourne Supremacy" preceding it), and we pick up Prof. David Webb, staid and  proper family man, comfortably ensconced in academia when, abruptly, he finds  himself once more thrust into his old role in Vietnam and Hong Hong as the  assassin Jason Bourne. It's a wrenching return for a middle-aged university  professor, but since the evil apparatus, Medusa, and his archenemy Carlos are  hell-bent on one last extermination effort, it is a matter of pure survival --  and are those now-aging muscles and reflexes up to the task?  </P> <P> "The Bourne Ultimatum" dances from Washington to the Caribbean to Europe and  Russia, and in the pulse-tingling style that began so many years ago with "The  Scarlatti Inheritance," we are caught up irretrievably.Michael Peterson on the  DMZ in 1968.ONOFRIO PACCIONE  </P></p>

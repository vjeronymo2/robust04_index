			<p>BFN     [Text] Cape Town May 25 SAPA -- President Mr Nelson Mandela  held his first meeting with the nine provincial premiers on  Wednesday. He is also due to meet Conservative Party [CP]  leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg at midday and Freedom Front leader  Gen Constand Viljoen later in the day.    Emerging from his official Tuynhuys offices flanked by the  nine premiers and second deputy president Mr F W de Klerk, Mr  Mandela said there was a need for him and the provincial leaders  to exchange views. "We will listen to people ourselves; our  style is one of intensive consultation. The agenda is going to  come from such meetings," Mr Mandela said.    An earlier statement from the Tuyhhuys said the meeting with  the premiers would include matters such as the relationship  between the central government and the provincial  administrations, and relevant constitutional matters. Also of  importance were the implementation of programmes for  reconstruction and development.    Mr Mandela, who is to meet Dr Hartzenberg about midday at  his  official residence Westbrooke, said he was due to meet Gen  Viljoen later on Wednesday. This followed their meeting on  Friday and another between Mr de Klerk and the Freedom Front  leader. Mr Mandela said he was prepared to listen to Gen  Viljoen in what he called a preliminary discussion.    The Conservative Party had also indicated it wanted to raise  certain issues with the government, including the question of  amnesty of 32 Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement] members implicated in pre-election bomb blasts. Other  CP concerns included a licence for Radio Pretoria and the  question of the "volkstaat" [Afrikaner homeland].</p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: UBS launches kinegram gold bars Union Bank of Switzerland, one of the leading suppliers of small gold bars to the retail market, has launched a new line of bars designed to foil the forger and tamperer, and attract new custom to the lacklustre gold trade. The bars feature a highly complex, multi-coloured hologram-like pattern on one face. The recently developed technology, called kinegram, is used on some banknotes and security documents and is virtually impossible to copy. The kinegram is very sensitive to disturbance. Anyone attempting to take some of the gold out of a small bar and substitute tungsten or another similarly dense metal would cause a distortion to the pattern that would be visible to the naked eye.</p>

			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / City investigation brings invisible threats into view: Robert Peston on a detailed inquiry into the Square Mile THE City of London's international trade in financial services, known as 'invisibles', is being threatened by deficiencies in the 'invisible infrastructure', according to an exhaustive investigation called the City Research Project. The invisible infrastructure is the system of regulating and policing the City: the regulatory authorities and the legal structure. Professor Richard Brealey, who led the London Business School team commissioned by the Corporation of London to write the report, identifies a number of possible 'invisible' threats to the City. One is the proliferation of official bodies with an interest in the development of financial markets. Where 15 years ago the Bank of England and the Stock Exchange had a virtual monopoly between them over regulation and the business of sponsoring the City's growth, they now face challenges from the Securities and Investments Board, the four self-regulatory organisations, the Treasury, the Office of Fair Trading and the Department of Trade and Industry. Prof Brealey believes that the lack of a 'single or co-ordinated focus on London's international competitive position' is an obstacle to collective action to correct any perceived trouble in the City. On the other hand, he agrees that the creation of a 'super-authority', combining all regulatory and sponsoring powers, would not necessarily be the best solution. Such a body would be huge and unwieldy. The report, the brainchild of Mr Stanislas Yassukovich, the investment banker and former chairman of what was then called The Securities Association, contains an extensive list of potential difficulties for the City but has an almost total absence of solutions. A programme of action may in time be drafted. The interim report published yesterday was the result of six months of interviews with 200 City figures and the distillation of thousands of pages of statistics. Prof Brealey has another 2 1/2 years of research ahead of him. Another invisible threat is the imposition of new regulations on the London market in the form of European Community directives. In that case, the EC-wide rules may not be sensitive enough to the particular needs of Europe's most sophisticated markets in London. For example, the costs of underwriting equities in London may rise - albeit less than originally feared - after the agreement last month of a new capital adequacy directive. Prof Brealey is less pessimistic about London's more visible ills, such as its ageing and congested transport system. 'There is no clear evidence that this is having a significant current effect on the City' he says. Similarly, although City salaries are higher than those in Paris and Frankfurt, he tentatively suggests they are justified by the apparently superior productivity of City staff. Prof Brealey defines an international financial centre as having two characteristics: a relatively high level of cross-border transactions and a concentration of offices of foreign financial institutions. On that definition, London is the world's biggest international financial centre - as distinct from being the world's biggest financial centre, since the domestic business carried out in New York and Tokyo far outstrips London's. The greatest concentration of financial employment in the world is also found in London, the report says. Department of Employment figures show that 620,000 people worked in finance and business services there in 1989, about 100,000 more than in New York. London also has the greatest number of foreign banks of any financial centre. Even in 1991, a year of recession in banking, 31 new banks opened a London office and 15 banks departed. There was a net loss of US banks from London, but they were replaced by Japanese and Continental ones. There may be little sign of banks leaving London, but other centres are attracting new banks in greater num-bers. At the same time, London's large share of total international bank lending is declining slightly, according to figures from the Bank for International Settlements, the international forum of bank regulators. Nonetheless, if foreign lending to domestic residents is excluded, London is the largest international banking centre with a 16 per cent share, compared with 15 per cent for Tokyo. One of the report's more surprising conclusions is that London's biggest business by a wide margin is in foreign-exchange dealing. Prof Brealey has for the first time tried to compare the gross revenues generated by different financial services, although his attempts have been hampered by the paucity of reliable data and the complete absence of statistics on some newer financial products, such as swaps and derivatives. Although he admits that his preliminary figures may need revision, he believes the comparative positions of the 11 financial services shown in the table are broadly accurate. The gross revenues include commissions, fees and 'spreads' on trading and lending activities - the difference between buying and selling prices - but take no account of a business's overheads, or profits and losses made from investments. Even so, the banking sector's importance to London is demonstrated clearly, given that foreign-exchange trading and international bank lending are respectively the top two earners in the City. International insurance, dominated by the Lloyd's insurance market, comes in third place, although Prof Brealey's colleague, Ms Jenny Ireland, points out that earnings from that source have been declining. Given the relative importance of foreign-exchange trading to London, any move towards monetary union in the EC would have profound effects for London. Prof Brealey, however, does not believe the disappearance of trade in sterling, francs and other European currencies would be too damaging. For all that, it is clear why the government attaches great importance to the location of a European central bank or its money-market dealing arm in London. The rewards for the City of being the dealing centre for a unified European currency could be huge. City Research Project Interim Report. Corporation of London, London EC2.</p>

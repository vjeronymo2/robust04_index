			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Markets: An exclusive club that no-one wants to join - The Bottom Line INVESTORS in British Steel have had to endure some heavy blows over the past year, and none could have been remotely surprised this week to have found themselves joining an exclusive, but unenviable, club. As workers at the Ravenscraig steel works in Scotland contemplate redundancy, British Steel's 307,000 shareholders - including 300,000 individuals - have joined the handful of privatisation investors to suffer a dividend cut. On Monday, the steelmaker reduced its final pay-out from 5.75p a share to 1.5p, and announced a Pounds 55m pre-tax loss. It is all so different from 1989, when booming market conditions - and profits - lifted the shares from the 1988 flotation price of 125p to a peak of 159p. Last night, the shares closed at 64p, having touched a post-privatisation low of 52p earlier in the week. Investors do not need reminding that British Steel is caught in one of the deepest recession experienced by the industry worldwide. The reasons are well-known - severe downward pressure on prices caused by falling demand and overcapacity, growing pressure on EC markets caused by imports from eastern Europe, increasing foreign competition. In the second half of last year, the share price took all this on board with a vengeance - plunging by nearly 20 per cent on November 11 when the company warned about the level of its final dividend and looked ahead gloomily on business prospects. 'Clearly, the shares have been a disappointing investment,' says Ian Lowe of Smith New Court. 'They have underperformed the market by more than 50 per cent over the past year.' Remarkably, though, things could have been even worse this week. The Pounds 55m loss may represent a dramatic fall from 1990/91 profits of Pounds 254m, but was smaller than virtually anyone in the City had expected. And, despite hints to institutions that they could expect a 1.5p final dividend, there was still some relief that the pay-out was not omitted entirely. This is the heart of the matter for investors. After the fall in the share price, and with 70 per cent of the shares held by income funds, the share has become a yield stock. Passing the dividend would have risked seriously alienating the City, and - quite rightly - British Steel does not want totally to discourage its shareholders. Even so, it is making no bones about the uncertainty of economic recovery, and the consequential effects on future dividends. Restoring levels of profitability even to support the reduced dividend will depend on an increase in steel prices, along with benefits from further cost reductions. According to Andy Chambers of Nomura Research Institute, there is nothing in terms of demand and supply for steel that indicates conditions will improve quickly. So what should shareholders do now? 'The time to sell was probably three weeks ago when the price was 85p,' says Chambers. In the short-term, he cannot see the shares going anywhere, one way or another. Looking further ahead, he predicts a pre-tax loss of Pounds 50m this year, but says the company will still be only 10-20 per cent geared at the year-end. One clue to the immediate future for the share price might come from events this week. US buying has lifted the shares from their 52p nadir, says Lowe, with investors assessing British Steel's peak profits in the next cycle and concluding that the company is between 20-100 per cent undervalued. Lowe feels the share price could come under further pressure, adding that a further dividend cut is 'very likely.' Lowe's relatively pessimistic analysis of British Steel's future cash generation abilities prompts the suggestion that the company should consider fostering the idea of a US-style 'dividend cycle', linking the payout to the ebb and flow of profits. One wonders whether UK investors would wear it.</p>

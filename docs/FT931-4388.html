			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: 'The Women of Trachis' and 'The Frogs' - Theatre Fifth century Athens arrives at the Oxford Playhouse with Sophocles' Trachiniai in Greek and Aristophanes' Frogs in English. The Oxford University Drama Society production deftly puts these round plays into a square theatre: both plays benefit, and both illuminate the Greek stage. The Trachiniai (c. 450BC) tells of Herakles' death: he puts on a robe inadvertently drenched in poison by his wife Deianira, and dies horribly after she kills herself in remorse. The director Alex Walker, with University advisers David Raeburn and Oliver Taplin have compromised between Athenian simplicity and contemporary convenience. The production shows how significant action is recoverable from the words of the plays. There are no masks, and the gestures are naturalistic rather than formulaic, but the foreignness keeps chorus and actors separate and separated. Non-Greek speakers have to rely on the chorus, sensing the modulation of their voices and tracing their interaction with the major characters. The choric episodes use a variety of music, rhythmic verse-speaking. So exits, entrances, actions, gestures, objects, tokens, silences and sequences become more important when the language itself is occluded. The actors - in particular Alice de Smith (Deianira), Robert Lloyd-Parry (Herakles) and Sara Kalim (Chorus leader) - speak with easy fluency, making the emotion of each interchange live in their speech and movement. After the enervating sight of Herakles screaming from his funeral pyre on Mount Oeta, the evening offers Aristophanes' Frogs (405BC). While Sophocles is structured and abstract, Aristophanes is chaotic and tangible. He brings out the worst in others. Swift was caught with the howler 'Aristophanes . . . Too bawdy and profane is'; and the Frog chorus sent 19th-century Hellenic scholarship in search of authentic 'Brekekekex ko-ax ko-ax' frog calls in the inland waters of Greece. Here, Frogs has been boldly modernised, keeping to the spirit of Aristophanes' scatological, political and literary humour. The god of theatre, Dionysus, despairs of 'new writing' and heads to Hades for more of the old. The action centres on a debate in hell between Aeschylus and Euripides ('How dare you put me in a proscenium arch'), the first a fruity Thespian and the second a thin deconstruction worker. The surrounding chorus comprises journalists, the principals are politicians, and the boring boatman to hell - who takes Deutschmarks only - a good stab at John Major. Out in the Styx means rap singing, Camillagate sound-bites and a quorum of transvestite judiciary. But the denizens of hell do dance the salsa, a fact which Virgil and Dante have concealed long enough. Oxford Playhouse until March 13</p>

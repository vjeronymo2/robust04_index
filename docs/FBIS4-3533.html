			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 21 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic today proposed a complete cease-fire and  disengagement of forces in Bosnia to make the entire Bosnia a  UN- designated safe area and thus create conditions for peace  talks.    A complete halt to hostility is the only way out for the  Bosnia crisis, as only cease-fire can lead to a political  settlement and end the Bosnia war, Karadzic said in letters to  the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.    He pointed out that the Serb proposal is aimed at securing  peace in the former Yugoslav republic, adding that it is now the  best time for resolving the Bosnia crisis once and for all.    Serbs have announced unilateral cease-fire, but Muslims do  not intend to do the same, the Serb leader noted.    Karadzic stressed that the attempt of the international  community to realize a military balance on the Bosnian  battlefield could reach nowhere but to prolong the war, and so  would the new plan proposed by the United States, which he  described as "completely wrong."    U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Wednesday three  steps which he said would help reach a negotiated settlement in  Bosnia. The steps include extending NATO air strike threats  against Serbs to UN-declared safe areas to halt Serb attacks,  tightening economic sanctions on Serbia and supporting UN  humanitarian aid to the Muslim enclave of Gorazde and more UN  peacekeepers in Bosnia.</p>

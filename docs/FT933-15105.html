			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Stratagem to acquire Harrison Industries STRATAGEM, which is engaged in computer maintenance, retail car sales and runs an investment portfolio, has agreed terms for the acquisition of Harrison Industries. The share exchange basis values Harrison at Pounds 7.4m with a cash alternative at Pounds 5.1m. Stratagem has been seeking a presence in the manufacturing sector since 1991 and feels Harrison, which makes industrial and domestic garage doors and related equipment, will benefit from added financial resources and a further strengthening of management. After several years of losses at Harrison it believes there is considerable scope for recovery. To help meet the cash alternative and fund working capital requirements of the enlarged group, Stratagem is raising Pounds 7.9m net in a placing and open offer, which shareholders can take up on the basis of 9-for-10 at 125p per share. Yesterday the shares rose 5p to 142p. Terms of the acquisition are one Stratagem share for every 23 in Harrison, valuing each Harrison at 5.96p against 5p in the market on Thursday. The cash alternative is worth 4.1p. Stratagem already owns 25.07 per cent of Harrison and has received undertakings which will bring its holding up to 50.12 per cent. The acquisition and placing shares will represent 59 per cent of the enlarged capital and approval of Stratagem shareholders will be needed. A month ago Stratagem reported a turnround from losses of Pounds 221,000 to profits of Pounds 272,000 for the half year ended February 28 1993. Yesterday, Harrison announced a loss of Pounds 3.82m for the year ended March 31 1993 against a deficit of Pounds 908,000 for the previous 15 months, which included a Pounds 1.2m provision for reorganisation in industrial doors and a Pounds 900,000 property write-down. Industrial doors, architectural ironmongery and builders' hardware companies, which represented more than 60 per cent of turnover of Pounds 51.4m, suffered from greatly reduced activity levels.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Birmingham's engine room is slowing down: Paul Cheeseright reports on the changing face of employment along the M6 THE troubles at Daf, the UK-Dutch vehicle maker, have raised fears for the future of the company's van plant in an area once considered the engine room of Birmingham. Yesterday, 589 of the Washwood Heath plant's workers were made redundant. 'We always viewed Leyland Daf as a jewel in terms of east Birmingham, acting as a focus to encourage continued development and growth,' said a Birmingham Training and Enterprise Council official. Leyland Daf and its predecessor companies, working at Washwood Heath since before the second world war, gave substance to the boast that the area, covering the wards of Aston, Nechells, Small Heath and Washwood Heath, was 'the engine room' of Birmingham. This engine room, visible on both sides of the M6 as the motorist approaches Spaghetti Junction from the south, works more slowly these days. Companies such as Ansells brewery, TI Tubes and GKN Automotive have long left. But large employers remain, including BTR with its aircraft tyre plant, British Gas, British Steel, SP Tyres, GEC Alsthom at the old Metro-Cammell railway equipment plant, HP Sauce, IMI which manufactures, among other products, titanium and explosives, and Jaguar Cars. Employment patterns have changed with manufacturing techniques and markets. More than 20,000 worked at IMI during the second world war. Now there are 1,600. In January 1988, Jaguar had 2,200 hourly paid workers and 360 staff - in January this year it had 850 hourly paid workers and 230 staff. At British Steel's seamless tubes plant, 400 people work where 500 did five years ago. There are exceptions - GEC Alsthom, just across the road from Leyland Daf, has 1,200 employees compared with 400 five years ago - but the employment trend has been downwards. Half the jobs in the Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation area, more than 2,000 acres of east Birmingham, disappeared between 1978 and 1988. Loss of employment in large groups has been offset by the arrival of smaller companies. But national economic growth during the 1980s left east Birmingham behind. In November 1989, just before the resent recession pushed up unemployment, the jobless levels in the four wards was between 13.1 per cent in Washwood Heath and 22.1 in Aston - the national average was 5.7 per cent. Unemployment levels today are between two and three times the national average - 22.1 per cent in Washwood Heath, 25.7 per cent in Small Heath, 28.5 per cent in Nechells and 31 per cent in Aston. The recession, combined with the area's decline, has defeated the range of active regenerating agencies - not only the development corporation, which last year succeeded a mixed private-public sector urban development agency, but also Birmingham City Council and the government's East Birmingham Task Force, a group designed to foster employment. If such agencies find it hard to cope, the likelihood of them helping redundant Leyland Daf employees back into the labour force is remote. Mr Jim Beeston, chief executive of the development corporation, said: 'The prospects of vacancies in Heartlands, or in Birmingham for that matter, are quite low.' Ms Christine Heard, the task force leader, said it would be 'a ripple on the pond.' The majority of Leyland Daf employees live within five miles of the plant. Most are semi-skilled and will find it difficult to find alternative jobs without some re-training. Birmingham TEC has prepared a package of assistance for Leyland Daf employees involving pre-redundancy advice, vocational training and assistance for those considering self-employment.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Gardening: A portrait from beyond the grave IS THERE life for a garden after death? We all burrow away, planting our musk roses and lavender-blue Aster frikartii; we wage inconclusive war on weeds; we escape for hours from human company and then, like our tender salvias, we keel over. 'I have seen only one certainty in life', said an early Muslim saint: 'death'. We have to agree that he was right. These autumn evenings have a melancholic tinge: responding to it, I have been on the trail of autumn mortality. Just north of London, I have revisited a garden where the balance between death and continuing life is particularly evident. In autumn, its former owner is particularly in my thoughts. Autumn crocus looks very pretty at the moment and the bigger flowers of the colchicum are even better. Nobody has ever been such an expert on the family as the late EA Bowles. Bowles' life spanned the great age of gardening, from 1865 to 1954. He outlived the later years of Gertrude Jekyll and the formative years of Hidcote or Sissinghurst. Nowadays, they have all been revived and they are household names, even to non-gardeners. Yet Bowles had a sharper eye, ever alert to the small beauties of botany. Dozens of good garden plants still bear his name, from a grey cotton lavender to a well-known cream-yellow crocus. Nonetheless, he has remained a name for connoisseurs only. Some of us have read his three seasonal books, called My Garden: others, perhaps, have seen Bowles Corner in the gardens at Wisley in Surrey. If Bowles had been a woman, not a bachelor, he would be all over bookshops, the radio and the US. When he died, the Bowles line branched into Parker Bowles, whose fame now extends beyond cream-coloured crocuses. What about his garden: has it survived him in any way? Through his books, readers still feel that they know it intimately. His habit was to describe what he grew as if he was taking us round with a cup of coffee in one hand. The garden lies at Myddleton House in Enfield, Middlesex, just off the junction of the A10 with exit 25 of the M25. In Bowles' day, it teemed with rarities, not the roar of traffic: his alpine meadow of bulbs was famous; so were his crocuses, snowdrops, irises, anenomes and his rare quirks of nature (his Lunatic Asylum), not to mention his rare trees and shrubs. Through his own writings, you cannot help knowing his habits: his dislike of sweet peas on the dining room table, his habit of going out in January, throwing buckets of water at the trunks of the yew trees and polishing them until they shone. This month of September was the season for Bowles' bowling: he would scatter narcissi along his drive by bowling them over-arm and planting them wherever they landed. In 1954, Bowles' famous garden passed to the pharmacology department of London University; in 1968, after years of academic neglect, it sold most of the flower garden to Lee Valley Park. Nowadays, there are civic lamposts up the drive where Bowles once bowled narcissi. The Lee Valley Rangers have made themselves at home and have established a Ranger Base in the stables. Since 1984, there has been talk of refurbishment and approaches to Wisley and the new conservation movement for plants. I have heard good things about the new iris beds whose varieties have names such as Indian Pow-Wow. Lee Valley inherited a difficult legacy after 14 years in London University's inadequate hands and a further 16 years of restraint has not made the task easier. Admirably, Lee Valley and the Rangers open the garden daily throughout the season; they provide leaflets, some labels, an incongruous glasshouse from a show in Glasgow and a budget for garden staff. As a test-case for a garden's afterlife, Bowles' has enjoyed an unusual life: neglect, then attempts at restoration from an unusual quarter. The site is a muddle and I am not impressed by progress, even if funds have been scarce. I suspect that a no-spray policy has been popular, leaving the weeds untamed; it looks as if no strong personality has taken a firm grip and pulled the garden back into shape. In these days of conservation, the opportunity ought to be taken. Bowles's garden is one of the few which a famous owner described so carefully that we could recreate its extraordinary interest in this new, plant-finding age. If run ruthlessly, it would not be impossibly expensive. Nonetheless, all is not melancholy. To an ear trained on Bowles, there are echoes which survive the grave. Sometimes you catch them on the old pergola where roses grow with names like Silver Moon and Paul's Perpetual White: Bowles enjoyed single-flowered roses and two of his favourites, Anemone and Bracteata, still climb where he planted them, up the old stone cross of Enfield, which he rescued and conserved in his own garden. In the neighbouring jungle, his carnations have gone from the box-edged beds, although anyone competent could reinstate them. The grey-leaved tree-poppies are still going strong with those single white flowers like newly-fried eggs. Nearby, you hit on a tangle of oddities, a white passion flower, a big clemetis armandii, a badly-damaged celletia with its thorns, a red colquhounia and behind the wall, a climbing dicentra. The river has changed course: the hosta-bed continues; the irises have been updated; Bowles might not care for all the Rangers' bedding-out, but I certainly cared for the sight of his marvellous long-flowered Wistaria, still growing by a former river-bridge and twisting upwards far into an evergreen tree. Even among neglect, old echoes suggest new tricks: I now want wistaria up my awful leylandii cypress. Among the weeds and the ever-present snowberry, I began to relish the fragments of immortality, made famous by his writings. The cyclamen are still there and so is the old conservatory, now housing the pair of ornamental ostriches which used to stand by the river. The lake looks forlorn and the meadow is gone, but there is still a tantalising sweet chestnut tree and a plant or two of oxalis Bowles White whose long season of flower has been delighting me in my garden this year. There are even some of the lemon yellow daisies, which Bowles' books recall as a special present. If the owner returned, he would be philosophical, perhaps in one of his homely, but arch quotations. He might, however, ask us why we should expect our gardens to survive us and whether this quiet subsidence was not better. For gardens to live on, they have to be retouched by somebody else, like a canvas for ever in an artist's workshop. I have, however, learned what to plant in order to cheat life's only certainty. In the corners of the flower beds and in a crack of the paving round Enfield Cross, great clumps of autumn colchicums still thrust into the open, leafless but wonderfully white and purple in the sun. If you want to cheat mortality, plant colchicums for the future. They will survive a University, and be friendly to a Ranger Base and the passage of 40 years. Bowles loved this family and must have planted some of these great survivors: in September I find it reassuring that some of them are still flowering, in the jungle of the garden whose owner understood them best.</p>

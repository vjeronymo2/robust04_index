			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Observer: Menage a deux There is an engaging family overtone to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's first big east-west investment, a Dollars 20m stake in a consortium to buy 40 per cent of CSA, the Czechoslovak state airline. The consortium is headed by Air France, which is putting up only Dollars 6m in cash. Air France is run by Bernard Attali. The EBRD is run by Jacques Attali, his twin brother. But I am promised it was an entirely arm's length arrangement.</p>

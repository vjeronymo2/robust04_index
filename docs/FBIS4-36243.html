			<p>BFN     [Text] The Arab League regrets the new eruption of fighting  in Yemen only a few hours after Sanaa accepted a cease-fire as  announced by its foreign minister, Muhammad Salim Basindwah.    Counselor Tal'at Hamid, the Arab League secretary general's  press spokesman, said that the resumption of military action in  Yemen does not help create the appropriate circumstances for  negotiations. He added that the Arab League supports any Arab  or international effort to stop this destructive war in line  with UN Security Council Resolution 924.    Hamid reported that the Arab League secretary general is  constantly in touch with Yemeni leaders in the north and south  and with several other Arab countries to implement the Security  Council resolution.</p>

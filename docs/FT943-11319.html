			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Drive down your car insurance bill - Why most people are paying less Competition, better underwriting and fewer thefts have been good news for drivers. Over the past year, some motor insurance premiums have fallen by between 5 and 10 per cent, according to Mark Wood, managing director of the Automobile Association's insurance and financial services. He says: 'The absolute incidence of motor crime reduced very sharply in 1993 and there has been a massive number of new market entrants, both from continental Europe and new start-up operations. Traditional insurers have been reducing prices and the new direct writers are paying to build up a position in the market.' Direct insurers sell their policies over the telephone, cutting out middlemen, and probably account for around a third of the market. One of them, Direct Line, is the largest motor insurer in the UK. The irony is that although they started out as niche players, they now tend to occupy the middle ground, leaving the niches to the conventional insurance companies. Michael Edwards, deputy managing director of The Insurance Service - the direct insurance arm of Royal Insurance - says much of the cross-subsidy between good and bad risks has been eliminated due to changes in underwriting techniques in recent years. Inevitably, though, this has not benefited everyone. The virtual end of the 60-year-old knock-for-knock agreement - under which insurers agreed to pay claims presented by their policyholders irrespective of their responsibility for an accident - means that comprehensive drivers are no longer subsidising third-party risks. Many young drivers who had been shielded by their parents' insurance have been hit hard, too. A survey in the latest edition of Which?, the Consumers' Association magazine, shows that the cost of a policy for a man with an expensive car, whose wife and son are also covered, has almost tripled over the past two years. Young drivers with high-value cars who arrange cover in their own names are likely to find this very expensive. I asked three direct insurance companies and three brokers to give quotations for a 24-year-old journalist with one speeding conviction who was seeking comprehensive insurance for the first time on a 1992 Ford Escort XR3i. One quotation was to be based on a south London post code, the other on a post code in Norfolk. Direct Line, Churchill and The Insurance Service would not cover either risk. AA Insurance quoted Pounds 4,355 (in London) and Pounds 3,282 (in Norfolk), with a Pounds 175 compulsory excess. Telesure, the UK's first telebroking company, produced rates of Pounds 3,508 (London) and Pounds 2,647 (Norfolk), but with a Pounds 350 excess. And Swinton quoted Pounds 4,086 (London) and Pounds 2,884 (Norfolk), with a Pounds 600 excess. Many young drivers cut costs by taking third party - the legal minimum protection - instead of comprehensive cover. Simon Ward, Telesure's managing director, says this would cut the cost for the south London driver to Pounds 1,705. Costs also fall when young motorists have established a no-claims driving record. If the south London driver had completed four years without a claim, the AA would have quoted a premium of Pounds 1,742. No insurance company is a best buy for every risk, and drivers should not accept the first quotation offered. Direct insurers tend to be around 10 per cent cheaper on many standard risks but are unlikely to offer cover to drivers who own high-value cars or who live in a high-risk area. Edwards says his company will not quote on 10 to 12 per cent of motorists. But Telesure scans 150 schemes from 32 insurers, and Ward believes it can quote for 99 per cent of the motorists who come to it. Meanwhile, James Duffell of Norwich Union - a broker-orientated company which does not have a direct arm, says: 'We are much better for hot hatches, younger drivers and executive cars.' Like other insurers, Norwich also has such 'extras' as standard breakdown cover for women and older drivers; no loading for un-garaged cars; and a limited mileage policy that brings down costs for the occasional driver. Although direct insurers are often the cheapest for the 'average' motorist, this is not always the case. Insurance brokers gave seven out of the 21 lowest quotes, according to Which? The tables show the 15 most competitive quotations obtained by the Consumers' Association for a typical family car - in this case, a four-year old Rover 820SE garaged overnight. The policy covers a 45-year-old manager of a printing company (with a full licence and 25 years' driving experience) and his wife. The driver has a full no-claims driving record, no accidents, claims or convictions, and drives to work. The Which? survey revealed huge premium variations, even for this standard cover. While Swinton - a broker - quoted Pounds 219 for the lowest-risk area, five insurers charged more than Pounds 500. Similarly, the cost of cover at The Insurance Service for the highest-risk area was Pounds 395, but premiums with the five dearest insurers topped Pounds 1,000. The Pearl charged a staggering Pounds 2,431.  ---------------------------------------------------------- BEST INSURANCE BUYS FOR HIGHEST RISK AREAS  ----------------------------------------------------------                        Premium     Excess           Type of Provider               (Pounds)   (Pounds)         provider  ---------------------------------------------------------- The Ins.

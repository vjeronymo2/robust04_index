			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Improvement seen in property market THE Welsh property market ended 1991-92 on a positive note even though the year and its predecessor had been two of the worst in the market since the late 1950s, Mr Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the Land Authority for Wales, said yesterday. He said when presenting the authority's annual report in Cardiff that the organisation had made a profit of Pounds 3.3m before tax last year on turnover of Pounds 9.1m. That showed a rise in profit of Pounds 400,000 over the previous year on a turnover which was Pounds 500,000 lower. However, encouraging signs included the announcement of a new community development with some 2,000 houses and light industrial and retail areas on a 370-acre site in Cardiff, and the involvement of the property arm of Boots, the retail chain, in the redevelopment of the town centre in Caerphilly. The authority was set up in 1974 to help development in Wales by putting together packages of land. It is particularly active where the private sector has difficulty acquiring land and is the only body of its kind in Britain. It took 14 years to assemble the land for the Cardiff development. Mr Inkin said the authority would 'maintain an even more imaginative programme this year' in order to prepare the foundations for recovery once the national economy picked up. Mr Bernard Ryan, chief executive, said that as a result of its land sales last year 'a potential development investment in Wales of Pounds 70m would come about'.

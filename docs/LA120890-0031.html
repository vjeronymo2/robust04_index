			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> READERS HAVE NAME FOR IT: MIKE DOWNEY  </P> <P> I wanted to take the time to commend the L.A. Times for your progressive  affirmative action program.  </P> <P> I have been reading some of the commentaries authored by Mr. Mike Downey and  have also heard him on KABC radio. Mr. Downey's learning disabilities are  apparent from the level on which he communicates. His handicap appears to be a  cognitive reasoning disorder, typically found in adults suffering from  dysfunctional disorders that keep many unemployed and living nonproductive  lives.  </P> <P> The fact that this has not deterred the L.A. Times from employing Mr. Downey is  a tribute to your policy to employ people less fortunate than most.  </P> <P> FREDERICK P. MILLER  </P> <P> Upland  </P></p>

He added that this problem must be resolved by the central  government, taking into account that it affects the public and  that the problem was created by the government when it  implemented Legislative Decree No. 776, which pruned the  municipality's tax benefits.    Dibos indicated that this month (March) it will be very  difficult to cover the employees' payroll, which amounts to some  4.5 million new soles.    He stated that the estimated deficit amounts to 60 million  new soles per annum. "The problem is very serious, and we do  not have the resources needed to pay employees' salaries," he  said.

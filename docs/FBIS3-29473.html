			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Answering a question from a member of Parliamentary  Commission I on the East Timor issue, Foreign Minister Ali  Alatas said that the issue is trivial. He believes it is  settled and should not be brought up again. He also said that  if Indonesia made offensive moves, as Portugal has done, it  would create the impression that the East Timor problem was  important when, in fact, the problem is a trivial one. He  clarified that Indonesia has adopted a wait-and-see attitude and  only issues statements as necessary.    Meanwhile, several offensive actions have been carried out  against Indonesia with regard to its foreign policy and the East  Timor problem, including the production of a book, criticisms  against Indonesia, and the friendly [as heard] visit to Dili by  a European Parliament delegation.</p>

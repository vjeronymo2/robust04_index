			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: BHF-Bank to simplify structure BHF-Bank, the eighth largest private sector bank in Germany, plans to turn itself into a joint stock company and to shed its partnership status as part of its strategy to become one of the leading advisory and trading banks in Europe. As the bank's shares are already quoted in Frankfurt - at yesterday's share price of DM387, a rise of DM2, the market capitalisation was DM3.1bn - the legal change will have no consequences for its ownership. About half the share capital is in firm hands, including those of Allianz, the German insurance group, which owns 16 per cent. About a quarter of the capital is held abroad. The bank said the move to joint stock or AG (Aktiengesellschaft) status would provide it with a simpler internal structure, enabling managers to concentrate more effectively on their specialised fields. That would make sense to foreign shareholders who are sometimes confused by the idea of a quoted bank run on a partnership basis. The change will be proposed to the annual meeting in May. BHF's operating profits rose by 20.5 per cent last year to DM323m (Dollars 205.7m), with group assets nearly 18 per cent higher at DM55bn. In the first half of 1994, operating profits were flat at DM148m. The bank's six general partners are at present personally liable for the business. They need to keep abreast of aspects of the bank's activities outside their specialities. BHF said it wanted to instil the principle of 'performance-oriented entrepreneurship' at all levels. The bank will pay more attention to merchant banking, expand its equities side and concentrate more on serving wealthy investors. In corporate business, BHF will position itself as a leading advisory bank for medium to large German companies. BHF said its co-operation with IKB Deutsche Industriekreditbank, specialising in long-term finance to small and medium-sized companies, will be intensified.</p>

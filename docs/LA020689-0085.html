			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AQUINO AIDE TO TALK MARCOS DEAL  </P> <P> President Corazon Aquino said today that she has sent a senior adviser to the  United States to talk with Ferdinand E. Marcos' lawyers about a deal between  the ousted Philippine strongman and the country he allegedly pillaged for 20  years.  </P> <P> She said she sent Mateo Caparas, chairman of the Presidential Commission on  Good Government, to Hawaii to verify Manila newspaper reports that Marcos  "sincerely wants to discuss a settlement" of demands for the return of millions  of dollars he is alleged to have stolen from the Philippines while in power.  Caparas' trip has "nothing to do with bringing Marcos home -- only his money,"  said the Philippine Daily Globe newspaper, published by an Aquino aide.  </P></p>

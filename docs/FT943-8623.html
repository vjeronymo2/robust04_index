			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares shed 9p after third quarter decline Shares in Huntingdon International Holdings fell 9p to close at 65p after the life sciences group announced a drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 3.34m in the nine months to end-June. Revenue, net of subcontracts, fell from Pounds 115.6m to Pounds 109.2m. For the three months to June 30, the fall was from Pounds 4.32m to Pounds 774,000 on revenues of Pounds 35.7m (Pounds 38.7m). Mr Ian Campbell, chairman, said the nine-month results were disappointing. Although current trading was stronger in all operating groups, he said it was unlikely there would be an overall improvement in the fourth quarter. In May, the group said it would concentrate on its life sciences business and Mr Campbell said yesterday that discussions were under way with potential purchasers for both its US engineering and environmental services business and for Travers Morgan, its UK-based consultancy. For the nine months there were losses of Pounds 299,000 (Pounds 2.77m profits) from US engineering while Travers Morgan contributed just Pounds 183,000 (Pounds 1.89m). Life sciences slipped to Pounds 5.83m (Pounds 6.6m) as a result of price competition, lower-than-anticipated throughput and increased unit costs. However, the installation of new equipment had been speeded up at Huntingdon Research Centre and additional staff recruited. Also, both forward orders and quotations were now 13 per cent ahead of last year with orders from Japan and the US considerably higher. Mr Campbell added that having initiated a 'comprehensive restructuring' of the group, he intended to step down once a replacement had been found.</p>

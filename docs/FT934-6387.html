			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Essentials to close yawning budget deficit Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'An Enigma Behind the UK Recovery' (November 22), asks the difficult question: exactly how much spare capacity is there in the UK economy? The paradox in the Confederation of British Industry survey of the decline of excess capacity combined with the anaemic gross domestic product expansion is, however, not so difficult to resolve. First, the CBI survey is dominated by companies engaged in manufacturing whereas a much greater share of the recession in the 1990s has been taken by the service sector. I would guess that retailers, bankers, building societies and the media could all comfortably cope with an increase in output of 10 per cent from current levels. Second, excess capacity, particularly in manufacturing, does nor stand idle forever. The conventional analysis of the output gap which extrapolates the trend in GDP and subtracts this from actual GDP is based on the premise that the capital stock is held largely intact during the cycle, unable to change swiftly in response to the fluctuations in aggregate demand. In a recession as long and deep as that at the beginning of the 1980s and 1990s, some spare capacity will be scrapped. This will reduce but not eliminate the gap. A similar argument applies to labour. The unemployed become progressively less employable the longer they are idle. The precise size of the output gap is not particularly relevant. It is clear that there is a gap which is unlikely to be reversed for the next two years at least if, as we at Morgan Grenfell expect, UK growth is held below 3 per cent. Massive increases in taxation and/or reductions in public expenditure are required to close a yawning budget deficit. This, combined with the overhang of debt from the 1980s, will prevent demand from becoming too firm. Further gradual monetary easing in the form of lower sterling and/or base rates is justified.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn, January 19 (XINHUA) -- Top Chinese and German  legislators both agreed today to further the ties of their  parliaments.    The agreement came in talks between Qiao Shi, visiting  chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing  Committee, and his German counterpart Rita Suessmuth here this  morning.    Qiao expressed his satisfaction with the growth of bilateral  relations since the two countries established diplomatic ties.    He said recent years have witnessed rapid progress in  bilateral ties, not only in economic trade, but also in culture,  science, technology and education.    Bilateral ties have progressed to a new stage especially  after German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited China last year,  Qiao said.    Qiao noted the growing relationship between China's NPC and  the German Federal Assembly, explaining how two German  vice-presidents visited China in the past and he is now the  first NPC chairman to visit Germany.    He expressed the belief that his visit will achieve  successful results.    During the talks, Qiao formally invited Suessmuth to visit  China at a time convenient to her.    Qiao also gave a full account of China's reforms and opening  to the outside world, its economic construction and its legal  system.    He said over the past 15 years, China's economy has  developed  rapidly and people's living standards have improved greatly.    The Chinese people can express their views freely, he  stressed.    Extending her warm welcome to Qiao, Suessmuth spoke highly  of  China's economic growth and progress in safeguarding its  stability.    Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC standing committee,  participated in the talks.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Row with Ukraine hits debt rescheduling talks RUSSIA has called off debt rescheduling talks with its western creditors, after failing to resolve its dispute with Ukraine over how to divide up the assets of the former Soviet Union. Ukraine signed a protocol in November agreeing to relinquish its claim on most Soviet assets in exchange for Russia assuming responsibility for Ukraine's share of the estimated Dollars 67bn (Pounds 44bn) Soviet debt - the last of the former Soviet republics to accept this arrangement. The agreement has since broken down, however, and now seems likely to delay a settlement with creditor nations, grouped in the Paris Club, by at least several weeks. Russia and Ukraine are due to begin talks in Moscow today and tomorrow on the deadlock with Ukraine. Hopes have been raised that President Boris Yeltsin of Russia and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine could resolve the dispute at their meeting tomorrow, but Russian officials have warned their western counterparts not to count on this. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian deputy prime minister responsible for the negotiations, yesterday said he still believed a rescheduling agreement could be reached by the end of the month. But he said that Russia would find it difficult to pay more than Dollars 3bn on servicing the debt of the former Soviet Union without cutting back on oil deliveries to other former Soviet republics in order to raise more hard currency revenues. Previously Russia had appeared to move closer to its creditors' demands, agreeing last month to pay Dollars 4bn. 'We cannot exclude that the search for a mutually acceptable solution may require further high level meetings,' Russia said in a letter to western debt negotiators. Mr Olin Wethington, who has been in charge of the Russian debt negotiations at the US Treasury, called the breakdown 'puzzling and unfortunate,' and warned that the build-up of payment arrears was making it more and more difficult to reach a satisfactory solution to Russia's debt problems. A Paris Club rescheduling of government to government debts would open the way for a parallel agreement with the London club, representing around 600 commercial bank creditors, on more than Dollars 20bn of commercial debts. Because of the assets dispute with Ukraine, Russia has not yet formally responded to an offer made last month by the Group of Seven industrial nations to reschedule over Dollars 15bn of past official debt, cutting Russia's debt service obligations this year from Dollars 12bn to Dollars 2.75bn. But Russia is now accumulating arrears on debts it has contracted more recently, and a large proportion of these will have to be paid up before a rescheduling deal can go ahead.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / How To Spend It: A well-worn air of comfort Shabby Chic is the name of a new franchise operation selling hand-made (in Lancashire) sofas with a wonderfully over-sized, old-fashioned, comfortable air. Frames are made from European hardwoods, seats and backs are hand-sprung and covered with hair, hessian and felt. The fabric is pre-shrunk pure cotton and comes in soft, washed plain colours like ice blue, sage green, flame and dusky pink so that the sofas come with an already comfy, slightly worn air - no danger of that 'straight from the shop window' look. Shabby Chic these days does not come cheap - at Pounds 1,595 for a two-seater sofa, Pounds 1,700 for a three-seater and Pounds 1,145 for an armchair these are at the expensive end of the spectrum. However, the shapes and sizes have an air of splendour and comfort that is often hard to find. Shabby Chic is at Unit G06-G07 Plaza, 535 Kings Road, London SW10 0TZ.</p>

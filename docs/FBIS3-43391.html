			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the National Party's Federal Council on </F> 5 January]    [Text] It seems as if the ANC's [African National Congress]  PWV [Pretoria -Witwatersrand - Vereeniging] region is repeating  the mistakes of the Western Cape ANC, in compiling their  candidates list. Names of prominent people are being used to  give credibility to the list without their consent.    This undemocratic procedure causes grave embarrassment to  people who differ fundamentally with ANC policy and are public  figures who do not want to become embroiled in political  controversy. The way in which the ANC goes about compiling  their candidates lists indicates a shocking disrespect for the  individual.    These embarrassing incidents also prove that the ANC is  still  trapped in their one-party-state-of-mind. It is time that they  accept that the essence of democracy is freedom of choice.  Appointing people on to your electoral lists without their  permission is further proof of the ANC's disregard for basic  democratic procedure and values.    It is indeed a sign of the political bankruptcy of the ANC  if  they have to revert to these kinds of gimmicks, to draw  attention to their candidates lists and to attempt to lend it  glamour.</p>

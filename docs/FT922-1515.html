			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Council care plans may be delayed: Ministries clash over funding arrangements A CLASH between government departments about community care has led some ministers to contemplate postponing the planned transfer to councils of responsibility for people in nursing and residential homes. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, is keen for the funding to be 'ring-fenced' as special grants to councils, rather than simply being included in the total grant to local government. The aim is to ensure that councils use the money for community care and cannot divert it to other projects. The Department of the Environment, however, is concerned that if that approach is followed, the transfer of responsibility, which was intended as a vote of confidence in local authorities, will be so hedged about with restrictions that it will be seen as the opposite. As work on the transfer of responsibility for April next year has advanced, the difficulties have dismayed some ministers so much that the possibility of a delay - or even changing the policy - has been raised. Ironically, preparations by councils for the transfer have contributed to worries about the policy, as their work has shown up a greater need than ministers were expecting. That is bound to increase the pressure on the government to provide more money when the responsibilities switch to the councils. The policy of transferring responsibility to councils has had a troubled history. Councils were due to take over the responsibility in April last year, but the introduction of the poll tax then delayed the plans, as ministers were concerned that the cost would affect poll-tax bills too much. Mr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, insisted to MPs last week that steady progress was being made towards implementing the arrangements. 'We are not talking about disasters waiting to happen,' he said. 'We are committing all our efforts, with local authorities, to ensuring that the policy will be a real success.' Nonetheless, the interdepartmental dispute may have to be resolved in a cabinet committee. Officials believe that in practice the arrangements are so far advanced that there is little option but to go ahead as planned. The final decision on how funding should be available may not, however, be taken before discussions in the autumn on the public-spending round.</p>

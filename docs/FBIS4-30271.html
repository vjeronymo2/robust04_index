			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta, June 27 (AFP) -- Baton-wielding police  and soldiers violently broke up two demonstrations Monday  against the government's suspension of three popular weekly  newspapers, just ahead of Australian Prime Minister Paul  Keating's arrival.    At least 23 people were arrested and at least several were  injured and bleeding after being struck by security personnel,  witnesses said.    Police said there were only four arrests, however, in what  was the toughest crackdown on demonstrators here in a week  marked by growing unrest in Indonesia over the press crackdown.    For the first time, banners carried by the protesters said  Information Minister Harmoko should resign if the ban was not  lifted.    Political sources here said the government was concerned  that  Keating might cause embarassment to Indonesia's leadership by  raising the question of the press clampdown with President  Suharto. [passage omitted]    The head of the Jakarta police, Major General Hindarto, said  long-standing Indonesian law prohibited the gathering of more  than five people under such circumstances.    A short time later, soldiers dispersed another group of  about  150 artists led by the well-known artist Rendra, who were  protesting the ban on the weeklies in a park near the  Information Ministry.    The security officials chased down the demonstrators and  destroyed their banners less than one minute after ordering the  crowd to disperse. [passage omitted]</p>

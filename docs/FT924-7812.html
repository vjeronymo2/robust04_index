			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / International Company News: Veba down 19.6% after 9 months PRE-TAX profits at Veba, the German energy-based conglomerate, slumped 19.6 per cent to DM1.2bn (Dollars 750m) in the first nine months of this year, our Frankfurt correspondent writes. Improvements in the electricity division, which accounts for almost 20 per cent of group sales, were obliterated by poor performances from basic chemicals and plastics and restructuring costs - all attributable to the international recession. Oil, the second biggest single business sector after trading, also failed to match 'extraordinarily good' results achieved last year thanks to the effects of the Gulf war. Although volume sales increased, turnover at the Veba Oel unit fell 8 per cent, according to an interim report. No improvement is expected in the closing months of the year in either plastics or oil, but 'we are expecting an annual result which, though down, will nevertheless be relatively satisfactory'. Almost three-quarters of the 12.3 per cent rise in group sales to DM49.8bn was accounted for by the first-time inclusion of results from the Schenker-Rhenus forwarding business. Meanwhile, trading turnover increased by less than 2 per cent, to DM15bn. Siemens-Nixdorf, the computer division of Germany's Siemens group, expects to reduce its losses further in the current year after cutting its net deficit 34 per cent to DM513m in the year to end-September. Turnover rose 7 per cent to DM13bn.</p>

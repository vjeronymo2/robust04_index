			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE END OF A WOMAN'S NIGHTMARE HAD A NICE RING TO IT  </P> <P> A team of Roto-Rooter employees went beyond the call of duty to retrieve a  $5,000 engagement ring a San Jose woman accidentally flushed down the toilet  just a day before her wedding.  </P> <P> Their efforts, which included tearing up the front lawn and flushing gallons of  water into a sewer main, paid off. Trish McDonald's ring was saved from a  watery grave on May 19.  </P> <P> "I gave them all the champagne out of my refrigerator," said McDonald, a  27-year-old flight attendant. "I was just passing it out in the street."  </P> <P> McDonald, who had been preoccupied with pre-wedding arrangements, forgot she  had wrapped the ring in toilet paper to protect it. After she wiped the sink  dry with some other toilet paper, she flushed the whole clump.  </P> <P> "I just about hyperventilated on the floor. I said, 'This is the beginning of  the end of my marriage.' "  </P></p>

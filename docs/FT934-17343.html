			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Obscure view of milk issues Sir, The letter from Andrew Dare, chief executive of the Milk Marketing Board (September 29), serves only to obscure the issues set out so clearly in your leading article, 'Milking the Milk Monopoly' (September 27). According to Mr Dare: 'It may be that supply is limited by EC-imposed milk quotas. But far better that the limited supply is priced by the market place.' The UK is only about 85 per cent self-sufficient in raw milk, and no increase in the price paid to farmers can increase that supply. The stated ambition of Milk Marques - the organisation that will replace the MMB - is to control 80 per cent of this restricted supply and thereafter, free from the present statutory price controls, significantly to increase the prices payable by dairies and consumers. As your leader says, such increases are monopoly rents. Any comparison with the free market in the Netherlands, which is over 200 per cent self-sufficient in raw milk, is wholly misleading. It is perhaps the mark of a monopoly that it can write to the press criticising its customers and dismissing their concerns. Jim McMichael-Phillips, president, Dairy Trade Federation, 19 Cornwall Terrace, London NW1 4QP</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Flushing out the rebels Mr John Major is quite right to make the passage of the European Community (Finance) bill a matter of confidence. He could not remain prime minister if he did anything less. His undertaking to contribute to the enlarged European budget was given with the cabinet's support. As Mr Major said in the Commons yesterday, there is no room for compromise. He was, of course, addressing the rebels within his own party. Labour must now decide whether its support for the European Union overrides the temptation to vote opportunistically in the hope of staging a coup. The likelihood that such a piece of theatre might succeed is small. Few Conservative Eurosceptics are willing to topple their own administration. The handful that might be so minded is outnumbered by Ulster Unionists who support the Tories. The Liberal Democrats might not vote with Labour. In sum, the balance of risk favours the prime minister. A similar risk assessment has dictated the government's legislative programme for the coming session. Here too the watchword has been caution: there is clearly no stomach for the prospect of facing backbench rebels down on substantive matters such as the privatisation of the post office. The unavoidable bravado over the European finance bill apart, the motto is 'safety first'. This may be no bad thing. The actions of a parliament are best judged on grounds of quality. The quantity of new bills should be kept low. The speech delivered by the Queen at the opening of Parliament yesterday contained a smaller package of proposals than has become customary since 1979. Few if any are radical or dramatic. In the debate following the speech the leader of the opposition found little to quarrel with in any of the prime minister's specific proposals. This revving down of the pace of law-making may be derided in Westminster as 'consolidation' but beyond the small circle of everyday politicking there may be a more positive response. As the chancellor of the exchequer is fond of saying, what the public wants is a period of good government. There is no evident demand for ever-increasing amounts of hasty and therefore botched legislation. It will be possible to assess specific bills when they are published, but at first reading a list that includes pensions reform, a tidying-up of the health service bureaucracy, mini-privatisations of the Crown Agents and the commercial parts of the Atomic Energy Authority and a disability rights law is welcome - although the latter may be too watered-down to be useful. A period of low-key government might benefit the Conservatives. Unemployment has fallen for the tenth consecutive month. Inflation is steady, around the mid-point of the 0-4 per cent target range. A faster than advertised reduction in public sector borrowing seems likely, offering a potential justification for tax cuts in the 1995 budget. Mr Major's fortunes may yet improve, if only accidents will stop happening to his government.</p>

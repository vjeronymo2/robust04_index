Han] </F>   [Text] Washington, March 2 (CNA) -- Ding Mou-shih,  representative of the Republic of China [ROC] in the United  States, said Wednesday [2 March] night that there is sill ample  room for improving U.S.-Taiwan relations.    Speaking at a reception commemorating the 15th anniversary  of  the Taiwan relations act in an office building of the U.S. House  of Representatives, Ding told U.S. well-wishers, "as a  democratic and prosperous people whose values match yours, our  substantive relations with the United States can and should be  further enhanced."    Ding pointed out that the people in Taiwan hope for greater  international involvement. He also thanked Taiwan's friends in  the U.S. congress for supporting the rights of Taiwan's 20  million people to participate in world organizations.    The ROC representative noted that Taiwan and the United  States have cooperated closely for mutual benefits during the  past 15 years despite the lack of official ties.    "We want to see the Taiwan relations act remain strong and  continue to serve as a solid foundation for enhancing the  cooperation and friendship between out peoples," he said.    Also speaking at the occasion, Wang Jin-ping, vice president  of the ROC Legislative Yuan, said the people in Taiwan have made  significant political and economic strides in the past 15 years,  thanks to the far-sightedness of the U.S. lawmakers in enacting  the Taiwan Relations Act.    Wang said he and his two colleagues were in Washington,  D.C.,  not only to attend a meeting of Global Legislators Organization  for a Balanced Environment (GLOBE), but also to express  appreciation on behalf of the ROC people to their U.S. friends  for their persistent support.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Capital Markets: Yen feature protects convertible Fuji paper A SFr40m convertible note issue for Fuji Electronics contains a feature to protect investors against rises in the value of the yen. Yamaichi Bank (Switzerland), the lead manager, has introduced a formula for adjusting the exchange rate to be used when converting the Swiss franc nominal value of the notes into Fuji's yen denominated shares. The formula is related to the feature introduced three years ago by Yamaichi in response to declining Japanese share prices. This provided for the downward revision of the conversion price on equity related bond issues. It established a so-called setting date, usually two years after the issue, at which the conversion price could be revised downward if the company's shares had declined by a specified amount. Under the new feature, for Japanese issuers, the upward revision of the yen exchange rate will also take place on the setting date, but only if the conversion price is revised downward at that time and if the yen exchange rate is higher than it was at the time of the bond's issue (the so-called constant rate). For other issuers, the upward revision of the currency exchange rate would take place independently of any downward revision of the conversion price. Yamaichi intends that the maximum potential exchange rate adjustment should be less than 10 per cent. In the Fuji case, it is 9.3 per cent. The potential conversion price adjustments are normally less than 20 per cent.</p>

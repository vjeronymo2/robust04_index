			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: GEC moves on manufacturing - Poorly performing non-strategic companies likely to be sold GEC intends to rationalise its portfolio of general manufacturing companies to improve its profitability and focus. Poorly performing companies which are not part of GEC's strategic operations will be sold if their profitability cannot be improved. Lord Weinstock, GEC's managing director, said that in addition to its three core businesses of telecommunications, electronics systems and power systems, the company was setting up an industrial group to encompass the rest of its operations. Some businesses within that, notably the petrol pump manufacturer Gilbarco and the ink-jet printer maker Videojet were doing extremely well and would be developed further. Others would either have to improve their profitability or be sold. 'It is not enough to be a me-too manufacturer any more. We have to be in those busineses where we have sufficient presence to make an acceptable return,' he said. The industrial group of businesses were responsible for some of the difficulties which led to profits being only slightly ahead of last year at Pounds 866m. However, the final dividend was increased to 8.01p (7.62p) making a total of 10.82p (10.3p) for the year. Profits were some Pounds 70m below the company's own earlier expectations for a variety of reasons. A US-based semiconductor operation, GEC Plessey Semiconductors, reported a small loss, some Pounds 17m below GEC's budgeted level. Restructuring charges cost Pounds 8m in the power controls business and poor market conditions hurt the cables and weighing operations. Currency effects cost a further Pounds 10m. Elsewhere, development costs of the in-flight entertainment system, which is due to be supplied for the Boeing 777 aircraft, cost Pounds 20m more than anticipated. To avoid the possibility of the system being late more staff have been assigned to the project. Of GEC's three main divisions, power systems saw operating profits fall by Pounds 8m to Pounds 166m, on sales of Pounds 3.1bn (Pounds 3.14bn), but the profitability was distorted by pre-payments for power stations, which reduced operating profits but increased interest income. Pre-payments increased the GEC Alsthom's working capital by Pounds 511m to negative Pounds 665m. The joint venture achieved record results and margins improved to 7.6 per cent (7.1 per cent). The electronics systems business, which includes the defence interests, saw operating profits fall to Pounds 252m (Pounds 271m) on sales of Pounds 2.75bn (Pounds 2.72bn). Order intake was below the previous year and the outstanding order book has fallen 7 per cent to Pounds 4.5bn. Margins were squeezed because development costs are still at a high level on avionics systems for the Eurofighter 2000 and the Boeing 777, while deliveries have not yet started. In telecommunications, GPT's operating profits rose more than 13 per cent to Pounds 120m even though turnover only increased marginally to Pounds 1.05bn. With business on the System X digital exchanges for BT running down, the division has had to switch to other business ranging from switching software, through the development of advanced telecoms transmission systems in co-operation with Siemens, to the manufacture of payphones.</p>

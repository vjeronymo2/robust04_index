			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Chieftain Chieftain Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist insulation and fireproofing services, returned to profit in the half year to June 30 with Pounds 203,000 pre-tax, compared with losses of Pounds 481,000. Turnover fell from Pounds 7.36m to Pounds 4.84m. The acquisition in January of R Blackett Charlton had enabled the company to expand in the diversified activity of pipe fabrication and erection, said Mr Peter Wardle, chairman, and the company had won orders of nearly Pounds 1m, due to be completed this year. An unchanged dividend of 1.5p is declared from earnings of 1.67p (3.76p losses) per share.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (6) The reason the file is being requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If USARCS has already acted on a request for reconsideration on a personnel claim, the file will not be returned to a field office for action on a second request for reconsideration. In such cases, the request will be sent to USARCS for action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.236  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Certified and registered mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Correspondence to claimants and/or their attorneys denying or making final offers in tort claims under subparts C, D, E, F, G, H, and L or the transmittal of an abandonment notice will be accomplished by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. The return receipt (green card), upon its return to the claims office, will be retained as a part of the claims file as proof of receipt by the claimant or other addressee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.237  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Maintenance of claims files.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The contents of each claim file for claims against the United States will be placed in a standard 91/4 inch by 113/4 inch manila folder . The name of the claimant, exactly as entered into the automated claims management data base, will be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder. The complete nine-digit computer-generated claim number displayed in the automated database will be placed on the extreme top right-hand side of the folder. The fiscal year, office code, and claim sequence number will be separated by a dash mark (example, ``88&hyph;011&hyph;0079''). Both name and claim file number entries on the manila file folder will be printed legibly in blue-black ink. The claim file should be stapled together before inserting in the file folder; however, the file need only be placed in the folder without stapling to the file folder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Investigative files will also be maintained in manila folders. The date of the incident and general descriptive data (for example, ``1 Jul 86/ auto accident (1st and Elm, Smallville)'' or ``24 Sep 86/ heart operation (Jones, John M.)'') will be placed on the top-left portion of the file folder.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 requires labeling of file folders and containers with specific information. In complying therewith, the following guidance is provided:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Only the ``dummy'' or ``lead'' folder will contain the disposition instructions required by AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2, for files that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have a common disposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) When labeling individual file folders, only the information required by AR 25&hyph;400&hyph;2 will be typed on the label. The label will be placed on the top center portion of the folder. Under no circumstances will the information concerning the claim (see paragraph (a) of this section) be placed on this label.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Monthly Claims Reporting System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.238  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Personnel Claims Management Program, the Affirmative Claims Management Program, and the Tort and Special Claims Management Program are the automated programs which generate a monthly status report on claims against the United States and recovery actions. Specific instructions pertaining to the USARCS Claims Automation Program are contained in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 1 and in documentation provided with the automation software.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: Eni may alter its plans for sell-off ENI, Italy's state-owned energy and chemicals group, which is to be partially sold to the public, yesterday surprised bankers by disclosing a possible change of plan in the way it is to be privatised. The revised plan would consolidate Eni's oil and gas activities into one company. The new concern, probably named Societa Italiana Idrocarburi (SII), would then be fully or partially floated. Listing SII represents a radical change from the two previous privatisation proposals for Eni. The first aimed to list just the Agip upstream oil and gas business, probably after a merger with the Agip Petroli downstream oil business. The alternative to this would have been to float a small tranche of shares in the entire Eni group. The second idea has lost ground because of continuing heavy losses at Eni's chemicals side, and the shadow this casts over any attempt to sell Eni shares. By contrast, listing the two Agip businesses would only partially reflect Eni's position as one of the world's biggest energy groups. SII would probably include Snam (gas supply and distribution), Snamprogetti (design and engineering) and Saipem (drilling and construction), as well as to the two Agip businesses. The SII project would combine Eni's most attractive and profitable businesses in a single, coherent energy and engineering group. Before going forward, however, Eni will probably have to remove stakes in its loss-making EniChem chemicals business from the balance sheets of the companies comprising SII. Saipem, already listed, has reported a 28 per cent rise in first-half sales to L1,098bn (Dollars 700m), confirming the recovery indicated last year. Its net financial position has improved with a cash surplus of almost L34bn at end-June against net borrowings of around L81bn last December.</p>

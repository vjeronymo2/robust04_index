			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Financial Control Systems (7): An aid to recovery / EIS user-view: Whitcroft - The vision that information technology could give a company more than manual accounting methods led to an EIS for a building and textiles conglomerate Andrew Fishwick, group financial controller at the Winslow-based Whitecroft building and textiles conglomerate, was anxious to escape from the 'blind alley' brought about by two-dimensional spreadsheet models and cupboards full of paper. The Acuity executive information system, EIS, was chosen from a shortlist of five, for both financial control and business management information. An important requirement was a single-supplier agreement - 'one bottom to kick' - with the hardware supplier, Bull, providing front-line support. The aim was to give 'similar but different' views of data to managers in different operational departments. PA Consulting helped define the financial, business, and management needs, but even so, the implementation has evolved over the 18 months it has been in use, especially as a change in management re-focused the effort. 'The analysis never stops,' says Andrew Fishwick, who went from filing cabinets to the computer in one step. Once the wide area network linking with the headquarters is in operation, data will be collected locally in Lotus spreadsheets, and even floppy discs will be obsolete. 'We now have a standard financial reporting system that has tightened up financial control disciplines throughout the group, particularly in terms of cash flow management and short-term profit forecasting,' says Mr Fishwick. 'But you have to educate people out of paper. We've broken new ground using Acuity, but it's been an investment of time, and Acuity has learned things, too: we've helped them develop a consolidation tool for the commercial sector. 'The system has helped us through recovery: we're now the top-performing share in the north-west of England.'

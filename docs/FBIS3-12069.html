			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Porfirio Munoz Ledo of the PRD [Party of the  Democratic Revolution] has stated that in view of the country's  circumstances, it is important for the government to be cautious  because if it hardens its policy it will be risking the nation's  social stability. Commenting on the nomination of Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party] presidential candidate, the national PRD leader said that  now more than ever, the political dialogue must be increased to  guarantee clean elections.    [Begin Munoz Ledo recording] We hope that there will be no  hardening of positions. The country's conditions make it  advisable for the government to be cautious, wise, and tolerant.  The Chiapas problem is not solved. There is concern and even  emotional instability in vast areas of the country. We must  advise the government to be cautious, increase political  dialogue, and not allow the nomination of a candidate to be put  on the same level with the appointment of a president. That  would be the worst mistake that the system could make at this  point. [end recording]    Munoz Ledo added that it is probable that Cuauhtemoc  Cardenas  will resume his campaign after Holy Week.</p>

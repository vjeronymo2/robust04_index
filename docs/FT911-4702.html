			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Parretti ousted from helm of Pathe Communications MR GIANCARLO Parretti, the controversial Italian financier, has been ousted as chairman and chief executive of Pathe Communications. He has been replaced by Mr Cesare De Michelis, a professor of letters at the University of Padua and younger brother of Italian foreign minister Mr Gianni De Michelis. Mr Parretti will remain a majority shareholder of Pathe and will keep a seat on its board. Hollywood has been buzzing with rumours about financial malaise at MGM-Pathe almost from the moment MGM was acquired for Dollars 1.3bn last year by Mr Parretti's Pathe Communications. MGM-Pathe is facing an involuntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition from six creditors who claim they are owed more than Dollars 11m. MGM-Pathe said its main lender, Credit Lyonnais of France, has agreed to provide Dollars 145m in additional loans if the involuntary bankruptcy filing is dismissed. The studio plans to file a motion to dismiss the petition within days. However, Credit Lyonnais would not comment on the announcement and sources close to the creditors voiced scepticism about the existence of the financing. It is believed that the creditors would drop their bankruptcy petition if MGM-Pathe paid them in full. Earlier this week, the studio and its parent company said they would post significant losses for 1990. The studio is so strapped for cash that it had to delay the release of Delirious, a new film starring John Candy, because it could not fund the Dollars 7m promotional budget. MGM-Pathe said a release date for the film would be announced shortly. Credit Lyonnais has been an important backer for Mr Parretti and his Geneva-based partner, Mr Florio Fiorini for several years. The bank originally helped the partners to acquire Cannon Pictures in 1987 and Pathe Communications in 1988.</p>

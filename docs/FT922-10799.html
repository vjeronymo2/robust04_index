			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Lloyds sets out plan to bid Pounds 3.6bn for Midland: Hongkong Bank says rival offer would reduce UK banking competition LLOYDS BANK yesterday said it was planning to make a Pounds 3.6bn offer to acquire its rival Midland Bank and urged the government to carry out a thorough review of competition in the UK banking industry. It said that if it succeeded in buying Midland it would reduce staff numbers at the combined banks by 20,000 over four years and close 1,000 branches. Annual overheads of the joined operations would be cut by Pounds 700m. However, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, insisted there would be no compulsory redundancies and that the axe would fall on Lloyds' operations as well as on Midland's. He said Lloyds would preserve 'the best of each bank'. Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, insisted that his bank was 'not making a hostile bid', but bankers said Sir Jeremy was 'playing with words'. They had no doubt that Lloyds was in effect making the first ever hostile bid attempt by a UK clearer for a domestic rival. At 7.30 yesterday morning, after four months of secret preparations, Lloyds said it would offer one new Lloyds share and 30p in cash to acquire each Midland share. However, it set an unusual precondition on its bid. The offer would not be put to Midland shareholders, Lloyds said, if the takeover proposal was referred for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, unless the rival bid for Midland by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was also investigated by the MMC. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, met Department of Trade and Industry officials immediately after Lloyds' announcement to discuss the bank's bid plans. Officials at the Office of Fair Trading said the OFT would probably advise Mr Heseltine to refer the Lloyds bid to the MMC. Before Lloyds' intervention, analysts believed he would not refer the Hongkong Bank bid on the basis of the government's competition policy of the past decade. However, Mr Pitman said that Midland's customers would benefit more from a Lloyds takeover than from one by Hongkong Bank so it was in 'the national interest' that both bids be referred to the MMC. Mr Heseltine will also have to grapple with the issue of whether the Hongkong bid falls properly into his jurisdiction or whether it should be vetted exclusively by the European Community competition authority in Brussels. DTI officials said they were still at the stage of accumulating information on this question. If Lloyds acquires Midland  - and it admitted that it faced a stiff challenge  - its position as the UK's most profitable bank would be reinforced. It would also become the UK's biggest bank in terms of branch numbers, employing 125,500 people. Measured by gross assets it would be the UK's third biggest and would rank 18th in the world. Midland, whose directors met for an emergency board meeting between 5.30pm and 8pm, made no formal response to Lloyds' proposal. However it is expected to maintain its backing for Hongkong Bank's Pounds 3.3bn offer when it issues a statement today. Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong Bank, immediately went on to the offensive, saying a Lloyds takeover would reduce competition in the UK banking industry and would 'mean the destruction of Midland'. Mr Pitman said Midland's customers would benefit more from Lloyds' plan than from Hongkong's. He hopes to offer better products and services if the bid is successful and will outline these in the next fortnight. He added that a Lloyds takeover would not have the adverse effect on competition in the UK banking industry that some analysts have been predicting. Small businesses have been particularly concerned that the combination of Midland and Lloyds would in effect lead to the removal of a vital source of loans. However, Mr Pitman insisted that the combination of Lloyds and Midland would offer a stiffer challenge in the small business market to the leaders, Barclays and National Westminster, thereby forcing them to provide an improved service, benefiting all small business customers. Midland's share price rose from 381p to 394p, which compares with the 447p-a-share value of Lloyds' proposed terms. Lloyds fell from 427p to 417p.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE LINE UP  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Lloyds         Midland Pre-tax profit 1991     Pounds 645m      Pounds 36m Total assets            Pounds 51bn     Pounds 59bn UK branches                   1,915           1,830 Employees                    67,900          57,600  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- World ranking by assets*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyds                 44 Midlands               40 Lloyds/Midland         18 HSBC/Midland           12  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK Ranking  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lloyds, end 1991        5 Midland, end 1991       3 Lloyds/Midland          3 HSBC/Midland            3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Source: The Banker July 1991  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

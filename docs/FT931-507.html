			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Rover joint venture aims to revive MG ROVER, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is in advanced negotiations to form a co-operative venture for the production of a new range of MG sports cars. It hopes to resurrect one of the world's best-known sports-car marques with the help of external finance, more than a decade after MG was killed off. Rover is negotiating with Mayflower, the specialist UK engineering company, to form a collaborative production venture for the new MG range. Code-named PR3, the sports car would be a small, affordable mid-engined roadster that could be ready for launch by 1995-96. The company cleared the way in the autumn last for a revival of the MG marque when it unveiled its low-volume MG RV8, a redesigned and more powerful variant of the MGB sports car last produced in 1980. The PR3 is designed to return MG to mainstream sports carmaking, a market dominated in recent years by Japanese carmakers with products such as the Mazda MX-5, following the earlier demise of UK sportscar makes such as Triumph and MG. Rover, formerly the loss-making state-owned British Leyland, abandoned this market in 1980 with the closure of the MG plant at Abingdon, Oxfordshire. Under the terms of the proposed collaboration with Mayflower, Motor Panels, the Coventry-based supplier of automotive bodies and a subsidiary of Mayflower since 1991, would produce the MG body panels and supply the welded bodies to Rover for painting and final assembly. Mayflower, due to announce today its preliminary financial results for 1992, is also expected to launch a new share issue aimed in part at financing the planned venture with Rover. A revival of the distinctive MG marque has long been planned by Rover, but the UK carmaker has lacked the funds to finance the venture alone in the face of the heavy capital demands of its mainstream new model programmes. In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range starting with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and a re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in 1991 and the imminent launch of the Rover 600 next month. The attraction of the venture for Rover is that Mayflower would take over responsibility for financing a costly part of the new MG development programme, namely the development of the tooling and equipment for producing the body panels and for welding the bodies. Mayflower already produces the exterior panels for the Land Rover Discovery and cabs for the Leyland Daf 45 series light trucks. The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built. The RV8 will be produced at a maximum volume of only 15 a week with first delivery starting next month, but the model is intended to resurrect the MG name in public awareness.</p>

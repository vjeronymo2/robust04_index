			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bharat Bhushan in Washington] </F>   [Text] The Kashmir issue seems set to further strain  Indo-US ties with a letter sent by President Bill Clinton to the  head of a pro-Pakistan, pro-militant organisation of Kashmiri  Americans referring to human rights violations in Kashmir and  offering to work with them "to bring peace to Kashmir."    The letter, written on December 27 to Ghulam Nabi Fai of the  Kashmiri American Council (KAC), could not have come at a more  inopportune time. It comes in the wake of Clinton's raising the  Kashmir issue in the UN, the US flip-flop on the Instrument of  Accession and the failure of the Indo-Pak talks.    (India reacted to the letter by hoping the US would not  ignore gross human rights violations committed by terrorists in  Kashmir, aided and abetted by Pakistan, while thinking of peace  in the Valley. "We are committed to strengthening the  institutions relevant to the upholding of human rights in  India," an official said).    The Clinton letter seems to recognise Fai as an interlocutor  in the Kashmir dispute. India would find this particularly  objectionable as Fai's organisation is widely believed to be  funded by Pakistan and is seen as promoting instability in  Kashmir.    Fai has made a career out of lobbying against India in US  Congress and that is what he gets paid for as KAC executive  director. India can, therefore legitimately ask why a US  President should write to him that he looks forward to working  with him.    Fai speaks for people seen as terrorists by most Indians and  this is bound to raise questions about where the US stands on  terrorism when it does not threaten its own citizens directly.    All the State Department would say about the letter was that  it was consistent with the US policy of being willing to assist  India and Pakistan on Kashmir. The US -- an official said  reiterating the Clinton Administration's stand -- does not see  itself as a mediator unless it is requested for by both nations.  Clinton's letter should be seen in that context, he said.    Before getting all hot and sweaty about the letter, it may  be  pertinent to take a few deep breaths and note that he does not  even get to see the thousands of letters he receives and which  are responded to with his name appended to them.    A lot of people write to Clinton just as any other head of  state and a number of them receive responses. The response to  Fai's letter is fairly innocuous at one level and in all  likelihood drafted by some bleeding-heart liberal in White House  who has no intention of striking one more blow to Indo-US  relations.    But this is merely the mechanics of how the letter would  have  got written. When his name is appended to a letter those  responsible for doing so have to be more sensitive about the  contents.    After Clinton's infamous reference to Kashmir in the UN and  the brouhaha following Assistant Secretary of State Robin  Raphel's statement on the Instrument of Accession one would have  thought the US Administration would be more careful.    In all fairness after the Raphel statement, the State  Department took a reasonable public position. But the White  House staff seems to work with its own agenda. And this letter  is an example.</p>

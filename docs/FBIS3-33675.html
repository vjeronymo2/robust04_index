			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 31 Jan (MENA)--The newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH  says Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statements are  designed to avoid meeting the April deadline to implement the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement just as he avoided beginning the  withdrawal on 13 December.    The paper adds: Israel knows how to sell the illusions of  peace to obtain more arms deals and restore its ties with many  countries. The U.S. pressure to end the Arab boycott of Israel  before the latter takes any concrete step proves this.    AL-JUMHURIYAH points out that Israel has a long experience  in  prevarication and maneuvers, the most recent of which was the  farce over a referendum on withdrawal from the Golan Heights.  This was a move intended to confront the results of the Geneva  summit between Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President  Bill Clinton.    AL-JUMHURIYAH concludes: Washington apparently approves of  this game as demonstrated by a remark made by U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher that his country, although a full  partner to the process, will not pressure Syria or Israel in the  peace negotiations and will not mediate unless requested to by  both parties.</p>

According to the  population projections drafted in 1991, based on the data on the  labor force in the Demographic and Health Survey (ENDESA-91),  the total domestic population in the economically active  category was about 3.7 million. Males accounted for 2.2 million  of this figure, and females for 1.5 million.    There is no great variation in the unemployment situation  between the rural and urban areas, although the percentage of  the workers who are unemployed is slightly higher in the latter.    When the unemployment figure is broken down by sex, however,  the women's situation clearly reveals their social  disadvantages. While only 11 percent of the men are unemployed,  this is the case for 46.7 percent of the female population.    And there is one fact that would be hard to believe if it  were not well-documented. Unemployment is higher among those  with high-school education than among those without.    The data in question are contained in the monograph entitled  "The Labor Force in the Dominican Republic," edited by  demographer Nelson Ramirez. This study was based on the results  obtained in the Demographic and Health Survey carried out by the  Institute for Population and Development Studies (IEPD), one of  the entities of the Dominican Association for the Welfare of the  Family (PROFAMILIA).    A novel method was used to measure the levels of popular  participation in economic activities and the unemployment rates.  In an approach different from those traditionally used, the  ENDESA-91 included in the unemployed category "not only the  individuals who were looking for work during a reference period  (the week preceding the survey) and those who plainly declared  themselves to be unemployed, but also all the individuals  prepared to work for pay or profit."    With this approach, the survey regarded as unemployed all  those individuals who want to work but were not seeking  employment because of their conviction that they were unlikely  to find jobs (a group with significant weight in the  underdeveloped societies).    Thus the rates determined as a result of this study differ  from those based on the figures in the population census. Nor  are they the same as the figures obtained in the occasional  manpower surveys carried out by government bodies and organs.    At the time the ENDESA-91 was completed, 67.9 percent of the  population 10 years of age or older was included in the figure  representing the total manpower available for the production of  economic goods and services. Eighty percent of the men and 55  percent of the women were included in this figure.    All of the figures agree in showing differences between the  levels and forms of participation in economic activities between  men and women. A breakdown by age shows that the rates of male  participation are on "a very high level up to the ages of 50-54  (and up to even higher age brackets in the rural areas), while  the rates of participation for women begin to decline as of the  age of 40."    The data pertaining to child labor, especially the  employment  of males, is pertinent. According to the ENDESA-91, "one out of  every two boys between the ages of 10 and 14 is on the labor  market."    The same high rates are seen for men 65 or more years of  age.  In this bracket, six out of every 10 are still economically  active. In the rural areas, the figure is seven out of 10.    "The shortcomings from which the socioeconomic systems in  general, and the educational and social security systems in  particular, are suffering" constitute the corollary.    In terms of education as a condition for participation in  economic activity, the differences between men and women become  significant. While for males "the level of economic  participation seems to be independent of the number of years of  study completed, a clearly defined positive relation is seen for  the female population in this regard. The higher levels of  participation in the labor market correspond to higher levels of  education."    Although significant, the unemployment rates for men and  women obtained in the ENDESA-91 survey are less dramatic than  those based on the traditional methods of measuring this  phenomenon.    Naturally, the study warns that these more positive rates  pertain exclusively to occupational levels "and not necessarily  to the quality or productivity of the work done."    In this connection, the possibility that "within a context  of  increasing social crisis and serious deterioration of the  purchasing power of the population, larger population segments  have been forced to enter the labor market--even if only by  means of self-employment in marginal activities--in order to  cope with this situation" is noted.    A similar inference might be made for the female population.  If there is no visible impact on the rates of participation as a  result, the explanation might be that the increase in the level  of employment "is concealed within the much larger increase in  the labor force (and in the number of unemployed workers)," or  is obscured by the new conceptual method used to describe the  economically active population (EAP).    Although an increase in the employed population (for both  sexes) has been seen in recent decades, the increase between  1981 and 1991 has been by far the most notable.    The other side of the coin, that is to say unemployment, has  afflicted urban males more than those in the rural sector, while  the situation is the reverse for females.    "In connection with these figures, it should be noted that  in  both sectors and for both sexes, the clear unemployment picture  for the younger population segment is much more serious than the  situation of those in the middle or older age groups. In fact,  the rates are relatively low for men over 30."    The fact that individuals with less education have a lower  rate of unemployment than individuals with a high-school  education might be linked with the fact that the former group is  "more urgently forced to engage in self-employment in informal  activities as a strategy for survival."    However, a comparison of the individuals who have had a  high-school education with those who have university backgrounds  shows a more positive balance for the latter. According to the  ENDESA-91 survey, the reason for the difference is to be found,  on the one hand, in the fact that individuals with a university  education have a greater need to work in order to pay for their  studies. And on the other hand, the incorporation of a large  number of the individuals who have completed professional  training in productive activity is "facilitated by the level of  training achieved and the greater readiness of these individuals  to work."    In studying the unemployed population (those seeking jobs or  wanting to work), the ENDESA-91 found that "23 percent had been  in that situation for one month, another 27 percent for between  one and five months, and 9 percent for between six months and a  year, while the remaining 41 percent had been unemployed for a  year or more (two or more years for the majority)."    Finally, the survey pointed out that this last percentage  (individuals unemployed for a year or more), which is made up  principally of the majority segment of the unemployed not  seeking work, provides an indication of the rigid nature of the  supply of productive jobs."    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rates of Economic Activity by Age and Sex Categories                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(in percentages)                                                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |National Totals                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Age Category             |Males                    |Females                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |10-14                    |49.1                     |23.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |15-19                    |78.0                     |57.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |20-24                    |89.0                     |73.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |25-29                    |94.6                     |73.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |30-34                    |96.8                     |73.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |35-39                    |94.3                     |75.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |40-44                    |96.2                     |68.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |45-49                    |94.6                     |60.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |50-54                    |95.0                     |45.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |55-59                    |87.7                     |38.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |60-64                    |86.1                     |28.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |65 or older              |59.2                     |16.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rates of Unemployment in the Population 15 Years of Age or Older           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(in percentages by level of education and sex)                             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Level of Education|Both Sexes        |Men               |Women             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |None*             |17.9              |5.1               |44.8              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1-4 years primary |22.0              |6.6               |47.3              |  |school            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |5-8 years primary |28.0              |10.9              |50.0              |  |school            |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |High school       |30.6              |15.0              |47.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |University        |17.8              |8.6               |26.5              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |*Preprimary schooling included                                             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

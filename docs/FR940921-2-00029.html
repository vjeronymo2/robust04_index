Enclosed with that letter was a copy of an earlier letter, dated November 26, 1993, also designated as a section 21 Petition. The Petition describes problems Mr. Truelock has experienced over the years in seeking relief from periodic overflowing of raw sewage from a drainage ditch adjacent to his house. The problem described is not amenable to solution by remedies provided by section 21 of TSCA, nor does Petitioner request such action. In December of 1993, in response to earlier correspondence, EPA Region 6 informed Petitioner of actions already taken under the Clean Water Act to resolve the problem. Therefore, Petition is denied because no action authorized under TSCA section 21 has been requested. Specifically, Petitioner has not sought rulemaking under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under TSCA section 5(e) or 6(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Edward M. Brooks, Chemical Control Division (7405), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. 515A, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 260&hyph;3754.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Statutory Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 21 of TSCA provides that any person may petition EPA to initiate proceedings for issuance of rules under sections 4, 6, and 8 of TSCA. A section 21 petition must set forth facts which the petitioner believes establish the need for the rules requested. EPA is required to grant or deny the petition within 90 days. If EPA grants the petition, the Agency must promptly commence an appropriate proceeding. If EPA denies the petition, the Agency must publish its reasons in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Within 60 days of denial, the petitioner may commence a civil action in a U.S. district court to compel initiation of the requested rulemaking. For petition for a new rule or order, the court must provide opportunity for the petition to be considered de novo. After hearing the evidence, the court can order EPA to initiate the requested action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relief available under section 21 is limited to initiation of a proceeding to issue, amend, or appeal a rule under section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under section 5(e) or 6(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of Petition and Related Events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received an April 4, 1994, letter from Petitioner labeled ``TSCA&hyph;21.'' That letter provided no details and requested no action, but simply asserted that EPA had failed to respond to a Petition on December 6, 1993. The Agency has no record of correspondence from Petitioner dated December 6th. The April 4 letter was accompanied by a second letter, dated November 26, 1993, but first received with the April letter that is also designated as a TSCA section 21 petition. The petition does not expressly request any action, but instead recounts Petitioner's experiences in seeking relief from a chronically overflowing drainage ditch that runs adjacent to his property line. The petition also references and notes that EPA had not responded to an earlier July 14, 1993 letter on the same matter Petitioner had sent to the EPA Region 6 Office in Dallas, Texas. The July 14 letter chronicled Petitioner's experiences in seeking relief from the Del City authorities, stated his intent to be compensated for past damages, and referred to three sections (308, 309, and 326) of the Clean Water Act. While neither the section 21 Petition nor the July 14, 1993 letter request any specific actions from EPA, the Agency believes it is reasonable to infer from both that Petitioner seeks action to prevent the drainage ditch from periodically overflowing into his home.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fact, EPA's Region 6 Office did respond to Petitioner's July letter on December 7, 1993. That response noted efforts made by EPA, the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality, and Del City to correct the collection system deficiencies; informed Petitioner that EPA had issued an Administrative Order in February of 1992, requiring the Del City Municipal Service Authority to complete construction of the collection system improvements by the end of 1993 (Docket No. VI&hyph;921246); and concluded by suggesting that Petitioner inform the Del City Municipal Service Authority and/or EPA if sanitation sewer overflows occurred after that date, providing specific information on location(s), date/time(s), and circumstances of such events.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Disposition of Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The petition is denied because it did not request rulemaking under TSCA section 4, 6, or 8, or an order under TSCA section 5(e) or 6(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The problem described, moreover, is not amenable to those authorities. Notwithstanding denial of the petition, the Agency has investigated Petitioner's complaints and provided relief. The problem described by Petitioner is being addressed by EPA Region 6 under the Clean Water Act, and Petitioner has been expressly requested to bring any further occurrences of the problem to the attention of the Del City Municipal Authority and/or the EPA Regional Office. Petitioner has not reported on, nor is the Agency aware of, any incidents that have occurred after December 31, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JURY'S NOT GUILTY VERDICT IN MCMARTIN PRE-SCHOOL CASE  </P> <P> The verdict is in. Not only was Peggy McMartin Buckey found innocent, but the  other five female teachers who were originally prosecuted were dismissed  because of "incredibly weak evidence."  </P> <P> These innocent defendants have suffered greatly because of this modern-day  witch hunt. It is fortunate that our legal system prevented their unjust  conviction in view of the tremendous adverse publicity generated by the media.  </P> <P> I think that it is both just and reasonable that the City of Manhattan Beach  and County of Los Angeles consider appropriating a substantial sum of money to  compensate these defendants for their huge financial losses. They can never be  compensated for the suffering which they have had to endure due to their  prosecution.  </P> <P> As to Ray Buckey, a cloud of doubt still hangs over his head, but he has  already suffered five years of jail and has not been convicted of any crime.  The remaining charges against him should be promptly dismissed.  </P> <P> ALLAN M. MANNHEIM  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

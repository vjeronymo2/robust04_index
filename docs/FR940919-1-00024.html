			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the measures in this rule, discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 7 would add localized depletion to the FMP's list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems in the snapper-grouper fishery. It would add FMP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives to evaluate and minimize localized depletion and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify the framework procedure for implementing or adjusting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain management measures to allow the Council to react more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quickly to changing resource conditions. The proposed change to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the framework procedure would allow the Council to initiate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement necessary changes at any time during the fishing year  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of only prior to each fishing year. Revision of 50 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 646 is not required to effect these changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background and rationale for the additional measures in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Amendment 7, and for the measures in this rule, discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are contained in Amendment 7, the availability of which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 42570, August 18, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Additional Measures Proposed by NMFS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to change the title of part 646 to ``Snapper-Grouper Fishery Off the Southern Atlantic States,'' with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concomitant changes of the language in the codified text, to more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correctly indicate the geographical scope of the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The address in the definition of ``Regional Director'' would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed to reflect a recent move.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that an applicant for a dealer permit for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wreckfish must have a physical facility at a fixed location would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be changed to clarify that such facility must be for the receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of fish, rather than merely a mailing address.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 304(a)(1)(D) of the Magnuson Act requires NMFS to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publish regulations proposed by a Council within 15 days of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receipt of the amendment and regulations. At this time, NMFS has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not determined that the amendment these rules would implement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the national standards, other provisions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Magnuson Act, and other applicable laws. NMFS, in making that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, will take into account the data, views, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received during the comment period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been determined to be not significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of E.O. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant General Counsel for Legislation and Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Department of Commerce certified to the Chief Counsel for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a substantial number of small entities because neither gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revenues nor compliance costs would be significantly changed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All participants in the fishery are small entities. As a result,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule contains three collection-of-information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act_namely,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications for charter vessel/headboat permits, applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for dealer permits, and applications for experimental fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permits. These requirements have been submitted to the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. The public reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdens for these collections of information are estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average 20 minutes, 5 minutes, and 1 hour per response,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively, including the time for reviewing instructions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection-of-information. Send comments regarding these reporting burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates or any other aspect of these collections of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, including suggestions for reducing the burdens, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS and OMB (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 646  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fisheries, Fishing, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: September 13, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gary Matlock, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Program Management Officer, National Marine Fisheries Service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 50 CFR part 646 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

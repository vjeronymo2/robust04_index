			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Bosnia peace on Tuesday, says Owen LORD OWEN, the international mediator, yesterday gave his strongest indication to date that a peace agreement could be close in Bosnia, when he said he expected the three warring sides to sign a deal when they meet in Sarajevo on Tuesday. Speaking in Macedonia on an intense round of diplomatic lobbying, Lord Owen said: 'I expect that the agreement will be signed on Tuesday. It will be a very difficult agreement, but it must be signed.' The accord that the three sides have been asked to 'consider signing' on Tuesday proposes a loose 'union' of three ethnic mini-states, with provisions for the states to secede at a later date. With many of the territorial issues still apparently unresolved, the tactics of the mediators now appear to be to press for an outline peace settlement, hoping that the final boundary details can be worked out at a later date. But, as an indicator of the problems that will dog any deal, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnian president, reiterated that he will not sign a deal without further territorial concessions. The latest round of peace talks broke down three weeks ago, when Serb and Croat leaders refused the Bosnian government's demand for an extra 4 per cent of territory, on top of the 28 per cent which the agreement now offers them. Although the commanders of the Moslem and Croat forces in Bosnia yesterday agreed to a ceasefire, due to take effect at 10 am GMT today, fierce fighting between Moslem and Croat forces was reported to be continuing in central Bosnia, around the cities of Mostar and Vitez. By way of a separate blow to the peace process, Serb forces were also reported to have shelled Knin, in the Serb-controlled Krajina enclave, in Croatia.</p>

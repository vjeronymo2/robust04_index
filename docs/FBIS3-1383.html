			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Peter de Ionno] </F>   [Text] Disgruntled South African nuclear and rocket  scientists are threatening to expose closely guarded secrets  about the country's arms programme unless they are paid  R[Rand]4.5-million in retrenchment benefits.    A spokesman claiming to represent 16 scientists admitted  this  week the threat amounted to blackmail.    "We want a settlement but negotiation has failed and we  don't  want to have to take this to the industrial court. Our  disclosures will prove embarrassing for Armscor [Armaments  Corporation of South Africa], Denel (an off-shoot of Armscor)  and the Nationalist government," he warned.    The group has unreleased details about South Africa's past  co-operation with Israel on missile technology. Some of this  challenges claims by President F.W. de Klerk last year tLat he  had come clean on the country's nuclear story.    The 16 scientists are preparing an appeal to the industrial  court in which they are demanding two years' salaries and  benefits from Denel.    They were retrenched with two months' notice from Advena, a  Denel subsidiary, on April 15 last year. They claim they were  promised another two year's work.    The spokesman, who asked not to be named at present, said  their firsthand information would identify sources of  specialised equipment for nuclear bombs in the United Kingdom,  France and Germany.    He also claimed Israel supplied rock technology and details  of a process which transformed a satellite launcher into a  nuclear ballistic missile.    And in a move which could realise the arms industry's  greatest fear -- nuclear weapons scientists selling secrets to  rogue nations or terrorists -- the spokesman said the group  would construct bombs for anyone, if their salaries were  guaranteed.    When Mr de Klerk announced the destruction of South Africa's  nuclear capability a year ago, he was adamant that no foreign  help was used in the weapons' programme. But he made no mention  of missile delivery capability.    Now the spokesman for the maverick scientists claims South  Africa's defunct space programme was originally intended to use  a clone of the Israeli Jericho II two-stage solid fuel missile  to deliver nuclear weapons.    Two all-terrain mobile launchers were build and tested at  Armscor's proving group at Advena in 1988 and 1989. They were  never used. The missile, last codenamed RSA3, was only fired in  static tests.    The spokesman said more than 200 South Africans visited  Israel covertly and worked on the missile programme between 1989  and 1992.    In a multi-million rand deal, Israel had sold South Africa a  system of explosives that could stop the missile in mid-flight  at a predetermined point, allowing it to fall on to a target  city with an accuracy of less than one kilometre.    In October 1989, publicly expressed concerns by US  officials,  including President George Bush, about Israeli and South African  collaboration on a medium-range nuclear missile were denied by  both countries.    The spokesman said that after the initial 18-kiloton (18,000  tons of TNT) "dirty" bombs were completed, development of more  powerful nuclear weapons continued in secret at SADF [South  African Defense Force] insistence until late 1989 when Mr de  Klerk ordered that the programme be stopped.    These more powerful nuclear weapons included thermo-nuclear  hydrogen bombs.    "What is the deterrent value of a 20-kiloton bomb when your  enemy is threatening you with a 100-kiloton bomb?" the scientist  asked.    The spokesman, who identified himself as a supporter of the  right wing, said: "Some of us and many in the SADF [South  African Defense Force] strongly believed that a couple of bombs  should have been held back and kept in white hands."    The spokesman said: "I am not ashamed of what we did, but I  cannot get a job. We are treated like outcasts. We are South  Africa's nuclear casualties."    He had applied for 50 jobs and five of the rest of the group  were unemployed.    The international implications of the scientists' threats  are  severe. Revealing suppliers would tarnish South Africa's  credibility in the secrecy-obsessed international arms market  and cause controversy in the countries involved.    The involvement of South African expertise in outlaw weapons  programme would raise great international concern and possible  conflict with the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has  overseen South Africa's nuclear rehabilitation.    A Denel spokesman confirmed yesterday that 16 employees were  contesting termination of their service. Negotiations had  failed because of their "unfounded and unreasonable claims and  expectations".    Intimidation through the media left Denel disillussioned at  the conduct of people "with high technology standing for whom  Denel has only the highest regard and sympathy," the spokesman  said.</p>

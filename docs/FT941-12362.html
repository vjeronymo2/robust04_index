			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Issue of university bonds considered Universities are preparing a blueprint for a financial vehicle company which would raise funds from the capital markets through bond issues. A group of university principals has been appointed to decide how the vehicle company, which would be funded by a consortium of universities, should be established. The group will also examine restrictions on univers-ities borrowing against their assets. They said the move was necessary to fund capital building projects after the sharp expansion in student numbers over the past five years, which they said had not been balanced by increased government funding. The cost of the projects was estimated to be at least Pounds 3.2bn by the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals last year. Figures published today by the universities show that the number of graduates will rise by 40 per cent between 1992 and 1995, with no reduction in growth until 1997. Over this period, the number of business and financial studies graduates will rise by 60 per cent, while graduates in 'studies allied to medicine' will rise by 77 per cent. The committee is backing the project, in conjunction with the higher education funding councils - government quangos responsible for distributing funds to universities - and the Northern Ireland education department.

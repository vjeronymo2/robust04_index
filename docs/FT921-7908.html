			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / International Company News: San Paolo, Fondiaria in rights issue link-up THE bonds between Italy's biggest banks and insurance companies are to tighten further with a wide-ranging accord between Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the big Turin-based financial institution, and the Fondiaria group, the country's second biggest private-sector insurer. The link will come through a rights issue of up to L463bn (Dollars 374.2m) by Milano Assicurazioni, one of Fondiaria's stock market quoted subsidiaries, which is to issue 22.2m new ordinary shares and 15.2m savings shares. As part of the deal, San Paolo will raise from 6 per cent to around 20 per cent its stake in Milano Assicurazioni. No details of how the increase would take place were revealed. However, it is likely that some, if not all, the shares will come from Fondiaria, which currently owns 63 per cent of Milano Assicurazioni. Fondiaria said it would 'participate' in the rights issue but did not make clear whether it would take up all its rights, saying only that it 'would retain control of' Milano Assicurazioni. The new stock will be offered to shareholders on a one-for-two basis with an additional one savings share being offered for every eight shares of either category. A premium for the new shares, which will have a nominal value of L1,000 each, has yet to be decided. As part of the link-up, Milano Assicurazioni will sell a variety of life and non-life insurance products through the San Paolo group, expanding an existing alliance. The deal involves both San Paolo and the group's two big regional banking subsidiaries, covering around 775 branches in all. Fondiaria, which is a one-third shareholder in an important joint venture formed with Royal Insurance of the UK and Aachener and Munchener of Germany, said the agreement with San Paolo would roughly double premium income at Milano Assicurazioni to over L200bn a year.</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILWAUKEE PAPER PULLS ADS RAPPED AS ETHNIC SLUR  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Journal has pulled advertisements featuring Polish leader Lech  Walesa speaking in broken English after complaints that the ad amounted to an  ethnic slur.  </P> <P> The Journal used newspaper, television and radio advertisements featuring  Walesa and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to promote its new page  designs, unveiled in April.  </P> <P> The Walesa newspaper advertisement on April 23 showed a photo of the founder of  Poland's Solidarity movement with the words: "Very long I have hoped for  changes so significant as those in new Milwaukee Journal."  </P> <P> The Thatcher ad pictures the prime minister with the words, "Why yes, the  American colonies have progressed. Consider the recent changes in your  Milwaukee Journal."  </P> <P> Both ads involved contrived quotes.  </P> <P> Robert Dye, spokesman for the Journal, said that the ads were intended to be  "lighthearted spoofs" and that both were pulled.  </P></p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Devenish says 17% rise will bolster it against Boddington bid JA DEVENISH, the West Country-based pub operator, yesterday said its 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year ending September 30 put it out of reach of its rival Boddington which last year launched an unsuccessful bid. Profits rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 13.6m on increased sales from continuing activities of Pounds 72.7m, against Pounds 62.4m for the same period last time. Mr Michael Cannon, chairman, said he regarded Boddington's decision to hold on to its 19.5 per cent stake as 'hostile' and said Devenish had already prepared its defence against a possible second bid from Boddington. 'I think our result has made it too expensive for Boddington to try for us again. But we are prepared to fight off any cheap bid,' he said. Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's chairman, said he could draw no 'particular significance' from Devenish's full-year results. Boddington is to keep its 19.5 per cent stake in Devenish for 'strategic reasons'. He said Devenish's operating profit was only marginally ahead in spite of an increase in the number of pubs from 376 to 532. 'I guess Devenish's management must be a bit disappointed with only a small increase in operating profits from pubs given the large increase in its estate,' said Mr Cassidy. Devenish's pre-tax profits were boosted by an increase in the share of associated undertakings and a Pounds 1.2m fall in the interest charge to Pounds 3m. The withdrawal from wholesaling and brands realised around Pounds 25m which was used to acquire more pubs. Mr Cannon said he was opposed to Boddington's diversification into hotels and nursing homes in spite of the group's recent 50 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the half-year to June 27, from Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 11.3m. He said the Ashdown family, which owns more than 10 per cent of Devenish and could be instrumental in deciding the outcome of another bid, had told him they were pleased with the company's results. The final dividend is to be increased to 6.35p, from 5.05p, giving a total of 7.85p - a 25 per cent increase on the previous year. Fully diluted earnings per share increased to 18.73p, against 16.02p last time. Details, Page 17</p>

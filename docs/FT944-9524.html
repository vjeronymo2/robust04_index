			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: Minorco wins battle for Lisheen project A bitter battle for control of the Lisheen project in County Tipperary, Ireland, the second-largest zinc-lead deposit in Europe, has ended in victory for Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American-De Beers group of South Africa, and Ivernia West, a junior Irish company, writes Kenneth Gooding. Minorco has paid Ivernia Dollars 77m to acquire 50 per cent and management control of Lisheen. Ivernia immediately beforehand paid Dollars 77m cash to Chevron to buy the US oil group's 52.5 per cent stake. Ivernia says it thereby has lifted its share of the Lisheen project by 2.5 per cent, to 50 per cent, at no net cost to itself. The struggle for Lisheen developed because Chevron in 1992 agreed to sell its controlling stake to Lac Minerals of Canada. Ivernia claimed to have pre-emptive rights over Chevron's shareholding. But this claim had to be tested in the Irish High Court which in September ruled in Ivernia's favour. Lisheen is expected to have a life of 13 to 15 years producing an annual 155,000 tonnes of zinc, at a relatively low cash cost of 30 cents a lb. Capital expenditure is estimated at USDollars 184m and start-up is scheduled for early 1997. Minorco owns 24.5 per cent of Ivernia, as does Outokumpu, the Finnish resources group.</p>

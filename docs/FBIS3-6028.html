Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), exchanged views with the JNP  legislators of both the House of Representative and the House of  Councillors at a restaurant in Tokyo over the political  situation and a future realignment of political parties, they  said.    Ozawa called on those present to step up ties in the  coalition to maintain the Hosokawa administration, the members  said.    Prior to Friday's meeting, he had also met with three other  JNP legislators on Monday, they said.    The powerful politician has been staying out of public sight  since Hosokawa gave up his attempt to make changes to his  seven-month-old cabinet early this month because of strong  opposition from within the coalition and a tight Diet schedule.    Ozawa is widely believed to have urged Hosokawa to push for  the cabinet reshuffle, whose primary purpose was to replace the  premier's chief spokesman and chief of staff, Masayoshi Takemura.    Political sources said the honeymoon between Hosokawa and  Takemura ended last December over their differences on policies.  Speculation has arisen that Hosokawa was tilting in favor of  ties with Ozawa, who is reported to be at odds with Takemura.    Shinseito and Komeito [Clean Government Party], the third  largest coalition bloc, are pursuing establishment of a  two-party political system and insisted on unifying coalition  parties to fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic  Party (LDP) in the next general elections under a new electoral  system mixing single-seat constituencies and proportional  representation.    The largest coalition bloc, the Social Democratic Party  (SDP), as well new party Sakigake (Harbinger) headed by Takemura  and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), meanwhile, are aiming  at multiparty system, but with fewer parties than at present.    The remaining coalition component is the minor United Social  Democratic Party (USDP).</p>

Clinton was met on his arrival by Scalfaro, accompanied by  his daughter Marianna, and after the traditional playing of  respective national anthems and a review of the guards retired  in the Quirinale for their talks.    The American president began his day in Rome with a jog in  the central Villa Borghese park, located close to the embassy  residence of Villa Taverna, along with the Washington ambassador  to Rome, Reginald Bartholomew.

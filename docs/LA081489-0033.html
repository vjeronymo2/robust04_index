			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> The state Office of Emergency Services lifted a five-day earthquake advisory  for San Francisco, saying the likelihood of another earthquake in the area  shaken last week has returned to normal. Shortly after a strong quake jolted  the Bay Area on Tuesday, the office warned that the chances of another  earthquake in the same area would be increased for the next five days. There  were several aftershocks to the magnitude 5.1 earthquake, which caused some  damage and was blamed for one death, but no new shakers.  </P></p>

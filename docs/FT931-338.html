			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Survey of the Republic of Slovenia (3): Now the economy has to adjust - Prospects for lower inflation and higher exports THE disruption of economic ties with former Yugoslavia, over 10 times its size, means that the small, export-oriented economy of Slovenia has been saddled with a severe adjustment problem. War-impoverished markets and the loss of cheap inputs from embargo-afflicted Serbia, coupled with low-wage competition from the former communist central European economies, have left Slovenia with a cost and, above all, income structure which is not justified by current levels of productivity and quality. Per capita GDP dropped from Dollars 8,658 in 1990, when the statistics were inflated by the cheap dollar, to Dollars 6,320 in 1991 and Dollars 6,052 last year. This is far below income levels in neigh- bouring Italy and Austria but much higher than Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, with which Slovenia now competes for foreign investment and for new markets in the recession-hit European community. Incomes have not adjusted to two years of sharply declining GDP, which fell 9.3 per cent in 1991 and 6.5 per cent last year. The drop is due principally to a 12.4 and 13.2 per cent annual decline in industrial output over this period, and a steep decline in tourist revenue, the main source of hard currency income. Wages and salaries, by contrast, rose around 20 per cent last year, reflecting the tradition, inherited from the former Yugoslav self- management system, of awarding pay increases unrelated to productivity. In the past, this has led to rapid inflation and frequent devaluations. But the small team of key economic decision makers headed by Mr Mitja Gaspari, the finance minister, and Mr France Arhar, gover- nor of the Bank of Slovenja, the central bank, are determined that the new republic should break out of the old ways. 'Stabilisation must be the main target, to get inflation down to European levels. Otherwise, there will be no new foreign investment,' Mr Arhar insists. The principal burden of adjustment thus far, however, has fallen on the unemployed as needed structural changes, resulting from privatisation and reform of the banking system, have not really begun to take effect. The unemploy- ment rate rose to 11.6 per cent at the end of the year. It is currently 13 per cent. Last month's tripartite talks between the government, the unions and 'employers', represented in the Chamber of Economy, eventually agreed a wages pact designed to keep income growth below the rise in prices. But Mr Gaspari believes that Slovenia will achieve European-style inflation levels only when property relationships are clarified. This requires the quickest possible transformation of companies with ill-defined 'social capital' into private companies with definite owners and a clear interest in profitability. Until now, the employers' side has been represented by managers, not real owners. Slovenia's privatisation law was approved in November but detailed regulatory legislation is not expected to be in place before mid-year. Each enter- prise is responsible for drawing up its own privatisation prop- osal. These include various forms of management and worker buy-outs, but enter- prises looking for foreign investment will have to draft their proposals more conventionally. The government wants to privatise 400 enterprises this year and nearly 1,600 next year. It is not clear at this stage whether it will be able to achieve its ambitious target. In the meantime, it has just drawn up a tight budget which aims to keep the budget deficit to 1.8 per cent of GDP. This means a deficit of around T21bn, equivalent to Dollars 200m, in a budget of T291bn (Dollars 2.9bn). Reaching this target, which is compatible with keeping inflation down to around 1.6 per cent a month, or 30 per cent on an annual basis, will not be easy. More than 40 per cent of budget outlays are made up of salaries and building a new state is an expensive business. The army, for example, needs re-equip- ping to patrol and defend the new border with former Yugo- slavia. Rising unemployment increases the demand for social safety net spending. Independent economists, such as Mr Joze Mencinger of the Ljubljana University law faculty, believe the economy is bottoming out and should stabilise or show small growth this year, provided the recession in western markets does not affect exports and tourism receipts too adversely. Last year saw a 3 per cent decline in imports, mainly inputs from former Yugoslavia, and an 8 per cent rise in hard currency exports, reflecting a modestly successful shift into EC and Efta markets. The result was a Dollars 161m surplus on the country's Dollars 11bn foreign trade following a Dollars 257m deficit in 1991, according to the central bank. A modest trade surplus and a rebound in foreign tourist receipts after the collapse in 1991 contributed to a current account surplus of Dollars 764m last year, compared with Dollars 190m in 1991. Both helped push foreign exchange reserves sharply higher to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars 365m at the end of 1991. Exporters, squeezed by rising domestic costs and last year's effective 18 per cent revalu- ation of the Slovene tolar, complain bitterly that govern- ment policy is squeezing mar- gins to the bone and discour- aging an export-led recovery. The government remains deaf to their pleas, determined as it is to force enterprises to cut their cost base and become more productive. 'Accum- ulating foreign reserves is tantamount to exporting capital. But it brings in a return of 8 per cent, and until structural reforms bite there are few ways of earning that kind of return on domestic investment,' adds Mr Mencinger, a forceful advocate of floating the tolar and one of the architects of economic policy in the first post- independence government. Looking ahead, the prospects look brighter. Slovenia sur- vived a short but violent indep- endence war with an economy which has proved largely self-contained and with a good infrastructure, including a nuclear power station at Krsko and its own port at Koper on the Adriatic coast. The new republic has man- aged to create a strong, virtually convertible currency backed by strong reserves and a low foreign debt of Dollars 1.74bn. It has become a member of the main international financial institutions and laid down the legislative framework for privatisation, banking and other reforms. It now remains to build on this solid base and move ahead rapidly with the privatisation programme designed to provide the flexibility needed to reduce costs and develop new markets.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Nikolay Venediktov </F> "specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI" under "Contacts" rubric:  "Time To Stake Claims. What Russian Parliamentarians Became  Convinced of in Latin America"]    [Text] Russia is ready for partnership relations with  South America. Convincing the Latin Americans of this was the  main task of a Federation Council delegation's official visit to  Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Ecuador.    The purpose of creating a political climate in Latin America  favorable to Russia is meant to facilitate the development of  mutually advantageous economic and trade relations between our  countries. The great potential of the region, which occupies 13  percent of the globe's land mass with a population of around 450  million people, the complementarity of our economies, and the  similarity of our economic and sociopolitical processes are  preconditions for this. All the leaders of the countries that  the delegation visited spoke of the need to organize strategic  collaboration with Russia. The Brazilian president, for  example, noted that "this is needed to prevent the creation of a  unipolar world." The Brazilians let it be clearly known that it  is time for Russia to "stake its claims" in Latin America.  Unless it lays a long-term basis for Russian-Latin American  relations, the region's leading countries will quite soon "reach  the peak of the world hierarchy without taking Russian  priorities along with them."    Meetings with representatives of Latin American countries'  business circles demonstrated their readiness to cooperate with  Russia primarily in the sphere of private enterprise. Here they  stressed the importance of the "sponsorship" of future projects  by presidents, foreign ministries, and other official state  authorities. The Russian side also believes that relations in  the private sector can to some extent compensate for the  transitional difficulties in foreign economic ties with Latin  America associated with the crisis in the previous model of the  Russian economy.    In order to facilitate these contacts there must be a  renewal  of the legal and treaty base of relations with Latin American  countries. Treaties have already been concluded with a number  of them, and memorandums have been adopted on the principles of  bilateral cooperation. Draft agreements on protecting  investment and avoiding double taxation are being elaborated  with many of them. These questions have been repeatedly raised  at meetings between the Russian delegation and their Latin  American colleagues and entrepreneurs. They are very important  as regards developing trade and increasing the volume of  investment in the Russian economy.    The Latin American market is also fruitful for Russia from  the viewpoint of high technology. Venezuela has great  experience in the sphere of oil extraction and refining, and it  is recommissioning once-abandoned wells by using the latest  technologies. Brazil is ready to cooperate with us in the  aerospace and nuclear power generating spheres.    Finally, we must not forget Peru, Nicaragua, and Cuba --  Russia's debtors. We must seek a settlement in relations with  these countries in order to recover the people's billions:  These countries' total debt is estimated at over $20 billion.    The changes that have taken place in the world are forcing  Russia to look at the former Third World in a different way.  The countries of this vast region in the Western Hemisphere  will no longer be an arena for rivalry between the  "superpowers." At any rate, for as long as a democratic Russia  exists.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / UN's Somalia envoy offers to quit in row MR Mohammad Sahnoun, the United Nations special envoy for Somalia, has offered to resign after being reprimanded by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general. Mr Sahnoun has been sharply critical of the UN's handling of the breakdown of law and order in Somalia and the subsequent famine, which is claiming an estimated 1,000 lives a day. A highly regarded Algerian former ambassador to Washington and Paris, Mr Sahnoun enjoys the confidence of the Security Council, key members of which hoped to find a compromise satisfactory to the two men. He was under strong pressure last night from member states to carry on with his duties in a country that has posed multiple problems for the UN. Commenting on the resignation offer, Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, current president of the Security Council, said it would be hard to find a UN official for Somalia who would be so effective. American diplomats said they hoped Mr Sahnoun could be persuaded to stay on. In television interviews and other statements during a visit to New York last week Mr Sahnoun faulted the UN for sitting on its hands for months after the downfall of Mr Siad Barre, the former Somali leader, in January 1991. He went so far as to call for an international investigation of the tardy response and mishandling of the situation. Mr Sahnoun recently accompanied Irish President Mary Robinson on a tour of Somalia and the Kenyan border. Afterwards, she joined the critics, particularly faulting the UN refugee agency for failing to provide even basic facilities in camps in northern Kenya. The secretary-general's break with Mr Sahnoun, who has returned to Mogadishu, apparently reflects bitter feelings in international relief agencies, which strongly resented the envoy's criticisms. Ironically, Mr Boutros Ghali has also been strongly critical of the Security Council's role in the Somali crisis. Earlier this year he said its actions were too little and too late. It is the secretary-general's first serious staff dispute since he took office in January.</p>

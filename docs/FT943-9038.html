			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Lira crumbles The D-Mark yesterday walked tall on foreign exchanges as investors sought refuge from market volatility by moving into the German currency, writes Philip Gawith. All leading currencies weakened against the D-Mark, both in Europe and beyond, but the most prominent victim was the Italian lira which tumbled to record low of L1,030 against the D-Mark before recovering slightly to close in London at L1,026 from L1,005 on Thursday. The Swedish krona fell to SKr 5.037 against the D-Mark before closing at SKr5.008. Both currencies were heavily punished for their central banks' decisions on Thursday to raise rates, which the market considered misguided. Foreign exchange volumes were at their heaviest for a number of weeks, but traders said they fell short of panic selling. Weaker currencies were matched by a general firming of interest rates, and a further deterioration of sentiment in futures markets. Portugal was the only country to lift its interest rates, with the repo rate on seven - day funds rising to 11.08 per cent from 10.5 per cent. The release of weaker than expected July consumer price data helped US bonds, and hence the dollar, which closed at Y99.99, off an earlier low of Y99.60, but down from Thursday's close of Y101.115. Against the D-Mark it finished at DM1.5557 from DM1.5872. Sterling was also a victim of D-Mark strength, falling below DM2.40 before recovering to close at DM2.4061. Against the dollar it finished at Dollars 1.5467. Traders downplayed comparisons with the ERM crisis of 1992 and also said the actions of Italy and Sweden should not be mistaken as a signal of immediate rate rises across Europe. Apart from the particularly severe fiscal problems of both countries, many observers also felt, especially in the case of Italy, that the rate rise might testify to a struggle between the central bank and the politicians. Mr Akis Karayiannis, head of foreign exchange at Lehman Brothers in London, said the economic backdrop now was very different from that which caused the ERM crises. Markets then found government promises, to raise interest rates against the backdrop of economies mired in recession, lacking in credibility. But with economies growing again, higher rates are to be expected, even if the timing might be unexpected. Mr Karayiannis said he also doubted whether clients had the level of exposure to European bonds and currencies that would produce the sort of selling pressure seen in earlier crises. While official rates stayed unchanged in Europe, with the exception of Portugal, most cash market rates firmed. In Germany, for example, three, six and one-year rates firmed amid fears of an end to Bundesbank rate cuts. The Bank of England in its daily operations provided UK money markets with Pounds 323m at established rates after forecasting a Pounds 300m shortage. Futures markets lost ground, with the December short sterling contract trading 47,000 lots to close at 93.23 - off a low of 93.17, but well down on Thursday's close of 93.35. The December euromark contract finished at 94.80 from 94.85.</p>

			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAUGUS VICTORY GIVES SPANGLER POINTS LEAD  </P> <P> The Saugus Speedway Sportsman division points race took a surprising turn -- as  did Dave Phipps' 1989 IROC Camaro -- just two laps into Saturday night's 40-lap  main event before a crowd of 3,229.  </P> <P> Phipps, a resident of Simi Valley, entered the evening as the division's points  leader, pursuing an unprecedented third consecutive Sportsman title.  </P> <P> But after making contact with the car of Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley, Phipps'  car slammed into the front straightaway wall and was out of the race before its  pistons had warmed.  </P> <P> Phipps' misfortune left Keith Spangler of Northridge and Will Harper of Tarzana  -- who trailed Phipps by six and seven points, respectively, at the start of  the evening -- battling to assume the points lead.  </P> <P> And Spangler won the battle, holding off Harper to win his third main event of  the season and take an unofficial lead of three points in the seasonal race.  </P> <P> "It happened early," Spangler said of Phipps' crash. "So, I just figured I  could fall out, too. I just tried to think about the race, take it one step at  a time."  </P> <P> Spangler, who started in the second position, moved into the lead after racing  resumed on the second lap. Harper, who started third, was unable to pass  Spangler during the remaining 38 laps, which were delayed by a season-high six  yellow flags.  </P> <P> In the 25-lap Street Stock main event Russ Beckers of Sepulveda sped across a  slippery, wet track to post a victory.  </P> <P> Beckers, who started in the pole position, survived two extended yellow flags  while track crew members swept the one-third-mile paved oval with drying  compound after oil and water had coated the surface.  </P> <P> On Lap 14, the car of Jim Marlewski of Simi Valley spewed oil in the outer  lane, delaying proceedings for 15 minutes. On Lap 17, the car of Greg Benner of  Whittier dumped radiator fluid, creating another lengthy delay.  </P> <P> In addition, Mike Branam of San Fernando forced a red flag on Lap 22 when his  car skidded into the infield without its left rear wheel, which rolled away.  </P> <P> Through it all, Beckers, who entered the evening as the division's points  leader, held on.  </P></p>

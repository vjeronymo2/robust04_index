			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE LAST full day of trading ahead of this morning's expiry of both the Footsie September future and index traded options turned out to be a much calmer and less hectic session, with signs that dealers had already unwound positions, writes Joel Kibazo. The September FT-SE 100 futures contract started trading at 2,992 yesterday, at a slight discount to cash, but quickly declined by a further 8 points as several small sell orders were executed. This done, September moved steadily ahead, gaining a modest premium to cash. Volume was good, but with most of the traders having made an effort to square their books earlier in the week, there was little in the way of basket trading. In spite of today's expiry, the forward month contract continued as the most liquid, showing nearly double the volume recorded in the December contract, which assumes market leadership on Monday. Turnover in September at the official close was 8,029 lots and that in December was 4,625. The near month contract finished at 3,003, leaving a 2-point premium to cash. In traded options, volume remained healthy, reaching 36,467. The FT-SE 100 option traded 14,092 contracts, while the Euro FT-SE saw business of 2,413 lots. Among the stock options, Glaxo led the way in the activities list with a total of 2,447 lots transacted.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a meeting with the press at the Cuban Institute  of Friendship with Peoples [ICAP], Palestinian Ambassador to  Cuba Imad Jad'a discussed matters related to the situation of  the Palestinian people. Reporter (Ilia Sardina) reports further  details:    [Begin recording] [(Sardina)] The Palestinian ambassador  said  the decisive factor and the final objective in his people's  struggle is represented by the national unity which seeks  reconstruction, and also the alleviation of the pain the  Palestinian people have been suffering over the past 45 years of  struggle. He added that the difficulties have not ended and that  everyone's efforts are required for this new stage.    [Jad'a] This is the first time in the history of the  Palestinian people that we will be able to begin building our  sovereignty ourselves. To achieve this, we need everyone's  cooperation, primarily from the Palestinian people, to work as  hard as possible for Palestine. Today we have a good chance to  work for Palestine because we have always lived in pain and we  have always had to work for the unity of Palestine, as a facade,  while it was really for the Arab reconciliation.    [(Sardina)] The ambassador also referred to the difficulties  they will have to face.    [Jad'a] It was relatively easy for Palestinian guerrillas to  put on their ammunition belts and [words indistinct] a tank. But  today it is more difficult to unite those Palestinians to build  a school, where those little boys who have spent eight years of  the intifada on the streets, will study. This is what I mean by  difficulties. It means the need for serious work, for help from  our true friends.    And speaking of our true friends, I can never forget the  role  Cuba has always played in supporting the rights of the  Palestinian people. Today, I can also extend the good news to  all: We have signed some agreements for economic and political  cooperation in the future.    We are also preparing for an exchange of visits by  Palestinian delegations to Cuba, and vice versa, to see how we  can develop and improve, and how to channel Palestinian-Cuban  relations.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed  regret today over the decision by the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea (DPRK) to change fuel rods at its 5-megawatt  experimental nuclear reactor.    "It's extremely regrettable that North Korea (DPRK) gave  notification it will unilaterally begin changing the fuel rods  at its nuclear reactor," said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Chang  Ki-ho.    The DPRK has notified the United States and the  International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) respectively that it could no longer  defer removal of the nuclear fuel rods from its reactor for  technical reasons.    But in its letter to the IAEA, Pyongyang said it has "just  begun" the process and the agency still has time to choose the  rods and place them under inspection for future measurement.    Seoul, Washington and the IAEA have claimed that changing  the  rods without IAEA supervision would end the dialogue and place  the DPRK nuclear issue in the United Nations Security Council.    "The South Korean Government emphasizes to North Korea the  importance of sampling and securing the rods as demanded by the  IAEA and reminds it that the nuclear problem should not be taken  to a destructive stage by North Korea's unilateral changing of  the fuel rods," Chang said.    He expressed support for the IAEA dispatching an inspection  team to the DPRK and urged Pyongyang to negotiate with the  agency on the replacement of the rods at the nuclear reactor and  to carry out its "full obligations."    Postponement of the refueling is a condition for the IAEA  inspection of the DPRK's nuclear facilities. The agency told  Pyongyang earlier this week it would send an inspection team "on  the assumption" that the DPRK was deferring the changing of the  rods.    Officials here said that the uncertainty over the nuclear  reactor is making the IAEA uneasy about sending the inspection  team.    They said that it remains unclear whether the IAEA will go  ahead and send the team to Pyongyang this weekend or wait for an  official reply from the DPRK before deciding.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Airports launch expansion plans Liverpool and Manchester airports yesterday made applications for expansion. The airports are less than 30 miles apart and it is expected that only one plan will be approved. Manchester wants a second runway to double its capacity of 15m passengers a year. Liverpool, with fewer than 750,000 passengers a year, wants to expand to 6m passengers by 2010 and 12m by 2030.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francisco Alves Filho and Peter Moon: "Tropical </F> Paradise"]    [Text] Russian scientists "imported" by  the CNP [National Research Council] are testing life in Brazil  and approving of it. Now they want to stay.    Scientists have no fatherland and science belongs to  humanity. Those two maxims are taken literally by the over 40  professors and researchers who have settled in Brazil over the  past two years. Bankrolled by scholarships from the National  Research Council, they are gradually adapting to the daily  routine at Brazilian universities and losing the suspicion that  the assignment would be no more than a brief experiment  involving half a dozen nobodies. They are optimistic and seem to  have forgotten the meaning of the term "goska" -- the feeling  that we usually describe as "homesickness" or "nostalgia" --  when they talk about the possibility of returning to Russia.  They want to stay in our country as long as they have the  opportunity to work.    The distance separating Brazil from a country where  professors are paid a dignified salary is the same as that  separating Rio de Janeiro from Moscow. Be that as it may, it  must indeed be impossible to feel nostalgic about jobs paying an  average of $80 per month. Physicist Gregory Surdutovich, 56, was  one of the first to arrive. He landed in Brazil in January 1992,  impelled by the political instability and drastic cut in science  budgets in Russia. Deteriorating conditions were causing  salaries to plummet. Despite the shortcomings, he believes that  Brazilian research can be improved. "The climate in the  Brazilian scientific area today resembles that in my country 35  years ago," says Surdutovich, who is studying the pressure of  light on atoms at the Sao Carlos campus of the University of Sao  Paulo (USP). Artur Elfimov, 50, the leader of a group of five  Russian experts on plasma physics working at the Rio de Janeiro  State University (UERJ), agrees. "If the administrators really  give their support, this country will be able to make up for  lost time in several areas of knowledge," he believes.    The researchers are a varied group. Galina Pugacheva and  Anatoliy Gusev of the Campinas State University (Unicamp) are  studying anomalies in the Brazilian magnetic field. Those  phenomena cause the number of lightning flashes in our  atmosphere to be 50 percent higher than anywhere else on the  planet. Five other Russian scientists are assigned to work at  the North Fluminense State University (UENF), which was opened  on Monday 28 March. They are interested in producing synthetic  diamonds. Under a plan by Senator Darcy Ribeiro (PDT [Democratic  Labor Party], Rio de Janeiro), the UENF's mentor, another 15  researchers from the former Soviet Republic [as published] will  soon join the team.    In the opinion of many people, "importing" Russian  scientists  means saving time and money. "Training a professional at that  level requires at least eight years of heavy investment at a  cost that is never below $200,000," says Carlos Augusto Azevedo,  head of the Department of Quantum Electronics at the UERJ.  "Moreover, it will not take a long time for the work of these  researchers to produce results," he adds. "That immigration has  already yielded excellent results for us," says Oscar Hipolito,  director of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry at the Sao  Carlos campus of the USP.    But all that enthusiasm comes up against an obstacle: the  law  prohibiting the hiring of foreigners as government employees.  That restriction, detested by the scientific community, has made  it necessary for the Russian scientists to stay here as visiting  professors on one- to two-year scholarships that pay from $1,000  to $2,000 per month. Rectors and professors are attacking the  ban on the basis of the constitutional principle of university  autonomy. Their arguments began bearing fruit with the  recruitment of physicist Dmitri Gitma, who was hired by the USP  in 1992 after passing a competitive examination.    Gitma is an exception, however. All the other Russian  researchers are here on scholarships, and many of them are  experiencing an additional difficulty in order to teach in  Brazil: inflation. Physicist Irina Potapenko of the UERJ left  Russia two years ago. Her salary, like that of state employees,  is adjusted according to the dollar rate every three months. "I  live in an apartment provided by the university. But even so,  the lag in pay means that there is only enough money for the  upkeep fees and survival." Although her pay is eaten up by  rising prices, she admits that she is satisfied with her work  and is not thinking of leaving the country. When people draw her  attention to legal and economic difficulties, she answers with  the smile of someone who is already beginning to understand the  Brazilian soul: "Take it easy! After all, Brazil is ours."</p>

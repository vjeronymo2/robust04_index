			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, may 12 (XINHUA) -- A mobile telephone  network will cover the whole of north China's Hebei Province by  the end of the year.    An agreement to import mobile telecommunications equipment  with a total capacity of more than 70,000 terminals from the  Ericsson Radio System AB of Sweden was signed here Tuesday.    Officials from the Hebei Provincial Posts and  Telecommunications Bureau said that upon completion of the  installation by the end of this year, mobile telephone calls  from any of all 103 counties and cities in the province will  automatically reach receivers in neighboring Tianjin and Beijing  cities.    The province built its first mobile telecommunications  system  in 1987. However, by the end of April this year, the total  number of mobile phone users topped 17,000.    The agreement, which is the third import transaction with  the  Swedish company, involves some 28.59 million U.S. dollars.    Wei Enhong, director of the provincial telecommunications  bureau, said that the province is set to install more mobile  phones in the coming few years to meet increasing demands. By  1998, the expected number of mobile phone users will top  300,000, some 17.5 times the existing number.</p>

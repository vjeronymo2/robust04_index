			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Warner-Wellcome starts its European operations The European operations of Warner-Wellcome, the new consumer health joint venture between Wellcome of the UK and Warner-Lambert of the US, came into being yesterday, two weeks after being given the go-ahead from the European Commission. 'We received a 'comfort letter' from the Commission indicating that there were no objections,' said Mr James Cochran, European operations director of Wellcome. The Commission said in March that it was reviewing the deal. A letter of intent was signed by the two companies in July 1993 and the North American arm of the operation came into existence in January 1994. Warner-Wellcome is 50-50 owned by the two partners in Europe and 70 per cent owned by Warner-Lambert in the US. Mr John Walsh, president of Warner-Lambert's consumer products division, said the venture should double its worldwide sales of over-the-counter medicines from a current level of Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in the next five years. The European operation will sell a range of products including Listerine mouthwash, Actifed cold treatment and Zovirax, Wellcome's anti-viral drug for use on cold sores. Mr Walsh said that the market for OTC products would grow from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 40bn a year by 2000. The joint venture's sales would double over five years thanks to 'switch products' - prescription drugs such as Zovirax that receive approval for OTC sales. The venture has a licence from Glaxo to sell an OTC version of the world's biggest selling prescription drug - Zantac, the ulcer treatment. Zovirax is yet to receive OTC approval in the US. The terms of the contract between Wellcome and Warner-Lambert provide for a review of the joint venture if the drug fails to secure approval. The company will be seeking further licences to sell OTC versions of prescription drugs, said Mr Cochran, although none were close to being secured. The OTC market would grow quickly because individuals wanted to be able to treat themselves without having to consult a doctor, he added.</p>

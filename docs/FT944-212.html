			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Unisys to cut workforce by 4,000 Unisys, the US computer company, said it would eliminate about 4,000 jobs, or about 8.5 per cent of its workforce, as part of its transition from a proprietary mainframe computer business to a provider of information management services. It said it would take a fourth-quarter pre-tax charge of between Dollars 175m and Dollars 225m. In the fourth quarter last year, Unisys reported net income of of Dollars 117.7m, or 53 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 2.1bn. The job cuts will be made in Europe and the US. 'The repositioning will focus on our European business, our worldwide equipment maintenance business, and on product areas . . . where we have significantly improved our efficiency,' Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive, said. In Europe, the company has suffered from slowing sales of mainframe computers. Although Unisys has seen stronger European demand for desktop computers, these carry a lower profit margin. In March, Unisys appointed Mr Malcolm Coster, a former Coopers and Lybrand consultant, to head its European operations. Mr Unruh said the new executive would 'take steps to focus the business on growth opportunities and improve programme execution'. The restructuring announced yesterday is, in part, the result of this effort, the company said. Unisys returned to profitability in 1992 after three years of heavy losses. The company has been attempting to expand its systems integration and information services business to compensate for declining mainframe sales. Mr Unruh said that during the second half of this year the company had achieved revenue growth in information services and in the sale of departmental computers and desktop systems. 'However, a slowing in the traditional hardware sales and maintenance business and profit pressures in our European operations have led to a disappointing financial performance in 1994,' he said. Information management services represented 25 per cent of Unisys's total revenue, Mr Unruh said, making it the largest business sector. Sales of departmental and desktop computers are also increasing. 'Our plans call for these growth businesses to provide nearly half of the commercial revenue of Unisys in 1995. 'As they become an ever larger part of the total company, the traditional infrastructure must be far more streamlined and efficient,' Mr Unruh said.</p>

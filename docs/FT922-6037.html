			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / EC moves closer to trade ban on Serbia as Major speaks out THE European Community last night moved closer to a trade ban and other sanctions against Serbia as officials of the 12 member nations, meeting in Brussels, agreed on recommendations to ministers. The drive for sanctions gained further momentum as Mr John Major, visiting central Europe, condemned the role of Serbian forces in provoking ethnic conflict in breakaway Yugoslav republics. Before leaving Warsaw for Prague, the prime minister called for mandatory United Nations sanctions to force an end to the fighting. British officials travelling with Mr Major said ambassadors of UN Security Council nations in New York had prepared a draft UN sanctions resolution against Serbia. But France was said to be resisting the inclusion of oil trade in any package of sanctions. The officials gathered in Brussels left open whether the EC should act alone or through the UN. Their recommended package of sanctions will be scrutinised at a meeting of EC ambassadors today, but EC ministers might not meet until next week to decide on it. Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, called at the weekend for tough sanctions against Serbia, and both the US and Canada have cut air links with Belgrade. EC countries and the US have already announcing withdrawal of diplomats from Belgrade. Mr Major made clear Britain was pressing for mandatory measures including an oil embargo, a break in civil air links with Belgrade and more general trade sanctions. He was aware when he made his remarks that France is reluctant to agree to significant sanctions. But he indicated Britain was determined to press ahead regardless. His calculation is that Paris will not in the end be able to resist international pressure for sanctions. Mr Major set out a series of conditions which the west should demand before lifting a threat against Serbia. They included a ceasefire in the breakaway republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbian action to control its irregular forces, resumption of constitutional talks and guarantees to let refugees return home. Echoing the hard line taken by Washington on international sanctions, Mr Major demanded also that troops of the Yugoslav federal army be withdrawn from the republic of Croatia. Diplomats in Brussels said France wanted any trade embargo, particularly on oil, to be channelled through the Security Council. France argued that because the EC supplied only about 10 per cent of Serbia's oil, an embargo would work only if backed by such countries as Iran, China and Russia. In an effort to head off the campaign for sanctions, Serbia promised to 'do its utmost' to get humanitarian aid to Bosnia. At the same time Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, announced a deal in Sarajevo to reopen the blockaded city's airport. He said a ceasefire would take effect today so that emergency supplies of food and medicines could be flown in. The airport has been under blockade since early April, first by the federal army and now by Serbian irregulars.</p>

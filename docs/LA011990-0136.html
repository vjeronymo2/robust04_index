			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHICKEN RANCHER HAS BONE TO PICK OVER NEW USDA ORDER  </P> <P> Rocky the Range Chicken has been ordered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture  to become de-ranged, and its owners are squawking.  </P> <P> For five years, Bart and Patricia Ehman's Pine Ridge Ranch, perched atop a hill  dotted with 60-year-old apple orchards in rural Sonoma County about 65 miles  north of San Francisco, has been shipping chickens under the Rocky the Range  Chicken label. The Ehmans boast that "Rocky is raised on a vegetarian diet and  allowed to run outdoors in a stress-free environment."  </P> <P> They contend that raising the birds this way makes them juicier and tastier  than commercial birds that remain cooped up for their few short weeks on earth  and get frequent injections of antibiotics.  </P> <P> Despite selling for a hefty premium over standard chickens, Rocky "free-range"  birds have become popular with many upscale restaurants and groceries. The  Ehmans lately have been hoping to expand distribution in Los Angeles and San  Diego.  </P> <P> Enter the USDA, which, after a review of several months, decreed that as of  last Monday the couple could no longer use "range" or "stress free" on their  Rocky labels.  </P> <P> The Ehmans fear that the change threatens their young business because they  won't be able to tell potential customers about the special merits right on the  package.  </P> <P> But the USDA maintains that "ill-defined terms" can mislead consumers and that  the government would be unable to verify the accuracy of such claims, according  to Jim Greene, a spokesman for the agency's Food Safety and Inspection Service.  </P> <P> "There are probably about half a dozen terms that we don't allow on meat and  poultry products," he added. "What's the use of having something on a label  that can't be enforced?"  </P> <P> Ehman (pronounced ee-man) has vowed to pick this bone with the highest  agricultural authority in the land, Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter,  possibly with backing from what Ehman called farming rights groups.  </P> <P> As a stopgap measure, the Ehmans printed a wanted poster to explain the  labeling changes to clients. It features their cartoon character logo of Rocky  the Chicken -- alias Rocky the Range Chicken -- sporting cowboy hat, boots and  pistol.  </P> <P> The Ehmans process only 20,000 or so chickens a week, making their company a  bantamweight contender among U.S. poultry companies, which together process 90  million chickens weekly.  </P> <P> But Meat &amp; Poultry magazine, a frequent critic of the free-range chicken  industry, said large producers have increasingly put pressure on the USDA  because they feel that smaller companies' claims make mainstream birds seem  tainted.  </P> <P> Alice Waters, owner of the well-known Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse, said  she thinks that labeling is an important issue.  </P> <P> "People have to know what these things mean," she said. Her restaurant recently  stopped buying Rocky birds in favor of chickens raised in very small numbers on  the Research Farm near Davis. The birds there are moved outside each morning in  good weather and eat grass, bugs and whatever else they find.  </P> <P> Other observers see the squabble as much ado about nothing much.  </P> <P> "I don't think that one word should make a difference," said restaurateur  Wolfgang Puck, who urged Ehman five years ago to develop a range chicken and  still occasionally serves Rocky brand chicken at his Spago eatery in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Puck is familiar with the vagaries of government regulations. Two years ago  when he decided to sell his "designer" pizzas in supermarkets, the USDA said he  could not call them pizzas because they didn't contain tomato sauce. Puck said  he got around the problem by applying "an espresso spoonful" of tomatoes to  each pie.  </P> <P> In Southern California, Rocky birds are sold at Gelson's and Mrs. Gooch's  (which Ehman inexplicably refers to as Mrs. Goochie's, perhaps confusing it  with the tony Italian design house). Gelson's in Century City this week quoted  a price of $2.49 a pound for a Rocky fryer, compared to $1.49 per pound for a  Zacky Farms bird.  </P> <P> Sales of Rocky birds and a smaller counterpart, Rocky Jr., are projected this  year at between $5 million and $6 million.  </P> <P> Raised by Petaluma Poultry Processors to the Ehmans' specifications, Rocky the  Chicken has indeed been very good to Ehman, 49. He tools around from ranch  house to chicken ranch in a new silver Mercedes-Benz 560 SEC, and he and his  wife recently built a white house on a 113-acre property.  </P> <P> "Land up here is scarcer than hen's teeth," Ehman said with a straight face.  "We were lucky to find it."  </P> <P> Ehman, who said his real love is fishing, acknowledges that he sometimes has  difficulty getting visitors to grasp the "range" concept, especially during  winter when the birds tend to flock together near the feeders inside their  plywood and chicken wire houses rather than wander about outdoors.  </P> <P> On Tuesday afternoon at one chicken ranch in nearby Santa Rosa, intermittent  showers kept all but one game Rocky from venturing out. Clearly, these  fair-weather fryers have figured out that they are more at home on the range  when it's warm and sunny, even if they are, as Ehman puts it, "not much more  intelligent than grass."  </P> <P> "We don't make them go outside," he noted, indicating that forced marches would  scarcely qualify as "stress-free" conditions.  </P> <P> Ehman said a legal challenge is a possibility. Said he with more than a hint of  defiance, "The government might shut us down from all the hell we're raising."  </P></p>

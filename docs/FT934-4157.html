			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Private View: The Treasury's top mandarin answers back - Sir Terry Burns, the 'invisible hand' behind the Government's economic strategy, reviews past errors and says the Treasury will do better Every day he gets on his bike, props a chapter of Trollope on the handlebars and pedals another bit of road from John O'Groats to Land's End. 'I'm nearly there now,' he said proudly. But that is not why Sir Terry Burns was looking so cheerful this week - after all, it is only an exercise bike on a statistical journey. No, he was beaming (cautiously) at press and stock market reaction to the first unified Budget under a new British chancellor, the fifth he has served. During 11 years as chief economic adviser - he was only 35 when appointed - and nearly three as permanent secretary to the Treasury, this mandarin son of a coalmining mechanic has been regarded as the invisible hand behind the Conservative government's economic strategy. Known to his staff as plain 'Terry', the permanent secretary is affable. He has a charming smile, used to good effect. As he walked about the big, overheated office, I was struck by a resemblance to his friend John Major. (Or is it the other way round?) Sir Terry talks volubly but in a methodical, literal way with an intelligence that seemed analytical rather than imaginative. Perhaps he was more apprehensive than he looked. Tuesday's Budget, I said, has been called pragmatic, non-doctrinal and political as well as tough. Does that mean there is less of you in it than usual? He baulked at the question. He had advised on strategy, not detail, he said; from a macro-economic point of view it was 'very much the chancellor's Budget' but also 'very much in line with what we as an institution are happy with.' Sir Terry wanted to talk about his plans for sharpening the Treasury's management. I wanted to hear him talk about the big policy mistakes - from Lawson's inflationary boom to Lamont's ERM bust. The two subjects seemed in some way connected. He has engaged Wendy Pritchard, a management consultant, to help him and his officials concentrate their minds. They want to repair their relationship with spending departments which complain of meddling, to consult more with outsiders who say they are out of touch, and make the Treasury a more agreeable workplace for the UK's best and brightest. You want to correct the Treasury's image as an introverted, elitist organisation? 'It's not really an image I am after. What I am after is that we should do our job better. The real question is how far the criticisms of the Treasury are justified. In some respects I think they have been. It has been a relatively introverted organisation because it conducts most of its business through intermediaries.' Have you yourself become a prisoner? 'No. I don't think I have become in any sense a prisoner. I continue to go out a good deal. I have maintained a good many of my contacts and I think I've got quite good intelligence of what's going on.' The 1980 appointment of Terry Burns, a moderate monetarist and forecasting specialist from the London Business School, was a minor sensation. He was the young outsider the new Tory government needed to challenge the dominant, neo-Keynesian line. Now, in Major's classless society, he is the Establishment. Burns does not agree. The fact that he defends his department, he said, does not mean he has lost his critical faculties. Treasury officials work hard - perhaps inefficiently hard. Sir Terry's contacts with the real world include golf on Saturday mornings, watching Queens Park Rangers play football every other Saturday afternoon, and playing music in a recorder quintet. Jazz or classical? He answered seriously: 'No, it's classical recorder. We play a wide variety of music.' When not bicycling with Trollope he reads golf and computer magazines - and mountains of paperwork. Last weekend he went back to the north east where he was born to receive an honorary degree from the University of Sunderland. (His own degree is from Manchester). I observed that the last coal pit in the Durham coalfield is closing. Does the permanent secretary of the Treasury feel any connection to that event? 'I don't feel very closely connected because what has happened to the coal industry has been very largely to do with world trends, to do with technology, to do with the relative costs of producing energy by one means as opposed to another. 'On the other hand when I look at what it is they have been doing to try to compensate for that, then you get into an area more closely related to what we are doing. And the overwhelming sensation I get is to be taken aback by the extent of the change. I find it quite staggering to think that has all happened in the time since I left the north east.' Economist colleagues have complained that they no longer know what Terry Burns believes in. He says that is because he has been so long out of the public arena. His views, he said, were formed between 1972 and 1975, a period that included the Heath U-turn, the collapse of fixed exchange rates, the trial and failure of incomes policy, the Barber boom, the three-day week and high inflation. The combination of crude stimulus and incomes restraint while searching for competitiveness via currency depreciation was 'a very dangerous brew. You had to see inflation as a monetary phenomenon, and it had to be attacked by monetary policy.' Once a monetarist, always a monetarist? 'Well, I would say that most of the people I know engaged in the broad subject of macroeconomics have changed their views quite a lot over the last 20 years. I've never been at all happy with this idea that you belong to schools. I've never regarded myself as belonging to a particular school, being a card-carrying member and surrounding yourself with only people who think alike.' Monetarism was 'absolutely not' a right wing phenomenon: he had always seen the danger of supporting the economics of any one political party. 'I have never had any involvement in my adult life with a party. I have always tried to incorporate within my own views the lessons from experience. How could you help but shift your views when you look at the experience and the variety of things that have happened?' It was not, he said, that economists had moved from one, monetarist pole towards another, Keynesian one. Rather they had converged from different starting points in a triangular fashion. 'Maybe there is greater consensus about these matters than there has been for some time.' You have been accused of making the mistakes for which we are now paying, I said: for failing to foresee the boom, failing to stop it quickly enough, focusing on single indices, for the ERM fiasco, for your attitude to manufacturing industry and, one could add, for losing two Chancellors from under your wing. Do you accept any of those things as your personal mistakes? 'Well, with some of them, obviously, I did contribute. Whether they have had the influence that is sometimes suggested I think is another matter. It's quite true that the forecast I was involved with in 1987-88 failed to see the scale of the boom, failed subsequently to see the scale of the recession, and, you know, there is no doubt about that. 'But the forecasting industry generally over the last six or seven years has had a very difficult time, and that is not only in this country. The Treasury forecasts are no worse than forecasts generally - in fact, if anything, slightly better. 'Obviously one would have wished that one could have foreseen the future with a greater degree of accuracy. Had we been able to do so, I think that it is likely that policy would have been a bit better and the ups and downs wouldn't have been as great.' Were things made worse because the government and its advisers were hooked on certain key indicators and not prepared to take a rounded view of the real economy? 'No, no. Economies have cycles. You are never going to be able to eliminate them. When you have exogenous (outside) pressures of the kind we had during that period, they turn out after the event to have had a substantial effect. There are things, with the best will in the world, you will never see. And even if you can, it is far from evident that you can necessarily correct them. 'It must be your ambition to try to foresee these events and to take evasive action. But what you must not do is set impossible standards, or to assume that all change is the direct consequence of having failed to do something that should have been done, which was to see the future perfectly.' Sir Terry talked of accountability. By this he did not mean that officials like himself should resign if they get their sums wrong but be readier to explain their arithmetic in public. The question of how much responsibility was the adviser's and how much the minister's was 'very difficult'. I said: It's reported that you once boasted the government always did what you told it . . . 'That's not . . . ' . . . and that if anything went wrong with the British economy it would be down to you. 'No. I certainly didn't . . . I did not say that. I would not say that because it is not remotely my . . . perception of what has happened. That is an enormously vain thing to say. I don't know why it is that people have the view that somehow ministers are weak puppets in the hands of enormously strong officials. 'What I may have said in the past is that I have always been listened to.' I asked him if his beliefs had changed. 'When you see the failure of both yourself and colleagues and others to be able to predict things, you do tend to see the process as more complicated and one is less given to strident views about what is obviously right or wrong. You see it increasingly as a very risky business.' Had experience made him more pragmatic in his advice to the chancellor? Was he more aware of the consequences? 'I think you tend to think of a greater variety of possible outcomes and ways in which things may go wrong - where the dangers are. Whether it is a good thing or a bad thing I'm not sure, but it is a characteristic of people that as they age everything is more complicated and the rights and wrongs of particular courses of action are much more difficult to identify in an unambiguous way.' Sir Terry was anxious to point to successes: privatisation, deregulation of the financial markets, the post-ERM monetary policy, the Budget itself. Is your own reputation also bound up with the success or otherwise of this Budget? 'No. Reputations cannot be made and lost in terms of single events in this world. What matters is how you perform over a period of time.' You will be 50 soon. Is there life after the Treasury - something else you would like to do? 'I would hope at some stage that I would do something else. This is not something I think about a great deal. I have the philosophy of doing the job that I currently have as well as I can, and leaving the future to look after itself. So far, the future has looked after itself.' It was the man speaking, of course, not the permanent secretary to the Treasury.</p>

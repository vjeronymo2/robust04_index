			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS IDENTIFY REMAINS OF SAINT CANDIDATE  </P> <P> Scientists have positively identified a skeleton exhumed from a New York  cemetery as the remains of a Haitian slave who is a candidate to become  America's first black saint, Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Saturday.  </P> <P> A team of archeologists, forensic scientists and anthropologists determined  that a skeleton dug up earlier this month was that of Pierre Toussaint, the  cardinal said.  </P> <P> Toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to New York at age 21 by his French  owners. Still enslaved, he became a leading hairdresser in the city and was  allowed to keep some of his income.  </P> <P> Freed in 1807, he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on charities,  including an orphanage and the city's first school for black children.  </P> <P> He is considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the needy  for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed.  </P></p>

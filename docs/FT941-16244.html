			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ifil seeks a winning combination  -Haig Simonian analyses the holding company's complex web of deals Even by the recent standards of many Italian companies, the past three months have been extraordinarily busy for Ifil, the holding group indirectly controlled by the wealthy Agnelli family. Since October, Turin-based Ifil has spent L652bn (Dollars 397m) on a controlling stake in La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer; increased its share in Fiat to more than 12 per cent and launched a large rights issue to finance its ambitions. As part of its diversification into non-cyclical sectors such as foods and tourism, Ifil has struck a string of deals with important business partners, notably in France, ranging from hotels in Hungary to foodstuffs in Hong Kong. However, Ifil's moves have not been unanimously acclaimed. The complex Rinascente deal, in which the Fiat-controlled retailer passed to Ifil via Fiat's own shareholders, was pilloried by some analysts as an in-house arrangement tailored to bolster Fiat's flagging finances more than the interest of Ifil's shareholders. Ifil's decision to spend more than L770bn on increasing its stake in the cars group has come under fire. Though some analysts see Fiat, Italy's biggest private company, as a potential recovery stock, its short-term prospects look grim and Ifil's investment seems odd. Unprejudiced consideration of its policy is complicated by Ifil's historical role as a strongbox for the Agnellis and an instrument in broader family or Fiat-related transactions. Many observers recall the 1986 manoeuvrings when cash-rich Ifil was used in a complex ballet to buy out the Libyan government, then a minority shareholder in Fiat. Mr Gabriele Galateri di Genola, Ifil's managing director, sees things differently. Ifil's decision not just to subscribe to Fiat's rights issue, but raise its stake to 12.6 per cent from 9.26 per cent, 'comes down to whether you think it's a good investment or not', he says. Displaying the charm and acumen which many believe will drive him to the top of Fiat, he argues that any investor not convinced about the car company's future should sell out. Mr Galateri argues that Fiat, expected to announce a large loss in 1993 and pass its dividend, has strong recovery potential. The rights issue represents a bargain. Drawing attention to the convertible bond which accompanied the rights issue, he rejects criticisms that the cars group represents a poor short-term investment. The 2 per cent coupon on the bond offers a very reasonable return and Ifil has entered the group of core investors expected to play an active role in Fiat's future, he argues. Mr Galateri is more convincing when it comes to Rinascente. While some analysts have attacked the deal - in which Fiat shareholders were invited to buy the group's 46.8 per cent Rinascente stake - many agree there could be advantages in bringing Ifil and the retailer together. Ifil has expanded in food production after a stream of takeovers of leading Italian companies since the mid-1980s. More recently, it has sold many acquisitions to BSN, the big French foods group, in return for cash, an equity stake of almost 6 per cent and a commitment to develop joint food interests. It is the food-retailing combination which lies at the heart of the Rinascente deal. The latter is an odd collection of businesses, comprising flagship city-centre department stores, the SMA supermarkets and hypermarkets chain and the struggling Upim variety stores. SMA, and especially its growing list of greenfield hypermarkets, is the most attractive component. Italian retailing has been undergoing a belated transformation in recent years as thousands of small, city centre outlets have made way for more big supermarkets. Although the mix between small and large food stores is heavily weighted towards the former, the big outlets are expected to dominate in the end. Because of the complexities of Italy's new takeover laws, Ifil has limited its Rinascente share to 33 per cent to avoid triggering a compulsory takeover. That will gradually increase, as bourse rules allow it to raise its holding by 3 per cent a year, although Mr Galateri declines a final target. Not that there is any threat to its control. The complex change of hands from Fiat has meant that bank underwriters, likely to be sympathetic to Ifil, have been left with a large portion of Rinascente stock on their books. Arab Banking Corporation and Pictet, the Geneva-based private bank, have bought stakes, estimated at around 6 per cent and 2 per cent, in the retailer respectively. Both are close to Ifil. The Ifil-Rinascente link may be purely defensive. If, as some observers expect, Italian retailing moves towards the UK model, where big supermarket chains tend to have the upper hand over suppliers, then adding retail distribution to Ifil's food production portfolio could be a bonus. But the deal's main appeal may be in the wider context of changes in Italian food retailing. As part of its privatisation policy, the government plans to sell GS, the big state-controlled supermarket and hypermarket chain. A number of contenders have thrown their hats into the ring, although the timing and details of the disposal are unclear. Mr Galateri is unwilling to be drawn on Ifil's plans. Some observers suspect that buying Rinascente - while beneficial to Fiat - may be a first step in a more ambitious Ifil strategy. Combining Rinascente's food retailing with another big network, such as GS, would create a large force in the highly fragmented Italian market. If the Rinascente-GS duo could be beefed up with minority participations from other leading retailers, in the UK or Germany, it could make a winning combination.</p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Markets: A tipple investors may like - The Bottom Line Guinness, after all, may be good for investors. That was the market's view this week after the UK drinks group radically reshaped its alliance with LVMH, the French cognac, champagne and luxury goods company. There was a time when there was no doubt about Guinness's benefits to shareholders. Between 1987 and 1992, the group's share price rose 300 per cent and dividends increased 158 per cent. During those years, under Sir Anthony Tennant, the company was reaping the rewards of reorganising the spirits business acquired in the controversial takeover of Distillers Company. Brands such as Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky were being refurbished, repackaged and repositioned. Distribution was being brought under direct control and extended. Markets were buoyant. Profits grew organically by over 40 per cent between 1990 and 1992 in spite of the shadow of recession. But towards the end of that period, doubts began to appear. Growth slowed. For the first time for 13 years, pre-tax profits in 1992 fell, slipping 12 per cent. Tony Greener took over from Sir Anthony in 1993 in a much more hostile trading climate. Economic conditions in some of the group's most important markets had deteriorated. Falling demand and over-production hit the Scotch whisky industry. Guinness closed five whisky distilleries, with the loss of 700 jobs. Brewing also had its problems - notably in Cruzcampo, the Spanish brewer. A costly programme of redundancies was required there, too. Some analysts began to mourn the demise of the de-luxe decade in the global spirits industry, suggesting that more value-conscious consumers were unlikely ever again to pay the price of premium brands. Guinness's sliding share price reflected that sentiment - reinforced by similar worries about the cognac, champagne and luxury goods business of LVMH, its French partner. The alliance came under frequent and questioning scrutiny. The success of the joint distribution ventures it had established throughout the world could be measured. They contributed 25 per cent of Guinness's spirits profits. But there was growing unease about the two companies' 24 per cent cross-shareholdings. Guinness, with an indirect holding, was regarded as a passive investor in LVMH with little influence to show for its Pounds 1bn investment. The new-found enthusiasm of Bernard Arnault, LVMH chairman, for expansion into publishing and fashion did nothing to allay the concern. Those worries continued to overhang the Guinness share price even after it reached its lowest point, 400p, on the day that Crispin Davis resigned after little more than a year as managing director of United Distillers, the group's spirits division, last October. The restructuring of the alliance on Thursday changed City attitudes at a stroke. 'A strategic coup,' said Jonathan Goble, analyst at BZW. 'A positive for Guinness,' said John Wakely, of Lehman Brothers. 'Good sense,' said Eric Frankis, of Hoare Govett. A 10 per cent rise in the share price confirmed that consensus. Guinness has exchanged its 24 per cent indirect holding in LVMH for a 34 per cent direct stake in Moet Hennessy, the group's cognac and champagne business, and Pounds 416m cash. Apart from the minority blockage rights of the stake, Guinness has also negotiated pre-emption rights on the MH brands - Hennessy and Hine cognac, Moet Chandon and Veuve Clicquot champagne. It has thus become a commercial partner in the LVMH in which its real interest lies and divorced itself from Arnault's plans for the group as a whole. The deal has been done as the markets for cognac and champagne are beginning to improve - and at a cost of perhaps 4 per cent dilution in earnings per share. It offers prospects of increased co-operation and improved performance in Asia/Pacific and other world markets. Guinness's 1993 results will show that the decline in profits has been checked.</p>

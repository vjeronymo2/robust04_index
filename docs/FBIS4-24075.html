			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg June 22 SAPA -- This year's budget is  "a laudable attempt" to deal with problems head-on and build on  sound fiscal growth, but financial discipline will determine if  the shocks have only been delayed until next year, Syfrets  [financial institution] economist Elmien de Kock said in a  statement on Wednesday. [22 June]    "It is not a redistribution budget; it's a reconstruction  budget," she said.    "It is only by increasing the economic pie that the  underprivileged can benefit from wealth redistribution...The  only way the government can sustain an increase in revenue is by  growing the tax base."    The one-off five per cent levy to finance the country's  transition to democracy would hurt high-income individuals  without curbing consumer spending because most breadwinners were  not affected.    The deficit before borrowing of R29.6 billion [rand] was not  onerous because it included transition costs of R4 billion.    Mrs de Kock said Syfrets expected a negative reaction  initially from capital markets but there was potential for lower  bond yields.    The financial rand would not be abolished in the next six  months, she said.    The corporate tax rate cut would offset the transition levy.  Companies with low dividend cover would most likely be adversely  affected, while those with average cover would lose about four  per cent in earnings per share.    Beer and tobacco tax rises would not substantially affect  sales volumes.    The construction sector had reacted positively to pre-budget  announcements on job creation and public works programmes, Mrs  de Kock said.</p>

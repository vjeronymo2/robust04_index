			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Repola back in black with FM737m Repola, Finland's largest industrial group, swung to a pre-tax profit of FM737m (Dollars 135.7m) in the four months to end of April from a loss (restated) of FM13m in the same period in 1993. The result consolidates a recovery that took hold last year. The improvement stemmed in part from a fall in financial expenses, to FM441m from FM851m, as interest charges tumbled. Repola, whose operations include forestry, forestry machines and other associated production, said reduced financial expenses would help drive a considerable improvement in full-year profits from last year's pre-tax figure of FM29m. Repola restated its 1993 figures to reflect accounting changes made to conform with EU directives. Group sales were barely changed in the first four months at FM9.16bn, compared with FM9.14bn last time. Turnover was held back by a strengthening of the Finnish markka this year, and restructuring moves in 1993. Overseas operations accounted for 86 per cent of sales. Operating profit, however, was well ahead, reaching FM1.1bn against FM838m. Much of this was attributed to unexpectedly better profits at United Paper Mills, the forestry unit. UPM sales were up 4 per cent at FM6.12bn, but operating profit moved up more sharply, to FM906m from FM756m. Repola said although economic recovery in Europe was strengthening demand for paper, prices were still restrained by oversupply. Meanwhile, manufacturers would face rising raw material costs for paper and sawn timber production towards the end of the year.</p>

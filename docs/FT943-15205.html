			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Monday Interview: The cup that runneth over - Why Alan Rothenberg, Mr Soccer USA, is poised to benefit from the match between the sport and his expertise American lawyers are something else. Outside the court and boardrooms, they populate governments past and present (two Clintons, Christopher, Bentsen, and Baker for starters), the Congress (well over half the Senate have law degrees), Wall Street, opera houses and charities. Some own sports franchises. One of them is close to owning a whole sport. That man, Alan Rothenberg, must be happy these days. But as the World Cup approaches its climax, he might also own up to moments of nervousness, as he and all those with a vested interest in the future of soccer in America contemplate the next step. The happiness of the youthful 55-year-old Los Angeles super-lawyer and past president of the California Bar Association is easy to understand. Soccer's quadrennial global tournament is well on the way to be a sporting and commercial success, not a prospect necessarily held out for its first staging in the US when Rothenberg assumed control of the operation in 1990. He is, as the mega-TV screens in many stadiums display before and after each match, chairman, president and chief executive officer of World Cup USA 1994 Inc. He is simultaneously - and not uncontroversially - president of the United States Soccer Federation, the governing body of the sport in the US, and head of the management team behind Major League Soccer. To call him Mr Soccer USA is these days no exaggeration. Even if his many public interviews in recent weeks have not disclosed a deep knowledge of what actually takes place on the field, he is no recent convert who merely spots a quick potential profit. His involvement dates back to the late 1970s when he was part-owner of the Los Angeles Aztecs of the now-defunct North American Soccer League, an investment, he has said, that he was lucky to escape from alive. He was soccer commissioner for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, learning much at the knee of its impresario, Peter Ueberroth, who showed how it was possible to turn a penny from international sporting events that previously had made vast losses (viz the 1976 Olympics in Montreal). That track record alone made him the favourite candidate of Fifa, the international soccer authority, to run the 1994 tournament. Rothenberg draws no salary from World Cup USA 1994, a non-profit organisation, but he will be paid a one-time bonus when the ledgers are finally drawn up. This may be as little as Dollars 250,000, according to his supporters, and as high as Dollars 5m, in the opinion of his critics. Either way, the sum will have been richly earned, since Rothenberg thrives on 100-hour work weeks and has had to forgo some income from his lucrative law practice. It is also likely to be small in relation to his larger investment plans for the sport, which, in turn, hang on the popularity and profits generated by the World Cup. The figures are by no means in yet, but they are already looking impressive. Average attendance per match is around 67,000, about 19,000 more than in Italy in 1990, with the size and quality of American stadiums only a partial explanation. That two Arab teams could attract 72,000 to a match held just across the river from New York City, where few natural fans of Morocco and Saudi Arabia can be found, is a testament to general fascination with soccer and good national and local marketing. Television ratings, a vital determinant in the viability of all professional sports, have exceeded most expectations. The USA-Brazil game on the July 4 holiday, shown on ABC, the national network, was watched by about 10m Americans, a record for soccer. ABC and ESPN together bid a modest Dollars 23m for the domestic TV rights, reflecting soccer's previously low national recognition, but the international rights fetched Dollars 275m. Ticket sales, commercial sponsorship and other forms of income could mean, Rothenberg himself has estimated, gross revenues of around Dollars 1bn. Few opportunities to cash in have been left unexplored. Companies, including Coca-Cola, General Motors, Canon, MasterCard, and adidas, have paid up to Dollars 20m each to be officially associated with the World Cup, a total take exceeding Dollars 250m. Even that amount is probably much lower than the cost of the promotional activities undertaken by companies, in effect free publicity for the event. Merchandise licensing arrangements, rock concerts and more besides have helped swell the pot. A critical ingredient was the involvement of the nine host cities, chosen from a list of 26 applicants. This may have provoked some local disputes - even in Los Angeles, of which Rothenberg is a conspicuous booster - but appears to have been broadly successful. The almost complete absence of violence among fans and the estimated Dollars 4bn equivalent of foreign currency spent at local hotels, shops, bars and restaurants has more than mollified civic doubting Thomases. So has the temporary summer employment offered to thousands of young people serving as ushers, guards, press aides, runners, drivers and 'ball persons'. Profits at the end of the day will be split between Fifa, the international governing body, and the US organising operation. The domestic share may approach Dollars 25m and therein lies the controversy which Rothenberg's many soccer hats have generated. The broad idea was that profits should be disbursed to the general cause of soccer in America at the grass roots level. This will still happen. But, according to reports in both the Los Angeles Times and New York magazine the facts of which have not been disputed, World Cup USA 1994, headed by Rothenberg, has already paid Dollars 500,000 for a business plan for a new league to Major League Soccer, controlled by Rothenberg. MLS outbid two other contenders for the right to run the new league in submissions to the US Soccer Federation, whose boss is Rothenberg. Further, Dollars 3.5m from World Cup USA has been paid to MLS for start-up costs and total funding from World Cup profits may exceed Dollars 6m. Rothenberg has also said he would like to be commissioner of the putative 12-team league, though he may then face challenges to his control of the US Soccer Federation. But as commissioner he would control the disposition of franchises for the new league. He may want to run one himself. Soccer in the US is, as even his critics concede, a small and underdeveloped pond, short on resources and competing personalities, in which Rothenberg is a very big fish. He resolutely denies any conflict of interest or any dealings that would not stand up to scrutiny. If soccer is to take off in America after World Cup euphoria fades and sports like baseball, basketball and gridiron football reassert themselves, it is going to need a powerful man at the helm. Once, fleetingly in the 1970s, it had Pele who, in the twilight of his career, played for the New York Cosmos, but the Brazilian superstar's legs faltered and so did the legs from under professional soccer. It is now played mostly indoors and in obscurity. Alan Rothenberg may not know how to kick a ball but the evidence of the World Cup is that he sure knows how to set up the business of scoring goals.</p>

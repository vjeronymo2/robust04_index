			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Germany agrees to increase relief effort THE German government yesterday agreed a sharp increase in aid for Kurdish refugees in the area around northern Iraq, with a total of DM440m (Pounds 146m) now earmarked for a humanitarian operation given all-party support in Bonn. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, foreign minister, said German hospitals would offer beds for victims of Baghdad's aggression against the Kurdish people. Mr Genscher, who will fly to eastern Anatolia in Turkey tomorrow to inspect the relief operations, said the lives of 'hundreds of thousands' were at stake. In an unusual display of harmony, the German Bundestag unanimously condemned Iraq's persecution of the Kurdish people as 'attempted genocide'. A motion proposed by the government and opposition supported the use of military force in the region if necessary to dissuade the Baghdad regime from further action against the Kurds.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kresimir Meler and Branka Horvatek: "Development </F> Plan for Croatian Army"]    [Text] Croatia should develop one of the strongest, if not  the strongest, army in southeast Europe within 10 years. It  will also incorporate a rapid deployment unit, which will, "if  necessary, defend Croatian interests and the Croatian minority  on all territories of the former Yugoslavia." As of now, this  is only a proposal by a group of generals and politicians who  belong to the rightist, radical fraction of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Community]. Considering the present situation of the  Croatian Armed Forces and the HDZ itself, it is quite realistic  that these plans will actually be carried out. With rare  exceptions, the Croatian Army General Staff and the commanding  officers in the brigades consist of members of the ruling party  who could, even if the ruling party were to be replaced, carry  out the policy of their party unopposed, or even prevent the  winning party from taking office.    What kind of future does the "Development Plan for the  Croatian Armed Forces" foresee? As stated, "the present  unstable political-military situation in southeastern Europe  will continue in the coming years, maybe for the whole decade."    According to all available data, the situation in the parts  of the country where the Serbian population is in the majority  will not normalize. Serbia will continue to supply these areas  with large amounts of weapons, and the threat of terrorist  groups must be taken into account. Having a border with a  possible Muslim state, which could cut through the territory of  the Republic of Croatia, thereby hampering a free flow of people  and goods, presents military and security problems. Moreover,  the border with the present FRY will be extremely difficult to  control. In the future, this border will have to remain a  concern of highest priority. Along its most critical points it  will have to be reinforced with heavy armored, motorized, and  special airborne forces.    Acting as a constant destabilizing factor, the so-called FRY  will probably continue "to lay claim not only to some parts of  the Republic of Croatia but also to the territory of other  states formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia."    Given this assessment of the situation, it was only to be  expected that the plan would propose "the gradual formation of  an army that will be capable not only of protecting its borders  if attacked from outside, but also of launching strong  counterattacks on enemy's positions on enemy's territory, as  well as pre-emptive strikes on enemy bases near the Croatian  border. The Croatian Armed Forces must be ready in the future to  respond quickly to protect ethnic Croats who live outside of the  borders of the Republic of Croatia."    According to the planning being done by the Croatian  generals, the Croatian Army should focus on acquiring U.S.  military hardware or on cooperation with countries that produce  weapons and equipment under U.S. license. If all these plans are  fulfilled, the U.S. armament industry should prosper. Croatia  plans to purchase 210 Phantom aircraft of various models. The  first delivery will replace 40 MiG-21 and Jastreb aircraft. The  Croatian Air Force plans to replace them in the next two years.    The remaining aircraft would be purchased over the next five  years. There are also detailed plans regarding helicopters. The  Croatian Government has already bought 10 MD-500 helicopters  made under U.S. license in South Korea. Argentina manufactures  missiles and machine guns for these helicopters. They are highly  maneuverable. They can be also equipped with a submarine  detector, TOW laser-guided antitank rockets, Martin Pescador  air-to-ground missiles (to destroy radar systems), double lasers  for Stinger missiles, two torpedos, a GE six-barrel mobile  7.62-mm minigun, a Hydra 70 launcher for 70-mm tracer bullets,  and an infrared decoy emitter device. Half of these helicopters  are already flying with HVO [Croatian Defense Council] markings.  The total should reach approximately 100 in four years, in  addition to a larger number of transport helicopters and  aircraft.    Croatia would also like to buy radar and missile systems,  leopard tanks, and long-range artillery made in the United  States or under U.S. license. To reduce costs, individual parts  would be produced in Croatia -- difficult to accomplish  considering the technological capacities of Croatian industry.  The Army will receive an appropriation equal to 45 percent of  the state budget, or about $1.3 billion. Over the next five  years at least, the Army would receive 36.7 percent of the  supplemental revenue derived from taxes on all goods and  services. Consequently, Croatia would have to take out loans,  which will in turn require forming strategic alliances with  certain countries.    It is against this background that one should interpret  Croatian defense minister's proposal that Zemunik airport be  turned into a U.S. military base for the operations throughout  southeast Europe, that the Rijeka shipyard be made available for  repair services for the Sixth Fleet, and that U.S. Navy ships be  given permanent docking privileges in any Croatian port they  choose.    Croatian military strategy would be a complete -- maybe  slightly modified -- copy of the Israeli defense system.    The toughest problem (although the Croatian authorities will  not admit it) will be officer training. So far, Croatia does not  have a satisfactory educational system at all. It is a fact that  it lacks military secondary schools, let alone a military  academy or so-called military colleges, in which the cadets  could acquire know-how to advance to the highest military ranks.  There is a shortage of senior officers. Moreover, only a few  generals would be capable of passing a rigorous exam, with the  exception of those that came over from the JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army]. However, there are only very few of them and  they have been kept inactive for now.    Another option would be training abroad, limited to the  United States or to countries that buy the weapons from the  United States or its licensees. The "unsolved problems with the  western neighbor and Italy" are also mentioned, which inevitably  leads to the question of whether the Balkans is going to  eventually wind up with another unpredictable "Balkan policeman."</p>

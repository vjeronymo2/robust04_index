			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Cardoso backed by main party Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso (pictured left), who is set to take office as Brazilian president on January 1, yesterday won the backing of the country's largest political party, the left-of-centre Democratic Movement party (PMDB). The PMDB's support, which was formally pledged during a meeting with the party president, Mr Luiz Henrique, should help Mr Cardoso to build a big enough coalition, in the Congress due to take office next month, to make several constitutional changes next year, aimed at modernising the economy. The PMDB holds about 125 seats in the 514-member Congress. If these are added to the 210 seats held by the alliance which elected Mr Cardoso, he looks able to count on the necessary three-fifths support needed to change the constitution. According to most analysts, changes are urgently needed in the tax and social security systems in order to keep the government's budget in balance and to underpin Brazil's latest anti-inflation currency, the Real. Mr Cardoso was a member of the PMDB until five years ago, when he left to help found the Social Democratic party (PSDB). This old link, and the fact the two parties share similar views in areas such as social policy, meant Mr Cardoso's advisers were always hopeful of gaining the PMDB's support. However, a powerful wing of the party, controlled by a failed presidential candidate, Mr Orestes Quercia, remains opposed to Mr Cardoso. Although PMDB leaders said they would back the new president on most matters, Mr Quercia's group and some northern deputies are expected to abstain or try to block Mr Cardoso's reforms. In return for its support, the PMDB is expected to be given a say on economic matters, although any advice may not be heeded by the economic team built up by Mr Cardoso when he was finance minister earlier in the present administration. The PMDB is also likely to be given one or two ministries. Most likely is that of justice, for which the PMDB deputy, Mr Nelson Jobim, is favourite. He oversaw the unsuccessful attempt to change the constitution earlier this year and is widely respected in Congress for his legal knowledge. Mr Jobim decided not to run for re-election to the Congress elected in October and November, and he is thought to be Mr Cardoso's choice.</p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HONDA PAYS U.S. WORKERS $1,712 BONUS  </P> <P> Honda of America Manufacturing Inc. said Wednesday that employees at its  assembly and engine plants in Ohio received an average of $1,712 per worker in  profit-sharing checks, up slightly from year-ago payouts.  </P> <P> The payments last week to Honda's 9,400 "associates" -- which include non-union  workers as well as management -- is expected to be the highest in the industry,  given the dismal financial performance posted so far this year by the nation's  Big Three auto makers.  </P> <P> Those results -- which include a $2.1-billion loss for the third quarter alone  -- will most likely result in no profit sharing this year for unionized workers  at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.  </P> <P> Honda's latest profit sharing, based on fiscal 1990 earnings, is based on three  numbers: worldwide net income before taxes, the number of employees worldwide  and the number of employees at Honda of America, said Jeff Leestma, a spokesman  for Honda North America in Detroit.  </P> <P> "That formula is the same for everyone," he said.  </P> <P> Payouts by GM, Ford and Chrysler are done under a complicated formula  negotiated by the United Auto Workers union for its members and are based on  U.S. automotive profits alone.  </P> <P> Among traditional U.S. car makers, Ford workers have reaped the most in profit  sharing checks, with the typical payout averaging a record $3,700 per worker  for 1987. But that figure slipped to $2,800 for 1988 and to $1,025 for 1989.  </P> <P> GM workers received no profit sharing checks in 1987, with minimal payouts for  1988 and 1989.  </P> <P> While there is little probability that Big Three workers will stand to get any  profit sharing for 1990, the UAW renegotiated in its latest contracts a new  formula that could increase any potential payout.  </P> <P> A UAW spokesman defended the union's payouts.  </P></p>

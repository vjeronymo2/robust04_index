			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Industrial Restructuring"] </F>   [Text] "Privatization, meaning the total transfer of state  ownership, is not what we have in mind at the moment."    The author of this statement is the minister for industrial  restructuring and participation, Mr. Mourad Benachenhou.  [sentence as published]    He also told CHAINE III that he did not consider himself the  minister for privatization. More specifically, Mr. Benachenhou  said his ministry's mission is not privatization but rather  redesign: to analyze the current state of the industrial plant  and other economic activities and propose a reorganization to  facilitate increased productivity.    The minister added that his department has no intention of  drawing up a reorganization policy in a vacuum. Quite the  opposite: He envisages consulting all parties concerned,  including the UGTA [General Union of Algerian Workers]. "The  ministry will elaborate a policy that will have greater impact  on the Algerian economic landscape and on all the social  partners, who are extremely important, since they represent the  great mass of workers. The latter will be consulted and have the  opportunity to express their views about reorganization of the  industrial plant." The minister noted that the objective of  restructuring the economy is to increase the productivity of the  industrial plant, whether it be publicly or privately owned.    "We must recognize that the industrial sector needs  reorganization to increase productivity and modernize the  productive plant. It is growth of the existing plant, quite  apart from the question of its ownership, that will ensure a  return to economic growth, create jobs, and stabilize the value  of the dinar," said Mr. Benachenhou. According to the minister,  two factors must be considered in reorganizing the sector.  First, existing productive potential must be maintained.  "Deindustrialization under the cover of restructuring is out of  the question." Second, reorganization must reinforce employment,  not lead to its disappearance.    At the time Mr. Benachenhou was installed in his new  position, he said among other things that there was a need to  come up with industrial restructuring options compatible with  Algerian realities. The secretary general of the UGTA has  proposed that priority go to creating employee shareholderships.    Regarding the effects of the IMF accord on economic  recovery,  the minister said Algeria has the resources to recover if it  meticulously implements the IMF stabilization policy. Even a  simple debt rescheduling would be enough to put Algeria on the  road to economic recovery, if the rescheduling covers a long  enough period to allow for consolidation.    The negotiations expected to begin in the next few weeks  with  the Paris Club on rescheduling medium and long-term official  debt could lead to a $4 billion reduction in debt service for  1994 and an additional $1 billion reduction between now and the  March 1995 expiration of the standby agreement; without such  relief, it is estimated that debt service for the current year  would amount to $9.5 billion.    Referring to the secrecy surrounding the contents of the  letter of intent sent to the IMF--some of the social partners  seem to be critical of the government on this score--the  minister said the letter contained "a number of measures whose  effectiveness cannot be assured unless they remain confidential  until implemented."    "The contents of the accord will only be made public," Mr.  Benachenhou added, "insofar as it is determined that disclosure  would not prejudice national interests or be exploited by a  minority for purposes of profit."    "It is a question of collective responsibility," he  concluded.</p>

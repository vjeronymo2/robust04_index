			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS ADDRESS MISSIONARIES' ATTITUDES TOWARD OTHER PEOPLES  </P> <P> Take up the white man's burden  </P> <P>  Send forth the best ye breed,  </P> <P>  Go, bind your sons to exile  </P> <P>  To serve your captives' need.  </P> <P>  -- Rudyard Kipling, 1899  </P> <P> They no longer speak of their task as "the white man's burden," but some  missionaries, perhaps influenced by a decade often characterized by  self-indulgence and national boosterism, are said to be exporting  self-righteousness along with their religious beliefs.  </P> <P> The organizer of a conference this week on racism and ethnocentrism among  missionaries said mission officials have noticed some evangelists are heading  overseas with an inadequate respect for native cultures and beliefs.  </P> <P> "The Reagan years -- I don't know how else to say it -- have lessened the  sensitivities and commitment to this," said Paul Yount of the National Council  of Churches. "We'd thought we'd made some headway into this, but now we're not  so sure."  </P> <P> Daniel Romero, general secretary of the mission program of the Board of World  Ministries of the United Church of Christ, recalled being shocked when a  missionary couple referred to Third World people as "heathens."  </P> <P> "To have that terminology used now, I think, is an insult to the religious  communities around the world," Romero said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Issues Raised at Workshop  </P> <P> Mission officials discussed issues of racism and ethnocentrism in missionary  selection in a workshop earlier this week at Stony Point, N.Y. The meeting was  sponsored by the Overseas Personnel Office of the Division of Overseas  Ministries of the national council.  </P> <P> Member churches of the national council had some 4,300 missionaries overseas in  1985, slightly more than 10% of the total 43,000 Protestant missionaries, Yount  said.  </P> <P> Yount, who is director of overseas personnel for the council, noted that many  early missionaries took stands against colonial authorities and that  missionaries have translated the Bible into almost every language and dialect.  </P> <P> "I would stress that the missionary heritage in this is both positive and  problematic," he said.  </P> <P> The conference was called because many mission officials believed that the new  generation of missionaries lacked sensitivity toward native cultures, Yount  said.  </P> <P> "The climate has changed," he said. "There is not the more widespread concern  about the racism within our own culture, classism within our own culture."  </P> <P> Romero, however, said he thinks it is some of the older missionaries who "still  carry some overtones of the past in which there is a bit of that white  superiority that comes creeping in."  </P> <P> He recalled, for example, how several such missionaries had joked about the odd  names they had encountered overseas, despite the fact that they were making  those remarks in the presence of natives of those countries.  </P> <P> "I don't think they had the slightest notion it affected the people sitting  there," he said.  </P> <P> Julie Brown, vice president of the Division of Overseas Ministries for the  Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), said that her experience was different,  however.  </P> <P> "I think the missionaries that the Disciples are sending out today are less  racist than the missionaries we were sending out 20 years ago," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enrichment' Is Goal  </P> <P> She said many missionaries from her church, appointed for specific terms and  invited by overseas organizations, speak not in terms of "making a tremendous  impact" on the places they visit but of enriching their local churches when  they come back. Missionaries who say their only reason for going overseas is  that they feel called by God "are the first people we weed out," she said. "It  usually means they have a paternalistic attitude."  </P> <P> Romero sees hope for the future in the recruitment of younger missionaries and  more members of minority groups.  </P> <P> "There is great value to having people who have lived with racism, who have  lived with oppression in their own countries," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, churches are adjusting to vast shifts in membership, with  congregations swelling in Africa and Latin America as branches in Europe and  the United States remain merely stable or, in some places, wither.  </P> <P> Brown noted that the Disciples of Christ will have more members in Zaire than  in the United States by the year 2000, and that the denomination has cut its  corps of overseas missionaries in half, to 110, over the past two decades.  </P> <P> Such changes have prompted new attitudes toward mission work, Yount said.  </P> <P> Participants at a recent meeting of the World Council of Churches agreed, he  said, that "if we're really going to have the sending of missionaries, we  really need to have the exchange of missionaries."  </P></p>

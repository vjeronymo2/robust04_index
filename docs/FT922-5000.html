			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Growing optimism lifts Dow Jones to record high Wall Street US STOCK MARKETS turned early weakness on higher bond yields into a record-breaking performance yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished above 3,400 for the first time in its history, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow was up 16.33 at 3,413.21, a near 40-point recovery from its low of the early morning. Among other indices, the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.93 to 417.25, the Amex composite rose 0.15 to 394.84 and the Nasdaq composite ended 3.21 higher at 588.37. Turnover on the NYSE was 181m shares. The dominant factor of the morning was bond prices, which fell almost a full point at the long end (pushing the yield back up to nearly 8 per cent in the process) as Treasury investors interpreted a strong May purchasing managers' report as reducing the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The selling in the equity markets, however, could not be sustained, and amid growing enthusiasm about the outlook for the economy, share prices advanced across all fronts late in the session. The car sector led the way higher, with all three of the big car markers rising as investors continued to anticipate a recovery in their fortunes. General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 in turnover of 3.3m shares, Ford added Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 46 3/8 in 2m shares, and Chrysler advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 as 1.9m shares changed hands. Chrysler received an additional boost from Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street broking house, which raised its earnings outlook for the group and predicted profits in both the second quarter and the full year 1992. Salomon set a new price target for Chrysler stock of Dollars 25 over the next 12 months. After the opening of trading was delayed because of an imbalance of orders on the sell side, Commonwealth Edison fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2 in the wake of a warning from the broking house, Kidder Peabody, that the company's current divided rate might be cut. Citicorp climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 3/8 after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', citing dramatic strides in cost-cutting, peaking problem real-estate assets in North America and an expected boost to earnings from strong franchises in emerging markets. Waste Management rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 38 in heavy trading on the news that the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of the group's subsidiary Chemical Waste Management, which had challenged a special fee levied by Alabama on out-of-state hazardous waste. Canada TORONTO Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE 300 rose 16.05, or 0.47 per cent, to close at 3,403.98. Advancing issues edged declines 276 to 259. Volume of 22.8m shares was up from Friday's 20.3m, and trading value rose to CDollars 303.3m from CDollars 223.8m. Eight of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the transportation group, up 2.2 per cent. Laidlaw B, the most-heavily weighted stock in the group, rose  3/8 to 12 1/4 . Financial services gained 1.5 per cent and gold was up 1.0 per cent. Industrial products also closed higher. Magna International A tumbled 1 1/8 to 32 5/8 . The company said it plans to issue 3.2m class A shares at CDollars 32.25 a share.</p>

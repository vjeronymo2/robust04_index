			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 3 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin today applauded the Russian-Georgian treaty of  friendship and cooperation, saying that it paved the way for the  further development of bilateral ties.    However, the lower house of the Russian parliament expressed  its worry that the treaty would destabilize the Caucasian region.    Yeltsin arrived in the Georgian capital Tbilisi on Thursday  [3 February] for a one-day visit which resulted in the signing  of a treaty of friendship, good-neighborly relations and  cooperation.    Under the treaty, Russia would help Georgia's armed forces  by  supplying them with military technology and equipment.    Yeltsin told a news conference in Tbilisi that Russia and  Georgia should establish not only "friendship" but also "a union  which would favor the interests of both countries," adding that  the treaty would legally support bilateral relations.    But the treaty did not win support from the Russian  lawmakers. The lower house of the parliament released a  statement today in a news conference, saying that the treaty,  especially the military aid item, would endanger the stability  of the Caucasian region.    Yeltsin explained that the military aid would be carried out  "gradually" and depends on the developing situation in Abkhazia  and South Ossetia.    Abkhazia and South Ossetia are two autonomous regions of  Georgia. They have been involved in bloody conflicts with  Georgia after they declared independence from Tbilisi  respectively in July 1992 and November 1991.    Leaders of the two regions also expressed their opposition  to  the treaty, stressing that such an agreement should be signed  only after the conflict between Georgia and the two regions are  completely settled and the latter's political status determined.    Yeltsin and his Georgian counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze  agreed in their meeting that the conflicts should, nevertheless,  be settled peacefully.    However, the lower house said that such a precondition might  undermine the mediator status of Russia on the issue, arguing  that Russia should consider its own interests first and protect  itself from the threat of a wave of Caucasian refugees.    Ties between Russia and Georgia were tense in recent years  due to the Abkhazia and South Ossetia issue and improved only  after the Russian armed forces were allowed to be stationed in  Georgia last October.</p>

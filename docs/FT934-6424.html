			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Budget 1993: Pensions option may be tempting to Clarke - The industry expects to be hit but, as Norma Cohen writes, which tax breaks will be curbed is unknown The temptation for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to raise badly needed government revenues from the pensions sector must be very great. Government estimates are that tax reliefs associated with pensions are between Pounds 14bn and Pounds 15bn a year. Numbers like that catch the eye in a year when the government will have to borrow Pounds 50bn to meet its own expenses. The pensions industry now expects that there will be curbs on tax breaks for the sector. But what form they will take is a subject of some debate. Mr Andrew Evans, partner in the executive benefits group at accountancy firm Price Waterhouse, said a tax on pensions could be a relatively attractive political option in spite of the government's avowed policy to encourage individuals to make more provision for themselves. He said: 'It's easier to raise revenues from pensions because it is difficult to explain the consequences from this action. It's a step removed from most people's day-to-day expenditure.' Certainly that was how it turned out last March when Mr Norman Lamont, then chancellor, cut the amount of recoverable advance corporation tax paid on corporate dividends that pension schemes could claim from 25 per cent to 20 per cent of the dividend's value. For weeks the industry barely murmured its objections, although the effect of the change was to deprive schemes of 6 1/4 per cent of their annual cashflow earned on UK shares. Finally, the industry trade body, the National Association of Pension Funds, succeeded in extracting a promise that further reductions in recoverable ACT were not planned. But experts remain uneasy that the promise will be kept. Mr Andrew Wilson, partner at consulting actuaries R Watson and Sons, said that further reductions in recoverable ACT would reap the government far less than it believed. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said a reduction to 10 per cent will raise Pounds 3bn a year. 'But the net figure is closer to Pounds 500m,' Mr Wilson said. That is because the resulting loss in cashflow will force companies to contribute an additional Pounds 3.5bn a year to their pension schemes, thus reducing the amount of ACT paid to government in the first place. Mr Evans noted that tax advantages occurred at three stages in the pension cycle, when a contribution was made, while investment income was earned and, through the availability of a tax-free lump sum on final benefits, tax relief on withdrawals. 'It would be very dangerous to tax pensions at all three points,' he said. There is a growing consensus that the tax-free lump sum is an anomalous tax break and should be phased out. The institute has said the government could raise an additional Pounds 1bn a year by eliminating it. When this change was last seriously proposed by Mr Nigel Lawson, now Lord Lawson, in 1988, it sparked one of the loudest public outcries of his term, according to his memoirs. The mood may have changed, however. The government's own Pension Law Review Committee wrote in a report that was published in September: 'We received a considerable amount of evidence from institutions suggesting that in return for simplicity of administration the right to receive a tax-free lump sum might be conceded.' Mr Evans pointed out that such a change could only be phased in over time, but that the government might not wish to wait so long to see an improvement in its finances. Other possible tax changes include the suggestion of Mr John Maples, the former Treasury minister, that the tax relief afforded on contributions be abolished in favour of tax-free pensions. This would raise Pounds 7bn immediately while cutting revenues in the future. There would be significant difficulties, however, and officials have recently indicated that the proposal will not be adopted. Mr Paul Johnson, researcher at the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said it was more likely that the chancellor would seek to restrict the level of tax relief on contributions to the basic rate of 25 per cent or even to reduce it to 20 per cent. The first measure would raise between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn while the second could add Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn to the public coffers.</p>

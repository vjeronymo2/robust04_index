			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch": "Guangdong Public Security Authorities Explain </F> the Causes of the Police Office Storming Incident in Huiyang";  all names as published]    [Text] Guangzhou, 3 Apr (TA KUNG PAO)--When being  interviewed by TA KUNG PAO today, a responsible official with  the Guangdong Provincial Public Security Department said:  Recently, the police station [pai chu suo 3175 0427 2076] in  Xiayong Town of Huizhou City's Daya Bay Administrative District  was stormed by some people, and innocent policemen there were  beaten up. It was a serious incident stirred up by a small  number of lawbreakers.    He stressed: The lawbreakers instigated some villagers who  were unaware of the true facts to attack the policemen in order  to prevent the public security personnel from arresting criminal  offenders. When the policemen found that they could not perform  their duties, and their lives and safety were threatened, they  were forced to take the necessary emergency measures.    According to the responsible official of the Public Security  Department of Guangdong Province, on the early morning of 1  April, between 0500 and 0600, the Xiayong Town police office  subordinate to the Daya Bay Public Security Sub-bureau  dispatched 10 policemen to arrest two criminals, Chen Ren-X and  Chen X-hui, in Bogang Village. According to information and  evidence held by the police, the two suspected criminals were  involved in four blackmail cases last July and August and  extorted more than 13,000 yuan from their victims. They  seriously threatened law and order in the local community.  Through careful investigation, the public security organ decided  to send policemen to arrest the two people. The policemen acted  in two groups, and they caught the two suspected criminals in a  short time. Chen X-hui was brought back to the police station  first.    When the policemen were going to take Chen Ren-X away from  the village, he suddenly cried "help!" His younger brothers and  sisters-in-law took clubs and stones and chased the policemen.  The attackers beat up the policemen -- who had displayed their  certificates and the arrest warrant -- and even beat a policeman  unconscious. When finding that their warnings were ineffective,  another policeman was forced to pull out his pistol and shoot at  the leg of club-wielding Chen X-chao, elder brother of Chen  Ren-X. This shocked the besiegers and stopped their attack.    At 0900 that morning, the police station inspector led  several police officers to Bogang Village to explain their  actions. On the way to the village, they encountered a number  of armed villages who were planning to attack the police  station. Persuaded by the police officers, some villagers  returned home, but more than 100 people still rushed to the  police station as encouraged by Chen X-shan. They demanded the  release of criminal Chen X-hui. Leaders of the Xiayong Town  Office and police officers of the police station patiently  explained what had happened, but the villagers ignored the  warnings and continued to storm the police station. Zhang  Xinde, chief of the Daya Bay Public Security Bureau, then led a  group of police officers to the area and took resolute action to  arrest Chen X-shan, Chen X-wen, Chen X-hua, Chen X-jun, and Chen  X-ling who took the lead in stirring up trouble, and thus calmed  down the incident.    The official said that this case of instigating villagers to  stir up trouble was very serious. At present, the Daya Bay  Public Security Bureau is intensively investigating the case.  Those who took the lead in impeding police officers from  carrying out their tasks, instigating villagers to storm the  police station, and attacking and injuring public security  personnel will be punished severely according to the law.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Construction Contracts: Lindum heads South A Pounds 10m contract to design and build a new engineering facility for Peter Brotherhood of Peterborough has been given to Lincoln-based LINDUM CONSTRUCTION. The 147,000 sq ft factory and offices - covering an area the size of three football pitches - will be on a 12-acre site in Werrington, Peterborough, less than two miles from the company's present facility. Work begins on site this month and is scheduled for completion by October 1994. The factory floor area has been designed to take loads of up to 150 tonnes. An external feature of the building will be the glass curtain walling, introduced to break up the large expanses of metal cladding. Design of the 13m-high fac-ility conforms with the stringent environmental controls. More than 40 per cent of the contract value relates to electrical and mechanical installation to be carried out by Derry Building Services, part of the Bowmer &amp; Kirkland group based at Derby. Architects are Benoy, consulting engineers John Gilbert, and Peter Brotherhood's project representatives, Thornton Firkin &amp; Partners.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Cal/OSHA resumed operations for the first time since July 1, 1987, when it  closed down after Gov. George Deukmejian vetoed its funding. At that time, the  federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration assumed responsibility  for protecting California's 9.5 million private-sector workers. Last November,  California voters passed an initiative to restore the state agency. The next  five months will be a transition period, during which federal officials will  retain some jurisdiction, while the state agency becomes fully staffed and  changes some of its regulations to bring them into conformity with federal  safety standards that were enacted during the last two years.  </P></p>

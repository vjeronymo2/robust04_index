			<p>CSO     [Text] Consumers want to purchase environment-friendly  products, and manufacturers want to accommodate them. But how to  calculate the environmental impact of, say, a car or a  refrigerator or an entire building?    That is a problem which has just recently begun to be  addressed in a process called life-cycle assessment.    It is not just a matter of measuring the environmental  impact  of a product while in use. The entire life cycle of the product  must be considered, embracing the acquisition of natural  resources, the production of materials, the manufacture of  goods, the distribution of goods, the use of those goods and  finally their disposal, including recycling wherever possible.    Moves are afoot to establish international standards for the  assessment of the environmental impact of various products. In  the meantime, government, academic and corporate groups are  grappling on their own with the problem of how to devise valid  evaluation methods.    Since global warming and destruction of the ozone layer are  foremost in the minds of people worried about the environmental  impact of industrial activity, many efforts at life-cycle  assessment focus on the generation of carbon dioxide and  chlorofluorocarbons.  <H5>  Life of a Building </H5>   A life-cycle assessment for buildings was made by  researchers  from Waseda University and Nikken Sekkei Ltd., the largest  architectural designing company in Japan. They asked how carbon  dioxide emissions would change if the building were designed to  be more energy efficient and to last longer. For their study,  they considered every stage in the life of a building, from  construction through operation and renovation to final  demolition.    According to their calculations, if the building were  designed with state-of-the-art air conditioning and other  systems to reduce energy consumption by 50 percent during  operation, more carbon dioxide would be generated during the  construction of the building. Nevertheless, emissions could be  reduced by 18 percent over the entire life of the building.    A similar life-cycle assessment for automobiles was carried  out by the University of Tokyo and the National Institution for  Environmental Studies. They calculated that carbon dioxide  emissions equivalent to 8.3 metric tons of carbon are released  for each car. The calculation takes into account the  manufacture, use, maintenance and disposal of cars.    Fuel consumption accounts for 70 percent of the lost carbon,  which should not be surprising. But another 10 percent comes  from the construction and maintenance of roads for the cars to  drive on. The researchers note that this is a significant amount  and argue that roadway infrastructure is a factor which cannot  be ignored when evaluating the environmental impact of cars.    At the company level, Canon Inc. recently calculated the  amount of carbon dioxide released during the life cycle of the  replaceable toner cartridges used in its photocopiers. The  company's assessment took into account overseas transport of the  toner and looked at how recycling could cut down on emissions.    Life-cycle assessments are not limited to evaluations of  greenhouse gas emissions. IBM Japan Ltd., for example, is  studying ways to design computers that are easier to recycle.  The process involves evaluating how easily machines can be  dismantled.    Meanwhile, the Plastic Waste Management Institute is  investigating plastic materials and evaluating how the  conservation of raw materials and energy would cut down on the  emission of environmental pollutants.  <H5>  Unravelling the Knot </H5>   Despite such efforts, life-cycle assessment is still a young  science and many problems still need to be resolved. For  example, carbon dioxide is not the only harmful substance  produced during product life cycles; solid wastes and nitrogen  oxides are also released. It is difficult to untangle all the  factors and decide which have significant impact on the  environment.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry wants to  collect more data on the subject. It feels that none of the  evaluation methods have been fully substantiated yet. For this  reason, government agencies including the Science and Technology  Agency and the Environment Agency are working to develop new  methods while keeping a close eye on efforts by researchers  elsewhere in the field.</p>

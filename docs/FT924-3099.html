			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (10): US joint venture - Profile of Maple Leaf Foods A CLEAR pattern runs through the shake-up which Hillsdown Holdings has given Maple Leaf Foods in the two and a half years since the British conglomerate bought control of Canada's biggest food processor. 'From day one in restructuring this business, we looked at it to be cost-competitive on a North American basis and not on a Canadian basis,' says Mr Art Devlin, a senior vice-president who is the only senior manager to have survived Hillsdown's medicine. Known as a lumbering corporate dinosaur in its former incarnation as Canada Packers, Maple Leaf is now blazing the trail which many other Canadian companies will have to follow if they are to survive and prosper in a more competitive environment. In a strategy typical of many other industries, Maple Leaf's US competitors no longer treat Canada as part of their foreign operations but as an extension of their domestic market. The US food companies are stepping up their drive into Canada. Imports of prepared meats and other products have risen markedly as tariff barriers are lowered under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. As Mr Devlin puts it, 'the economic borders are disappearing. We tend to think of our businesses now as geographic regions running north-south, rather than east-west.' Maple Leaf sold its dairy and edible oils businesses after realising that they were too small to go head-to-head against the giants of the North American industry. Beef-slaughtering became less attractive when Cargill put up a huge new facility in Alberta, and the provincial government started propping up smaller, inefficient producers. A large broom has been swept through Maple Leaf's remaining businesses - such as poultry, prepared meats, groceries, milling and baking. It has closed some plants, combined production at others and, in a few cases, made acquisitions to achieve economies of scale. Stiffer competition and the recession have not left the company unscathed, however. Earnings per share from continuing operations edged up by a modest 5 per cent in the first six months of 1992. But the Canadian company is at least lean enough now to start holding its own against the US giants, not just in Canada, but also on their own turf. Significantly, when Hillsdown picked a new chief executive officer for Maple Leaf last April, its choice was Mr Charles Bowen, who has spent much of his career with General Foods of the US. Mr Bowen's priorities include expansion south of the 49th Parallel. A milestone in the cross-border strategy was a 50-50 joint venture set up earlier this year with ConAgra, the US food processor. Maple Leaf has contributed its entire milling and baking mix business, while ConAgra has chipped in a large mill in Buffalo, New York. ConAgra manages the venture, enabling the Canadian businesses to benefit from the economies of scale of ConAgra's payroll, data processing and purchasing departments. For its part, ConAgra has stepped up its purchases from the Canadian flour mills. Maple Leaf is now examining the feasibility of expanding the partnership to other products, and perhaps forming similar ventures with other US companies. It already exports about a third of its fresh pork output to the US. Bread, pasta, frozen dough, prepared meats and animal feeds are among other products which are finding a market south of the border. Rather than take on heavyweight US brands, however, Maple Leaf is putting the emphasis on private-label business where it can compete on price and quality without a hefty marketing budget. With no debt on its books, Maple Leaf can afford a substantial acquisition in the US. But here, too, the Canadian company is aware of its limitations. Rather than trying to be a national brand-name player, it is looking for regional, perhaps family-owned, companies. What Maple Leaf would most like to find is a little-noticed company with a franchise as strong and a management as weak as Canada Packers had when its new British shareholders came on the scene two years ago.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Chiroscience poised for anaesthetic link Chiroscience Group, the biotechnology company which floated in February, said yesterday that it was likely to sign collaborations with large pharmaceuticals companies within the next few months. The deal would be to sell levobupivacaine, Chiroscience's local anaesthetic, which has shown improved safety over standard bupivacaine in clinical trials just completed. 'The deals would probably consist of an upfront payment and a royalty arrangement,' said Mr Nowell Stebbing, deputy chairman. The company is understood to be likely to sign a deal with one of the few specialist companies in anaesthetics. They could include Sweden's Astra and Zeneca and BOC of the UK. A product could be on sale within three years which would be initially aimed at taking a proportion of the existing bupivacaine market, worth Dollars 100m (Pounds 68m) a year. The improvements shown so far by the new drug suggest it would find customers in the wider anaesthetic market, worth Dollars 1.2bn a year in global sales, said Mr John Padfield, chief executive. The probability of the deal was outlined at the company's annual results presentation. There were only 17 days of trading between the flotation and the end of the company's financial year, so the figures were close to what had been forecast. The infusion of cash from the flotation took net assets to Pounds 45m, or 66p per share. Spending on research and development more than doubled from Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 3.7bn as the number of staff rose from 48 to 103. Turnover, a relatively unimportant figure for young biotechnology companies, improved from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 2m. Pre-tax losses widened to Pounds 4.27m (Pounds 1.25m); losses per share were 11.9p (6p).</p>

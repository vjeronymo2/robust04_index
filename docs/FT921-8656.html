			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Retail price cuts cause sharp drop in inflation THE UK inflation rate fell steeply last month as a result of deep price cuts in shops hit by the recession, according to government figures released yesterday. The Central Statistical Office also announced a further fall in manufacturing output at the end of last year, putting Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, under more pressure to stimulate the economy in next month's Budget. In the 12 months to January, the retail prices index rose by 4.1 per cent, after a 4.5 per cent year-on-year rate in December. The fall in the annual rate was much bigger than expected in the City, and followed two consecutive monthly increases. A measure often taken as the underlying rate of retail price inflation - the RPI without mortgage costs - showed a year-on-year rise last month of 5.6 per cent, after 5.8 per cent in December. But the good news for the government on lower inflation, which it reckons will provide the base for a broad economic recovery, was countered by a 1.2 per cent drop in manufacturing output between the third and fourth quarters of last year. With manufacturing accounting for just under a quarter of UK output, it appears the non-oil economy contracted slightly or was flat in the final quarter - the sixth consecutive quarter of recession. Especially worrying for the government - whose record on the economy will be a central theme in the election - are signs that the rate of decline in manufacturing output is increasing. The fall at the end of last year followed several months in which production had appeared to stabilise. Mr Lamont said the RPI figures showed Britain was on course for permanently low inflation, though he described the production figures as 'disappointing'. Earlier this week, other government figures had revealed a big drop in factory-goods inflation and a large increase in unemployment, indicating that the recession is likely to continue well into this year. According to the CSO, the sharp fall in retail price inflation was partly caused by exceptionally sharp price reductions in the January sales. Prices of clothing and footwear fell by 5.1 per cent, the steepest drop since 1921. A drop in petrol prices also helped to push down Britain's inflation rate to a figure well under the 4.5 per cent average in the other countries in the European exchange rate mechanism. The RPI numbers were received coolly by Mr John Smith, the Labour shadow chancellor, who said inflation was being 'suppressed rather than defeated'. The economic gloom has heightened fears among senior Conservatives that Labour will squash any Tory lead in the opinion polls and begin building momentum behind its campaign for the general election.

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Book Review: Enigma at the heart of the bloke KENNETH CLARKE By Malcolm Balen Fourth Estate, 302 pages, hardback Pounds 18.99 He's blokeish, with a hail-fellow-well-met quality, always popping up on our television screens or disturbing a quiet breakfast by trying to outshout the presenter of BBC radio's Today programme. But Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor, is still a puzzle. He defies easy categorisation. He hails by tradition and intellect from the left of the Conservative party, but has nevertheless spearheaded some of the most bruising confrontations between government and recalcitrant employees such as doctors, ambulance workers and teachers. Although a stickler for upholding the powers of Parliament, he has facilitated a steady increase in the Bank of England's say in monetary policy. Then there is the sartorially challenged Clarke with his famously crumpled suits and suede Hush Puppy shoes. These are shouting out a message of some sort: but what? This book, in spite or perhaps because of being 'completed with Mr Clarke's full co-operation', leaves the reader still unclear as to what really makes this ambitious politician tick. However, author Malcolm Balen, the editor of BBC TV's Nine O'Clock News, has provided the next best thing in this readable account of the ups and downs in a career that put Clarke in charge of the UK's health, education, law and order and now the Treasury. It would be a heroic story if John Major had not already overcome greater handicaps in his background to become prime minister. But the tale of the Nottinghamshire watch-repairer's son (from what Tory canvassers would identify as a C2 skilled working-class family), who resolved early in life to become an MP and who has climbed high enough up the Tory party's greasy pole to eye the prime minister's job, is still sufficiently unusual and topical to be worth telling. Of obvious importance were the scholarship successes to the upmarket Nottingham High School and to Cambridge, and the discovery of like-minded souls at university who were later to form a 'Cambridge mafia' of friends and rivals in the Tory governments of the 1970s and 1980s. A stable family life, which Clarke takes care to keep out of the public eye, and outside interests such as jazz have doubtless given him greater stay-ing power than many politicians. But the story is not without its dark moments. Clarke's mother developed a drink problem when he was in his teens and, according to his younger brother Michael, died an alcoholic. While Clarke's childhood appears to have been happy enough, Balen suggests that he started early in life to fashion a tough outer shell. Many people in these pages describe Clarke as 'self-contained'. Balen says his subject is 'a gregarious man who is intensely private' and 'an uncomplicated enigma'. For Michael Clarke, 'Ken is like an iceberg. Seventy five per cent of him is underwater. To get where he's got, he must be like that. I'm not saying his personality is a facade - it isn't - but there's a very large inner person. He can be very emotional. But he tends to detach himself.' That submerged 75 per cent no doubt helped Clarke through the frustrations of the 1980s. As not 'one of us' he failed for many years to prosper under Mrs Thatcher. He only entered the cabinet in 1985 and then as Commons spokesman for the employment secretary, Lord Young. Once in high office, Clarke developed a talent for getting into fights. A love of controversy had always been there. The book recounts how, as head of the Cambridge University Conservative Association, Clarke had caused an almighty row by inviting Oswald Mosley, the head of the British fascists in the 1930s, to speak. He rode out the storm but it delayed his rise to the politically important post of president of the Cambridge Union, the students' debating society. Similarly, Balen says Clarke's later battles with doctors and ambulance workers 'set back his career and ultimately cost him a place in the leadership race when Mrs Thatcher resigned'. That Clarke is now chancellor is a measure of the policy failure that culminated in sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism and the presentational ineptitude of Norman Lamont, his immediate predecessor. Balen's book, which finishes with Clarke's tax-raising Budget of last November, wisely steers clear of predicting whether the chancellor will move next door to Number 10 Downing Street. For Clarke's performance at the Treasury will be crucial in determining whether he will one day succeed John Major as prime minister or leader of the opposition. Clarke has so far been both lucky and skilful in running his second (after the Home Office) of the three great offices of state. From the hapless Lamont, he inherited an economy with low inflation and low interest rates that was recovering from recession. He had the guts to tackle the problem of the annual Pounds 50bn deficit head-on through unpopular tax rises. True, 'Clarkes' took a pounding earlier this year on the Westminster gossip exchange when the import of the tax increases dawned. But with the economy still growing and the setback that John Smith's death caused to the leadership hopes of Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, Clarke's stock appears to be rising again - at least within the Tory party. The nagging worry, which Balen's book does nothing to dispel, is whether Clarke is an accident waiting to happen. The book chronicles how ill- considered remarks when health secretary exacerbated his disputes with the doctors and ambulance service. There was also the television debate after Black Wednesday's ERM exit in which he admitted that he had never read the Maastricht treaty. Such mishandling can be excused and overcome in a battle against vested interests. But will financial markets be so forgiving if they turn against the pound and this chancellor?</p>

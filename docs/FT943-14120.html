			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - Personal Pensions (27): A way to keep your capital - Is a Pep better? / Eric Short compares two tax-efficient routes Annuity rates have bounced back from their 20-year low, but until recently they had highlighted an aspect of personal pensions often overlooked in the marketing of these contracts. It is not the cash accumulated under the contract that matters, so much as the amount of pension the cash will buy. Personal pensions are tax-efficient and offer considerable flexibility with regard to contribution payments and choice of funds up to the time the benefits are taken. But there are also certain drawbacks. First, the assets held in a personal pension are locked in. You cannot get hold of them before age 50 in theory, and much later in practice. This inflexibility is of concern if you suddenly need money, as may happen if you are made redundant or your business folds up. Second, once the individual is free to take benefits from a personal pension, only a quarter of the value can be taken as a tax-free cash sum. The remainder must be used to buy an annuity - and here the disadvantages of personal pensions become apparent. Annuity rates depend on prevailing interest rates, sex and the age at which the individual buys the annuity. The lower the age, the lower the income. Someone taking benefits from a personal pension while still relatively young is likely to find that what appears to be a sizeable cash sum buys a disappointingly low income - even lower for a woman. But the problems do not stop there. Income from the annuity is taxed as earned income, which for most people means that the whole of the income is taxable, subject to personal allowances. Finally, someone buying an annuity is effectively gambling on how long he or she will live. If they die within a few years, the balance of the invested capital is lost so far as the children are concerned. Individuals can partially protect that capital by taking out an annuity with a spouse's benefit, or an annuity with payments guaranteed for a fixed number of years. But this protection has to be paid for in the form of much lower annuity payments. When annuity rates are already low, people will be reluctant to take an even lower income in order preserve their capital. Indeed, many are opposed to annuities in principle because of this early-death factor - though the balance of the capital does not go into the pockets of the life companies' shareholders, as is popularly supposed, but to pay that growing number of annuitants who live until they are 80 and beyond. These disadvantages have led many people and their advisers to look at personal equity plans (Peps) as a means of at least boosting income in retirement, if not as an alternative to a personal pension. True, contributions to a Pep are paid out of net income, but thereafter the investment is as tax-efficient as a personal pension in the build-up of funds, and more flexible and tax-efficient when it comes to the benefits. Individuals and advisers who have been attracted to Peps like the idea of being able to take income or capital, or both, at any time they please in the form of tax-free cash. For example, they may take just the income from the Pep fund, tax-free - income that should rise as dividend payments rise - leaving the capital intact to continue to grow, and perhaps to be passed on to the next generation at death, thus avoiding loss of capital on early death. (Table 1 illustrates the provision of income from a Pep - on the assumption that Peps have been available for the past 15 years.) Alternatively, a person may boost his income further by using some of the capital, though this would diminish the underlying fund. It is always easy to convert capital into income, simply by purchasing an annuity. With the capital from a Pep, one would buy a purchased life annuity, which provides a higher after-tax return than a pension annuity bought with cash from a personal pension. Part of a purchased life annuity - the element deemed to constitute return of capital - is tax-free, leaving only the interest element liable for tax. By comparison, the whole of a pension annuity is taxable. The average duration of payments into a personal pension is around 15 years, because only in later life can most people afford to make substantial contributions. Consequently, the shorter the time before benefits are taken, the less will be the effect of tax relief on payments. So the older the individual, the more attractive Peps become as a means of boosting income. Table 2 compares a personal pension and a Pep. The latter provides a greater cash sum, but less income, particularly at an older age, so a greater part of the capital is preserved if someone dies shortly after taking the benefits. However, personal pensions and Peps are not mutually exclusive. You can invest in both if you have sufficient means. An efficient financial planning exercise would derive the best from each, and allow flexibility of income in retirement.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 1: Income from a personal equity plan  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1, Pep taken out by an individual in 1979.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 2, Contributions of Pounds6,000 a year for 15 years are made and invested in Save &amp; Prosper Scotyield fund. Dividends on the fund are automatically reinvested.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 3, By 1994, the Pep fund value has accumulated to around Pounds440,000  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 4, The individual now needs to take income from the Pep.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 5, The current dividends from the fund are around Pounds16,900 a year. The individual can take this income out of the Pep tax-free, so this is equivalent to a gross income of around Pounds22,500, assuming basic-rate tax of 25 per cent.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 6, This income is not dependent directly on the age and sex of the individual, only on the investment period and performance.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 7, Dividends on the fund over the past 15 years have grown by 7.3 per cent a year, compared with an annual inflation rate of 7 per cent over the same period. However, current dividend growth is around 5 per cent. So this income from the Pep should at least increase in line with inflation over the long term.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 8, The fund of Pounds440,000 can continue to be invested, though its future growth will be lower than before because dividends are not being reinvested. But over the long term its value should increase.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Save &amp; Prosper  ---------------------------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Table 2: Pension v Pep  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. If a contribution of Pounds6,000 net (Pounds8,000 gross, assuming tax at 25 per cent) was paid over 15 years into a personal pension investing in the same underlying fund, the corresponding value after 15 years would be around Pounds587,000. 2. If benefits are then taken, the individual could take Pounds146,750 as tax-free cash, while the balance of Pounds440,250 must be used to buy an annuity. 3. By comparison with a Pep, the individual invests in an annuity on his or her life, increasing each year at 5 per cent. The annuity payments are subject to tax. The position on taking the benefits would be as follows:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------       PERSONAL PENSION                    PEP       Cash sum of                         Cash sum of       Pounds146,750, plus                 Pounds440,000, plus       net annual income                   tax-free annual       (at 25%) of:                        income of:  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Age at taking             Man      Woman benefits        Pounds      Pounds  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 60              20,326      17,843        Pounds16,900 pa 65              23,860      20,650        all ages, 70              28,690      24,625        both sexes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

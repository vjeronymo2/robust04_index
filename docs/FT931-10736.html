			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Still plenty of North Sea life . . .: The outlook for British hydro-carbon output is by no means drear, though it depends on who you talk to. David Lascelles makes a helicopter tour of oil rigs OIL BEGAN to flow from the North Sea 25 years ago, providing Britain with a timely means to gild its fading fortunes. But, as the present row over coal has shown, oil is a resource over which the average Briton frets as much as he gloats. The nation must be mad to shut collieries, he says, when it measures its coal reserves in centuries but oil and gas only in years. What is the truth? It depends who you talk to. Unst is Britain's most northerly settlement, clustered round a windswept inlet of the Shetland islands - an area that drew unwelcome headlines last month when the tanker Braer ran on to rocks and spilled its entire cargo. Unst is where you board a helicopter for the 45-minute flight to the Ninian Central platform, one of those gigantic structures poking out of the sea, bristling with cranes and pipes. Ninian is a grand-daddy of the North Sea. It has been braving storms for 24 years, and it shows. Weather-beaten, man-battered, already it is a monument to Britain's oil age. It is like a small village, with 200 inhabitants and a huge factory attached. Its generators can produce enough electricity to power Edinburgh. Migrating birds have made it a staging post. But it belongs to the past. When Ninian started, it sat astride one of the most productive fields yet found. The natural pressure in its vast reservoirs forced out 315,000 barrels of oil a day, enough to supply more than a fifth of Britain's needs on its own. Today, liquid still gushes out of Ninian, but more than three-quarters of it is sea water which has to be pumped into the well to keep up the pressure. Ninian's workers now spend most of their time removing that water. They pipe the liquid into huge settling tanks where the oil separates out, rather like salad dressing left to stand. To date, 1bn of Ninian's estimated 3bn barrels have been sucked out and Derek Smith, the Chevron platform manager, thinks they may be able to get 1bn more. But you can never suck an oil well completely dry. Ninian's future depends on whether they dream up more sophisticated ways of extracting oil, and whether its price rises enough to justify extra investment. But the future is inescapable. Ninian is dying, slowly. 'The field could last until 2004 or 2005,' says Smith. Many people have claimed that Britain's oil wealth has been squandered. That is not the case at Ninian. Its glory days in the early 1980s also were the days of sky-high prices. It cashed in at the top of the market and provided the UK with a bonanza. Now, Ninian is having to adjust to other realities of the North Sea: declining returns, rising costs, and the tougher regulations brought on by the 1988 Piper Alpha disaster. To boost its earnings and make full use of its 110-mile pipeline to the Shetlands, Ninian is developing a new role for itself as a collecting point for oil from neighbouring fields. Ninian typifies a passing era. Britain's oil and gas production peaked in 1986 with 166m tonnes of oil equivalent, vastly more than its own needs of 127m tonnes. In 1991, output was down to 139m tonnes, barely meeting demand of 136m. Over the past 10 years, UK earnings from oil and gas have nearly halved - from more than Pounds 20bn to Pounds 11bn  - and revenues from taxes and royalties have plummeted from Pounds 12bn to Pounds 1bn. In 1991, the oil and gas industry, with all the onshore jobs it sustains, accounted for a mere 1.5 per cent of Britain's gross national product. Oilmen will tell you that all the big North Sea fields probably have been found. In future, it is a matter of developing the smaller ones in between and finding ways to squeeze extra barrels out of the old ones. This decline has a lot to do with the weakness of the oil price, which is at a 20-year low in real terms. This is putting enormous pressure on the North Sea's traditionally high operating costs, and obliging the government to take a more lenient line on taxation and regulation. There is talk of some of the big US companies moving out. The squeeze is apparent onshore as well. The great sea lochs of Scotland are packed with idle rigs; others are being towed thousands of miles to the new oil frontiers, such as Vietnam. Some months ago, Ben Line, one of the few British-owned rig operators, pulled out of the business because of slack demand. People in Aberdeen, Britain's oil capital, worry if the UK will preserve enough of its stock of equipment and know-how to sustain an indigenous industry. 'UK-based industry is doing 80 per cent of the North Sea work but maybe only 5 per cent of the world market,' says Ian Wood, chairman of John Wood Group, an Aberdeen-based energy service company. 'We've made very little impact on the world scene. There's nothing like a Division 1 company in the UK.' He is urging the government to help transform Aberdeen into an oil centre of world stature: a European Houston. Two hundred miles south of Ninian is the Nelson rig. On the flight, you notice the multitude of platforms all around: to the east is Brent, another grand-daddy; to the south, Alwyn; to the west, Heather - all producing oil and gas. Gas flares create bright spots in the leaden sea. It does not look like an industry in decline. Approaching Nelson, we pass the platforms of the Forties' field, British Petroleum's biggest find. The helicopter circles, testing the wind currents. On the helipad, heavily-kitted emergency teams stand by. The machine settles on to a patchwork of thick rope, to stop the wheels sliding. The story on Nelson is rather different from Ninian. This is not a production platform with its feet on the sea floor; it is a floating drill rig, and it is looking for new oil rather than sucking out old. At its heart is a huge drill stem capable of reaching five miles under the ocean floor. Below us lies the Nelson field, as yet untapped but with upwards of 500m barrels of oil. There is a buzz in the air. 'That's Forties' sand,' says John Shute, the project director at Enterprise Oil, a part-owner of the field. In his hand is a pile of wet sand which has been drawn up by the drill. He holds it under an ultra-violet light. It glows yellow, meaning that it is moist with oil. Nelson's proximity to the BP field is the reason for the excitement. It is small by comparison - about a fifth of Forties' size - but is one of the largest being developed, so it represents a chunk of the North Sea's future. Nelson is typical of the advances made in 25 years of North Sea exploration. In the old days, individual rigs moved expensively around the surface, drilling a string of vertical holes in the seabed. Nelson can do it all from one spot. Using steerable drill bits, it will bore 32 separate wells, splaying out in all directions. So sophisticated has directional drilling become that Nelson's operators are able to aim a well more than two miles deep with an accuracy of 10ft. The drill bit has an electronic black box which sends back pulses. These are picked up by sensors, which measure precisely its position and make course corrections if needed. Oilmen can even go past a reservoir and bore into it from underneath if their geologists reckon that will yield more oil. All this has slashed costs. Gordon Culloch, a burly Mississippian with the Santa Fe company, which operates the rig, says drilling innovations have halved the average time taken to bore a North Sea well to 30 days. 'What it's all about is productivity,' he says. 'Fields are going to get smaller, and we just have to be more efficient. There's no future for guys who can't do that.' About a dozen oilfields continue to be found each year. Most of them are much smaller than Nelson, but they help to preserve Britain's reserves-to-production ratio - a key measure of how long the oil will last. In fact, the present gloom might be deceptive. Most forecasters believe UK oil and gas output will surge to a new peak during the late 1990s as the Nelson generation of wells comes on stream. And oil companies have far from exhausted the search. 'There's 10 years of healthy exploration left in the North Sea,' says John Hogan, North Sea managing director of Lasmo, which part-owns Ninian's waning resources. But Lasmo has several other projects going and expects to double its output of oil, and treble its gas output, by 1997. Just as important as the rate of discovery is the advance in extraction technology. A striking example is Brent, where Shell and Esso are spending Pounds 1bn rejuvenating one of the UK's earliest and largest fields. As oil output declines, the field is being switched gradually to extract the huge bubble of gas which has accumulated at the top of the reservoir. Shell's engineers reckon they can give Brent new life as a gasfield producing 500m cubic feet a day - 5-10 per cent of Britain's needs. Oil seldom runs out completely. Man either finds new ways of extracting it or the threat of shortage drives prices up to levels that trigger fresh investment. 'We went to Brunei in 1921 thinking the oil would last until 1935,' says Jerry Saville, until recently Shell's personnel director in Aberdeen. 'We're still there.' Although oilmen complain about the UK's high costs, they still see the North Sea as one of the world's most attractive exploration areas because of the high quality of the oilfields and the hospitable political environment. 'It's the centre stage,' says Santa Fe's Culloch. 'In the US, oil is seen as a sunset industry. Here, it's still exciting and glamorous.' So, what does our swing through the rigs tell us? All the big fields have been found, and some are tailing off already. But the high level of activity and technological advance gives grounds for hope. Estimating the life of reserves is a notoriously inexact science. The department of trade and industry has calculated that, at the very least, the UK still has 555m tonnes of recoverable oil. At the present production rate of 91m tonnes annually, that is enough for a mere six years. Nobody believes things are that bad, though. The DTI's maximum estimate is 1,960m tonnes, enough for just over 20 years, which is the sort of figure you hear more often in the oil industry. But the big change that will occur during the 1990s is foreshadowed by developments at Brent. Gas will become much more important: BP estimates it will account for as much as 40 per cent of North Sea hydrocarbon output by 2000, and that this share will go on rising into the next century. This is what underlies the 'dash for gas' which has been blamed for squeezing coal out of the power generation market. The DTI's estimates of known gas reserves would last up to 36 years at present consumption rates. True, gas consumption will rise sharply in the years ahead - but we may have discovered only half the gas that exists. So, the North Sea is at something of a turning point. 'We've left the pioneering age behind us,' says Jan Veldwijk, a Dutchman who heads the local operations of Rockwater, a specialist in underwater contracting. 'We mature all the time. We're harvesting experience.' The old image of gigantic platforms pouring out oil needs to be discarded. In its place, think of high-tech rigs sucking out oil from dark corners, and gas hissing out of valves plugged into the sea floor. There could even be enough hydrocarbon and gas to last half a century. By then, who knows what amazing new fuel source might have been invented.</p>

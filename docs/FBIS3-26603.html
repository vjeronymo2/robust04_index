The observatory also predicted that after the  Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is officially put into operation,  the increase in the quantity of radiation in Hong Kong per year  will be fairly low and will not affect human health.    Since the end of last August, the Dayawan Nuclear Power  Plant  has started supplying on a trial basis some electricity needed  in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Observatory set up nuclear  radiation monitoring posts in 10 areas of Hong Kong, but to date  has found no signs of an increase in the quantity of radiation.  Wang Mingsong, chief senior scientist at the observatory, said:  It is predicted that after the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant is  put into full operation, the increase in the quantity of  radiation in Hong Kong will be merely under one-thousandth the  amount of ordinary radiation exposure in urban areas; this will  not affect human health.    Dai Qianjun, public affairs manager for the Hong Kong  Nuclear  Power Investment Corporation, noted: Hong Kong's power plants  did not increase power generating equipment last year, but Hong  Kong's demand for electricity is increasing. After it is put  into operation, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Plant can provide 70  percent of its electricity to Hong Kong, accounting for 17 to 18  percent of the amount consumed in Hong Kong; this will meet Hong  Kong's power demands from 1994 to 1995. Moreover, the low  operating cost will maintain a stable electric rate in Hong Kong  over the next 20 years.</p>

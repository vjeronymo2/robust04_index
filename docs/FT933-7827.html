			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Smoking cannot be called just a European habit (2) Sir, An anecdote springs to mind in response to Dr M Singer's letter. A colleague of mine was in the US for a series of meetings this summer. A native of Spain, he is very much a smoker. As we sat in a conference room waiting, he looked around for an ash tray. He did not find one and asked me about it. I pointed to a sign on the wall that said: 'Smoking in this room will only be permitted once a consensus has been reached by all present.' I guess that's the democratic 'No smoking' sign of the 1990s, although it seems slightly out of place in a country that distributes free needles to drug addicts. And for the record, I too am a non-smoker. Eileen M O'Connor, 20 Edgewood Road, Glen Ridge, New Jersey, US</p>

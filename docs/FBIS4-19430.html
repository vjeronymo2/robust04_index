			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Yesterday, the battle for the posts of  parliamentary speakers was shown live on television. Today,  work is already under way to form a new government. According  to Forza Italia leader Silvio Berlusconi it will be ready by the  end of the month.    Outgoing Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has sent a  cable  to former speakers Giovanni Spadolini and Giorgio Napolitano to  thank them on behalf of the government for their complete  impartiality and for their deep understanding of the state --  Ciampi wrote -- with which they have ensured that parliamentary  work has made good progress. He also stressed the correctness  of the constitutional relationship between the government and  the parties of the opposition. [passage omitted]    President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro will start to hold  consultations to form a government on Thursday 21 April. The  new prime minister is almost certain to be appointed after 25  April. [passage omitted]    In the Senate the problem of a too slender majority remains  for Berlusconi. It is a problem of numbers, but above all it is  a political problem. For this reason Berlusconi has adopted a  strategy of focusing on the center. He has denied buying votes  [in yesterday's parliamentary speakers elections]: Our majority  has shown that it is concrete, but needs to be widened. The  message was aimed at the PPI [Italian People's Party]. Nicola  Mancino, [outgoing interior minister and newly appointed PPI  spokesperson in the Chamber of Deputies, [PPI deputy Rosy]  Bindi, and [PPI chairperson] Jervolino have said that he will  never get their votes, but Berlusconi knows that other members  of the PPI are less extreme and he is waiting.</p>

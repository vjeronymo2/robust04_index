			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Amato floats free from Craxi's levers of power MR Giuliano Amato, the Italian prime minister, yesterday admitted his six-month-old four-party coalition was defying political gravity. Just like a cartoon character, the government would keep going as long as no one realised it was riding on air. He is managing to stay in office even though the government has ceased to represent the specific interests of the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the two main coalition partners. The two parties' credibility is daily diminished by the mounting revelations of corruption and illegal party financing over the past decade. Mr Amato, a Socialist, has been obliged to cut free from Mr Bettino Craxi, his party leader. It has been a post-war political tradition in Italy for party leaders to control prime ministers. The break with Mr Craxi, formalised on Monday, was essential to prevent the government from being directly involved in the Socialist leader's fight for political survival in the face of allegations of corrupt behaviour and illicit funding of the party. The prime minister's divorce from Mr Craxi has been followed by three other Socialist ministers, including Mr Claudio Martelli, the ambitious justice minister. Mr Amato is thus no longer the prime minister for the Socialist party but a socialist chief executive of the administration. If Mr Craxi and his dwindling band of followers so choose they can withdraw their parliamentary support, thereby removing the coalition's narrow 16-seat majority in the chamber of deputies. In recent days Mr Craxi has posed this threat, especially in the light of a motion of confidence tabled by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). However, on Monday night Mr Craxi was persuaded this would be counter-productive, and could even hasten the break-up of the party he has dominated for a decade. As in every instance over the past six months when the Amato government has appeared unstable, it has survived for two reasons: none of 16 parties in parliament has suggested viable alternatives; and second the major parties have neither the funds nor the public support to call fresh elections so soon after last April's poll. Added to this, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who has conducted his presidency with skill and quiet authority, has thrown his weight behind the Amato government. The same considerations apply today as the government faces its first no-confidence motion. Indeed, Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, who tabled the motion, has admitted his main intention is not to bring down the government; but to force Mr Amato to distance himself from Mr Craxi, make firmer commitments to combat corruption and focus more on the increasingly serious problem of unemployment. The no-confidence debate, due to wind up tomorrow, will give Mr Amato a platform to state his aims and indicate how long he expects to stay in office. The timetable over the next two to three months is overshadowed by parliament's need to agree electoral reforms or be overtaken by referendums imposing such reforms. This key debate requires government stability - as does the management of an economy in recession. He would be reluctant to leave office before electoral reform was in place and the parties had regained their composure. But for this to happen he will have to expand the coalition. The no-confidence motion will provide an opportunity for those parties who regard themselves as the 'opposition', like the PDS, to spell out terms for joining an enlarged government.</p>

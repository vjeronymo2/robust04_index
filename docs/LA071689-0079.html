			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Nicaragua's social development is on "the verge of disintegration" and Western  powers should increase aid to the struggling Central American nation, Oxfam, a  private British philanthropic agency, said. "The United States' embargo on  trade with Nicaragua and unstable commodity prices have combined to cause  economic collapse," Oxfam said in a publication marking the agency's 25 years  of work in Nicaragua. Oxfam said it is appealing to the 12 Common Market  nations to support peace moves in Nicaragua and to promote the disbanding and  resettlement of the U.S.-backed Contras.  </P></p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: P &amp; O prosper P &amp; 0 stood out like a beacon in an otherwise dull market, surging 15 to 638p as investors continued to keep the shares firmly on the recovery tack. Interest-rate-sensitive, with a debt ratio (to net worth) of around 60 per cent compared to a Footsie average closer to 30 per cent, P &amp; 0 is being widely seen as a clear beneficiary of the Bank of England's recent less hawkish tone on base rates. The uncertainties surrounding British Gas's dividend policy, which surfaced after a lunch between the company and a number of energy analysts mid-week, brought renewed pressure to bear on Gas shares which retreated 7 1/2 to 296p. Turnover reached 8.9m shares. A UBS buy recommendation helped sustain Shell which eventually settled a net 8 off at 727p, having been much lower earlier in the session. BP held up well and closed fractionally easier at 422 1/2 p as Kleinwort Benson upgraded its stance on the stock to 'long-term buy', citing a strong recovery in European polyethylene margins. Kleinwort also noted rumours of a 'giant condensate find west of Shetlands' as underlining the group's upstream strength. VSEL, the subject of an agreed takeover from British Aerospace, edged forward 5 to 1,325p with BAe also hardening a tad to 470p, up 3. GEC, which has declared itself to be a potential counter-bidder, slipped 7 to 293p as market hopes for a full-scale auction showed signs of flagging. NatWest Securities has upgraded expectations for profits at BAe, should its Pounds 478m offer succeed. The house feels that, combined with VSEL, normalised profits at BAe could improve to Pounds 311m in 1985, up from an earlier estimate of Pounds 240m. A big individual trade in Barclays Bank helped drive the shares sharply higher early in the session, but they subsequently succumbed to the general retreat by the market, closing 7 off at 566p. Heavy turnover of 12m shares, the highest for two months, reflected an institutional buyer of 4.5m shares at 583p. Anagen, the diagnostics group, raced up 7 to 59p after a bullish note in the press and ahead of what are expected to be good interim results next Thursday. In the leaders Glaxo delivered one of the outstanding performances in the FT-SE 100, the shares moving up strongly to close 6 better at 612p as domestic and overseas institutions bought the stock aggressively on the view that it was substantially oversold and a strong chart buy. Turnover in Glaxo topped 8m, the highest since the group revealed its preliminary figures last month. Ahead of Monday's interim statement, Eurotunnel re-mained a weak market, sliding a further 17 to 228p for a two-day decline of 35. To a man, analysts expect the group to project a significant shortfall on revenue targets for this year: some even talk of the company seeking yet another cash injection. Shares in Body Shop, which reported improved interim profits earlier in the week, firmed 2 to 227p, as the market continued to celebrate the figures. Several brokers recommended the stock, including NatWest Securities which said: 'We expect 15 to 20 per cent growth per annum from this increasingly global retailer.' Speculation that the much discussed sale of Boot's drugs division was imminent sent the shares forward to close 4 better at 535p, after trade of 3.7m. SG Warburg was said to be positive on Dixons and the shares closed up 7 1/2 at 201 1/2 p. Insurance and tobacco group BAT outperformed the poor market trend with the shares finishing 2 lighter at 455p, in strong volume of 9.6m, after a James Capel recommendation. The broker reiterated its buy stance on the stock, saying future dividend payments are likely to be in excess of inflation. 'We also expect a strong set of third-quarter figures next month following a recovery in the US cigarette market,' said an analyst.</p>

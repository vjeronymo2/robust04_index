			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Paragraph (b)(3) is revised to change the fiscal year references from FY 1993 to FY 1994. Paragraph (c)(2) is amended to show the amount of the surcharge for FY 1994. This surcharge is added to the base annual fee for each operating power reactor shown in Table V. The purpose of this surcharge is to recover those NRC budgeted costs that are not directly or solely attributable to operating power reactors but nevertheless must be recovered to comply with the requirements of OBRA&hyph;90. The NRC has continued its previous policy decision to recover these costs from operating power reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FY 1994 budgeted costs related to the additional charge and the amount of the charge are calculated as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,i1,s200,10 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [Dollars in millions] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Category of costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1FY 1994 budgeted costs <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 1.

In FY 1994, $373,000 in costs are attributable to those commercial and non-exempt Federal government organizations that are licensed to operate test and research reactors. Applying these costs uniformly to those nonpower reactors subject to fees results in an annual fee of $62,200 per operating license. The Energy Policy Act establishes an exemption for certain Federally-owned research reactors that are used primarily for educational training and academic research purposes where the design of the reactor satisfies certain technical specifications set forth in the legislation. Consistent with this legislative requirement, the NRC granted an exemption from annual fees for FY 1992 and FY 1993 to the Veterans Administration Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska, the U.S. Geological Survey for its reactor in Denver, Colorado, and the Armed Forces Radiobiological Institute in Bethesda, Maryland for its research reactor. This exemption was initially codified in the July 20, 1993 (58 FR 38695) final fee rule at &sect;171.11(a) and more recently in the March 17, 1994 (59 FR 12543) final rule at &sect;171.11(a)(2). The NRC intends to continue to grant exemptions from the annual fee to those Federally owned research and test reactors who meet the exemption criteria specified in &sect;171.11. The NRC is amending &sect;171.11(a)(2) to exempt from annual fees the research reactor owned by the Rhode Island Atomic Energy Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

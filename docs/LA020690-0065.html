			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTAKER TO SELL CHEMICAL UNITS FOR $225 MILLION  </P> <P> Whittaker Corp. announced Monday that it will sell its specialty chemical  business to a Chicago firm for $225 million and use the proceeds to reduce  debt.  </P> <P> The diversified Los Angeles company had previously said it wanted to sell its  chemical and some other businesses to concentrate on its aerospace and  biotechnology segments.  </P> <P> The sale of the specialty chemical units to Morton International, a chemical  and manufacturing firm, must receive approval from the Justice Department and  from the Ministry of Finance in France, where Whittaker has a plant.  </P> <P> Whittaker's specialty chemical operations, which include separate divisions  that make industrial coatings and adhesives, posted combined revenue of $180  million for the fiscal year ending Oct. 31, 1989. The chemical businesses  consist of 13 factories and two research laboratories.  </P> <P> Whittaker had originally planned to keep its adhesives division but decided to  sell that business to reduce more of its debt.  </P> <P> "Selling our adhesives business provides us with the opportunity to make a  substantial reduction in our outstanding debt, which we consider a priority at  this time," Joseph F. Alibrandi, Whittaker's chairman, said in a statement  released by the company.  </P> <P> Whittaker has already sold off numerous businesses, including a batteries and  metals unit, and plans to shed another half-dozen units, according to a company  spokesman.  </P> <P> Nearly a year ago the company announced a stock buyback and plans to sell  numerous divisions, apparently in an effort to discourage an unwanted takeover  bid by a New Jersey investor.  </P></p>

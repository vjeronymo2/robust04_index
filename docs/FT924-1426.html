			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / World Trade News: China buys Boeings for Dollars 800m CHINA Southern Airlines, the expanding Guangzhou-based carrier, yesterday ordered six Boeing 777 widebody aircraft worth Dollars 800m (Pounds 507m), writes Paul Betts, Aerospace Correspondent. This is a boost for the US manufacturer, which is developing the new 777 twin engine widebody aircraft at a cost of around Dollars 4bn. It is scheduled to enter service in 1995. Boeing said earlier this week the Californian-based International Lease Finance Corporation was buying six Boeing 777s as part of a significant Dollars 4.1bn package of new aircraft orders involving both Boeing and European Airbus airliners. The Chinese order also reflects the buoyant Chinese airline market.</p>

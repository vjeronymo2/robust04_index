			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): Purple patch for a gloomy pundit REFLECTIONS ON MONETARISM by Tim Congdon Edward Elgar Publishing, hardback Pounds 45, p/back Pounds 14.95, 287 pages TIM CONGDON is currently enjoying one of his purple patches, having been a prominent member of the Liverpool Six group of monetarist economists which campaigned for some 18 months for the UK to leave the European exchange rate mechanism. Congdon's gloomy predictions about the prospects for the British economy within the ERM ('there will never be a recovery') have been fulfilled and interest rates have been sharply cut according to his recommendation. A phase of fairly rapid growth and low inflation could now lie ahead, he thinks. But as this book of his collected writings makes plain, the lot of a British monetarist is not a contented one. Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s the monetarist prescription was largely accepted, culminating in the adoption of the medium term financial strategy by Sir Geoffrey Howe. But monetarism was abandoned again as the Conservative government in the mid-1980s embarked upon an amazing re-run of the Barber boom of the early 1970s. The book analyses all this in terms that are easily accessible to the layman, and Congdon observes that 'many non-economists will be puzzled and dismayed by the story that the book tells'. Perhaps so, but the ups and downs of monetarism are not so difficult to explain. The trouble was that although inflation came down under the MTFS, unemployment continued to rise, essentially because economic growth was not fast enough to satisfy political objectives, and monetarism does not have much to say about growth. Monetarists began arguing among themselves over the significance of narrow and broad money targets. Moreover the attempts to control monetary growth unexpectedly generated a bill 'mountain' which was extremely inconvenient for the Bank of England. Nigel Lawson impatiently dropped the monetary targets in 1985, and though disaster duly followed, it took until 1988 to become evident, a long time in political terms. Tim Congdon was taught conventional British-style economics at Oxford, and his conversion to monetarism came through his exposure to the alarming inflation of 1974 and 1975 while on the economic staff of The Times (where Peter Jay was also influential). His dogged pursuit of the truth reflects his ability to focus on his objectives with far more consistency and endurance than any politician. But when the politicians become bored with controlling inflation they also tend to become bored with monetarism. Congdon has been proved right, but it is easy to see how he might become sidelined again as he was in the late 1980s. Still, this book is an essential guide to the reasons for the repeated failures of British economic policy over the past 20 years.</p>

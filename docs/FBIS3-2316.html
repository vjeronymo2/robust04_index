			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung in Beijing] </F>   [Text] China's Prime Minister, Li Peng, has toned down  criticism of Britain in his Government Work Report to be tabled  at the National People's Congress [NPC] when it opens on  Thursday [10 March]. According to the 35-page report, copies of  which were distributed to delegates yesterday, Mr Li has adopted  a milder stance towards the British Government in spite of icy  ties in the wake of the collapse of democracy talks on Hong  Kong. The tone and rhetoric of the Hong Kong sub-section are  less confrontational compared with the vociferous volleys fired  by Mr Li in his NPC work report last year.    In Thursday's report, Mr Li asserts that the British side  has  to shoulder the "full responsibility" for the breakdown of the  17-round diplomatic talks. Noting that the work of the  Preliminary Working Committee has already started, the premier  says the Chinese Government "is fully determined and has the  capability" to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong  "in accordance with the schedule regardless of twists and turns".    Mr Li reaffirms the determination of Beijing to maintain the  long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. But he  emphasizes that the "colonial rule of the British Government" is  coming to an end. "This can never be blocked by any forces," he  says. The premier stops short of high-decibel name-calling or  provocative remarks about the integrity of Whitehall or the  "conspiracy of neo- imperialists".    His relatively mild remarks appear to suggest a return to  pragmatism on the part of the Chinese Government in the wake of  its "disillusionment" over any possibility of greater political  cooperation with the British side in the next three years. This  is despite a flurry of harsh words about Britain by senior  Chinese officials on the heels of the publication of details of  the talks and the gazetting of the controversial parts of  Governor Chris Patten's political blueprint 10 days ago.  Official sources said although China had never ruled out the  possibility of an early takeover, it had never considered an  earlier date for resuming sovereignty over Hong Kong.    On the question of Macau, Mr Li praises Lisbon for the close  Sino-Portuguese cooperation on the handover of the enclave.  Similar to previous government work reports, the Hong Kong  issue forms a part of the section dealing with "the  reunification of the motherland" which also covers Macao and  Taiwan.    The 15,000-character report compares to a 17,000 character  document last year. The bulk of the premier's report touches on  the economic development of the country, which has seen  fluctuations in the past year marked by hyperinflation and  austerity measures.    In the first section of his report, Mr Li reviews the past  year's economic development including the austerity programme.  He maps out the strategy of seeking a harmonious relationship  between "development, reform and stability" this year. The  reports also reiterates the dictum adopted by the politburo in  January: "Seize the opportunity, deepen reform, expand the open  door, promote development and maintain stability."    In the second section, entitled "Maintenance of sustained,  high- speed and healthy development of the economy", Mr Li  emphasises the need to promote development in tandem with the  enhancement of efficiency. In the third section, the premier  underscores the significance of speeding up reforms for the  development of a socialist market economy. The fourth section  deals with the promotion of science, education and culture,  while the fifth is on the strengthening of democracy and the  legal system. The final part of the report covers diplomacy.  Mr Li says Beijing has improved relations with all major  countries. But Britain is not mentioned in this regard.    Mr Li sets the national growth rate this year at nine  percent, and vows to keep inflation within 10 percent. While  indicating that major achievements have been made in a wide  range of areas, Mr Li concedes much still needs to be done in  economic and social spheres. These include tackling soaring  inflation, the "irrational" economic structure money-losing  state firms, the worsening law-and-order situation, and laxity  in fighting social evils as well as corruption.    Mr Li assures that the party centre and central Government  have already taken measures to solve the problems. Stressing  that this year's work should be governed by the 20-character  dictum, he calls on the nation to put the national situation  before local concerns. "We must seriously handle the  relationship between development, reform, and stability," he  says, adding the three are "inter-related".    "Economic construction is the core of our work. Reform is  the impetus for promoting development. Development and reform  are the way to ensure stability in the long run. And  maintaining stability will guarantee (the smooth implementation  of) development and reform."    In spite of his somewhat mild stance on Hong Kong, Mr Li  speaks in harsher terms on the reunification of Taiwan. "The  realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland is the  wish of all the people of China. Any attempts and activities to  split the motherland, no matter in what form, is in  contravention of the interest of the Chinese people. They will  all be futile," he says.    In spite of the controversy over the three-month-long  austerity programme last year, Mr Li maintains in his report  that the retrenchment exercise has attained positive results.  He reiterates the need to impose macro-level adjustments and  controls over the economy to solve outstanding contradictions  and problems. Echoing the instructions made by octogenarian  leaders Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, the premier underscores the  significance of boosting the centre's authority in macro-level  economic control.    According to an economist, the central Government should be  able to attain a growth rate of around 10 percent in spite of  the strong pressure of economic overheating. A veteran  legislator said the whole report was "quite balanced" and  moderate, adding he expected no major dispute over it at the  upcoming plenum. Mr Li also vows before the year 2000 to  provide "food and clothing" for the 80 million people who are  living below the poverty line.</p>

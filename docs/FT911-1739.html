			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Continental Can deal confirmed by Viag VIAG, the big German industrial holding company, yesterday confirmed the acquisition of the European operations of Continental Can of the US. The deal turns Viag into the second largest packaging company in Europe after Carnaud-Metal Box. Viag said it would not be disclosing the price it had paid until next month, but market estimates put the figure at more than DM1.5bn (Dollars 840m). Continental Can Europe (CCE) was nearly bought last year by Ball Corporation for just over Dollars 1bn, but the deal was blocked because of financing problems. Since then, the restructuring at CCE's biggest unit, the German can company Schmalbach-Lubeca, has been completed and profits have increased substantially. Viag announced last week that it planned a 1-for-8 rights issue. The pricing has not yet been announced but it should raise close to DM500m. Analysts also speculated that Viag may claw-back some of the acquisition price by placing part of the 64 per cent stake in Schmalbach-Lubeca. Other CCE companies include Thomassen &amp; Drijver in the Netherlands, Continental Can UK and Continental France. But Schmalbach-Lubeca accounts for more than half of CCE's DM3bn in sales and recorded post-tax profits of DM63m last year after DM40m in 1989. Mr Brian Wilkinson, an analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, said there would be a good fit between Viag's existing packaging operations, mainly in glass, and the Schmalbach-Lubeca companies. Viag, which was privatised in 1988, is a complex structure of holdings and cross-holdings but has six main areas of operation: energy, aluminium, chemicals, trade and services, ceramics and glass. The trade and services division was substantially expanded in 1989 through Viag's acquisition of the trading group Klo(e)ckner &amp; Co for about DM500m. Viag recorded sales of DM19.5bn and pre-tax profit of DM335m in 1990.</p>

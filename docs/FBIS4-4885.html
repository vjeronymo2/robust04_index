			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Yi Pyong-tae, "defence  minister" of South Korea, will reportedly fly to Japan on April  25 for talks with his counterpart in Japan, at which he will  discuss full-scale "military exchange" with Japan.    Earlier, while on a trip to Japan, the traitor Kim Yong-sam  had discussed the "joint counteraction" with senior brasshats of  Japan over the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK.    The facts prove once again that the Kim Yong-sam group is  the  enemy of the nation who does not hesitate to bring a nuclear  holocaust upon the nation, putting spurs on the establishment of  a criminal "international cooperation system" in collusion with  outside forces.    But their act is as foolish as bumping one's head against a  rock.    The Kim Yong-sam group which is seeking to prolong its dirty  remaining days with the help of outside forces will be punished  by the nation.    The Japanese reactionaries must stop maneuvering against the  DPRK in a conspiracy with the foolish Kim Yong-sam group and act  with discretion.</p>

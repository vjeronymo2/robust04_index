			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA agrees that the addition of a quarterly report would create additional work without a concomitant increase in valuable information. FRA believes that the revisions to the Forms, as proposed in this NPRM, would provide reliable and consistent injury and accident data for safety analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Reporting Threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since 1975, FRA has adjusted the reporting threshold every two years based on the prices of a market basket of railroad labor and materials. The purpose of these adjustments has been to maintain comparability between different years of data by having the threshold keep pace with accident costs so that each year the same groups of accidents are included in the ``reportable'' accident counts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current system is flawed for several reasons. First, the adjustment for the upcoming two years is made based on price levels for the previous year. This may be a good method for identifying what that previous year's threshold should have been, but is not necessarily a good method for setting the next two years' threshold. Second, the threshold adjustment has been performed only every two years instead of every year, so the comparability of annual statistics within the two-year set is less than perfect. Third, the market basket used is not necessarily representative of the labor and materials consumed in the aftermath of accidents ``at the margin''_those with damages just above or just below the reporting threshold. Thus, changes in the prices of the market basket may not be a good indicator of changes in the costs associated with accidents at the margin. Fourth, the data used to calculate the threshold adjustment (the market basket prices) is collected directly from the railroad industry itself, rather than public sources, which may raise the suspicion that the data may be self-serving.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress has given FRA some direction for modifying the procedure for calculating the threshold in 49 U.S.C. 20901(b) (formerly contained at section 15(a) of the Rail Safety Enforcement and Review Act (Pub. L. 102&hyph;365)): ``[i]n establishing or changing a monetary threshold for the reporting of a railroad accident or incident, *&blank;*&blank;* damage cost calculations'' shall be based ``only on publicly available information obtained from (A) the Bureau of Labor Statistics; or (B) another department, agency or instrumentality of the United States Government if the information has been collected through objective, statistically sound survey methods or has been previously subject to a public notice and comment process in a proceeding of a Government department, agency, or instrumentality.'' Congress allows an exception to this general rule only if the necessary data is not available from the sources described, and only after public notice and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA solicited comments in the ANPRM on the feasibility of a two-tier reporting system in which virtually all rail equipment accidents/incidents are reported to FRA, as now, but in which those involving a substantially higher damage threshold (for example, $50,000 or $100,000), would trigger requirements for quicker or more detailed reports.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters favored the concept of two-tier reporting for rail equipment accidents and incidents and recommended that the minimum reportable threshold be raised to $10,000 or $20,000 to eliminate less serious accidents from reporting requirements. A few railroads recommended that the second tier begin at $50,000 and that the lower threshold be raised in increments of $1,000 on a yearly basis. One railroad recommended that a third tier be established for reporting in greater detail those accidents that result in $100,000 or more in damage. A few commenters did not recommend adoption of the two-tier reporting system because they believed that such a system would require more details on those accidents that fell within the second tier and thus would create a more burdensome reporting system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis and FRA Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After examining and assessing the feasibility of all comments received in response to the ANPRM, FRA has concluded that a two-tier reporting system is not warranted at this time. Adjustment of the reporting threshold, as described below, would provide FRA with the data it needs to effectively evaluate the true status of railroad safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Threshold Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FRA proposes to obtain in October of 1994 the latest Producer Price Index (``PPI'') and National Employment Hours and Earnings figures from the Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics (``BLS''). At that time, the latest final figures, as opposed to preliminary figures, would be available to cover the period through June 1994. In October of each subsequent year, FRA would obtain the latest 12 months of final BLS figures and calculate the threshold for the upcoming year, publishing the new figure in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prior to its implementation. FRA hopes to issue a final rulemaking on the new threshold effective as early as January 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Equation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned previously, FRA proposes to use data from the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), LABSTAT Series Reports for calculating the threshold. The equation used to adjust the reporting threshold would be based on the average hourly earnings reported for Class 1 railroads and an overall railroad equipment cost index determined by the BLS. The two factors would be weighted equally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the wage component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code 4011 for Class 1 Railroad Average Hourly Earnings. For the equipment component, FRA would use LABSTAT Series Report, Producer Price Index (PPI) Series 144 for Railroad Equipment. In the month of October of each year, FRA would obtain from the BLS, finalized cost data covering the twelve-month period ending with the month of June. The monthly figures would then be totaled and divided by twelve to produce annual averages. The wage data would be reported in terms of dollars earned per hour, while the equipment cost data would be indexed to a base year of 1982.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The procedure for adjusting the reporting threshold is shown in the formula below. The wage component appears as a fractional change relative to the prior year, while the equipment component is a difference of two percentages which must be divided by 100 to present it in a consistent fractional form. After performing the calculation, the result would be rounded to the nearest $100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w296,d45  -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSEP19AU94.000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Where:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Wn = New average hourly wage rate ($)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wp = Prior average hourly wage rate ($)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> En = New equipment average PPI value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ep = Prior equipment average PPI value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

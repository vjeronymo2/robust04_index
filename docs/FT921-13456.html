			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Private hearing for Berlitz dispute AN APPLICATION by Macmillan, the main publishing subsidiary of Maxwell Communication Corporation, in connection with the disputed ownership of a 55.6 per cent stake in Berlitz was heard in private in the High Court yesterday after a judge was told it was a matter of 'extreme commercial sensitivity', writes Raymond Hughes. Five banks have claimed ownership of most of the stake, which is also claimed by Macmillan, as collateral for loans extended to companies within the Maxwell empire. Asking for the application to be heard in camera, Mr David Oliver QC, for Macmillan, told Mr Justice Ferris that last month Swiss Volksbank and Credit Suisse had undertaken not to dispose of certain shares without prior notice to Macmillan. Last week both banks had given such notice. Mr Oliver said the shares were in a company in which Macmillan held a very substantial stake, the balance being quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Four more private companies in the Maxwell empire were put into administration by a High Court judge yesterday. Mr Justice Mummery made administration orders on Media Expenditure Analysis, PHA Investments, Multiphase Systems and The Media Register. The judge also appointed interim managers of Questel Qualitative Studies and Maxwell Legal Services, pending applications next Monday for those companies also to be put into administration. The orders were made on applications by Mr John Talbot, of accountants Arthur Andersen, now the administrator of 44 Maxwell private companies.</p>

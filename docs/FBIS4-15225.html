			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 6 Apr--Certain mass media in Russia circulated  rumors that Defense Minister Vitalyy Radetskyy and a group of  high-ranking officials of Ukraine's military department  allegedly paid a secret visit to Crimea. It was also pointed  out that a Ukrainian special purpose unit arrived in Crimea on a  "mysterious mission."    "Lies, which are persistently circulated by the mass media  of  Russia, are carefully directed by someone and are needed by  someone." This is how the press service of the Defense Ministry  of Ukraine refuted this information.    It is true that Lieutenant General Horin, first deputy chief  of the general staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces, accompanied by a  group of officers, made a planned trip to Crimea on 5 April. He  was working at the headquarters of the naval forces of Ukraine,  studying the state of affairs, and visiting warships, and he  returned to Kiev on the same day.</p>

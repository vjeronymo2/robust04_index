			<p><P> November 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PENNSYLVANIA;  </P> <P> DEATH OF GIRL LAID TO HEART REJECTION  </P> <P> Sudden heart rejection caused the death this week of 13-year-old Stormie Jones  six years after she became the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient,  doctors said.  </P> <P> The autopsy results surprised Stormie's doctors at Children's Hospital in  Pittsburgh, Pa., who said that heart rejection was rare so many years after a  transplant. The girl needed the transplant because a rare genetic disorder  prevented her body from processing cholesterol. She is to be buried today in  her hometown in White Settlement, Tex.  </P></p>

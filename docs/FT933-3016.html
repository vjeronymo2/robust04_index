			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Trade News: French warn of crisis over farm accord MR JEAN PUECH, the French agriculture minister, warned yesterday that the 'spectre of crisis' would be released if the EC did not agree to renegotiate last November's US-EC farm trade accord. Mr Puech is engaged in a frenetic round of diplomacy with his EC partners ahead of Monday's special meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers in Brussels. Yesterday he met Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, before flying on to Madrid for talks with his Spanish counterpart. Mr Puech told journalists in Brussels that Spain, Germany and Italy were rallying behind the French position. Mr Steichen told the minister that the European Commission would do 'everything in its power' to try to solve the political problem over the EC-US farm trade accord, named Blair House after the Washington mansion where it was signed last Novem-ber. A spokesman for Mr Steichen said the two men had discussed the possibility of 'completing and clarifying' the Blair House agreement, which is supposed to be a cornerstone of a world trade pact. Mr Puech welcomed what he said were 'positive developments' and said Mr Steichen was 'completely open' to the French position. In separate talks, Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, stressed to Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's economics minister, the importance of keeping open the line of communication with the US. Sir Leon talked to his US counterpart, Mr Mickey Kantor, in Washington earlier this week, but he did not propose changes to the Blair House deal. The Commission is treading a difficult diplomatic path in its attempt to avoid offending France or the US. Members of France's main wildcat farm union, Coordination Rurale, succeeded yesterday in sporadically blocking some roads and rail lines around Paris, but highway officials said the disruption was less than that in the recent national return from the summer holidays. Using what their leaders called 'Vietcong guerrilla tactics', small groups of Coordination Rurale members started in the early hours of yesterday morning putting up blockades, often at highway tolls where cars have to stop anyway. They mainly relied on pushing lighted rubber tyres onto roads and some rail lines - including that carrying the high-speed TGV-Atlantique between Paris and Tours - but in a few places they briefly blocked roads with cars and tractors. Some FNSEA pig farmers joined in the action yesterday, temporarily blocking the Paris-Lyons rail line with straw bales, but the FNSEA and CNJA have timed their anti-Gatt demonstration for next Monday, when EC ministers meet in Brussels to discuss the EC-US farm deal. Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also expected to discuss the Gatt farm issue with President Francois Mitterrand when the German leader comes to Paris next Monday, it was announced in Bonn yesterday. Mrs Gillian Shephard, UK agriculture secretary, said yesterday the UK would strongly object to any backtracking on the Blair House agreement. 'If you try to re-negotiate bits of it, the whole package could come unravelled with implications for other industries as well as agriculture,' Mrs Shephard said. The Blair House deal agreed last November cuts subsidised exports of wheat and other farm products by 21 per cent over 6 years. France wants to improve the terms of the accord, agreement on which holds the key to successful completion of the Gatt Uruguay round talks. It has some support for its position from Spain and Ireland. Mr Rexrodt said there was room for clarification on Blair House and hoped the French would be able to fulfil their interests within the accord. Although German farmers are putting some pressure on their government ahead of Monday's council meeting, the UK farm lobby has come out in support of Blair House.</p>

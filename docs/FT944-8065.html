			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Gas dash warning for coal sales British Coal's remaining English mines could sell less than 20m tonnes a year to the electricity generators after 1998 following a renewal in the dash for gas, Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial director of the corporation, said yesterday. This compares with contracted sales of about 29m tonnes a year until 1998. Mr Edwards' forecast compares with that by RJB Mining, the coal company chosen as the government's preferred bidder to take over the three English coal regions, that the market will be at least 28m tonnes at the end of the century, with it supplying the bulk. Mr Edwards told a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs that prices in core contracts with generators were likely to be Pounds 1.10 a gigajoule or less after 1998. RJB assumed a price of Pounds 1.32 a gigajoule in the key assumptions for its Pounds 914m bid for the three regions. Mr Edwards' company, Coal Investments, bid for the two regions around the Yorkshire area and Nottinghamshire.</p>

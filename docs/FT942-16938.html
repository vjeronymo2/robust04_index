			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Lehman quits leveraged buy-out business Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, has in effect left the leveraged buy-out business, reflecting a need to conserve capital once it becomes a free-standing company later this year. Lehman said that four of the five managing directors in its merchant banking business were leaving to set up their own firm, called Cypress Capital, 'by mutual agreement'. The four had been behind a Dollars 1.25bn, so-called 'merchant banking' fund at Lehman, backed jointly by the bank and investment institutions, which backed leveraged buy-outs and other private equity investments. The investment bank said that it has no plans to raise another fund. This is believed to spring in large part from a need to conserve capital. American Express, which plans to spin off the bank by the end of June, has been forced to back a Dollars 1.25bn recapitalisation of Lehman to enable it to obtain a single-A credit rating.</p>

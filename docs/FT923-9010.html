			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Arts: NY City Opera THE New York City Opera season, from now to November, is not one of the most adventurous. A promised production of The Excursions of Mr Broucek which would have given Janacek's fantastical comedy its American premiere, has been postponed, leaving Busoni's Doktor Faust as the only stiff addition to the repertory. The other new productions are of Carmen, and of works either on the edge towards Broadway musical (Marc Blitzstein's Regina) or over it (110 in the Shade). Nor is there much risk in the choice of opening revivals La Boheme, Cav and Pag, and La Traviata - except in as much as this last opera is given in a shoddy, sniggering updating saved only by stylish, poised singing from Michael Rees Davis as Alfredo. (There are strong performers in the Pagliacci too, especially Gwynne Geyer as Nedda, flicking a steely voice with the speed, accuracy and gleam of a flayer's knife, and Sigmund Cowan as a Tonio dark-toned and true, intelligent with the words and with his watchful eyes, commanding sympathy by his entire involvement.) 110 in the Shade is unbelievably corny. First presented in 1963, it was a mild failure and sank into the limbo of college productions from which Scott Ellis, directing this City Opera staging, determines to rescue it. He got the original team of Harvey Schmidt (music), Tom Jones (lyrics) and N Richard Nash (book) together again to make a trimmed version with a couple of new songs. He also encouraged excellent support from set designer Michael Anania, who provided a selection of slatted silhouettes to suggest farm buildings rippled by heat haze, for the action takes place during a drought, at the stated temperature, somewhere in the old west. The drought also affects the heart of the heroine, Lizzie (the pathetic fallacy, along with all other dramatic devices, is working at a pretty basic level here). The sheriff is her obvious match, but cannot be made to declare himself. Along comes a young mountebank, Billy Starbuck, who promises he can bring rain, and meanwhile takes Lizzie off for a night of passion on his lorry. This fires up the sheriff; Lizzie makes her inevitable choice; and the rains come down. City Opera's cast, led by Karen Ziemba as Lizzie, Richard Muenz as the taciturn sheriff and Brian Sutherland as the rainmaker, give it all they have and disguise any embarrassment they might feel. The rain, drenching the stage at the end, has a charming stillness that fits rather well.</p>

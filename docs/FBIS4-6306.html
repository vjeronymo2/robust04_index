			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second and last installment of unattributed article: </F> "Outlook: Personnel Appointments in Kasumigaseki"]    [Text] Ministry of Finance    Administrative Vice Minister Jiro Saito (entered the  ministry  in 1959) [the following dates in parentheses indicate when the  person entered service with the Japanese Government]; Budget  Bureau chief Kyosuke Shinozawa (1960), who is certain to become  the next vice minister after Saito; and Tax Bureau chief Tadashi  Ogawa (1962), who is expected to become the vice minister after  Shinozawa, remain in their posts. [The reason for keeping these  three officials in their posts is based on] the recognition that  now is the time to determine the future course of the finance  and tax systems, because the examination of a major tax reform  by the ruling coalition parties will reach its peak at the end  of June, and it will seek to pass the [tax reform] bill within  the year. Saito will be the first vice minister to serve for  two years since Yoshihiko Yoshino (1953), president of the Japan  Development Bank, who held the post six directors before Saito.    Also in the field of international finance, Kosuke Nakahira  (1963), deputy vice minister for financial affairs and who has  held his post for a year, and Takatoshi Kato (1964), chief of  the International Finance Bureau, will remain in their posts and  work on finding a way out of difficult situations such as the  increasingly strained relationship between Japan and the United  States.    Eisuke Hamamoto (1961) will retire voluntarily from the post  of National Tax Administration Agency director general, which is  a vice-ministerial-level post. Then, Banking Bureau chief  Nobuyuki Teramura (1961), who has dealt with the management  problems of financial institutions for two years, will be  promoted to Hamamoto's post.    Those who entered the ministry in 1963 are the focus [of the  ministerial reshuffle]. Yoshimasa Nishimura, director of the  Institute of Fiscal and Monetary Policy, is certain to be  promoted to Banking Bureau chief. Also, Takeshi Komura,  director of the Secretariat, who seems certain to be the next  Budget Bureau chief after Shinozawa, is expected to remain in  his post. There is a possibility that Financial Bureau chief  Masami Ishizaka and Securities Bureau chief Sohei Hidaka will  resign. If either of them quits, the vacant post will be filled  by Koji Tanami (1964), deputy vice minister of policy  coordination.  <H5>  Economic Planning Agency [EPA] </H5>   It is strongly believed that Tsutomu Tanaka (1959),  administrative vice minister of economic planning, will remain  in his post because there is a need to grasp the outlook for the  economy. In that case, the probability of Coordination Bureau  chief Makoto Kobayashi (1961) remaining in his post also is high  .    Should Tanaka resign, Kobayashi is likely to succeed him,  thus making Kobayashi the first official from the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry in eight years to become the  Economic Planning Agency's [EPA] vice minister. In addition,  Planning Bureau chief Atsushi Yoshikawa (1962) will succeed  Kobayashi as Coordination Bureau chief, and Shinpei Nukaya  (1963), the National Land Agency's Planning and Coordination  Bureau chief, will be appointed to the post of the EPA's  Planning Bureau chief. Yoji Wakui (1964), director of the  Secretariat and who was from the Ministry of Finance [MOF], is  expected to also remain in his post.  <H5>  Defense Agency </H5>   Administrative Vice Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama (1961), who  was from the MOF, is certain to remain in his post, and the  personnel changes in the Defense Agency as a whole will be  minor. Naoaki Murata (1962), Bureau of Defense Policy chief,  and Noboru Hoshuyama (1963), director of the Secretariat, are  the candidates to succeed Ichiro Yoneyama (1961), director  general of the Defense Facilities Administration Agency, who is  going to retire voluntarily.    If Hoshuyama becomes director general of the Defense  Facilities Administration Agency, Yasutomo Mitsui (1964), Bureau  of Personnel chief, or Masahiro Akiyama (1964), Bureau of  Finance chief, will be appointed to the post of director of the  Secretariat. Then, Defense Councillor Ken Sato (1966), who was  from the MOF, is talked about to replace either Mitsui or  Akiyama.  Ministry of Home Affairs [subhead]    Shigeichi Mori (1959), administrative vice minister of home  affairs, will retire voluntarily, and Local Finance Bureau chief  Toshio Yuasa, who entered the ministry in the same year as Mori,  is certain to succeed him and push forward with the tasks, such  as decentralization, which Mori has been dealing with. Yasuhiko  Endo (1963), director of the Secretariat, is likely to become  the next chief of the Local Finance Bureau. However, because  his appointment to the post would shorten the record of the  number of years required to climb to that position by as much as  four years, there is a possibility that Hiromasa Yoshida (1962),  chief of the Local Administration Bureau, will be appointed to  the post instead. Also, Takahiro Kiuchi (1961), director  general of the Fire Defense Agency, is expected to retire  voluntarily. Makoto Taki (1962), chief of the Local Tax Bureau,  is the person most likely to succeed Kiuchi as director general.    Ministry of Health and Welfare    Many people believe that Administrative Vice Minister  Teijiro  Furukawa (1960) is going to retire voluntarily and that he will  be succeeded by Akira Suetsugu, director general of the Social  Insurance Agency, who is a year younger than Furukawa but who  entered the ministry in the same year. Hiroshi Tada (1962),  chief of the Health Insurance Bureau, is likely to become the  next director general of the Social Insurance Agency. Also,  Nobuharu Okamitsu (1963), director of the Secretariat, will  probably take over the post of Health Insurance Bureau chief.  In order to rejuvenate the post of director of the Secretariat,  Pension Bureau Chief Takehiko Yamaguchi (1965) has been named as  a candidate, among others, for the job. Moreover, the  possibility remains of Tada jumping to the post of  administrative vice minister. Furthermore, Furukawa is a  candidate for the post of the next deputy chief cabinet  secretary (administrative).  <H5>  Ministry of Labor </H5>   In accordance with the Labor Ministry's practice in recent  years, there is a strong possibility of Administrative Vice  Minister Yukinori Wakabayashi (1960) retiring voluntarily, and  Labor Relations Bureau Chief Kunihiko Saito (1961) succeeding  the vice minister. If [the Labor Ministry's personnel  appointments] follow their usual pattern -- director of the  Secretariat to Employment Security Bureau chief to Labor  Relations Bureau chief -- then Employment Security Bureau chief  Tokio Nanase (1964) will be appointed to the position of Labor  Relations Bureau chief, which is the post for  vice-minister-to-be officials, and Noriomi Soya (1965), director  of the Secretariat, will be appointed to the post of Employment  Security Bureau chief. However, there is still a possibility of  Labor Standards Bureau chief Shintaro Ishioka (1962) being  appointed as Labor Relations Bureau chief. In this case, the  Employment Security Bureau chief and others beneath him will  remain in their posts.  <H5>  Ministry of Transportation </H5>   Administrative Vice Minister Michihiko Matsuo (1960) is  certain to remain in his post, and the reshuffle of the ministry  will be a minor one in connection with the retirement of Tsuguo  Iyama (1961), director general of the Maritime Safety Agency,  who has held his post for two years. Either Civil Aviation  Bureau chief Yasutoshi Tsuchisaka (1963) or Railways Bureau  chief Yutaka Hatano (1963), who is a contemporary of Tsuchisaka,  is likely to succeed Iyama. Transportation Policy Bureau chief  Minoru Toyoda (1962), who is at the top of the bureau chiefs,  will probably remain in his current post and wait for the  promotion to the post of administrative vice minister next year.  <H5>  Environment Agency </H5>   The office of administrative vice minister of the  environment  is customarily held by officials from the MOF and the Health  Ministry. Administrative Vice Minister Atsuo Yagihashi (1961),  who was from the MOF, is likely to retire voluntarily with the  passage last November of the Basic Environmental Law adorning  the last days of his career. In that case, Planning and  Coordination Bureau chief Hitomi Mori (1962), who was from the  Health Ministry, is likely to succeed Yagihashi as  administrative vice minister.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Arts: Searching for space in outpost by the sea - The Tate at St Ives The Tate Gallery at St Ives, a new and not exactly unobtrusive building by Evans and Shalev on the site of the old gasworks overlooking Porthmeor Beach, was opened to the public last summer amid much local bally-hoo. Why should Modern Art be imposed so heavily, and so expensively, on an old fishing town that was used to artists but these days depended upon tourism for its livelihood? Would such money not be better spent on a leisure centre, or a swimming pool? Protests were made, meetings held: and now we have something of an answer. The scheme was argued on a projected annual attendance of some 70,000 visitors. This target was reached within months. The full year achieved a total well over 200,000. More to the point, with tourism so seasonal and St Ives shutting up shop for the winter, attendance ran to above 80,000 through the winter months. The seasonal orthodoxy has been confounded. That said, however, the Tate itself does face certain problems. Purpose-built as it is, the building was never designed to cope with so many people. And once inside, the galleries seem surprisingly few, and rather small. The view over the beach may be spectacular, the cafe delightful, the bookshop full, the lobbies even generous in proportion to the rest. But has not space been wasted, just a bit? In fairness it must be said that such questions are being addressed as exhibiting policy evolves beyond the first plans. This time more works have actually been hung. And while the concentration on the later modern artists of St Ives itself - on from Ben Nicholson, Christopher Wood and old Alfred Wallis in the late 1920s - is clearly not to be given up, it is never to be dogmatically exclusive. That, with Newlyn and its turn-of-the-century painters only six miles away, would be merely perverse. But there is another nettle to be grasped. The Tate was never going to offer any permanent display of the St Ives artists in Cornwall, for to do so was not possible in the restricted space, nor desirable in what must always be an outpost. What is given instead is a rolling programme of displays, each treating on a given aspect of the subject. Yet what is the distinction between the impermanent study display and the temporary exhibition? For these new displays, chronology is given up and the five galleries devoted each to a separate theme: The Penwith Landscape; In the Studio; Private and Mythic Narrative; Observation and Abstraction. The fifth, and the only one called a study display, is in fact a small exhibition of Peter Lanyon's two 'Generation' series, made in the late 1940s after his return from the war. Both are figurative, one more mystical with its chalices and still life, the second directly founded in the coastal landscape of West Penwith and Portreath. Together they foreshadow the larger and ab-stracted expressions of the sensation of landscape that characterised Lanyon's later work. Apart from what it tells us of Lanyon, this little show makes the point that so focused an exercise carries a disproportionate weight. The Tate at St Ives is perfect for the coherent temporary exhibition of medium size, which is not the same as the current run of displays through the remaining galleries. With them the sense is rather of the hanging of sympathetic work first, and the naming of it later. It is not a question of size, but only of purpose and concentration. Even so, each room holds remarkable and beautiful things - Paul Feiler's abstract rockscapes and the Alfred Wallises in the first room, Margaret Mellis's anemone in the second, Frost and Heron and Scott in the fifth. And the grievously under-rated Karl Weschke's dark, drowned body on the beach, in the fourth room, would grace 'The Romantic Spirit in German Art' now at the Hayward, had the organisers but the wit to know of it. Downstairs, in the entrance lobby, is a monumentally lumpen sculpture by Peter Randall-Page. He is the most distinguished stone-carver of his generation and quite at home in the town and spiritual company of Barbara Hepworth. The London show of his latest carvings, 'Secret Life', massive pods of granite split to reveal their carved insides and looking magnificent against the Thames at Reed's Wharf, has a week to run. The New Displays: Tate Gallery St Ives, Cornwall: sponsored by Intercity. Peter Randall-Page - Secret Life: Reed's Wharf Gallery, Mill Street SE1, until November 5.</p>

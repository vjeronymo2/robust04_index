			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Moscow slips down today's G7 agenda Finance ministers from the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries are to meet near Frankfurt today, to discuss the crisis in the Russian economy. This is so intractable, however, that their discussions are likely to focus as much on their own problems, of unemployment and lacklustre growth. The meeting was called last month by Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minsister, to find out, as one sherpa put it, 'what the hell Russia is up to'. Since then, turmoil has hit the world's securities markets, a trade war is threatened between the US and Japan, and there is rising concern about the German economy, prompting the ministers heading for the meeting today to add the global economy to their agenda. The G7 finance ministers - and central bankers from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Canada - will confer among themselves before meeting Mr Sergei Dubinin, Russian finance minister, Mr Alexander Shokhin, economy minister and Mr Victor Gerashchenko, central bank governor. They are expected to take a tough line with the Russians, in stressing the need for concrete measures to control the government's budget deficit and money supply. Although the G7 delegates are keen to support the continuation of economic reform, they are adamant that a reliable and predictable economic policy is essential, above all to attract foreign investment and not simply to get more public finance from the G7 governments. Mr Waigel, who will be chairing the meeting, made clear in advance that there are no plans for additional finance from the G7 group, but that transfer of funds, already promised at the Tokyo summit last year, depends on Moscow's further progress with the reform programme. Given the confusion emanating from the former Soviet Union, and the difficulty for the finance ministers of producing anything meaningful, the US-Japan trade row threatens to hijack events. No communique is planned. The US, which sees itself as the saviour of global economics, is aggrieved that Japan and Europe have dragged their feet while Washington, in the words of Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, has 'laid the basis for a revcovery with solid growth, a declining budget deficit and the lowest inflation and interest rates in more than 20 years'. The main US grievance is with Japan. It argues that Japan's inability to create the growth required to reduce its external surplus is acting as a drag on the world economy. For its part, Japan will protest that it has taken the necessary steps to boost growth in the form of its recent economic stimulation package. Moreover, it argues that any form of numerical targetting of its bilateral trade with the US runs against the spirit of a multilateral trade system and the recent Uruguay round agreement to liberalise global trading, a point on which it may well receive support from the UK and others. Also, the US is expected to draw attention to the sluggish reduction of interest rates in continental Europe since the currency crisis last year. Although a senior US Treasury official conceded recently that the US would not want to see the Europeans do anything 'imprudent', Mr Bentsen has called attention to the 'staggering burden of rising unemployment' in Europe. This issue is more likely to surface when the G7 meets again, next month in Detroit, to discuss persistently high unemployment in industrialised countries.</p>

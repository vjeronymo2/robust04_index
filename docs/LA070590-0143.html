			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: WEST COVINA;  </P> <P> LARGEST AUTOMATED LIBRARY  </P> <P> The West Covina Library joined the Los Angeles County Public Library's  automated system last week, making the county system the largest circulating  library in the world.  </P> <P> West Covina became the 90th library in the county to go on-line in the system.  </P> <P> Library officials said the most unusual aspects of the project are its size and  scope and the fact that it was completed in little over a year, after a decade  of planning.  </P> <P> County Librarian Sandra F. Reuben said a system of its size has never been  automated without hardware or breakdown problems.  </P> <P> The Automated Circulation System will allow the libraries to tailor their  collections to the communities they serve, and patrons will be able to locate  books and other information faster, Reuben said.  </P> <P> In addition, new library cards in use with the system will give patrons access  to the 5-million-plus volume book collection at all 90 county libraries.  </P> <P> "This whole project was designed to improve and enhance customer service,"  Reuben said. "We are in the business of satisfying the customer's need to know,  and now we will be able to serve them more productively."  </P></p>

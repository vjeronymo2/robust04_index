In a telephone interview with QUDS PRESS, 'Abd-al-Rahim  Malluh, member of the PFLP Political Bureau, denied reports  about an upcoming meeting between 'Arafat and Habash. Malluh  said these reports are groundless.    Palestinian sources close to Fatah had spoken about a  meeting  to be held between the two Palestinian leaders who arrived in  Amman to attend a Yemeni reconciliation meeting.    Malluh said the PFLP still thinks there is no political  common ground to hold such a meeting. He said: Our dispute  with Yasir 'Arafat -- over the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration  of Principles reached in Oslo and the Cairo agreement on  implementing the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho -- precludes any  common ground for a meeting with him, as Malluh put it.    The PFLP is opposed to a self-rule agreement struck between  the PLO and Israel and signed in Washington on 13 September.  Like other opposition factions, the PFLP refuses to hold any  meeting with the PLO leadership before annulling this agreement  and subsequent accords.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 8 KYODO -- Japan should give wider  foreign access to its technologies and a new  "technology-oriented society" with a freer outflow of  technology, a government panel report said Wednesday [8 June].    According to the report by an advisory body to the minister  of international trade and industry, the leader in the world of  technology should boost access to its technological innovation  for foreigners.    The report, released by a subcommittee of the Industrial  Technology Council, also called for promoting international  collaboration in developing new industrial technologies, while  playing a key role in solving environmental problems and AIDS.    Unlike the conventional concept of a techno-society focused  on technological development at home, the proposed new  technology-based society would be primarily characterized by  free inflows and outflows of industrial technologies.    Currently, Japan's technological exchange is overwhelmingly  lop-sided, with the number of Japanese researchers studying in  the United States five to six times higher than that of foreign  researchers here.    Access to Japanese technologies for foreigners is one of the  key themes of the stalled "framework" trade talks with the U.S.    The proposal comes with the emergence of the need to pursue  global collaboration in technological areas due to slumping  investments in research and development and a declining number  of local engineers.    The same needs have emerged elsewhere, as the end of the  Cold  War has made technology a tool for economic growth, rather than  for military expansion.    In addition, the ballooning costs and risks involved in  technological development make global alliances meaningful.    In country-to-country technological transfers, Japan should  pay more attention to assisting recipient nations, mostly  developing countries, to upgrade their technological levels.    More globally, the country should take the initiative in  fighting such global challenges as environmental protection with  its advanced technological know-how, the report said.</p>

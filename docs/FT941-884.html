			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / New uncertainty as Italy goes to polls Italy's 48m voters began two days of polling yesterday in the country's most unpredictable general election since democracy was restored after the second world war. The election marks the formal end of the postwar dominance by the Christian Democrats and their allies, and more than 80 per cent of the candidates have no parliamentary experience. The last election was only two years ago, but the corruption scandals which caused the collapse of the ruling parties forced a fresh poll. The first exit polls will be announced tonight at 10pm, when polling stations close. But the interior ministry has warned that it could be well into tomorrow before there is a clear indication of the outcome. Vote-counting has been complicated by new electoral laws. These introduced a first-past-the-post system for 75 per cent of the seats in both houses of parliament, but retained proportional representation in revised form for the rest. Voters were yesterday being asked to choose between 15 main parties that had formed into three broad alliances of the left, centre and right. The main protagonists are the seven-party Progressive Alliance on the left and the three-party Freedom Alliance on the right, dominated by the media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Before the ban on opinion polls during the final two weeks of the campaign, the Freedom Alliance looked set to obtain the most seats, but not an absolute majority. The alliance contains Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi and the neo-Fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini. In the final stages of the campaign, the Progressives, led by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) under Mr Achille Occhetto, arch-rival of Mr Berlusconi, claimed they had made gains with their superior grassroots organisation. The centrist Italian Pact appeared to claw back some ground by calling on voters to give the centre parties a balancing role. Zeffirelli in the scenario, Page 3</p>

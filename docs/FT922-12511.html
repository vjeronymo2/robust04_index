			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / O&amp;Y bondholders grant reprieve THE HOLDERS of an Dollars 800m (Pounds 453m) Eurobond issued by Olympia &amp; York have indicated that they will not yet declare the cash-strapped Canadian property developer in default, in spite of its failure to make a scheduled interest payment. O&amp;Y was to pay annualised interest totalling Dollars 62m on March 25 to holders of the bond, which is not publicly traded and is secured by one of the towers of New York's World Financial Centre. A 20-day grace period expired last Tuesday without payment being made. The World Financial Centre in lower Manhattan is almost fully occupied and is assumed to be one of O&amp;Y's healthiest properties. O&amp;Y's failure to pay interest on the bond suggests that rent income has been channelled into less liquid parts of the company and underlines the weakness of its strategy of compartmentalising its debt restructuring in about a dozen different lender groups. The bondholders, mostly Japanese institutional investors, are represented by Nomura Securities. At a recent meeting in Tokyo chaired by Nomura, they are understood to have agreed to extend the grace period. O&amp;Y has assured them that the value of the building is adequate to cover the principal amount of the loan. Much the same arrangement was made last month with banks which provided a CDollars 450m (Pounds 215.7m) construction loan secured by the 68-storey Scotia Plaza tower in Toronto. The principal on the Scotia Plaza loan was due on March 31. At a meeting with lenders earlier this week, O&amp;Y proposed a 90-day freeze of all principal repayments on its Dollars 12bn debt, as well as some deferrals of interest. It also requires Pounds 100m of new money for London's Canary Wharf and just under CDollars 100m for its Canadian operations. Mr Steve Miller, who is heading O&amp;Y's restructuring effort, said the company eventually hopes to repay its debts in full but concessions will be required from lenders. O&amp;Y has also failed to make payments on a Canadian commercial paper programme. Redemptions, totalling about CDollars 200m, are awaiting completion of the sale and leaseback of Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building in central Toronto, which is the security for the CP programme.</p>

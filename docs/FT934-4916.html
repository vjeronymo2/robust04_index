			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Change in resource accounting method - Red Book details The chancellor of the exchequer has announced proposals for an important change in the way government departments account for public money which will provide a better measure of the resources which departments are using. The approach will be similar to that employed in the private sector and in those parts of the public sector - including executive agencies and the National Health Service - which already make use of accruals-based accounting. In a resource accounting framework expenditure represents the cost of resources consumed each year, taking into account the depreciation of assets and the cost of capital, and changes in the level of creditors and stocks; income represents what is received each year, taking into account changes in the level of debtors. Resource accounting should be viewed as a development of cash accounting, not as an alternative system. It can thus be used to generate as much information on departments' cash flow as is necessary for essential public expenditure planning and control purposes. The proposed move to resource accounting is part of the development of a more strategic relationship between the centre of government and departments and agencies, following principles originally set down in the Financial Management Initiative in 1982. Linked to parallel changes in a department's organisational structure and management information systems, resource accounting will help departments manage their finances and resources more effectively, and facilitate the further development of measures of departmental output and performance. It is proposed that departments should introduce resource accounting over the next 3-5 years. The chancellor will publish detailed proposals in the first half of 1994. In the meantime, further work is being done with departments to establish: the framework of accounting principles and conventions, based on private sector practice, that is required; the handling of various practical issues (information technology systems, staff training, etc) associated with developing resource accounting in departments; the implications for public expenditure planning and control arrangements; and the parliamentary implications of any changes.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE NEW CONTROL TOTAL  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Pounds billion                                1993-94    1994-95    1995-96    1996-97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Plans in March 1993 Budget       243.8      253.6      263.3      274.1 Classification changes since  March Budget1                     1.3        1.3        1.2        1.1 Plans after classification  changes                         245.1      254.8      264.5      275.3 New control total set out in  this report                     244.7      251.3      263.0      272.3 Reductions                        -0.4       -3.6       -1.5       -2.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 The main classification change reflects the changed national accounting treatment of the fossil fuel levy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / North Korea seeks fresh pay-off North Korea wants several billion dollars' compensation for nuclear research and costs if it agrees to US demands to shut down its reactors, a senior Pyongyang negotiator said yesterday, Reuter reports from Berlin. That compensation would be in addition to international financing for a US plan to lower the risk of Pyongyang building nuclear weapons by giving North Korea new nuclear power technology. North Korea's delegation leader, Mr Kim Jong-u, speaking after five days' talks in Berlin with US experts, said there had been no agreement on the financing demands. 'Details of that will be discussed at higher-level talks,' he said. The two sides plan to resume talks in Geneva on September 23. 'There are two types of compensation,' Mr Kim said. One type would be for buying new foreign-made light-water reactors and another would be 'compensation for electric losses and investment after 30 years' of nuclear research and power generation. Asked how much North Korea wanted for its investment costs, Mr Kim said: 'Several billion US dollars'. The US has divulged nothing about the progress of the negotiations, billed as 'technical' talks as a branch of the main Geneva negotiations on ending a nuclear dispute between the two countries. Washington wants communist North Korea to switch from its graphite-moderated nuclear technology to light-water reactors that would be financed and supplied by a US-led international consortium. Mr Kim said his country wanted to increase its reactor capacity to a total of 1,550MW by the year 2002. But he repeated Pyongyang's rejection of light-water models offered by rival South Korea, saying they were not advanced enough. 'The right for the selection of light-water reactors is in the hand of DPRK,' he said, refering to the North's full name of Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The North Koreans say they are interested in technology from Russia or the German company Siemens. 'Whether South Korea is to finance the project or not we are not concerned,' Mr Kim said. In parallel with the Berlin talks, the two countries were discussing in Pyongyang the establishment of liaison offices in their respective capitals. In talks with the US in Geneva last month, North Korea agreed to suspend its nuclear programme while the two sides negotiated.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Arts: Today's Television No generation in English history had more influence on the way we lead our lives today than those who lived in the first half of the 17th century. From the winning of the initiative by the House of Commons via the civil war, with the defeat and execution of the king in 1649, to the Cromwellian Commonwealth, it was a period packed with crucial incident. It can be argued that it was the earliness of their 'revolution' which gave the English such a stable constitutional life for the next 300 years. Channel 4 starts a 6-part series on England's Civil War (8.30). ITV starts a second series of the entertaining drama Chancer (9.00) about the cockney yuppie Stephen Crane. BBC2 begins a six-part documentary series about the British experience of sex in the first half of this century: A Secret World Of Sex (9.50). Under the Mental Defectives Act of 1913 young women could be locked away in mental homes if they had illegitimate babies, and for many the annual seaside holiday was one of the few opportunities for sexual activity.</p>

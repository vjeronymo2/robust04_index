			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / No shelter from the storm: Imposition of UN sanctions against Serbia is exacerbating fears that the civil war will spread to the republic In the balmy heat of Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the impact of the United Nations sanctions imposed on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro, a week ago appear as far removed as the fighting and killing in neighbouring Bosnia-Hercegovina. Young and old sip Turkish coffees and smoke western cigarettes in the outdoor cafes. Smartly dressed drivers in their BMWs and Mercedes speed up and down the main boulevards. There is little to disturb the peace in Belgrade. Unlike Croatia, or Bosnia, war has never touched the people of Serbia. Yet many in the capital are afraid that the republic will soon be engulfed in civil war - a fear heightened by the imposition of sanctions. Those who have the money are beginning to stockpile food and other provisions in their cellars. Petrol is now rationed, with private car owners limited to 30 litres a month per car. Prices of basic goods have doubled in the past week. The country's steel mills are running out of coke and iron ore imported from Latin America and eastern Europe. Even the mint in Serbia is unable to print money. It is running out of dinars, the unit of currency, because the watermark and paper are imported from the republic of Slovenia, which has also brought sanctions against Serbia. The sanctions, which include a complete trade embargo on everything from textiles to cigarettes, the banning of all flights in and out of Serbia, a freeze on the republic's assets held abroad, and the reduction of diplomatic staff in embassies, were imposed by the UN on Serbia for two reasons. First, they were aimed at forcing the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, to order Serb irregulars and the the rump Yugoslav army to stop fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Second, in a less explicit way, western governments hoped that sanctions would lead to the overthrow of the Milosevic regime through anti-government demonstrations, and the subsequent installation of a pro-European democratic government in Belgrade. So far, there are no signs that the guns will fall silent in war-torn Bosnia. Serbian irregulars continue to expel Moslems from villages with the aim of creating ethnically pure regions. Croatian forces continue to try to form bridgeheads between Croatia and Croat-populated areas of Bosnia. The population of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, is on the verge of starvation following a two-month siege imposed by the Serb irregulars and the Yugoslav army. Even if there is a formal end to the war, the desire for revenge among Bosnia's three ethnic groups means that the killing is likely to continue - although perhaps not so systematically - in that republic. In an attempt to distance Serbia from the war in Bosnia, to end the UN sanctions, Mr Milosevic is now disowning the Bosnian Serbs, whom he once supported. He has said that Serbia is not involved in the civil war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. His government ministers repeatedly claim that the sanctions are unjust because Serbia is not the only guilty partner. At the same time, the sanctions have not yet galvanised the opposition into effective action against the Milosevic regime. This is because the opposition is fragmented between nationalists and liberals, and both groups are too weak to attract public support in their attempt to topple Mr Milosevic. For example, the armed, ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical party, led by Mr Vojislav Seselj, regards as traitors anyone who opposes the creation of a Greater Serbia, who wants a free press, or who advocates rights for the ethnic minorities in Serbia. The party enjoys considerable support in the countryside and in parts of Belgrade. Another opposition movement, the Serbian Renewal party, based in one of Belgrade's more fashionable suburbs, is a motley collection of nationalists, conservatives and monarchists. Led by Mr Vuk Draskovic, one of the few Serb politicians who spoke out against the war in Croatia and Bosnia, the Renewal party also believes in a Greater Serbia and the re-establishment of the former Yugoslavia on the lines of a confederation. Hopes that the Democratic party, the most liberal of all the Serbian opposition movements, will emerge as a viable force against the Milosevic government remain misplaced. Politically, its leaders want a democratic Serbia. But Mr Zoran Djindjic, one of the Democratic party's most articulate leaders, says that speaking openly about democracy in Serbia - which includes granting ethnic rights to the Albanians in Kosovo, the Moslems in Sanjzak in south-western Serbia, and the ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, northern Serbia - would amount to electoral suicide. 'The civil society is very weak here. Serbs do not reflect about democracy and its implications,' said Mr Djindjic. A senior Democratic party official said: 'Serbs simply do not care about the ethnic minorities, particularly the Albanians. They despise them.' Nevertheless, in spite of such evidence of a weak attachment to democratic political traditions in Serbia, the Democratic party wants to form a transitional government of national consensus which would include Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party. Although members of the Socialist party are beginning to try to distance themselves from Mr Milosevic's regime, his support is still strong enough for him to dictate the terms of any power-sharing arrangement. Mr Djindjic said last week a coalition government would prepare for free, democratic elections, monitored by international observers. He admitted that, by including socialists in any coalition government, the Democratic party's supporters would accuse it of selling out to the Milosevic regime. He also said that the Serbian president would try to use that government to remain in power, or even to pre-empt efforts to bring democracy and stability to the republic by fomenting civil war. 'The ingredients for war are all here in Serbia,' explained Mr Djindjic. He said thousands of Yugoslav federal army officers and their families had withdrawn into Serbia when they were forced to leave the other republics under the terms of the UN agreement in Croatia; 500,000 refugees had fled to Serbia from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina; and the extreme nationalists were jockeying for power. Given this atmosphere of recrimination and rivalry, the Democratic party is increasingly concerned that any delay in setting up a coalition government will give Mr Milosevic an opportunity to orchestrate unrest in order for the socialists to remain in power. 'Milosevic always finds a crisis to generate a conflict as a means of deflecting Serbia's problems,' explained Mr James Gow, a specialist on the Yugoslav army at King's College, London. But unlike previous occasions, Mr Milosevic can no longer rely on fomenting unrest in neighbouring republics to deflect attention from the republic's own problems: unemployment is about 20 per cent, industrial production is down about 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period of 1991; inflation is 150 per cent a month, on top of a rate of 1,000 per cent for 1991. Desperation at being boxed in may, however, make the Serbian president more unpredictable in the measures he takes to stay in power. United Nations peace-keeping troops have been deployed in Croatia. The Yugoslav federal army has withdrawn from the independent republic of Macedonia. What remains is Kosovo, which is the president's trump card, or potentially his Achilles' heel, as he calculates his next move. It was in this wretchedly poor province of 2m ethnic Albanians that Mr Milosevic began his rise to power in 1987. By using the rhetoric of nationalism, he accused the Albanians of persecuting the small Serb and Montenegrin ethnic minorities. By exploiting Serbia's historical claim on Kosovo, once the cradle of Serbia's medieval empire, he rallied enough support to incorporate the province forcibly into Serbia in 1990. Since then, Kosovo has been run by Belgrade like a police state, and the civil rights of the Albanians - who make up 90 per cent of the population - have been suppressed. Despite this violation, the ethnic (Moslem) Albanians, led by Mr Vettin Surroi and Mr Ibrahim Rugova, have adopted a policy of non-violence. But western diplomats doubt that this policy can continue. 'The tension is building up in Serbia because it is sitting on a time bomb - in Kosovo, its own back garden. Milosevic cannot hope for any stability in the new Yugoslavia as long as he continues to repress the Albanians,' a western diplomat said. But Serbia is saddled with a paradox: no party in Serbia can win at the ballot box if it guarantees to protect the civil rights of minorities in the republic - including the ethnic Albanians. Yet no stability in Serbia is possible without granting ethnic rights to the minorities. The possibility of war in Kosovo is of increasing concern to western governments, particularly the US. American diplomats say that Albania would support its fellow ethnic Albanians in Kosovo if nationalists around Mr Seselj or Mr Milosevic provoked a war in the province, or indeed, if the ethnic Albanians themselves attempted to rebel against their Serb government. In such an event, the ethnic Albanians in neighbouring Macedonia, who make up 20 per cent of the population, and the government of Turkey would probably support Kosovo as well. 'Turkey has had enough of the slaughter of their fellow Moslems in Bosnia. They won't stand idly by next time. They might arm the ethnic Albanians,' a diplomat said. However, few diplomats, or liberal intellectuals in Belgrade, can see a way out of the impasse. They fear that instability triggered by an outbreak of war in Kosovo will spread throughout the Balkans in a conflict which could last for many years. Western governments have so far ruled out military intervention, either in Sarajevo or to protect Kosovo's Albanians, because they are unsure what such a move would achieve. They are not even certain that sanctions, even if they stay in place against Serbia for many months, will force the Serbian leadership into starting negotiations with its ethnic Albanians. With Mr Milosevic at the helm, and ultra-nationalists waiting for him to falter, the depressing likelihood remains that things will get worse rather than better.</p>

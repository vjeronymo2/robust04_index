			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell asset talks likely SOME OF the companies which hold assets taken from the Maxwell company pension funds may be prepared to discuss returning them, said Sir John Cuckney, chairman of a government trust raising money for pensioners. Asked by the social security select committee if those who profited from dealing with Mr Maxwell - or assisted in the fraud - were providing funds to pensioners, he said: 'I have been approached by those who may be the target of legal action as well as those who may begin legal action themselves who are wishing to open up a dialogue.' He said that had proper standards of corporate governance been maintained in the City, Mr Maxwell would not have been able to steal the money. Sir John appointed to seek contributions from the City and individuals to pay compensation to Maxwell pensioners, told the Select Committee on Social Security that so far, just under Pounds 6m has been raised in 14 weeks. That sum is greater than those raised in the early weeks of disasters such as the Piper Alpha explosion and the Hillsborough stadium disaster. Some 600 individuals and companies have been approached for contributions, he said. Funds raised are enough to meet pension liabilities for roughly the next three years. Sir John said that some companies which had dealings with Mr Maxwell have avoided making contributions because to do so might imply some guilt on their part. Sir John said he had begun to act as an intermediary between lawyers and liquidators for parts of the Maxwell empire contesting each other's claims for assets.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Greece faces deficit crunch The European Commission has warned that Greece's Socialist government will be obliged to introduce new taxes this year, to prevent the public sector deficit running out of control. In its latest report on the Greek economy, the Commission predicts that, on the basis of current fiscal trends, revenues will increase by only 15 per cent in 1994, against a budget target of 22.9 per cent. The report says measures to raise extra revenue, equivalent to 5.5 per cent of gross domestic product, will be needed to limit the central government borrowing requirement to 12.9 per cent of GDP, the budget target. However, if the government is required to raise extra funds to cover a larger-than-forecast public sector wage bill, increased interest payments could send the borrowing requirement soaring to 18 per cent of GDP, the report adds. After several years of real wage decreases, the government is being pressed to grant generous rises to workers in state-controlled banks and public corporations. Moves to rehire public sector workers dismissed under the previous government's cost-cutting programme are under way. Greece's public debt, at 154 per cent of GDP the highest in the European Union, is poised to rise again this year as a result of heavy losses posted in 1993 by state corporations. The Greek parliament voted yesterday to investigate allegations that former conservative prime minister Constantine Mitsotakis was involved in illegal wiretapping of political rivals, Reuter reports.</p>

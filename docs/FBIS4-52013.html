			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with King Norodom Sihanouk by local and foreign </F> members of the Cambodian Journalists Association at the Royal  Palace in Phnom Penh on 2 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted -- introduction of journalists  and Sihanouk's views on press freedom and women's rights]  [Sihanouk] Now let us deal with the second problem, about the  royal guard. Let me tell you that I used to have an army and I  trusted His Excellency [H.E.] Lon Nol more than anyone. Lon Nol  got all of his ranks and positions because of me. At that time,  H.E. Nhoek Chulong retired and H.E. Lon Nol was given command of  the army. H.E. Lon Nol was even entrusted with the premiership  of the Royal Government when I made an official visit to the  Soviet Union. Then, together with Prince Sirik Matak, H.E. Lon  Nol deposed me in Phnom Penh. Ever since, as all of you know,  we have experienced nothing but hardship and misery. You know  how difficult life has been since that coup d'etat.    So how can I trust the army? I was betrayed by those who  were supposed to be my personal guards, by my own prime  minister, and especially by the army itself. Mr. Lon Nol was  the head of a royal army, not a republican army; a royal guard,  not a presidential guard. He deposed me when he was commander  of the Royal Khmer Armed Forces. The same story can be heard in  many African and Latin American countries. The head of state is  deposed when he is visiting foreign countries, and is deposed by  his own soldiers. For this reason, I no longer want my soldiers  to be my royal guard.    The other day, H.E. [words indistinct] and some other  excellencies asked if they could form my royal guard. I said:  Wait, do you want to depose me? [laughter]    It was not another army but the army close to me that  deposed  me. Who deposed me? My prime minister did; my commander in  chief himself did. Many heads of state around the world have  been deposed by their own right-hand men. So let it be known  that I will no longer accept my own soldiers as bodyguards.  Some may wonder why as a Khmer I do not use my fellow Khmers to  protect me. Please excuse me. If you do not want me to die  soon, or to be ousted soon, permit me to be protected by my  Korean bodyguards. I have 25 now, and President Kim Il-song has  assured me that if I want to have 50 he will send another 25.  Each of these Koreans has been trained to handle 100  adversaries; one against 100 [preceding three words in French].  So 10 of them can fight against 1,000, and 20 against 2,000.  If I have 50, they will be able to fight many, many more  adversaries.    Therefore, do not give me any nonsense about making  arrangements for my protection. There was a request made to  President Kim Il-song asking for ammunition and [word  indistinct] to set up a division to protect Samdech Sihanouk.  President Kim Il-song replied that he would provide anything  Samdech Sihanouk wished. I quickly entreated President  Kim-Il-song not to give anything; not to reply to the request.  This is because if such an arrangement were made, it would be  possible for those who made it to depose me. Therefore, I beg  your pardon for not being duped. I want to make it clear that I  would not accept that arrangement. I have already asked  President Kim Il-song not to give you anything. If he did, I  would be killed; I would be deposed.    So all of my trust is placed in my 25 Korean friends. I am  waiting for the Khmer Rouge to return the land they are using  before I increase the number of Korean guards to 50. I need the  land to build living quarters for them. I am in great need of  space, and the land now occupied by the Khmer Rouge would be a  good site to build houses for my 50 Korean guards. I have 25 of  them now. It is sufficient, but they are working too hard --  around the clock without rest -- for my protection.    That is my answer to the second question. I refuse to accept  a Cambodian royal guard. Who deposed me? Lon Nol did.  [passage omitted including journalist's two-part question]    Now, let us discuss the second question concerning the Khmer  Rouge and the roundtable.    Your Excellency Kong Sam-ol, is it not true that a round  table has been prepared? We use a round table, without any  edges, to illustrate our idea of equality for all parties living  in the same family, free from any distinction regarding status,  rank, or position. Those who sit at the round table are among  equals. No one is head of state, prime minister, National  Assembly chairman, or a mere party leader. We are all in the  same family at the round table.    Yet the roundtable meeting is impossible. This is a matter  of great concern because our people want peace. Why? If there  is war, the people suffer greatly. Not only the people, but  soldiers and the rank and file will all be miserable. Everyone  will suffer, and so will our efforts at national reconstruction.  The culprit is war. For this reason, we must seek to stop the  fighting by all means. If there is disagreement between the  Khmer Rouge and the Royal Government, both sides must agree to  talk to each other like brothers. They must not reject or  oppose talks.    [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] My plan was this: Both  sides would meet for three to four hours at a time, after which  the negotiators would come out and meet with the media. Those  of you in the media would grill them thoroughly to learn about  their positions. Once you understood their positions, our  people would also come to understand them through your good  offices.    That was my plan, but we could not do it for now. Why? It  was for this reason: At first, Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen rejected the proposal for the  meeting to be held inside the Royal Palace, although they have  agreed to it now. Khieu Samphan said that it was not safe for  him to stay near the Royal Palace, citing security reasons. He  asked that he and his delegation be allowed to stay in the Royal  Palace; not the Khemarin Palace [Sihanouk's residence], but a  building inside the Royal Palace compound so as to be close to  the king for protection. I agreed to that request and Prince  Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen -- who were opposed to the idea  before -- have now agreed to it. So I wrote to Khieu Samphan  yesterday. Khieu Samphan replied, saying thanks but no thanks.  He said Phnom Penh was not neutral and he wants to meet at a  neutral venue, perhaps meaning somewhere abroad. He said that no  place in the country is neutral. So we cannot go anywhere in  Cambodia to meet -- Siem Reap, Pailin, Kep, Sihanoukville --  none would be neutral. Therefore he asked to meet in Paris,  Jakarta, Pyongyang, or Beijing. Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh, Samdech Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim have told me  they adamantly refuse to meet the Khmer Rouge abroad. They  insist that the meeting must be inside the country.    The current situation is this: Khieu Samphan refuses to meet  inside the country and demands to go outside, while the leaders  in Phnom Penh refuse to go outside the country and insist on  meeting inside.    The other day I met with French Minister Francois Fillon,  who  came here on behalf of his head of state; his government. He  assured me that France would do anything I wished. I told him I  would ask Prince Krompreah Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen if they  would agree to go to Paris. If they go, Khieu Samphan will also  go because he will go anywhere as long as it is not inside  Cambodia. Unfortunately, Prince Krompreah and Samdech Hun Sen  answered that they would not go to Paris, Jakarta, Pyongyang,  Beijing, or anywhere outside of Cambodia. With such a  difference of views, we have certainly arrived at an impasse; a  dead end. In order to hold a roundtable, each side must be  willing to compromise. Without compromise there can be no  solution. [passage omitted]    How can we rebuild the country with the war raging? Our  natural resources are being destroyed by the war. Therefore, we  must put an end to the war; there must be an unconditional  cease-fire [preceding two words in English]. There must be no  conditions at all. There must be an unconditional cease-fire  and negotiations. That is my proposal even today; I repeat,  today [preceding nine words in English]. But who will listen to  me?    If no one listens, it becomes a very difficult situation,  especially now that the Khmer Rouge is winning. How can you  expect the Khmer Rouge to join the roundtable readily if they  are still feeling high from their victory?    There is another thing. They say they refuse to let the  Khmer Rouge join the government; that they would not amend the  Constitution to let the Khmer Rouge join the government. So we  have nothing to give them in return. My idea was to give the  Khmer Rouge some reward for transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng,  Preah Vihear; and so on -- that is, all the autonomous Khmer  Rouge regions -- back to the Royal Government. As compensation,  the Royal Government should enact a small constitutional  amendment to allow the Khmer Rouge to join the government. You  do not have to mention the Khmer Rouge specifically by name,  just say that if you need someone from outside of parliament,  you can do it. The practice of bringing in people who did not  participate in the elections is common in other countries. We  did it under Sangkum Reas Niyum.    So I asked them to consider all of that. They answered that  they would not give anything to the Khmer Rouge. Samdech Chea  Sim wrote me that whatever the Khmer Rouge asked for, this side  would not give it to them. If they are not given anything, what  will they get in exchange? In exchange for the Khmer Rouge  transferring Pailin, Anlung Veng, Preah Vihear, and other zones  under their control to us, the Royal Government should have some  rewards for them. The government's current position, however,  is that the Khmer Rouge can come in but will get nothing for it.  So they have no choice but to continue fighting. If we win, it  will be great; if they win, though, it will be serious for us.    For the time being, no one seems to have the upper hand.  There is no winner or loser. Only the people are the losers;  they are not directly engaged in the fighting, but they have  been fleeing everywhere. Some 25,000 fled to Thailand and  10,000 others are joining them now. During the battle of  Pailin, 10,000 civilians and soldiers fled in confusion into  Battambang. The people are the ones who are suffering.  Moreover, many bridges and roads have been destroyed. If the  fighting among Khmers continues, our nation will perish. Our  country will be wiped out if we Khmers continue to fight and  kill each another without pity or compromise. Who will benefit  from that? Our neighbors will; the foreigners will, especially  Thailand and Vietnam. Thailand and Vietnam are not going to  invade us anymore, but they will benefit when we go down. Each  time one Khmer kills another, the foreigners gain.    [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Our experience, therefore,  shows us -- teaches us -- that we must not fight each other; we  must regard each other as brothers. This should only be the  Royal Government's stand; both sides should uphold this common  stance. The Khmer Rouge, however, have never understood this  concept. When they were in power, they constantly boasted they  had saved the nation. How could they have saved it when 2-3  million Khmers perished? Some Vietnamese also died, of course,  but many more Khmers lost their lives than Vietnamese. The  Khmer Rouge must be held responsible for the deaths of 2-3  million Khmers. How could they boast of being the protectors --  the saviors -- of the Khmer race?    Their sale of gems to foreigners -- as well as allowing  foreigners to come in and cut our trees -- does not serve the  national interest. The Khmer Rouge, therefore, is at fault;  serious fault. Of course, I am not passing judgment on this or  that person. I am not saying that this person must be punished  and that person must be acquitted. I am merely asking everyone  to end the fighting and start negotiations. This is just my  personal opinion. If we have to go to Paris, then let us go to  Paris so we can explore any possible way to make peace. If we  resume fighting without even trying to end it by all possible  means, we will not be at peace with ourselves. We should talk  in Paris to see who is right and who is wrong. The ultimate  truth will be revealed to everyone, because some of you in the  media who have the means will go and listen to the discussions  in Paris.    Why Paris? I had asked for the meeting be held in the DPRK.  I own a very large palace near Pyongyang called the Land of  Longevity. There is a lake in front of my palace. There are  small hills, pine trees, and a cool breeze. President Kim  Il-song donated this land to Cambodia and officially recognized  it as Cambodian territory. We would be meeting on Cambodian  soil in Pyongyang, but they rejected my offer. So, because  Pyongyang was unacceptable, I proposed that we go to Paris or  Jakarta. France and Indonesia were the cochairs of the  Cambodian peace treaty that we all signed in Paris on 23 October  1991. Our problem remains linked with Paris and Jakarta as the  cochairs. Therefore, we should seek their help in finding a  solution to our dispute. If the Phnom Penh side disagrees with  this, I cannot help it. I know that Khieu Samphan would accept  because he will go anywhere provided it is outside of Cambodia.  He would go anywhere. This evening I am going to meet with  Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh and Samdech Hun Sen. This  morning I am meeting with you from the media, and in the evening  I will meet with the two leaders and we will see what their  position is. Then I will make my findings known to all of you  in a few lines of writing to both the national and international  press.    So this is all I have to tell you at this moment. Do not  worry. I will continue to make efforts toward peace, because the  longer the fighting lasts, the more people will perish.  Moreover, we will never be at peace with ourselves if we fail  to explore every possibility for peace. When we really run out  of peaceful means -- when there is no other way but war -- then  we will go to war. I do not give my blessing, of course, but if  both sides really want to fight they should go ahead and fight.  You will be responsible to history.    If I were given the choice -- the power to decide -- I would  stop the fighting; order an immediate and unconditional  cease-fire [preceding two words in French and repeated in  English]. Yes, if I could decide I would order two things: A  cease-fire -- cessation of the killing -- and talk. [passage  omitted]    Your king's position can be summed up as follows: First,  there must be an end to hostility -- there must be peace; and  second, there must be a roundtable. If this roundtable cannot  be held here at home, it should be held somewhere outside the  country. In my opinion, this is a good compromise to save  either side from a possible loss of face. It is quite  convenient to go to Paris. The other option is Jakarta. We can  go anywhere provided the three samdeches first agree to go  abroad, and second accept a venue convenient to them. If they  decide not to go, then we will come to a dead end. That is one  possible scenario.    If they are forced to agree to go abroad, the king will be  criticized for being pro-Khmer Rouge; blindly working for them.  They would think that when the Khmer Rouge asked to be quartered  in the Royal Palace we had to concede to their request; that the  Khmer Rouge won that round. Now the Khmer Rouge has rejected a  roundtable inside of the country and the king again wants us to  go abroad.    So, my children, this is my position: I dare not make  another appeal to the three samdeches. If I do, they will say  that the king is not neutral; that the king only loves the Khmer  Rouge and is harsh toward his children on the other side. So I  do not dare put any pressure on the three samdeches. If the  three samdeches listen to the radio, they should understand my  position. When we agreed to this interview, I requested that  our state radio and television broadcast it fully; not  partially. Please broadcast the whole thing, even if it lasts  until 2300 or midnight. IBC [International Broadcasting  Corporation], which is making a lot of money in the television  business, is also invited to maximize its broadcast of this  interview so that our people -- both our leaders and the masses  -- know everything.    Many of you from the media are present here, but quite a few  are absent. Do the absentees hate me? Are they trying to avoid  me? [laughter]    That is alright. I do not mind. They will not miss  anything, though. You who are here and will surely brief them  on what the king said. Anyway, they can listen to the radio or  watch television. [passage omitted]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am from the KHMER APPYEAKROET  newspaper. I wish to ask your majesty two questions:    First question: Do you have any other means or solutions to  solve the deadlocked roundtable issue so that the warring  parties will sit at the negotiating table, end the war, and make  peace for the Cambodian people?    Second question: This is a question about ethnic Vietnamese.  Cambodia belongs to the Cambodians. When Cambodians enter  Vietnam, they are arrested, yet Vietnamese are flowing into  Cambodia on a daily basis. During the election year there was a  perceptible decrease in Vietnamese immigration. Since then,  more Vietnamese have been coming to Cambodia. One can see that  there are Vietnamese everywhere. They clog up our rivers and  cities. How are you -- along with the current Royal Government  -- going to solve this problem?    [Sihanouk] I have said virtually everything about the  roundtable. There is no need to elaborate and I have nothing to  add to what I already said. Now let us consider the second  question; that is, the question of the Vietnamese immigrants,  whether legal or illegal.    It is difficult to tell for sure how many Vietnamese are in  Cambodia. If we ask our leaders, they say there are only about  30,000-40,000 ethnic Vietnamese. Others -- those who are not in  power -- put the number at some 2 million. Some would say  500,000 and others 50,000. I do not know what the real number  is. In the Royal Palace, we do not have a department capable of  counting -- of investigating -- the Vietnamese.    I have one of my cousins here, H.E. Buor Herl, who has  always  served me and who is an authority on Cambodia. He comes from  abroad. He is not one of the local businessmen. He saw me in  Cambodia and expressed his wish to come and serve me again. I  am going to assign him to investigate this issue. He is not  going to take a census of all the Vietnamese in Cambodia. That  would be an impossible task; some areas are impenetrable because  of poor security.    Please come here, Excellency Herl. His father, Buor Hong,  was a freedom fighter against the French colonialists. He was  jailed and exiled by the French. His has always been a family  of freedom fighters. Herl himself fought against the  Vietnamese, right? It was during the time when the ANKI  [National Army of Independent Cambodia], KPNLAF [Khmer National  Liberation Armed Forces], and even the Khmer Rouge joined hands  against the Vietnamese. So his credentials are good; he is  certainly not pro-Vietnamese. How about your wife? She is a  pure blooded Cambodian, is she not? [laughter]    If she were Vietnamese, it might would be difficult to  conduct the investigation. By the way, do you have a Vietnamese  girlfriend? No? [laughter]    I have a joke. It is about H.E. Um Manorin [Princess  Monique's stepbrother] over there. He used to have a Vietnamese  girlfriend. His wife went after that poor girl, smashing all her  pots and pans and banishing her back to Vietnam. Was it your  wife who sent her packing? Oh, it was Ku Run [police chief]? I  heard that she lost a few of her teeth. If you meet her now, I  think her face would not be pleasant to see. [laughter]    I believe you are more nationalist now, and maybe you have  stopped dreaming about Vietnamese starlets.    So let us all put our heads together and think about how to  deal with the Vietnamese immigrants. More and more are coming  every day. Where should we begin the investigation? How many  are at Neak Luong? [murmuring]    Yes, but Neak Luong has always been known as Saigon Moi. It  was known as New Saigon even under Lon Nol. It is not easy to  know for sure.    Let me tell all of you that the state has a hard time  dealing  with some aspects of this issue. There are Vietnamese who fled  Khmer Rouge persecution and are now trying to return by boat  because Vietnam does not recognize them as its own citizens and  wants them to return. They are massing at the border. The  state is not allowing in for fear of annoying our Cambodian  people. There are many boats at the border, and international  humanitarian organizations have to feed these people at our  country's expense. These organizations are based in Cambodia and  are supposed to feed starving Cambodians. Now they are feeding  these Vietnamese instead. These organizations include FAO [UN  Food and Agriculture Organization], UNICEF, and others. They  are not supposed to assist Vietnamese people in Vietnam, but  they are doing just that for the Vietnamese stranded at the  border, unwanted by both Vietnam and Cambodia. This is one  group.    Another group is formed by those who have come into Cambodia  by various routes and claim that our soldiers and police are  corrupt. No, I am not accusing my children who are soldiers and  police of corruption. It is a fact that our authorities cannot  stop them because our border demarcation is not as clear as in  the past. Under Sangkum Reas Niyum, the border was clearly  demarcated. Now it is different. Vietnam might have secretly  moved the border deep into our territory. Many of the  Vietnamese in our country can still claim to be in Vietnam  because the border markers have been replanted inside Cambodia.  Therefore, the governments in Phnom Penh and Hanoi must hold  talks to demarcate the border clearly.    As far as the ethnic Vietnamese in the interior of the  country are concerned, they enjoy almost excessive protection by  the West. They contend they are the offspring of Vietnamese  immigrants who came to Cambodia when King Sihanouk was young.  They say these Vietnamese existed when King Sihanouk was king  previously and when the French were here, before Cambodia was  independent. The present-day Vietnamese, therefore, are the  great grandchildren of these Vietnamese immigrants. As such,  they have the right to live in Cambodia. This is what has been  written in the Western press, showing that the West is siding  with the ethnic Vietnamese.    [Excerpts] [Sihanouk continues] Then there are the  Vietnamese who have Cambodian citizenship acquired under the  previous administration on the grounds that they had lived for  an extended period of time in Cambodia or were born in Cambodia.    Those Vietnamese who have proof that their ancestors lived  in  Cambodia, or who hold Cambodian identity cards given by the  State of Cambodia because they were born in Cambodia, lived in  Cambodia for many years, and know the Cambodian language and  literature, will not be driven out. This is because Cambodians  living in France, the United States, Germany, and other  countries have acquired citizenship in their host countries. If  Cambodians in, say, Canada can get Canadian citizenship, how can  we be harsh with the Vietnamese in our country? If we insist,  we would be accused of infringing on the principles of human  rights. This matter is quite touchy. Nevertheless, we have the  right to deport back to Vietnam those who have immigrated  illegally, including prostitutes of all descriptions. We can do  that. The government should check out the illegal immigrants --  be they farmers or traders -- and deport them. We can tell them  they are not permitted to live in Cambodia and we invite them to  return to their own country. We can do this because illegal  immigrants of all nationalities, including Cambodians, in France  and other countries who do not have proper residency cards are  driven out of those countries.    So here is my answer to your question:    1. Any Vietnamese having proof that his ancestors lived in  Cambodia in the 1930's, 1940's, 1950's, or 1960's -- that he is  their great grandchild -- will be allowed to live in Cambodia  because he is a Cambodian.    2. Any Vietnamese who legally acquired citizenship under the  ruling State of Cambodia on the grounds that he was born in  Cambodia or lived in Cambodia for many years and could speak,  read, and write Cambodian well will not be asked to leave. We  have no legal grounds to deport this category of Vietnamese.    We have the right to send back other Vietnamese, though --  any Vietnamese who have illegally immigrated into Cambodia and  have not received official permission from the previous  administration or the current government. We will politely ask  them to leave. We invite them to leave. We must check for this  type of Vietnamese. Some areas are not safe to go and check for  these Vietnamese, but I believe that the areas controlled by the  Khmer Rouge need not be checked because the Khmer Rouge would  not allow any Vietnamese to remain alive there. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Your Majesty announced that Khieu Samphan  had  asked you to leave Phnom Penh. The people were very alarmed.  Do you have anything to say to calm their fears? Another thing  is that we would like to see a cease-fire in place first before  a roundtable is held.    [Sihanouk] This is a good question. I have to tell you that  I still require more cancer treatment in China, and President  Jiang    Zemin has invited me on a three-day state visit before I  undergo further medical treatment. If need be, however -- if  the people need my presence in the country -- I might postpone  my cancer treatment in China or I might have my cancer treated  here so I can stay in Cambodia. But my wife wants to see me  undergo the treatment because she does not want to be a widow  soon. Despite all my brave words to the contrary, I am more or  less of a henpecked husband. [passage omitted]    Now let us talk about the roundtable. It is not right to ask  the Khmer Rouge to observe a cease-fire first; both sides must  stop fighting equally. Then we can proceed to the roundtable in  Cambodia. But Khieu Samphan does not want a roundtable in  Cambodia. What is your opinion; what is your suggestion if Khieu  Samphan does not want to hold it here? This problem is  important. All of you should help solve it.    [Correspondent] I am the director of the SAMLENG POLROAT  KHMER newspaper. My respects to Your Majesty. It is my opinion  that both sides should listen to Your Majesty's proposal. Khieu  Samphan's side should stop fighting and so should the people on  this side. Both sides should find the solution to our problem  together.    [Sihanouk] Thank you. I would like to inform you all that at  1730 this afternoon I will meet with Samdech Ranaridddh and  Samdech Hun Sen. I will ask them point blank whether or not  they agree to a cease-fire. I suggest that the cease-fire  should be bilateral and observed equally by both sides. The  roundtable will be held in the Damnak Chan Pavilion, and H.E.  Khieu Samphan will be asked to join. We will do that, if you do  not disagree. I will do that this afternoon. If the two  samdeches agree, I will fax a letter to Khieu Samphan and ask  him whether or not he agree if the other side has already  agreed. Both sides will be asked to send their generals to form  a committee under my chairmanship to oversee the cease-fire.  After the cease-fire is in place, Mr. Khieu Samphan will be  invited to join a roundtable to solve the problem for the  people. If this problem cannot be solved, each side will be  held responsible before history and the people. If you do not  disagree, I will do just that. [passage omitted]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] I am the deputy editor of the  SAKAL newspaper. According to news reports, the Royal  Government will reject the Khmer Rouge because they refused to  join the roundtable on 2 May. If this is the case, how will the  Royal Government solve the peace problem in Cambodia and what  means will it use to do so?    [Sihanouk] Thank you. This is an important question, but I  have already answered it in detail. Khieu Samphan refused to  come to Phnom Penh, saying that his security was not ensured.  He wants to go abroad. First he said that if his security was  assured he would come. Now he says no even though he was given  permission to stay in the Royal Palace. Maybe this is because  he is winning battles. Maybe because he is winning he is  looking for excuses not to hold a roundtable. This is only a  guess. If we want to corner him, we should agree to go to  Paris. But the children on this side say it would not be  practical to go to Paris. If all the leaders go to Paris, what  would happen here? Who would take care of affairs at home?  There would be anarchy. I agree with the children on this  side. If we go to Paris, it would be difficult to control the  situation and the fighting at home. Another thing is that it  would not be nice to look at. This does not mean I am siding  with the three samdeches. It would be an ugly prospect. There  would be no end to the problems and it would be most impractical  to resort to foreign venues all the time. Why can we not meet  at home? It is proper and sufficient to meet in the Royal  Palace. Khieu Samphan should agree to come and join the  roundtable here so that all the suspicions can be cleared and  everyone can see for sure who is right and who is wrong. We  should meet and discuss things once and for all. Each  negotiator will be grilled by the media so that the nation, the  international community, and history can see who is right and  who is wrong. [words indistinct] [passage omitted]</p>

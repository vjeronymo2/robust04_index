			<p>BFN     [Text] The new Turkish ambassador was today received by  President Hashemi-Rafsanjani to present his credentials.    At the meeting Ahmed Mitat Balkan, the Turkish ambassador,  conveyed the desire of the government and people of Turkey to  expand ties with their great neighbor, Iran. He described the  existing ties as deep-rooted. He expressed the hope that  through exchange of high-ranking delegations between Iran and  Turkey and greater efforts by the two countries' diplomatic  missions, the existing relations and cooperation -- including at  the Economic Cooperation Organization and international forums  -- will be further expanded.    According to a Central News Unit correspondent's report Mr.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani described as positive the grounds for the  expansion of cooperation between the two neighboring countries,  Iran and Turkey, especially in regional issues, the joint  committee, Central Asia and Caucasus.    Referring to the mischief-making of Turkish media, aimed at  marring the spirit of friendship and cooperation between the two  countries, he stressed the need for the two countries'  authorities to remain alert to foil those mischiefs.</p>

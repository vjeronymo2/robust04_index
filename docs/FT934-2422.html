			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Observer: Auld lang syne How the mighty thud when they fall. Once France's arts minister, Jack Lang now needs a job; he has been stripped of his parliamentary seat for having spent too much on his campaign in the spring elections. Lang, 54, bluntly denounced the loss of his seat as an 'attack from the right'. True, the conservatives never concealed their hatred of him, one of the most popular and powerful members of the socialist cabinet and a close confidant of President Francois Mitterrand. They also loathed his policies as arts minister, not least his elaborate grands projets, like the Louvre renovation scheme. But Lang undeniably went over the FFr500,000 limit that French politicians are allowed to spend on their electoral campaigns - FFr90,000 over the limit to be precise. He is also banned from standing for the French parliament for at least a year. That may not trouble him too much; he is eyeing next year's European parliament elections.</p>

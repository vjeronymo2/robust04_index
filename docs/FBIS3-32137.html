This was yesterday stated in a joint communique signed by  Presidents Sixto Duran-Ballen and Juan Calos Wasmosy at the  conclusion of the official visit by the Paraguayan chief of  state.  <H5>  Air Transport </H5>   Taking into account the cargo transportation difficulties  that the two countries have, with a lack of connections that  could further promote tourism and commerce, the presidents  emphasized the importance of air transport for promoting  development between the two nations. They agreed to instruct  the aeronautical authorities in their respective countries to  continue and to intensify the dialogue on the benefits of an  agreement for air transport between the two nations.    The presidents also reaffirmed their support for the role  played by ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] in the  current situation, particularly as it refers to subregional  integration agreements and to the promotion and liberalization  of regional commerce.    In this regard they expressed their firm position with  respect to the observance of the preferential treatment provided  for by the Treaty of Montevideo of 1980 for the countries of  lower relative development.  <H3>  Agreement Between Paraguay and Ecuador for the Protection of  Investment </H3>   Presidents Wasmosy and Duran Ballen also attended a ceremony  during which Foreign Ministers Diego Paredes and Luis Ramirez  Boettner signed a bilateral agreement for the promotion and  reciprocal protection of investment.    Under the terms of this agreement each side promised to  promote, within its territory and to the extent possible,  investments by the other side, putting them under its own laws  and regulations.    The agreement notes that the party that has admitted  investment in its territory will grant the necessary  implementation permits.  <H5>  Type of Investment </H5>   The agreement defines the type of investments that will be  admitted, and each party promises to protect them within its  territory, granting them the treatment of more favored nation.    This implies fair and equitable treatment, no less favorable  than the treatment that each party grants to its own investors  or to third states.    Both sides also guarantee that the investors who avail  themselves of the terms of this agreement may freely transfer  the payments corresponding to their investment.</p>

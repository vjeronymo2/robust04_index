			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Vocational tests body comes under attack THE HEAD of the Business and Technology Education Council, Britain's largest provider of vocational qualifications, yesterday launched a strong attack on the quango responsible for carrying out government policies to promote work-oriented education. Mr Parry Rogers, Btec's chairman, condemned the National Council for Vocational Qualifications as a 'prescriptive regulator' undermining the quality of courses by over-regulation of their content and standard. The NCVQ, under the leadership of Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post Office, has been charged by the government with simplifying and co-ordinating the range of vocational qualifications on offer. It has a power of validation - which gives it authority over the three main providers of courses, as government funding for trainees is to be closely tied to validated courses. The NCVQ also has the task of ensuring that 80 per cent of the workforce is covered by national vocational qualifications by the end of this year, and of overseeing the introduction of the 'general vocational qualifications' - intended to be work-oriented alternatives to A-levels in England and Wales - announced in last year's white paper on education and training. Tension between Btec and the NCVQ has been rising for some time, as the design and validation process has proceeded. Btec's concern is not limited to regulation: it is also thought to be worried about the speed of the introduction of the GVQs - due to be piloted this autumn, and to be generally available from autumn 1993. Speaking at the launch of Btec's annual report yesterday, Mr Rogers likened the NCVQ's approach to 'laying down the minimum specification for a car and forbidding the manufacturer from offering a higher specification'. He added: 'That attitude is daft in any circumstances; how much dafter when done in the name of a government dedicated to market forces]' Underlying the dispute are differences about the philosophy underlying vocational courses. The NCVQ wishes to use courses to promote skill-based training by employers, while Btec is anxious not to sacrifice the broader educational role of courses. Mr Rogers emphasised yesterday: 'I for one am unwilling to see Btec students lose the chance to go on to degree courses where this is what the individual wants and deserves.' Concern that standards are at risk and that the NCVQ is adopting an excessively competence-based approach is voiced far beyond Btec. An oft-cited example of the trend is the newly validated Btec first diploma in business and finance, claiming parity of esteem with GCSE, which comprises competence tests such as filing 20 consecutive documents correctly and answering 10 telephone calls accurately.</p>

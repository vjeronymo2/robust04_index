			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Investment Fund Listed in Shenzhen"] </F>   [Text] The first standardized investment fund, the Tianji  Fund, has recently been listed on the Shenzhen Securities  Exchange.    The Tianji Fund was established in January 1993 by Fund  Management Co of China Shenzhen Investment Fund Management Co  Ltd (SIFM). A total of 581.47 million yuan's ($66.8 million)  worth of fund units were issued, at a price of 1.03 yuan (11.8  cents) apiece.    Tianji Fund's organizational framework, internal operations  and management are based on international standards. The  responsibilities of the manager and trustee are clearly  separated to ensure that the trustee effectively supervises the  manager.    Tianji Fund is designed to increase assets while spreading  risks through diversified investments, as well as to service  small and medium investors. Its portfolio includes securities,  real estate, money markets and share rights.    As the first fund management company, SIFM is cultivating  foreign partners to develop overseas business.    According to officials of Tianji, China's emerging  securities  market has more individual and fewer institutional investors.  It is widely recognized that the lack of institutional  investors is the main cause of the stock market's persistent  sluggishness.    An investment fund is necessary to stabilize the market and  stimulate the development of capital markets the Tianji  officials say.    The listing of the Tianji Fund marks a new stage in  institutional investment in securities, fund officials say.    However, many problems stand in the way of the development  of  such funds in China, such as the absence of effective laws. Few  funds in China are based on international regulations, and China  itself has only one document governing investment funds -- the  Contemporary Regulations on Investment Fund Management, issued  by the Shenzhen municipal government.    Comprehensive laws are urgently needed to ensure that funds  can operate properly and orderly, Tianji officials say. In this  respect, China can learn from other countries in building its  own system.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Defence tonight dismissed as  "nothing more than speculation" a report that senior RAF  officers and planners have backed a plan to withdraw all British  combat aircraft and helicopters from Germany.    The proposal is the most radical to emerge from a series of  studies aimed at making a 1 billion pound cut in the 24 billion  pound defence budget, according to THE OBSERVER which says it  has seen a confidential six-page report.    If the Cabinet approves, nearly 80 fighter aircraft and  6,000  personnel would pull out of Germany by April 1996 as part of the  latest round of defence cuts, the paper says.    It would end an RAF presence in Germany stretching back  nearly half a century.    The paper quotes a senior RAF source saying: "In terms of  the  international situation, things have come on a long way since  the reunification of Germany and there is a feeling that if we  did need to go back it would not be that difficult."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By political correspondent Pierre Claassen] </F>   [Text] Cape Town March 1 SAPA -- ANC [African National  Congress] Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa has called for the  resignation of National Housing Minister Louis Shill for trying  to hijack political benefit for the National Party [NP]  government by announcing a multi-billion housing programme. Mr  Ramaphosa made the call in a resoluation submitted to the  Transitional Executive Council [TEC] at its Cape Town sitting on  Tuesday. [1 March]    Quoting newspaper reports and producing the official media  release, he said Mr Shill had arrogantly proceeded to make an  announcement on an as yet incomplete package negotiated by the  multi-party National Housing Forum [NHF]. "He is clearly taking  the housing issue and making it a party political matter," he  said.    Mr Ramaphosa told the council that when it was heard that Mr  Shill was going to make the announcement, he was asked to wait  and do so jointly with the NHF. "They (NHF) say the announcement  is premature and has the potential to put at risk everything  they have done."    It was quite clear that by making the announcement Mr Shill  was trying to demonstarte to the country that one party, the NP  government, was solely responsible for the plan. "He is abusing  his position as a minister by using a package negotiated at a  multi-party forum to boost the fortunes of the National Party.    "It is the most arrogant, the cheapest shot Mr Shill could  take on an issue like this," he said. Housing was a national  issue and had to be handled on a multi-party level. The issue  affected the levelling of the playing field (the primary  function of the TEC). Mr Shill had made it unlevel.    "We have had enormous problems with this minister." When the  housing board was formed he had made it clear he would not be  dictated to. "This minister must be brought to book." He should  be brought before the council, along with the NHF, to explain  his actions.    "I would like to say that this government is on its way out,  and that ministers should not make announcements on issues that  affect all our people without first making sure at multi-partyy  level that there is agreement."    After listening to the response of some members, including  Dr  Dawie de Villiers, who called for fuller information before  condemnatory action was taken, Mr Ramaphosa called for the  minister's resignation. "We have had good relations with other  ministers who have constrained themselves and not acted on a  unilateral basis but consulted on a multi-party basis."    He named Dr de Villiers and the complicated issue of  cellular  phones. The minister of finance and of foreign affairs were  other examples.    Mr Shill's actions was upsetting the tenuous balance which  the council was trying to establish over the transition. "He has  done the country a disservice -- he must go," Mr Ramaphosa said.    The debate on his proposal was adjourned to allow efforts to  be made to get Mr Shill to attend the session and explain  himself.</p>

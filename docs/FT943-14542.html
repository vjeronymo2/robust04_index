			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Fast-stream system faces shake-up The controversial fast-stream entry scheme for recruiting high-calibre graduates to the civil service is likely to survive, following a review by the Cabinet Office Efficiency Unit published yesterday. The scheme takes just over 100 graduates each year on what has been seen as a ticket to the top of Whitehall. The programme has been criticised for being too elitist and biased towards Oxbridge graduates. The Efficiency Unit study recommends retaining the scheme to attract top graduates in a recruitment market where most other large employers compete for the best people. It says this is the best way of attracting a share of the most able graduates with the quickness, sensitivity and flexibility to manage change successfully. But the study also says acceptance into the fast-stream should not be seen as an automatic route to the top. Those who enter it should receive limited but intensive training to help them develop their skills and acquire relevant experience. But they should then compete with others, inside and outside the civil service, for top jobs. The unit recommends that the scheme be renamed the Policy Management Programme to get away from the 'fast-stream' concept. It says that the selection processes should be re-examined to eliminate bias towards Oxbridge graduates. The review was published on the same day as the civil service white paper, which welcomes its conclusions and invites comments. It is clear from the white paper, however, that those who rise to the top of Whitehall in the future will be less likely to have spent their entire career in the civil service as most of today's permanent secretaries have. The government believes that the advertising of many top jobs - especially at the higher salaries likely in the three highest grades - will attract more outsiders into Whitehall. Eight out of the 35 permanent secretaries are already outsiders, including Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary at the Treasury. Ambitious young entrants to the new Policy Management Programme will be well advised to think about spending a period outside the civil service even if they hope to rise to the top in Whitehall. Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, said: 'The top mandarins in 30 years time will be more likely to have spent long periods outside the civil service or to have joined after a career elsewhere.' A second Efficiency Unit study published yesterday suggests a new role for the Civil Service Commissioners in monitoring Whitehall's recruitment procedures to ensure that they adhere to the principles of openness, fairness and merit. The study says the commissioners should lose their remaining responsibility for recruitment in favour of regulating departments which will take over all recruitment responsibilities.

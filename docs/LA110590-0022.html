			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN IS FATALLY SHOT AT SANTA ANITA; SUSPECT HELD  </P> <P> A man died Sunday, about an hour after he was shot five times by an  acquaintance on a crowded stairway at Santa Anita Park race track in Arcadia,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Santa Anita officials said it was believed to be the first shooting in the  55-year history of the track.  </P> <P> The victim, Henry Miller, 27, of Los Angeles, was pronounced dead at 4:23 p.m.  at Arcadia Methodist Hospital.  </P> <P> Patrick Patterson, 23, of Inglewood, was tackled near the gift shop after the  3:05 p.m. shooting by several race track security guards and at least two  spectators. He was being held by Arcadia police without bail on suspicion of  murder, authorities said. A .380-caliber Beretta semiautomatic pistol was  recovered, police said.  </P> <P> A witness, who asked that his name not be used, said that Miller and Patterson  were arguing on a first-floor grandstand stairway overlooking the pre-race  walking ring. Horses had left the area minutes earlier and were on the track  for the sixth race at the time.  </P> <P> Just before the shots rang out, Miller was heard shouting, "Shoot me, shoot  me," to Patterson, the witness said.  </P> <P> Police said a dispute between Miller and Patterson "had been simmering for  several months. The suspect had allegedly sought out the victim at Santa Anita  with the intention of confronting him."  </P> <P> The stairway where the shooting took place is a popular place for racing fans  to sit or stand. More than 30,000 people were at the track Sunday and the  stairs were jammed with spectators, authorities said.  </P> <P> Track security officer Evelyn Hartsfield said the two men argued before the  shots were fired.  </P> <P> "I turned my back, and that's when the shooting started," Hartsfield said. "I  think the one with the gun waited until I turned around before he started  firing."  </P> <P> "As close together as people get down there, it's a miracle no one else was  even hurt," Santa Anita racing steward Pete Pedersen said.  </P></p>

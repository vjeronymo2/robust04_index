			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["24 CHASA" staff report: "Athens Wants Kozloduy Nuclear </F> Power Plant Closed Down"]    [Text] Greece will make an official demand for Bulgaria to  shut down the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. This will happen at  an international conference that will seek the European Union's  blessing for the initiative, according to a statement made  yesterday by Kiriakos Domadzoglu [name as transliterated], a  member of the conference's organizing committee.    The conference will be held from 29 June to 3 July in the  town of Drama and will cost almost 9 million leva, at the  exchange rate fixed by the Bulgarian National Bank. The  sponsors include Siemens and Philips Greece.    The poster advertising the conference showed a boiler shaped  like Bulgaria that belched out smoke, turning the sun into a  black sphere.    The idea of holding the conference has reportedly received  support from the Greek Ministry of National Economy, the  Secretariat General of Makedonia-Thraki, and the councils of the  eight largest towns in the province.    Ecological movements in Greece have reportedly asked that  the  European Union close down the Bulgarian nuclear plant. The  conference will deliver an ultimatum to the cabinet in Athens to  raise the matter with the Berov government.    "Kozloduy is a potential threat to the Balkans," Mr.  Domadzoglu said, but admitted that he is not familiar with the  official report of the International Atomic Energy Agency on  Kozloduy, which is complimentary about the nuclear plant's  condition.    However, the Greeks are reported to be in a state of stress  over Kozloduy. At a meeting, a special group of Greek  parliamentarians is reported to have invited Bulgarian  Environment Minister Valentin Bosevski to support the  conference. However, our ecologists protested against the title  of the conference -- "International Conference on Kozloduy," so  there will be no official participants from Bulgaria.    Nevertheless, some Bulgarian scientists are said to have  responded to the invitations, and they will present three papers  in Drama. One of them, by Ivan Uzunov, a genetics professor, is  entitled "No Prospects Exist in Bulgaria for Nuclear Energy  Development."    "If Greece has rejected nuclear power plants," this does not  entitle it to make us follow their example, said Nikita  Shervashidze, chairman of the Committee on Power Supply. "In  the long run, we will teach them what kind of olive trees to  plant."</p>

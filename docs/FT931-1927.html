			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Observer: Healthy love-in Forget about cross-functional collaboration, corporate coherence and all other such modern management fashions. John Watkinson, chief executive of the King's Mill Hospital at Sutton in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, has a more down-to-earth way of uniting his staff. 'Love,' he writes in the foreword to the hospital's draft application for NHS trust status, 'is not a popular word to use in the work world these days. Some perhaps confuse the presence of love with an absence of management acumen. I know the two co-exist, because they are here together at the King's Mill Hospital.' And he goes on: 'We propose to frame the love and commitment of our staff in the disciplines and freedoms of NHS trust status for the benefit of Ashfield, Mansfield and our wider community.' Over to you Mrs Bottomley.</p>

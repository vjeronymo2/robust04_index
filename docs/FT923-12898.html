			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Cuomo hails the Comeback Kid' MR Mario Cuomo did Mr Bill Clinton proud last night. The governor of New York nominated the governor of Arkansas as Democratic candidate for president in a speech that wittily savaged President George Bush and evoked heroic qualities in Mr Clinton. Bill Clinton, Mr Cuomo said 'is the new captain who will change the course of the nation before it is too late'. President Bush, he said, was steering 'the ship of state for the rocks'. Referring to the Gulf war victory parade, he added: 'Step aside, Mr Bush, you've had your parade. It's time for a change - someone smart enough to know; strong enough to do; sure enough to lead. The Comeback Kid. A new voice for America.' Mr Clinton called himself the 'Comeback Kid' when he survived a series of scandals to place second in the New Hampshire primary last February. Bill Clinton, he went on to rapturous applause, understood the national need for jobs. President Bush's supply-side economics had perpetrated the 'greatest bank robbery' in the savings and loans scandal and 'we heard no moralising then from our Republican leaders then, did we?'. President Bush, he intoned, was always saying the country had 'the will but not the wallet'. Mr Clinton understood that 'we can always find the wealth for their quiet catastrophes', such as hunger, deprivation and lack of health care. Deriding Republicans as polo players without their mallets, Mr Cuomo said Mr Clinton 'was born and raised with all the attributes needed for leadership'. It was a vintage Cuomo performance, reminiscent of his speech for social justice at the San Francisco convention eight years ago. Recalling that address, he told the convention the party had failed to get its message across then. It could not afford to fail now. 'It is not a matter of our wanting Bill Clinton. It is more than that. We need Bill Clinton because he is our only hope for change from this nation's disastrous course,' he said. Mr Clinton could have asked no more from the man who once professed to dislike him.</p>

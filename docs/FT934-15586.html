			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Auditors turn cold as legal claims hot up: Record pay-outs have led to pressure to limit accountants' liability The rising tide of multi-million pound claims against auditors is 'enough to turn the blood cold', according to the senior partner of one large British firm. Last week's Dollars 110m (Pounds 73m) out of court settlement in Dublin ended what could have become a marathon legal action between Ernst &amp; Whinney, the accountants, and Allied Irish Banks. But the size of the pay-out is an uncomfortable reminder for accountants of the scale of the risks to which their profession is exposed. Increasingly, accountants are facing a steady rise in legal exposures, as creditors and investors in troubled and insolvent companies seek to recover losses. The Dublin case arose as a result of the failure of Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a small general insurance company acquired by Allied in 1983. Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp; Young, audited Insurance Corp's books between 1978 and 1983, a time when it was growing quickly. However, Insurance Corp set aside insufficient cash to meet future claims and in 1985 collapsed with losses of more than IPounds 80m (Pounds 76m). Allied, together with the company's administrators, Icarom, launched legal action, claiming Dollars 550m, alleging that E&amp;Y had not looked hard enough at Insurance Corp's operations. With accumulated interest the size of the claim could have exceeded IPounds 1bn. E&amp;Y did not admit liability and took comfort in the fact that the settlement was equal to only about 8 per cent of this. For E&amp;Y it follows hard on the heels of some big pay-outs in the US. Last November's Dollars 400m settlement with US federal savings and loan industry regulators, was the largest ever agreed by an accountancy firm. Ernst &amp; Whinney is also named - along with Price Waterhouse - on a Dollars 8bn claim, filed by the liquidators of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). Mr Lawrence A. Weinbach, managing partner-chief executive of the Arthur Andersen Worldwide Organisation, estimates that worldwide the industry faces Dollars 30bn of claims. This puts pressure on the arrangements through which the 'big six' insure themselves. The largest accountancy firms rely on both the conventional professional indemnity insurance market and the industry's own mutual insurers - Bermuda-based PALE and PADUA. Cover provided from these sources is understood to extend to more than Dollars 100m. But it is limited. And beyond a certain level the partners themselves - as the owners of the firms - are individually liable up to the total value of their assets. Premiums have risen steeply - by at least 300 per cent since 1985 - and insurers have increased the amount of each claim that they pay from their own resources. In 1992 the costs of fighting legal action for the 'big six' in the US amounted to Dollars 598m - or 11 per cent of their revenues. Insurance recoveries provided an additional Dollars 185m in resolving claims, says Mr Weinbach. Many smaller and medium-sized firms are also coming under fire. Mr Charles Cox, of CT Bowring, the insurance broker which provides a scheme for the smaller UK groups, says that each year one in five accountants notify their insurers about circumstances which might give rise to a claim. 'There has been a steady increase in notifications and a steady deterioration in claims.' Roughly half of all claims dealt with by Bowring are linked to tax disputes, but the number of audit claims now amounts to one in four of all claims. In the US, Mr Weinbach says the fear of legal action and potential financial ruin is leading to fewer accountants entering the profession and many younger accountants are refusing the offer of partnership. Over-exposure to litigation was a big factor in the 1990 bankruptcy of Laventhol Horwath, then the seventh-largest accounting firm in the US. Europe has yet to reach this pitch. Even so Mr Richard Murray, chief executive of Minet Global Professional Services, says claims here are rising at a faster rate than in any other part of the world. With many of the cases in the UK, the pressure for reforms to limit liabilities seems certain to grow. Accountants are seeking changes to the Companies Act which now bans auditors making contracts where liability with clients is limited. Mr John Magill, who is responsible for risk management at Touche Ross, said: 'There is concern that we can just be blown out of the water by some of these settlements.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD'S BIGGEST AWARDS AGAINST ACCOUNTANTS AND AUDITORS 1992-93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm against which    Plaintiff           Accountant's client award made  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Ernst &amp; Young       Federal Deposit     various savings &amp; loans banks                       Insurance Corp      of Tennessee and others 2 Ernst &amp; Young       Allied Irish        Insurance Corporation of                       Banks               Ireland 3 Coopers &amp; Lybrand   Bankruptcy          Miniscribe                       trustees 4 KPMG and Others     Investors           Wedtech 5 Ernst &amp; Young       Investors           American Continental Corp 6 Coopers &amp; Lybrand   Bondholders         Miniscribe 7 Peat Marwick &amp;      Shareholders/       Crazy Eddie Inc   Others              creditors 8 Arthur Andersen     Investors           Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Firm against which    Amount of award             Country award made            or settlement  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Ernst &amp; Young       dollars 400m                US 2 Ernst &amp; Young       dollars 111m                Ireland 3 Coopers &amp; Lybrand   dollars 95m*                US 4 KPMG and Others     dollars 77.5m               US 5 Ernst &amp; Young       dollars 63m                 US 6 Coopers &amp; Lybrand   dollars 45-dollars 50m*     US 7 Peat Marwick &amp;      dollars 42m                 US   Others creditors 8 Arthur Andersen     dollars 22m-dollars 30m     US  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Part of dollars 140-dollars 145m settlements by Coopers &amp; Lybrand in Miniscribe case Source: Lafferty Publications  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

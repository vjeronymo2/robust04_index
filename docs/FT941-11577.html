			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japan Air Lines pins its hopes on cutting costs - Michiyo Nakamoto looks at the latest medium-term restructuring plan from the struggling Japanese carrier In Tokyo's southern waterfront district of Tennozu Isle, construction began last autumn on a 25-storey building that will be the proud new offices of Japan Air Lines. The image of a bright future evoked by the new building, which is being built at a cost of Y43bn (Dollars 400m), contrasts sharply with the reality of the airline's financial predicament. The severity of JAL's difficulties was underlined by the announcement last month of a four-year restructuring programme - the second medium-term survival plan from JAL in just over a year. The latest plan aims to reduce costs even further than the previous one, to introduce measures to bring the airline's services more in line with changing customer needs, and to increase competitiveness both at home and abroad. JAL's misfortune is a familiar tale of declining revenues from lucrative first and business class travel, increased competition on international routes and fierce price discounting. While it has been seen as a slow-moving giant in the airline industry, unable to shed a bureaucratic corporate culture inherited from its days as a public company, JAL's problems are not entirely unique. Its Japanese competitors, ANA and Japan Air Systems, are also reeling under the effects of one of Japan's worst economic downturns since the second world war. The high cost structure which has severely damaged JAL's international competitiveness is a problem common to Japanese businesses with fixed costs in Japan, where property and service prices are notoriously high. The situation has been aggravated by the recent sharp appreciation of the yen against the US dollar. 'I see very little chance that JAL will be able to compete against south-east Asian carriers or indeed with US carriers at current exchange rates,' says Mr Paul Smith, industry analyst at James Capel. In the year to March 1993, the airline suffered a consolidated pre-tax loss of Y54.9bn on revenues of Y1,283.8bn and passed its dividend. JAL is more dependent on international travel than its domestic competitors and has been damaged more by price competition from foreign airlines. It also relies more heavily on customers being attracted to its prestige image at a time when the Japanese are basing decisions increasingly on value for money. But JAL's woes have also put into focus the way it has been managed. The company 'has not always been operated with a clarity of vision that one would expect from a private company,' says Mr Smith. Over the past several years, for example, JAL invested heavily in aircraft on the assumption that business would continue to expand as strongly as it had during the years of asset inflation. When the extra demand failed to materialise, aircraft had to be stored in the US. JAL was also caught in forward dollar rates agreements which it made on the recommendation of its bankers. After the 1985 Plaza Agreement, JAL hedged up to a third of its planned aircraft purchase needs for a period of 11 years in forward rates. Since then the dollar's value against the yen has fallen dramatically, leaving JAL committed to buy expensive dollars, although the company will not reveal at what rate it must buy. The airline's management of its subsidiaries has also come in for criticism by unions. One cited 6 the purchase by a subsidiary of Essex House, a luxury hotel in New York. Having bought it for Dollars 170m, the company was then obliged to pump in at least another Dollars 100m to renovate the hotel. While JAL agrees that this was somewhat more than budgeted, its subsidiary 'has a gorgeous hotel in New York now,' an official says. If JAL is to reduce its workforce dramatically, bring in a larger number of non-Japanese staff to cut wage costs and become a lean and mean operation that can generate higher revenues, it needs the co-operation of its unions. Even if its plan does manage to clear the unions, management could face criticism if JAL fails to see the pick-up in revenues it desperately needs. Market conditions so far this year have been worse than JAL had banked on at the beginning of the fiscal year, with international passenger revenues down 13 per cent at mid-year and domestic traffic revenues down 3 per cent. Hopes that its cost-cutting moves and a pick-up in demand would allow it to break even this year, return to profitability next year and resume dividends by the year to March 1996 are already beginning to look optimistic. 'The industry is highly leveraged and if there is a pick-up in passenger revenues the company could see a strong turnround,' notes Mr Smith. Given the continuing depressed state of the Japanese economy, however, JAL's latest medium-term plan may not yet be the last plan for survival to come from the airline.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Spark goes out of the world-beaters: Japan's consumer electronics groups are being forced to adapt Japan's consumer electronics manufacturers have achieved a position of enviable dominance in their industry, after two decades of spectacular growth. Their ability to continue that growth, however, is now in doubt for the first time since Japanese TV sets and stereos began finding their way into homes throughout the world in the 1970s. Companies such as Matsushita and Sony are finding that manufacturing electronics equipment is no longer as profitable as it used to be, and are moving into entertainment and information services, which appear to offer better prospects. But the Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers have yet to prove that they can build more profitable businesses in these new markets. Japanese manufacturers' profits on consumer electronics have been squeezed from three directions: sluggish demand, particularly in the home market; falling prices; and the yen's sharp appreciation. Nearly every Japanese household now owns a colour TV set, and 73 per cent a video cassette recorder. Demand is therefore weak for traditional money-spinners such as these. New products such as wide-screen TV are not attracting the kind of consumer interest needed to compensate. 'There are many new, exciting products, but they are not contributing to profits much because the scale of them is so small,' says Mr Nobuyuki Idei, managing director of Sony. Japan's consumer electronics market has also suffered from fierce competition and from the growing availability of cheap products made in low-cost countries, primarily in south-east Asia. 'Audio products the world over have become really cheap,' laments Mr Yoichi Morishita, president of Matsushita. Price-cutting has become rife as retailers struggle for business, and cheap TVs and VCRs flood in from Taiwan and Korea. 'It is no longer an industry in which it is easy to justify high prices,' asserts Mr Koichiro Chiwata, industry analyst at Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank. To add to the woes of the Japanese manufacturers, the yen's sharp appreciation has eaten into their overseas profits. The strength of the yen reduced Sony's revenues by more than Y500bn (Pounds 3.2bn) last year, according to the company. The yen's contin-uing appreciation this year will further depress manu-facturers' revenues. These pressures have had devastating results on the financial performance of the consumer electronics makers. Sony's operating profits dwindled to Y99.7bn for the year to March 1994, less than one-third the Y302.2bn it made in 1991. Its operating profit to sales ratio was 2.7 per cent last year against 10 per cent in 1990. Matsushita's operating profits shrank to Y173.6bn last year, from Y472.6bn in 1991. Its operating profits were 2.6 per cent of revenues, down from 7.5 per cent in 1990. The company expects a 33 per cent rise in ordinary profits for the current year to Y85bn, helped by rationalisation measures. But the result will still be less than a third of Matsushita's 1990 profits of Y277bn. Despite the deterioration in the consumer electronics business environment, the companies are obliged to continue pumping large sums into research and development. Both Sony and Matsushita spent about as much on R&amp;D in the last fiscal year as they did in 1991, when operating profits were between 2 1/2 and three times higher. R&amp;D costs are likely to rise further. With manufacturing costs that are among the highest in the world, Japan can no longer rely on 'people-dependent assembly' but must shift to a 'technology- and knowledge-intensive production system', according to Mr Haruo Tsuji, president of consumer electronics group Sharp. 'For that, R&amp;D is crucial,' he says. Such efforts have given Japanese companies technological superiority in making parts of the new generation of multimedia electronics equipment, which will deliver a wide range of entertainment and information services to business and consumers. Sharp dominates the market for liquid crystal display panels used in portable products, such as personal organisers. JVC is a leader in the digital compression technology that squeezes information - from sound and data to video - down the telephone line or on to digital discs, such as CDs. Japanese electronics makers, such as Sony, also dominate the market for recording media such as CD-Roms, the portable discs that are used to store computer data, and the drives that run the discs. But as more and more information becomes available to consumers at home, equipment such as CD-Roms which receive the information is expected to become less important - and less profitable - than the services that feed into it. This can already be seen with products such as personal computers and cellular telephones, where the most profitable businesses are in providing the software or telephone networks, rather than making the hardware. 'It is the owners of the networks who will be the main beneficiaries of the multimedia age, followed by those who provide the services,' says Sony's Mr Idei. He believes that the consumer electronics companies will gradually become such service providers over the next 20 years. The recognition that providing multimedia services such as video-on-demand and interactive games offers a more attractive source of profits than making the hardware has led both Sony and Matsushita to invest recently in cable TV and satellite broadcasting. Sony has invested in a Japanese satellite broadcasting company and Y600m in Tokyo's sixth TV station. It has also taken a 25 per cent stake in a Latin American cable TV operator. Matsushita has interests in 30 cable TV companies and has built up a computer data and network service in Japan. The consumer electronics companies have also been acquiring businesses that will supply the programmes and entertainment services for these networks. Control over software, the argument goes, will ensure support for new hardware systems and the distribution systems. Sony, for example, says that it would have been hard to sell its new MiniDisc portable audio products without being able, through its ownership of CBS records, to ensure that recordings were available to play on them. It was this view that prompted the larger Japanese electronics companies to march into Hollywood during the 1980s and acquire famous US film studios and their valuable stock of films and television programmes. Sony bought Columbia Pictures as well as CBS Records, while Matsushita bought MCA, the entertainment group. The move has yet to pay off: most Japanese investments in Hollywood have brought more headaches than profits. Matsushita has recently been publicly embarrassed by de-mands from MCA executives to cede management control of its entertainment subsidiary, which it believes is crucial for its future in multimedia. Sony is believed to have suffered a substantial loss last year from Columbia Pictures. The studio has remained in the doldrums this year, with few hit pictures - prompting the departure of its head. And Pioneer has had to make successive capital injections into Carolco Pictures, its US film subsidiary. . For the Japanese equipment makers, steeped in a culture of consensus-building and long-term decision-making, management of the spiralling costs, big egos and short-term thinking that characterises Hollywood studios has proved more difficult than they imagined. Despite these setbacks, most Japanese consumer electronics companies see little choice but to hold on to their entertainment assets. 'As software becomes more important, we cannot remain hardware makers alone,' emphasises Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita. The advent of multimedia and the stagnation in traditional manufacturing activities appear to leave Japan's consumer electronics with little choice but to move deeper into the unfamiliar world of entertainment media. As they do so, their best hope will be that the rewards they reap finally live up to the greater challenges they now face.</p>

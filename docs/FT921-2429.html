			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (33): After privatisation comes intense competition - Seeboard integrates its data resources SEEBOARD, the UK's South Eastern Electricity Board, is now free to compete for national business. It was this change that triggered off the the need for a co-ordinated sales and marketing policy in energy marketing. 'The problem was that we had a variety of in-house systems, on different machines, everything from mainframes to old standalone PCs,' explains energy marketing and sales manager Robin Brown. In all, there were five different databases catering for different market sectors, and the data they produced was not interchangeable. Seeboard, whose turnover exceeds Pounds 1bn, had decided to focus on 'concept selling,' but for this it needed to focus its data resources, and take a close look at how valuable its data really was. It was also vital to have a system which would allow integrated applications - for other areas such as staff management and project management. In this respect, the constraint was Seeboard's existing systems, which included a central IBM mainframe 9000. 'We didn't want to paint ourselves into a corner, so we started looking at Oracle because of its multi-platform support,' says Mr Brown. Buying Oracle  -in this case for use on an IBM Unix system, the RS/6000, was in line with company policy on using 'open' systems for departmental needs. (See Oracle profile, page 24). The sales and marketing effort could stay in line with the corporate mainframe system, (used for high-volume processing), while pursuing its own departmental business on a smaller machine running the same software, under a different, 'open' operating system, Unix. The entire system software and hardware, cost in the region of Pounds 250,000 initially. After building a 'quick and easy' prototype, the sales and marketing staff had a clear idea of what they needed, and it was something more comprehensive, with full reporting facilities. At this point, Shamrock Marketing was able to help with its marketing system (covered in Software At Work, issue 3, Autumn 1991). The system, which is Oracle-based and costs around Pounds 9,950, was developed in conjunction with Seeboard to its industry-specific requirements. There are around two million addresses in Seeboard's database for its own region, but this was not the best source of information for the more focused sales effort. Mr Brown and his colleagues recognised early on that the real decision makers were consultants, architects, surveyors, and electricians - not necessarily the consumers. Certainly, the address alone could not reveal whether the addressee was a real prospect or not, and the long process of refining data began. 'Once you've got the database, populating it with valid data is the real problem,' explains Robin Brown. 'It was a matter of changing the focus of the data and the way users look at it. One can spend hours agonising over the choice of hardware and product, but the real costs are hidden, in staff training and briefing, and checking the accuracy of the data.' Although the efforts have not yet borne fruit, Brown is confident that the business benefits will include tighter and more accurate control of staff and sales activities. Direct access to the mainframe data, through SQL, has already been a boon, with new users able to create meaningful reports within an hour or two of first sitting down at the computer. 'We are getting away from junk mail - no longer sending out 6,000 mailings for a handful of leads. We have found out who our customers really are.'

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--Jordan Wednesday [2 February] said Iraq would  continue to rely heavily on the Red Sea port of al-'Aqabah after  sanctions end because its own ports could not handle the demand.    "Iraq's dependence on the port of al-'Aqabah in the event of  the lifting of sanctions will be primary because neither their  port of Umm Qasr nor even Mersin Port would be enough to handle  all their goods," Jordan's Transport Minister Adib Halasah told  Reuters.    Jordanian concerns rose last November when Iraq began  importing through Umm Qasr and said whenever possible it would  directly import U.N.-permitted goods--mostly food and medicine.    "Whatever the size of Umm Qasr, and it's a large port, the  anticipated rise in Iraq's import needs would make them need not  just al-'Aqabah but other ports," said the minister.    Mr. Halasah said use of Umm Qasr, Iraq's only port, would  not  affect al-'Aqabah as "it would continue to be more economical  for Iraq to import its European cargo through it." Umm Qasr  would be used mainly for imports from the Far East.    He expected activity in al-'Aqabah to surge when sanctions  end. Less than 100 trailers travel the al-'Aqabah-Baghdad route  daily against 400 before the Gulf crisis.    Mr. Halasah said upgrading and modernisation of al='Aqabah  was underway to handle "the expected large volume of demand."    Sanctions were imposed because of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait  in 1990. Al-'Aqabah has also suffered from the U.N. inspection  of al-'Aqabah-bound ships for goods that could violate the  sanctions.    Port activity has fallen from pre-Gulf war level peaks of 20  million tonnes annually to around 13 million tonnes in 1993.    In an indication of confidence, Mr. Halasah said the  Iraq-Jordan Land Transport Company decided in Baghdad last week  to buy 100 Renault trucks to modernise its 420 trailer fleet.    The firm, set up in 1981 as a 50-50 joint venture between  the  two states, is registered as a Jordanian company and is not  subject to aspects of the U.N. embargo imposed on Iraq.</p>

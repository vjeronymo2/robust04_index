			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 16 KYODO -- The top opposition Liberal  Democratic Party vowed Wednesday [16 February] to press Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii to account on the Diet floor for his  alleged acceptance of a 10 million yen donation from an industry  body under his jurisdiction.    "Suspicions (on this issue) are extremely serious from the  standpoint of the public," said Sadatoshi Ozato, chairman of the  Liberal Democratic Party's Diet Affairs Committee at a news  conference in the Diet building.    Ozato was speaking about the donation allegedly received  last  August by two of Fujii's officially registered political fund-  raising organizations from the Enyu-kai, an industry association  of salt wholesalers.    The Enyu-kai is affiliated with the Association of Salt  Dealers Cooperatives, to which Fujii had served as a long-time  adviser.    Fujii, now a House of Representatives member of Shinseito,  was an LDP legislator until last June, when he and dozens of  other LDP lawmakers bolted from the scandal-marred LDP to form  Shinseito.    Ozato expressed the LDP's readiness to bring up the fact  that  Fujii returned the money a day after the YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the  nation's leading daily, reported the industry group made the  donation to congratulate him on assuming the post of finance  minister last August.    Japan's law on political funding bars a politician from  accepting a donation of more than 1.5 million yen a year from a  single source.    Shinseito secured a huge electoral success and came under  the  national spotlight at the 1993 general election by concentrating  on the theme of cleaning up the Japanese political system.</p>

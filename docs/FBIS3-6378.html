DLP Deputy Secretary-general Cho Pu-yong met with the deputy  head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese  Communist Party, Zhu Shanqing, on Thursday here to discuss  expanding cooperation and exchanges. At the working-level  meeting, the two sides agreed that the DLP will send a five- to  seven-member mission led by Secretary-general Mun to China as  early as April.    But DLP Chairman Kim's visit to Beijing, which was scheduled  for the first half of the year, has been postponed to the second  half because President Kim Yong-sam will go to China soon.    In return for Mun's visit to China, Beijing will send a  high-level delegation to Seoul headed by a party Politburo  member or cabinet minister.</p>

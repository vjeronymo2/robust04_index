			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  BRAWL ERUPTS OVER GIRL'S POPULARITY  </P> <P> Police said a dispute over a pretty girl's popularity erupted into a brawl  involving more than a dozen teen-age girls, leaving five injured.  </P> <P> Two girls were in stable condition at San Gabriel Valley Medical Center  recovering from stabbings with an unknown weapon, said Pat Inbody, director of  public relations. One was wounded in the abdomen and buttocks, the other in the  chest.  </P> <P> The dispute began Thursday when one student challenged another to fight because  of her beauty and popularity with boys at San Gabriel Valley High School, Lt.  James Gardner said.  </P> <P> "This is probably the result of a cat fight," Gardner said. "Usually it's a  hair-pulling, name-calling kind of thing and nobody gets hurt."  </P> <P> "This time, some girls got hurt, and that's the sad thing."  </P> <P> The attractive girl brought her friends to Vincent Lugo Park sometime after  noon Thursday to call a truce but instead the rumble ensued. In all, about 12  to 15 Asian girls, ages 14 and 15, were involved, Gardner said.  </P> <P> The girls were not identified. Besides the two who were hospitalized, three  others were treated for minor injuries and then released from the hospital,  Inbody said.  </P></p>

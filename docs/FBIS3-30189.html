In 1993 alone nearly 50 projects were licensed with a total  capital of more than USD 700 million, accounting for a half of  the total amount of foreign capital invested in projects in the  capital city.    Different from previous years when foreigners focused on  tourism service, one-third of the 1993 capital was invested in  industrial production. Prominent among these projects are the  Oriow-Hanel picture tube plant (a joint venture with S. Korea)  which has a prescribed capital of USD 170.5 million and the  (?Dkhha) Business Centre (a joint venture with South Korea), USD  64 million.    Leading the 24 foreign investors in Hanoi is South Korea  which has invested in six projects with a total capital of USD  43.8 million France, nine projects and USD 132,782,377 followed  by Taiwan, and Singapore. Of these foreign-invested projects,  totally or partly funded by foreigners, a large number are  operational, while some are still under construction. Vietnam by  collaborating with foreign partners in the past six years, has  gained a work force which is now accustomed to modern industrial  and management style. A number of managers have learnt both  foreign languages and business administration. Also, joint  ventures have created jobs for Vietnamese, contributing to  efforts to reduce unemployment in the capital city.    Some joint ventures have brought about evident  socio-economuc  effects and made considerable profits. They are the  Thai-Vietnamese joint venture to produce adhesive bands for  women, the Vietnamese-Danish joint venture to brew Carlsberg  beer, and so on.    Foreign investors are now inclined to invest in the north,  Hanoi in particular. To encourage this inclination, the  Vietnamese Government, besides simplifying the procedure for  issuing licences, [words indistinct] upgrade the Noi Bai  International Airport, the highway no. 5 that links Hanoi and  the port city of Haiphong, and the Haiphong harbour.</p>

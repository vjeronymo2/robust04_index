			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. The Commission also required GTE to comply with the nondiscrimination reporting requirements applicable to the BOCs. In particular, GTE must file an annual affidavit stating that it does not discriminate in providing ONA services to competitive ESPs and their customers, including the installation, maintenance, and quality of such services. The annual affidavit must be signed by the officer principally responsible for ONA service quality, installation, and maintenance. GTE is also required to file quarterly installation and maintenance reports using the reporting categories adopted for BOC reports unless GTE proposes and the Commission approves a different format for its quarterly report in GTE's ONA plan. GTE's initial installation and maintenance report is to cover the first full calendar quarter following the implementation date for ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards and thereafter must be filed quarterly. The report for each calendar quarter is due thirty days after the close of that calendar quarter. GTE's format should be consistent with the installation and maintenance system reports required of the BOCs and described in the BOC ONA Reconsideration Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GTE may, however, attempt to justify different service categories at a comparable level of detail. The Commission delegated authority to the Chief, Common Carrier Bureau to review and to act on any requested changes to the reporting categories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Commission concluded that the experience it has gained from its lengthy review of the BOCs' initial ONA plans and tariffs, as well as from the implementation of approved BOC ONA service offerings, will enable it to streamline the review of GTE's initial ONA service offerings. GTE shall submit an ONA plan within nine months of the release of this Order and shall file state and federal ONA tariffs for its ONA services within one year of the release of this order. The Commission required that GTE implement all ONA requirements and nondiscrimination safeguards fifteen months after the release of this order unless another time period is specified in the order. These requirements include those that have been developed in the Computer III and Computer III remand proceedings and the ONA orders, as well as any future requirements that the Commission may establish for the BOCs, unless GTE is specifically exempted. The tariffs will be subject to the requirements established in the ONA proceeding and the federal tariffs will also be subject to the pricing and other requirements of CC Docket No. 89&hyph;79, relating to the creation of access charge subelements and cost support requirements for ONA. GTE must amend its initial federal ONA tariff to include any additional requirements that are adopted so close to the GTE tariff filing date that they cannot be reflected in the initial tariff filing as soon as possible during the three month public notice period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Commission described filing dates in this order as being a certain number of months after a particular event. In such cases the filing or other such date will be the same day of the month as the triggering event, but the specified number of months later. Months shall be counted beginning with the month after the one in which the triggering event occurs. Filing dates falling on a weekend or official federal government holiday will be moved to the next business day. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Finally, the Commission adopted the same preemption of state network disclosure requirements for GTE that was established for the BOCs in the BOC Safeguards Order. The Commission determined that no other modification to the preemption of state requirements adopted in the BOC Safeguards Order was warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Ordering Clauses <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 18.

			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> PAIR REGAIN SOVIET CITIZENSHIP  </P> <P> Cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and his wife, opera singer Galina  Vishnevskaya, have had their Soviet citizenship restored to them 12 years after  the government took it away, Tass said today.  </P> <P> The Soviet legislature gave them back their citizenship and nullified the  decree that had stripped them of their medals and honorary titles, the official  news agency said.  </P> <P> Rostropovich, 62, gained international renown with the Moscow Philharmonic  Orchestra, but in the early 1970s he incurred the Soviet government's disfavor  by giving refuge to dissident author Alexander Solzhenitsyn. He left the Soviet  Union with his family and was stripped of his citizenship in 1978.  </P> <P> He has since become a household name in the West. Queen Elizabeth II conferred  a knighthood on him in 1987 on his 60th birthday.  </P> <P> Several other prominent Soviet cultural figures who lost their citizenship  under past regimes have had it restored in recent months amid the cultural thaw  that prevails under Mikhail S. Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Solzhenitsyn is a notable exception; Soviet officials say they have not  received any application from him to have his citizenship restored.  </P></p>

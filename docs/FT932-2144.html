			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: Gerresheimer issues operating loss warning GERRESHEIMER, the German glass manufacturer, is heading for an operating loss this year after a 'sharply negative' result in the first half, Mr Gunther Berger, chairman, said yesterday, writes Christopher Parkes. The company, which cut its 1992 dividend to DM5 from DM11 the year before after net earnings fell two thirds to DM31m (Dollars 19m), has closed two works so far this year. Provisions had already been made to cover the costs of a further closure planned for later this year, Mr Berger told the annual meeting. Turnover in the first six months, affected by recession and the closure of two glass plants last autumn, fell 8 per cent to DM691m, he said.</p>

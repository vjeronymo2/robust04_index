			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: SAS considers non-core sales Scandinavian Airline Systems (SAS) is considering the sale of all its non-core operations as it reorganises following the collapse of the Alcazar joint airline project and seeks to stem heavy losses. 'We will concentrate on our flight operations and sell our other operations,' Mr Jan Reinas, chief executive, said in a newspaper interview published yesterday. 'In principle, everything that is not directly connected to flight operations is on our potential sale list. Some sales are in the final phase.' He did not specify which. The main non-core SAS operations include eight hotels, the Nordic operation of Diners Club credit cards and part of SAS Service partner, a catering unit previously wholly owned by the airline. Mr Reinas said SAS would seek to strengthen its existing links with British Midland Airways, Swissair and Austrian Airlines. The company is to raise its holding in British Holdings, British Midland's parent, to 40 per cent from 35 per cent next July. The chief executive said that 'time will tell' if SAS would at some stage acquire all of British Midland but SAS officials said he did not mean to imply any foreseeable intention to do so. Mr Reinas said the SAS was studying whether its structure, grouping Swedish, Danish and Norwegian-owned companies, could be reduced to a more efficient single structure.</p>

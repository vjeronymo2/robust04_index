			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. N. Kotlyarov, UDC 621.396.61:621.375.026] </F>   [Abstract] Methods for optimizing the energy parameters of  nonlinear models of electronic power amplifiers with a  nonresonant random load are discussed. These amplifiers are used  to construct final stage broadband short-wave radio  transmitters. The approach considered here may be used to  calculate possible energy characteristics of various types of  broadband power amplifiers with a prescribed load, for which the  influence of harmonic components of the output signal spectrum  must not be disregarded.

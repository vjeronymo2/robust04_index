			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Democratic Alliance leader </F> Ferdinando Adornato by Goffredo De Marchis in Rome; date not  given: "The Leader for the Left Is Spaventa -- Adornato:  Occhetto or Orlando? No Way! If He Beats Berlusconi He Will Be  Prime Minister" -- first paragraph is IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] "In the Rome 1 constituency the challenge is a  political one, although it also has a symbolic value. The  winner in the fight between [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and  [progressive candidate] Spaventa will be the next prime  minister." Adornato has chosen a different horse now, albeit  from the same stable. Democratic Alliance [AD] is no longer  backing Carlo Azeglio Ciampi to head the government and has  chosen Budget Minister Luigi Spaventa as the new leader of the  united (so to speak) Left. [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS)  Secretary] Achille Occhetto and [Rete Secretary] Leoluca Orlando  may as well stay home, in other words in Via delle Botteghe  Oscure [PDS headquarters] and Palazzo delle Aquile [Palermo's  town hall]. Ferdinando Adornato, a journalist on REPUBBLICA and  L'ESPRESSO and the AD's candidate in a safe constituency in  Umbria, wants to be the one to choose the head of the  progressives.    [De Marchis] So, who is the leader of the Left?    [Adornato] Spaventa, Spaventa.    [De Marchis] Another left-wing liberal: Whatever will the  neocommunists have to say about that? They maintain that you  want a constituent government as a favor to your political  godfather, [Pact for Italy leader] Segni.    [Adornato] I reject the idea of a constituent government out  of hand. After the election there must be only two potential  scenarios: Either a right-wing government with Berlusconi as  prime minister or a left-wing government continuing the line  pursued by the Ciampi government.    [De Marchis] And if the numbers are insufficient, it will  mean another election, as Berlusconi proposes. Right?    [Adornato] Let us see what results the election brings  before  we say so. However, I take pleasure in reminding the Italians  that, for the first time ever, they have the chance to choose  the government directly.    [De Marchis] Then let us name the team. Do you already have  some ministers in mind for the left-wing government?    [Adornato] At least four or five members of the Ciampi  government should be reappointed, and let us not forget that we  want to set up some new ministries. One for culture, for  example.    [De Marchis] Berlusconi says that if you get into Palazzo  Chigi [government seat], you will turn the country "into one big  USL [local health unit]."    [Adornato] Slogan for slogan, I might retort that if he gets  there he will turn the country into a drive-in.    [De Marchis] And if we leave the gibes aside?    [Adornato] The truth of the matter is that, thank God, none  of the forces running in this election is fighting a statist  platform. The USL's are the great metaphor for a deal between  state-subsidized businesses and citizens involved in a  back-scratching system. And Berlusconi was part of that system.  And how!    [De Marchis] So what is your recipe for reconciling the  market and the welfare state?    [Adornato] We must retain welfare mechanisms, not based on  back scratching, for the weakest members of society;  modernization must take account of the most vulnerable. To cite  some examples, we must go for computerization ...    [De Marchis] Aha! That is a somewhat suspect point. You  work for publishing companies controlled by Carlo De Benedetti,  head of Olivetti.    [Adornato] But I want to favor no one.    [De Marchis] Sure?    [Adornato] I am sure. I did not like the deal between  Olivetti and the unions...    [De Marchis] Le us move on.    [Adornato] We must improve relations between the education  system and research, promote the tourist industry, and make the  most of our cultural heritage, creating new jobs.    [De Marchis] Let us change the subject. A lot of  ex-Socialists have found shelter in AD: Benvenuto, Cazzola, and  Ruffolo, for instance. The UIL [Italian Federation of Trade  Unions] is looking more and more like Democratic Alliance's  battleship. Where is renewal to be found? Do these cumbersome  facts not create discontent?    [Adornato] Ninety percent of our candidates have no previous  experience in politics. However, I personally am no Jacobin as  far as those who were in politics before are concerned. I do  not ask, "where have you come from?" but, "where are you going?"    [De Marchis] Talking of where you are going, what will  happen  to Adornato if AD fails to make it across the 4 percent  threshold?    [Adornato] It will merely mean that we shall pursue our  goals  in more difficult conditions.    [De Marchis] Perhaps it might have been better not to run in  the proportional representation section?    [Adornato] It might have been an idea, but we decided to  give  it a try.    [De Marchis] And if it does not work out, will you be  keeping  your head down?    [Adornato] No. In the long run, ours will be the winning  platform. In any case, even now ours is the only true alliance  fighting this election.</p>

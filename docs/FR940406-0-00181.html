			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Section 177 States <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``Section 177 States'' refers to states which voluntarily adopt the more stringent California emissions standards. At this time, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, and other Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states have either passed legislation to adopt the California emissions standards during the mid-1990s, or are considering enacting such legislation. However, there are ongoing legal challenges to adoption of the California emissions standards. NHTSA has not received any data showing any impact on MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy capabilities as a result of states other than California adopting the California emissions standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Fuels or Fuel Additives Such as Reformulated Gasoline and MMT <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has not proposed any changes in the current certification test fuel, so NHTSA does not expect any fuel economy impact for MYs 1996&hyph;97 light trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA has not made any adjustments to the manufacturers' CAFE projections to account for any impacts of changing emissions standards during MYs 1996&hyph;97. The agency notes that Ford appears to be the only manufacturer that explicitly included a potential fuel economy loss (an average of 0.3 mpg) in its MYs 1996&hyph;97 CAFE projection. Since Ford is not the ``least capable'' manufacturer and NHTSA is not basing the selection of the MYs 1996&hyph;97 light truck CAFE standard primarily on Ford's capability, it is unnecessary to resolve whether Ford's capability should be adjusted upward because of Ford's inclusion of this estimated fuel economy loss in its projection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Test Weight for Light Trucks Over 6,000 Pounds GVWR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CAAA require that, beginning with MY 1996, many light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be tested, for emissions purposes, at the average of curb weight and GVWR. This requirement applies to one-half the ``over 6,000 pound'' fleet in MY 1996 and all of this fleet in MY 1997. Previously, test weights were determined based on ``loaded vehicle weight,'' (LVW) which is defined as curb weight plus 300 pounds. Loaded vehicle weight has been the sole basis used to calculate ``equivalent test weight,'' which is the weight used for dynamometer testing. EPA has defined the average of vehicle curb weight and GVWR to be ``adjusted loaded vehicle weight'' (ALVW) (see 56 FR 25739), which will be used as the basis for determining equivalent test weight for emission testing of the ``over 6,000 pound'' test fleet described above. ALVW is higher than the LVW, and if light trucks are tested at ALVW, there will be a loss in the estimated fuel economy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CAAA do not require fuel economy testing to be performed at ALVW. However, because exhaust emissions testing must be done at ALVW for light trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR, use of a different test weight system for fuel economy could require manufacturers and EPA (when conducting confirmatory tests) to test each of these trucks twice: once at its ``equivalent test weight'' based on LVW for fuel economy purposes and once based on ALVW for exhaust emissions purposes. Another approach would be for EPA to mandate that trucks over 6,000 pounds GVWR be fuel economy tested at ALVW and for NHTSA to consider any resulting deleterious fuel economy effect in establishing CAFE standards for the affected model years. A third approach would be to have a manufacturer-specific test procedure adjustment to account for the proportion of its fleet affected by this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Domestic auto manufacturers have pointed out that testing at the higher weights would have a negative fuel economy impact. Using MY 1992 data, GM claimed a potential impact in MY 1997 of at least 0.5 mpg. Ford estimated a possible loss in MY 1997 of 0.2&hyph;0.3 mpg. Chrysler did not give a specific number but agreed that fuel economy would be lowered. Import manufacturers are unlikely to have any significant penalty from this test procedure change because they produce few, if any, light trucks with a GVWR exceeding 6,000 pounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a letter dated February 18, 1992, EPA stated that NHTSA should set CAFE standards with the heavier test weight in mind and stated that dual testing would entail increased expenses. EPA also noted that EPCA requires integrated fuel economy and emissions testing, although this requirement is limited by the language ``to the extent practicable.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the EPA letter was sent, MVMA (now AAMA) indicated to EPA that requiring the heavier test weight would also increase testing expenses, by forcing separate fuel economy tests for light trucks above and below 6,000 pounds GVWR. In addition, MVMA raised concerns that changing the basis for determining fuel economy on only a portion of the light truck fleet (i.e., those above 6,000 pounds GVWR) would cause consumer confusion and affect the competitiveness of manufacturers with a higher proportion of the sales of the heavier light trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the NPRM, NHTSA requested comments on the appropriate means of handling this issue in the context of setting the MY 1995&hyph;97 light truck fuel economy standards. The agency stated that if EPA mandates fuel economy testing at ALVW, NHTSA would account for the impacts of this testing in establishing light truck fuel economy standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In January 7, 1993 letters to AAMA and AIAM, EPA stated,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers should be aware of the NHTSA proposed rule on light truck average fuel economy standards *&blank;*&blank;* Included in the proposal is a request for comments on the consequences of performing fuel economy testing for heavy light-duty trucks under two different equivalent test weight approaches. The EPA will consider all relevant comments made during the NHTSA proposal comment period when developing an EPA guidance document or rulemaking on this subject.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> *&blank;*&blank;* The EPA plans to defer to NHTSA's policy decisions on issues such as the competitiveness effects of the alternatives. Once NHTSA determines the desirable CAFE solution and puts it into place, the EPA will follow with conforming amendments to either its regulations or policy as required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In commenting on the NPRM, GM, Ford, Chrysler, AAMA and Rover Group all supported the continuation of fuel economy testing at LVW. AAMA's comment was typical, ``Retention of the LVW criteria will avoid needless test and CAFE data base complexities, avoid added customer confusion when comparing fuel economy labels and avoid creation of unrealistic competitive fuel economy rating differences.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

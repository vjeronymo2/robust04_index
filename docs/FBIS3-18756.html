PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan] leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered his  organization to turn the region into a hell on the eve of the  elections.    The Turkish Armed Forces are sending an additional 50,000  troops in view of the approaching Nevruz and local elections.    [Begin Fatih Yilmaz recording] According to available  information, Ocalan ordered high-ranking PKK leaders to escalate  terrorist activities in southeastern Anatolia before 21 March.  Ocalan also called on the organizations' militants to organize  Nevruz celebrations on 21 March in the form of a popular  uprising. Ocalan, the leader of the separatist terror  organization, had made a similar call before the Nevruz  celebrations in 1992. That time, 103 people died in the ensuing  incidents.    The PKK has also called for the boycott of the local  elections to be held a week after the Nevruz celebrations.    A series of new security measures are being taken in the  region to ensure that Nevruz and the local elections are held  without any incident. In this framework, 50,000 additional  troops are being sent to southeastern Anatolia. With this, the  number of troops deployed in the region will reach 150,000. To  start with, units from the Bolu and Kayseri commando schools  have already been sent there. The 65th Infantry Division  stationed in Marmara region also left for the region. The A and  B teams of the Special Forces Command will also be sent to the  region to ensure border and road security. There is also a plan  to send a F-16 squadron to Diyarbakir. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xuzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- Xuzhou in east China's  Jiangsu province used to be contested by all strategists due to  military purposes, but today it has assumed new importance in  line with its strategic position -- it has now become a key  goods distributing center of coal, iron and steel, oil,  machinery, durables and daily necessities.    Early at dawn, the city is thronged with business people and  motor vehicles carrying fresh vegetables and other commodities  from almost all parts of the country to sell goods or purchase  what they need.    A survey shows that the transaction volume of vegetables  alone in Xuzhou tops 300,000 kilograms a day.    "Xuzhou's business is so developed that people from all  corners of the country wish to dig into it for profits," said  Huang Yuannan, a businessman from east China's Zhejiang Province  who is operating a stall of decorations at the Xuanwu small  commodities market.    He disclosed that his fellow natives have booked some 500  stalls at the market.    Jiang Qijun, a businessman from Harbin, capital of northeast  China's Heilongjiang Province, has made big profits by  operating a furniture shop and engaging in furniture-making in  the Kaiming market. The 30-year-old man now has fixed assets  worth several hundred thousand yuan.    Both Jiang and Xu are typical examples of 10,000 business  people from other parts of the country who open shops in Xuzhou.    In the afternoon and evening, Xuzhou's five major state  department stores are the best places for visitors and shoppers.    These splendid stores are a feast for the eyes and shop  assistants with smiling faces are always ready to offer a  helping hand.    Xuzhou is located in the area where Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan  and Anhui Provinces meet, and at the bank of the ancient  Beijing-Hangzhou grand canal, where the Lianyungang-Lanzhou and  Beijing- Shanghai railways meet.    Known as a "museum of war," the city has experienced more  than 200 battles in history.    "It was its geographical location provided with convenient  transport facilities that has enabled the city to develop into a  business center," said Yu Xianrong, director of the Xuzhou  Bureau of Commerce.    According to Xu Jiping, director of the Xuzhou City  Administration for Industry and Commerce, Xuzhou has set up 437  markets of farm produce, trade businesses, small commodities,  industrial products and production factors, with an annual  transaction volume totalling 12.5 billion yuan.    "These markets are paving the way for the city to further  boost the market economy," said Li Yangzhen, a senior official  of the city.    More and more Xuzhou citizens have abandoned their view of  distaste toward business careers.    According to statistics, Xuzhou has more than 100,000  registered private business people.    While welcoming business people from across the country,  Xuzhou is further improving its investment conditions to attract  overseas investment.    So far, 220 Taiwan-funded companies have opened service in  the city.</p>

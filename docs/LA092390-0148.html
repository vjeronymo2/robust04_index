			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ARREOLA AND VETT PACE NORTHRIDGE IN CROSS-COUNTRY  </P> <P> Darcy Arreola and Derik Vett led the Cal State Northridge women's and men's  cross-country teams to seventh- and ninth-place finishes Saturday in the Aztec  Invitational at San Diego's Morley Field.  </P> <P> Arreola, the 1989 Division II cross-country champion, placed fourth in the  women's race with a time of 17 minutes 27.6 seconds over the 5,000-meter  course, and Vett finished 16th in the men's race with a time of 25:47.2 for the  five-mile distance.  </P> <P> Vett, a senior from Buena High, was in 12th place after two miles before  dropping back into the mid-20s at the three-mile mark.  </P> <P> Arizona, powered by the 2-3-4 finish of Brian Grosso, Marc Davis and Martin  Keino, won the men's team title with 30 points, followed by Northern Arizona  (65) and UC Santa Barbara (91). Northridge had 331 points.  </P> <P> Arreola, who finished second to Buffy Rabbitt of UC Irvine in the Fresno  Invitational last week, was trailing Rabbitt by approximately 20 yards in  Saturday's race before taking a wrong turn with a half-mile left. The mistake  cost her 30 yards in distance and two places, according to Strametz.  </P> <P> "She didn't run badly," CSUN Coach Don Strametz said. "But I think she was a  little tired.

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Books: Upstart capital city BERLIN] BERLIN] ITS CULTURE, ITS TIMES by Michael Farr Kyle Cathie Pounds 18.99, 216 pages REVOLUTION could never grip Berlin, Lenin predicted, because Germans would only storm a railway station after first queueing for platform tickets. Nevertheless, as this engaging book shows, Berlin has had one of the most tumultuous lives of any European city in modern times. Today, it remains a barometer for European politics and culture. Unlike Rome or London, it was a never a natural capital. A medieval city fought over by robber barons from the Brandenburg marshes, it was thought a provincial upstart by lovers of Munich, Dresden and Frankfurt even in the 19th century. Michael Farr's achievement here is to explore how its civilising went hand in hand with the military growth which proved its downfall. So the work of the great architects Knobelsdorff and Schinkel, who determined the tone of the city from the 18th century with buildings like the opera house on Unter den Linden, the Altes museum and Potsdam's Sans Souci Palace, is seen against the backcloth of the warlike escapades of the Hohenzollern emperors. Farr is inspired on the contradictory character of this clan and its city. In the 17th century, every fifth inhabitant was a soldier, yet Berlin's tradition as most tolerant and cosmopolitan of German cities was already established, and in 1700, after an influx of Protestant refugees, one fifth of the people were French. Tiny, fat Elector Frederick William was a liberal but a bully who kicked women in the street and chased men with a cane. He collected giant soldiers for whom he swapped the city's artistic treasures with other monarchs. His favourites were a 7ft Irishman and a Norwegian smith; all were too precious to risk in war. His son, Frederick the Great, used his soldiers but always took a flute on his campaigns and composed sonatas between battles. For all his Prussian nationalism, he spoke only French and under him Berlin acquired the elegance which Frederick envied in Versailles. The love affair with France continued; during the Franco-Prussian war William I suspended his French chef, but reinstated him after sampling the menus of his German successor. The war ended in 1871 with Berlin capital of a united Germany. By 1900 it had become a mecca for artists and intellectuals as never before. Farr is a gifted raconteur but not a cultural commentator, and his anecdotal style fails here. But the hey-day of German expressionism and of the 1920s explosion of cabaret and naughtiness - Berlin had in perverted sex what Paris had in straight sex, according to one high liver - makes a naturally compelling story. There is the same imbalance between the sharp historical analysis of the Nazi and post-war years, and the sketchy cultural criticism. Redeemed however by delightful period photographs, cartoons and engravings, no Berlin lover would want to miss this book.</p>

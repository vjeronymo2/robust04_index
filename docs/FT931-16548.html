			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Letter: Learn from US Sir, President-elect Clinton's plans for introducing voluntary national service ('Citizens corps to the rescue', January 4) was encouraging. It should make higher education more available to all, improve the workforce's skills, and help to create a community spirit. The sadness is that none of the three UK political parties has yet decided to emulate Clinton. Niel Sebag-Montefiore, 180 Kensington Park Road, London W11 2ER</p>

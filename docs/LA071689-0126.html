			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART NEWS: JOKER'S SLASH ACT AN ARTLESS ENDEAVOR  </P> <P> "Batman" may have grossed $142 million as of last week, but the movie is making  a few enemies too. Some are indignant over a scene in which actor Jack  Nicholson as the Joker maniacally defaces master works of Western civilization.  </P> <P> Courting actress Kim Basinger who plays Batman's love interest, Nicholson  wreaks havoc in Gotham City's Flugelheim Museum, laughing wickedly beneath his  silk beret all the while.  </P> <P> Smash! Nicholson tips over a sculpted Degas dancer with the tap of a walking  stick. Splat! He and his goons toss cans of paint against the walls and go  after a Rembrandt. Psssssssst! They spray-paint Gainsborough's iconic "Blue  Boy."  </P> <P> Not one official at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical  Gardens in San Marino, where "Blue Boy" is housed, had seen "Batman," a  spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> But when Ron Haver, who heads the County Museum of Art's film department, saw  "Batman" for the first of three times, his jaw went crashing to his chest.  Though he otherwise "loved" the film, its museum scene is "socially  irresponsible" and sets a dangerous example, he said.  </P> <P> "There are so many nuts out running around that could easily be influenced by a  combination of a Jack Nicholson and Joker," said Haver, observing that audience  members at one theater he attended hooted gleefully every time a painting was  destroyed. "Anti-heroes are powerful symbols to sub-literates. Even if the  scene arouses one person to try to emulate (the actors) and one masterpiece is  defaced, it has done a disservice.  </P> <P> "People in the movie industry make such a big thing about being socially  responsible," continued Haver, a widely respected authority on film. "They  don't represent premarital sex because of AIDS and they don't encourage drug  use. But they'll take something innocuous -- or innocuous to them -- and make a  big laughing thing out of it. And it's not. It's absolutely not."  </P> <P> Critics for the Washington Post, the New York Times, the Boston Globe and  Newsweek magazine did not object to the scene. In fact, writers for the latter  three described it as one of the Warner Brothers movie's best or liveliest  sequences.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times' Sheila Benson sided with Haver, however.  </P> <P> Nothing could keep the "orgy of slashing and splashing" from being "a true  stomach churner. Not in today's world of indiscriminate art whackos," film  critic Benson wrote.  </P> <P> Indeed, incidents of art vandalism continue to claim headlines worldwide.  Perhaps the most infamous case involved the man who shattered part of  Michelangelo's Pieta with a hammer in 1972. As indigenous as murals are to Los  Angeles are the graffiti-makers who mar them.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Warner Brothers said phone calls for a comment on the issue  made to "Batman" producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber were not returned.  </P> <P> Still, others in the art world were not bothered a bit by the "Batman"  massacre.  </P> <P> "I didn't find it socially irresponsible at all," said Charles Desmarais,  director of the Laguna Art Museum. "I assume that people raised with a healthy  attitude won't be changed by some quirky scene in a film."  </P> <P> Artist Christopher Williams, whose work is included in "A Forest of Signs: Art  in the Crisis of Representation" at the Museum of Contemporary Art, felt that  the Joker's widespread product tampering -- he poisons cosmetics -- makes a  more worrisome suggestion.  </P> <P> "That seems a lot more dangerous to me than destroying artworks," Williams  said. "Nicholson's act of (art) vandalism was so casual really. There wasn't  any passion or political agenda behind it. He was just waltzing through on his  way to have tea with (Basinger's character) Vicki Vale."  </P> <P> FREEDOM OF ART: The Los Angeles-based Lannan Foundation has awarded a grant to  Washington Project for the Arts (WPA) to help present "Robert Mapplethorpe: The  Perfect Moment," a photography exhibit to be shown at the WPA from July 21 to  Aug. 13.  </P> <P> The exhibit was recently cancelled by the Corcoran Gallery of Art, another  Washington museum, to avoid exacerbating a congressional battle over National  Endowment for the Arts funding. Controversy over such federal funding had  erupted over the exhibit, which contains some of Mapplethorpe's  homoerotic-themed images.  </P> <P> The grant "serves in part as acknowledgement of our concern with the troubling  challenges to First Amendment rights now facing the cultural community in this  country," said Lisa Lyons, Lannan Foundation director of art programs. Citing  Lannan Foundation policy, Lyons would not disclose the amount of the grant.  </P> <P> Neither would Philip Brookman, WPA director of programs. But he said it was one  of two major gifts given to support the exhibit, which will cost the WPA about  $80,000 to stage.  </P> <P> The show, organized by the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of  Pennsylvania, is scheduled for a stop at the University Art Museum at UC  Berkeley from Jan. 17 to March 18.  </P></p>

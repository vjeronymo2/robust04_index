			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (20): The broad ethics of the free market ETHICS AND MARKETS: CO-OPERATION AND COMPETITION WITHIN CAPITALIST ECONOMIES by Colin Crouch and David Marquand (editors) Political Quarterly/Blackwells,Pounds 11.99 156 pages The Cold War and communism are over, but the debate over the morality of capitalism continues. That is the message of this volume of essays, whose authors are almost uniformly driven by a distaste of capitalism - in its Anglo-American form, at least. The distaste is partly a moral one. The authors, who mostly come from the centre-left of British politics, do not like the way that free markets produce losers as well as winners. But they also argue that Anglo-American capitalism, with its stress on competition rather than co-operation, is not a good way of generating wealth by comparison with the German or Japanese versions of capitalism. Their critique of Anglo-American capitalism, though hardly new, has the advantage of combining 10 authors' perspectives in 150 pages. The heart of the critique is that long-term relationships cannot develop and flourish in nakedly competitive markets. What is needed is a culture of community, co-operation and trust. The authors argue that the alleged short-termism of the Anglo-American model is most damaging in three respects. First, the failure to develop long-term relationships between companies and their shareholders undermines long-term investment and opens the way for practices such as hostile takeovers and asset-stripping. Second, the hire-and-fire mentality in the labour market discourages investment in skills. Third, the fact that manufacturers often have little compunction about switching suppliers if they can get a better deal prevents the growth of long-term links between manufacturers and suppliers. What all this has to do with ethics? The answer is, in part, that such long-term relationships have characteristics - trust, loyalty, cooperation and the like - normally associated with ethical behaviour. But the answer is also that the practices characteristic of German and Japanese capitalism are themselves embedded in those nation's broader cultural inheritances. These cultural linkages are explored in several papers: Ronald Dore's on Japan; Colin Crouch's on Germany; and Jonathan Boswell's on the links between Catholicism, Christian Democracy and capitalism in continental European countries. All three are interesting. But while Dore's and Crouch's articles are succinct and accessible, Boswell's is hard work. There is much in the arguments expressed in this volume. Markets do not exist in a vacuum. They are social institutions and rely on wider cultural support to function effectively. To appreciate this point, which was recognised by Adam Smith, one has only to look at the difficulties in establishing markets in Russia, where the sanctity of contract has no tradition. It is also true that markets cannot be divorced from ethical considerations. Managers, employees, consumers, shareholders and bankers are all human and their actions are capable of being judged from a moral standpoint. It is not enough of a justification to say that their actions are designed to maximise profits. However, in three ways, the arguments in this volume are deficient. First, it is misleading to paint capitalism as merely about maximising profits. Capitalism is a practice with its own entrepreneurial spirit, which values risk-taking and the creation of value in the widest sense as well as more narrow profit-making. While Russell Keat, in his paper, acknowledges that capitalism may be such a practice, these essays in general do not show much enthusiasm for the dynamic aspects of capitalism. Second, it is not clear that the Anglo-American model of capitalism has failed. The recent soul-searching in continental Europe over whether their markets are too rigid certainly should give pause for thought. While competitive markets may not be as good in fostering long-term relationships as co-operative institutions, they may be more flexible in responding to changing opportunities. Finally, even if the Japanese and German model of capitalism were superior, it could not just be grafted on to the British psyche. While several authors acknowledge this point, there is little exploration of how one could bring about such a change. That perhaps is material for a second volume.</p>

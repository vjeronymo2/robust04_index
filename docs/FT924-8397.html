			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: United Biscuits One can well understand UB's satisfaction at successfully netting CCA. Australia's number one snacks business was one of the few big prizes left in global snacks. The price looks keen by comparison with other international food deals under negotiation, in part because Pepsico could always be ruled out of the bidding on competition grounds. UB can now claim market leadership over its big North American rival both in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. None of this, though, is necessarily going to impress UB shares. For all the grand talk of strategic expansion, the company is essentially buying a well-managed Australian operation with a useful Italian add-on. The Pounds 200m purchase price should be put in the context of UB's Pounds 1.7bn market capitalisation, while the acquired sales represent a mere 5 per cent of the group's total. CCA's future will be volume rather than margin-driven, with benefits from integrating existing UB products for the longer term. The key to the shares, which have risen 45 per cent in the last two months, remains the extent to which Keebler can be knocked back into shape. So far the measures announced with the interims seem to be clawing back market share, though Keebler's second half profits are likely to be as disappointing as the first. The risk is that the 1993 bounce currently being discounted by investors is to a large extent dependent on factors outside UB's control.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Increased sales behind sharp recovery at French Connection FRENCH CONNECTION, the clothing wholesaler and retailer 76 per cent owned by Mr Stephen Marks, its chief executive, returned strongly to the black in the six months to July 31. However, the USM-traded group will not be paying an interim dividend - nor will it pay a final at the year-end. Mr George Wardale, chairman, said that increased turnover, especially in the US operation, had been the key to the improved performance - pre-tax profits were Pounds 2m, against losses of Pounds 768,000. Group turnover rose to Pounds 30.6m (Pounds 22.5m). 'All the rubbish is now out of the way,' he said, stressing that the group was now refocused on its French Connection and Nicole Farhi brands. Profits this time were unaffected by exceptional charges: last time Pounds 1.01m was subtracted from the pre-tax line. While sales at French Connection Wholesale slipped to Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.3m) and sales at Nicole Farhi Wholesale rose to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.1m), margins in the UK retail side improved and sales increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 8m. There are now six Nicole Farhi and 21 French Connection outlets in the UK - two more of the latter are planned before December. Sales in the US operations, 50 per cent owned by Mr Michael Axelrod, a director, expanded to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 5m). Mr Wardale said this rise, as in the UK, derived from 'genuine sales - more product sold at full price'. There are now eight French Connection outlets in the US. Cashflow from retail sales helped cut borrowings from Pounds 5.6m at January to Pounds 4.4m at the end of July, though Mr Wardale said that requirements fluctuated throughout the year. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 307,000 (Pounds 661,000). Earnings per share emerged at 4.4p (losses 6.3p) after minorities took Pounds 431,000 (Pounds 76,000).</p>

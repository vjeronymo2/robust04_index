			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM STING OPERATION RECOVERS $1.4 MILLION IN GOODS; 105 CHARGED  </P> <P> A stolen property sting operation believed to be the largest ever in Orange  County ended this morning with charges filed against 105 suspects and recovery  of nearly $1.4 million in items that were allegedly sold to undercover Anaheim  police officers.  </P> <P> Anaheim Police Chief Joseph Molloy announced at a news conference that about  half of the suspected thieves had been arrested this morning by eight teams of  officers in Orange, Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. Anaheim Police Lt.  William Wright said about half of the 105 suspects charged were already in jail  on other charges.  </P> <P> The arrests -- made in surprise visits to the suspects' homes -- culminated a  10-month investigation conducted by six officers of Anaheim's Special  Operations Division Crime Task Force Unit, who bought everything from stolen  tractors to television sets and guns from the suspects. The undercover officers  said they bought the property from the suspects out of a rented Anaheim  apartment, where the 220 purchases were videotaped.  </P> <P> Molloy said the officers paid about $29,000 to suspects to recover the stolen  items -- or about 2 cents on the dollar. Police said officers were able to  return 99% of the property.  </P></p>

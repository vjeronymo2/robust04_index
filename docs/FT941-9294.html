			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / FT Guide to the Winter Olympics (1): Message from the sponsors - IBM IBM has made a long-term commitment to the International Olympic Committee as the information technology partner for the next four Olympic Games, continuing the supporting role we have played since 1960. We are helping to plan, design and manage everything at Lillehammer - from results information and commentator services to site, venue, traffic control and ticketing. In addition, we are responsible for connecting systems from all other suppliers - electronic scoreboards, timing equipment, information terminals, text television and commentator stations. We have built a highly complex network with no room for error. The system we have installed is a showcase of how integrated technology and creative solutions can bring real benefit to users and businesses alike. The Lillehammer Winter Olympics will be the most technologically sophisticated Games to date, and IBM is proud to be the driving force behind it.

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA FIRES 2,075 POLICE  </P> <P> Colombia's national police announced that 2,075 officers have been fired, many  for having links to drug traffickers. The firings came under an anti-corruption  drive begun last February by Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla, the national police  chief. Gomez Padilla took over the top job in the 80,000-member force from a  general who was forced out because of connections with drug traffickers.  Meanwhile, Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement calling the murder of  Bishop Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, reportedly kidnaped by leftist rebels, "vile,  sacrilegious and pitiless." His death was apparently not connected to the drug  war.  </P></p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (7): Key structural changes ahead - France, the second biggest venture capital base in Europe, after the UK / The French venture capital industry is emerging in relatively buoyant shape from one of the country's most acute recessions since the Second World War The total value of venture capital raised last year amounted to FFr5.54bn, a drop of just six per cent on 1992. Venture capital investments slipped by 10 per cent to FFr6bn, while exits - or divestments of venture capital investments - rose sharply, from FFr2.26bn to FFr3.63bn. For Mr Denis Mortier, chairman of the French venture capital association, this was a solid performance - 'on the whole, and given the broader economic environment, I think the industry did better than expected,' he says. Despite the resilience of 1993, however, the French venture capital industry has been experiencing significant changes and is confronted by important structural challenges. Developments over the next few years, notably in mechanisms for exits and the evolution of fund raising, will determine whether France can consolidate its position as the second biggest venture capital base in Europe, after the UK. The principal shifts in the industry relate partly to the broader economic picture. Start-up investments, notably in high-technology activities, were affected by the economic environment - 'seed investments accounted for only one-tenth of one per cent and start-up investments for less than two per cent of the total amount invested,' say the accountants KPMG, in a report on the industry. Many of the larger players, in particular banks and insurance companies, have also curbed their venture capital activities as they seek to redress their financial positions. 'Insurance companies have suffered from losses in their damage businesses and have shifted the emphasis of their investments to liquid long-term assets such as bonds,' says one sector analyst in Paris. Many of the leading banks - seeking to offset losses from the property sector and from other bad loans - have reduced their involvement in private equity investment, he adds. The shift in strategy is most clearly indicated by Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank which suffered losses of more than FFr6bn last year. The bank, traditionally a big player in the venture capital industry, has reduced its investments in industry to raise capital and to concentrate on its core activities. According to a report by KPMG, the accountancy group, and the European Venture Capital Association, the decline in venture capital funds raised last year was mainly due to the reduced contribution of the banks. 'The total amount raised from banks fell by almost FFr500nm in 1993,' says the report, 'although with 31 per cent of the total venture capital raised, they remain the most important source of funds for the French industry.' At the same time, many industrial groups are shedding non-core businesses and venture capital investments as they focus on their principal activities. The most recent example is July's decision by Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, to sell FFr1.1bn worth of industrial investments, principally venture capital, to Banque Nationale de Paris. For some players in the venture capital industry, in particular the smaller, independent funds, these various changes have a positive effect. 'There has been less competition from the captive structures,' says Mr Mortier, referring to banks and insurance companies. 'At the same time, the pattern of divestments means that they have become providers of investments.' Competition is, however, unlikely to remain diminished. International venture capital funds, notably from the UK, are eyeing the French market with a view to increasing their presence - 'they are all raising funds for continental Europe,' says Mr Mortier. 'France is the second biggest market and the natural target to start with.' The domestic industry will be more eagerly awaiting the imposition of structural reforms which could improve the exit mechanisms in the French industry and increase the amount of investment finance available. On the first count, many in the French industry have pushed for the creation of a 'European Nasdaq' - a computerised off-market trading system. They argue that this would resolve the weaknesses of Europe's secondary stock markets, raise liquidity and tempt international investors, particularly from the US. Mr Mortier believes that the creation of such an exchange is just a question of time: 'We have created the awareness of a need and have won support for the idea from the European Commission. We have put together a study group to examine the conditions necessary, and hope to have a blueprint ready by November,' he says. 'By 1996, we hope to that the market can be launched.' By then, many in the French venture capital industry also hope that private, capitalised, pension funds will be in existence. According to most players in the domestic industry, the relative paucity of venture capital resources in France, compared with the UK, is partly a reflection of the lack of powerful pension funds. That lack seems unlikely to endure. The French government is moving, albeit cautiously, to the creation of private pension funds to ease the demographic pressures on its creaking pay-as-you-go state retirement scheme. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, is expected to introduce a bill to the national assembly this autumn, and a law, providing tax incentives for private pension contributions, could take effect after next spring's presidential elections. It is still unclear what the legal restrictions on such pension funds would be, and what proportion could be invested in equities or venture capital. But the impact would be significant. Mr Mortier forecasts that pension funds could provide one-quarter to one-third of external venture capital funds within ten years, compared with the 45 per cent ratio which now exists in the UK.</p>

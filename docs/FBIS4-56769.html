			<p>BFN     [Text] Panama City, 6 May (PL) -- Today, Cuba reiterated  its respect for Panama's internal affairs after reporting that  attempts had been made by some progovernment political sectors  to implicate representatives of the island in a foiled effort to  adversely affect opposition contenders in the electoral campaign.    Miguel Martinez, Cuba's acting charge d'affaires in this  capital, said in statements [words indistinct] during a meeting  he held yesterday with him.    Martinez said he asked to meet with Mulino following the  publication of an alleged report from the Cuban Embassy on  activities to support the opposition Democratic Revolutionary  Party [words indistinct], a favorite to win next Sunday's  elections.    Our position is to state very clearly that it is a false  document. Cuba has not been involved in, nor will it be  involved in the electoral campaign, and it will not support any  of the parties participating in the same, Martinez asserted.    Martinez said he told the Panamanian foreign minister of his  concern because irresponsible actions of this kind could  endanger relations between the two nations.    The incident has been widely publicized since last Tuesday,  when progovernment Legislator Leo Gonzalez held a surprising  news conference and said he had documents implicating Cuban  diplomats in alleged illegal actions, although he refused to  provide details on the origin of his information.    The head of the Cuban mission here explained that the  existence of the reports, which are completely false, was  reported to him by a top Panamanian official, Antonio Dominguez,  director of the National Immigration Department.    Dominguez even told the local press he had received an offer  from persons he did not identify who wanted to sell him the  documents for approximately $20,000.    Meanwhile, Martinez indicated that since he learned of  [words  indistinct] to manipulate in a specific manner the Cuban  position, he presented the Foreign Ministry on 26 April with  evidence showing the falsity of the alleged official Cuban  documents.    [Words indistinct] cited the cheap forgeries of diplomats'  signatures and a word choice and style completely different from  the Cuban style, even the use of typical Panamanian expressions  and phrases.</p>

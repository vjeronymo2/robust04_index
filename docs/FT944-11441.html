			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Property: The chancellor holds the key - Simon London on whether the Budget could affect the prospects for the housing market Anxious estate agents are among those awaiting with trepidation for the Budget to be announced at the end of this month by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer. Contrary to expectations, the housing market's bright start to the year did not last through the summer, and the National Association of Estate Agents found recently that two-thirds of its members had seen the market deteriorate through the autumn. Yet, most economists agree that any further tinkering with mortgage interest tax relief is unlikely to have much impact. The phased reduction of relief to a rate of 15 per cent, announced in the March 1993 Budget, should already be factored into house prices. The greatest erosion of this tax break came late in the 1980s when the threshold was frozen - yet, the housing market continued to over-heat. Optimists point out that the wider picture is favourable. Rarely have house prices been lower relative to average earnings: the average home now sells for 3.5 times earnings, having touched five times at the peak of the market in 1989. The lesson of previous economic cycles is that house prices normally lag behind disposable incomes through recession but catch up quickly as recovery takes hold. So long as the chancellor keeps the economy on track, the argument runs, house prices should rise in line with earnings. Against this seemingly compelling argument, other factors are at work: Changing demographics mean that the number of people in their 20s will fall from 8.8m now to around 7.5m in 1999. This means fewer potential first-time buyers. The average UK household is still carrying debts equivalent to more than a full year's income. This limits the potential for house-buyers to stoke up the market by taking out larger mortgages. Banks and building societies, which tightened their lending criteria through recession, are still cautious. Moreover, housing market forecasters disagree about how favourable the economic outlook really is. Stockbroker UBS believes economic growth will peak at 3.7 per cent in 1995 before falling back gently to 1.6 per cent in 1998. This leads it to expect average inflation of 6.5 per cent over the period and annual average earnings' growth of 8.4 per cent. Against this background, the UBS forecast that house prices will rise by 48 per cent over the next five years - or 8 per cent a year - seems reasonable. Yet, others are much more cautious about growth and inflation. The Halifax building society expects inflation to average around 3 per cent to the end of the decade and house prices to rise by perhaps 5 per cent annually. Both UBS and Halifax see house prices broadly tracking average earnings, which tend to run at 1-2 percentage points higher than the rate of retail price inflation. The forecasters themselves would admit that these numbers are of little help to people looking for property in a particular region or price bracket. In reality, the housing market is made up of many local markets which perform according to local economic conditions. The top end of the market, for instance, is only a very small proportion of the whole - less than than 1 per cent of the UK's housing stock is valued at over Pounds 300,000. But prices in this sector have shown a sharp recovery already, even though the wider market is in the doldrums. According to agent Savills, prime London properties have risen by 28 per cent since the market trough in December 1992, with around 20 per cent growth this year. The high bonuses earned by City professionals over the past year have helped this recovery. Agents also report renewed interest among overseas buyers of prime London property, although the role played by Russian mafia money has been greatly exaggerated. Even away from London, where foreign buyers and City bonuses are less important, prices in the top tier have shown a marked recovery. Savills estimates that country house prices have risen by 11 per cent in the past two years, far outpacing the wider market. The main reason for the rapid rise at the top end is shortage of supply. As one agent remarked this week, the supply of 18th century country houses was, by definition, 'inelastic'. Small changes in demand have a big impact on prices. If the outlook for the economy remains good, there is every chance that prime residential property will continue to outperform the wider market. The main risk is probably political: heavier taxation of high earners cannot be ruled out if there is a change of government after the next general election. Meanwhile, estate agents everywhere are hoping that Clarke has no such surprises in store on November 29.</p>

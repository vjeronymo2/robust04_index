			<p>BFN     [Text] The Japanese Government on 15 June informally  received a draft resolution the United States plans to submit to  the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on North Korea for  its suspected development of nuclear weapons. In response,  relevant ministries and agencies will begin studying concrete  ways to put the sanctions into effect. There is a possibility  the UN Security Council will amend the draft resolution, and the  task prior to making a final decision on the draft resolution is  how to persuade China, which is still cautious about imposing  any sanctions against North Korea, to change its stance.    Former U.S. President Carter entered North Korea on 15 June  and the Japanese Government plans to closely watch how North  Korean leaders respond to the draft resolution during their  talks with the former U.S. President, after concluding that  their response to the draft resolution will affect future  developments in connection with the North Korean nuclear issue.    On 15 June, Prime Minister Hata held an emergency meeting  with government officials at his official residence in the  evening to discuss how to deal with the draft resolution. The  Japanese Government has decided to notify the U.S. Government of  its basic agreement with the draft resolution, but government  officials are tight-lipped about the draft resolution, saying,  "We cannot reveal the substance of the draft resolution." A  government source said, "The draft resolution, as a whole, is  close to what Japan has asserted." The government source  stressed that in formulating the draft resolution, the United  States has accepted, to some extent, what the Japanese  Government has asserted since Japan, the United States, and  South Korea held the trilateral talks in Washington on 4 June.    After the meeting with the prime minister, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Kumagai said: "Japan has been extremely cautious about  the sanctions against North Korea. Japan has maintained that  the sanctions should not simply be a punishment for North Korea,  but should have the effect of making North Korea return to the  starting point. I do now know for sure how the draft resolution  will be handled in the future, but Japan intends to politely  convey what it thinks to other relevant nations." In this way,  the government spokesman indicated that Japan would work to  reflect its assertions in the sanctions through the United  States and the rest of the permanent members of the UN Security  Council when the UN Security Council votes on imposing sanctions.    The issue of halting remittances by ethnic Koreans residing  in Japan to North Korea has been a focal point in the sanctions  against North Korea, but it remains unclear how the issue will  be dealt with in the future. The issue is believed not to be  included in the sanctions that will be imposed in accordance  with the draft resolution, but there is the possibility of the  issue being incorporated in the sanctions one way or another.  With regard to the remittances by ethnic Koreans residing in  Japan to North Korea, they may be excluded from the sanctions.  A Foreign Ministry source said, "Once the UN Security Council  votes to adopt a resolution imposing the sanctions against North  Korea, all nations involved are obliged to comply with the  sanctions." Thus, he indicated that Japan will not be held  solely responsible for the remittances. A government source on  15 June said the Finance Ministry's interpretation is that "it  is difficult for the government to halt the remittances under  the current Foreign Exchange Management Law without a UN  resolution."    If the UN Security Council votes to adopt a resolution  slapping sanctions on North Korea, the government would have no  trouble halting the remittances. However, if the UN Security  Council fails to adopt a resolution slapping sanctions on North  Korea in the face of China's opposition, and multinational  sanctions are imposed instead, the government would face  difficulty dealing with the remittances.    According to the same government source, the draft  resolution  strongly calls on North Korea to return completely to the  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and demands the  imposition of several sanctions against North Korea.  Specifically, the draft resolution is believed to call for  suspension of international assistance to the Tumen development  project, and cultural exchanges.    The sanctions envisioned by the draft resolution will have  no  great impact on Japan, but they are likely to adversely affect  developing countries. The government source said "it would not  be simple" to win support from China and developing countries  which are members of the UN Security Council. Japan is poised  to do everything it can do to persuade them in the United  Nations.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Management: Put in the picture - Training videos are popular but are they of any value John Cleese is lying in bed with his wife. He is reading a report, she is sulking behind a glossy magazine. She asks him why he cannot confine his work to the office. He replies that he is too busy going to meetings - it is only when he leaves the office that he can start work. There is something odd about the situation: Cleese looks familiar enough, but out of his mouth comes the voice of a Chinese actor speaking in Cantonese. This image of Cleese as the harassed British manager in his pyjamas has been travelling the world since 1976. The video, Meetings Bloody Meetings, is one of the best-used training tools ever, translated into 17 languages watched by more than 1m managers. It has been so popular that a new version has just been released for the 1990s without the sideburns and flared trousers. When the video was first made most managers did not believe they needed training, and videos were still a rarity. Now Video Arts, the company started 20 years ago by Cleese and Sir Anthony Jay, co-author of the television series Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister, finds itself dominating a sprawling international market. These days all self-respecting managers go on training courses, and no course is complete without a video. The British manager may not be universally admired for his performance, yet when it comes to videos telling managers how to behave, Britain leads the world. It is only in Japan that the idea has not caught on: Japanese managers are not amused by the sight of Dawn French, the comedienne, getting buried under a mountain of memos. But how worthwhile are these videos? And can a 30-minute one really be worth the Pounds 1,000 that they can cost to buy? Research in the US claims that a message learnt through video is 40 per cent more likely to be retained than one taught through chalk and talk. Videos appeal to companies because they help break up a training session, and may get the point across more quickly. 'Video has vast potential for training. I have a library of videos I use all the time,' says Lucy Gardiner of Skilltrain, which provides companies with customised training packages. Comedy has also proved its worth: 'People often go into courses feeling resentful,' says Tina Tietjen, Video Arts' joint managing director. 'Humour breaks down fears and helps people relax. Only when they are relaxed can they take on messages.' To help relax the audience Video Arts has hired the great and the good of British comedy, including French and Griff Rhys Jones. Yet according to Gardiner these big names may be an unnecessary luxury: 'You can have the same impact without them. In fact, big names can be a distraction.' Other companies such as Melrose and Longman Training have followed Video Arts' lead, offering a bewildering choice of comedy, drama, straight speeches and even interactive videos to teach everything from how to talk on the phone to the in's and out's of total quality management. Until recently these three companies carved up much of the market between them, with video prices that raised some eyebrows. 'It is nice work, if you can get it,' says Chris Page of Jumpcut, a small Yorkshire-based training company. Jumpcut's videos for job seekers are sold for as little as Pounds 30 to schools and other customers who would regard prices even as high as Pounds 100 as a joke. The established players point to high production costs - Video Arts says it spends up to Pounds 250,000 per video - and to the quality of their products. Longman's latest offering on selling financial services is a slick drama filmed in a stately home, which could lull viewers into thinking they were watching a high-budget television soap. Companies have been prepared to pay high prices for videos as the cost of the video is a small part of the total training cost. Tietjen argues that the main cost is in lost management time, and that if you can get a point across through a video it has paid for itself many times over. These high prices have recently brought new players into the game. For about half the price the BBC has started to sell videos on such subjects as presentation skills. Cheaper still is Taylor Made Films which is producing videos under the Sunday Times name on quality management, personal skills and leadership. The company claims it offers twice as much material as Video Arts (two videos instead of one) at a quarter of the price. But which is best? One of the Sunday Times' new offerings is about meetings, and is in direct competition with Video Arts' more costly bestseller. Both videos present a parody of a meeting going badly and then spell out simple rules for a more successful one. Both offer the same sensible advice: meetings should not be held unless they are necessary; they should be planned in advance; everyone should know why they are there; the chairman should politely shut up people who ramble; decisions should be summarised, and so on. However, the Video Arts offering is funny. Cleese is memorable as he stands in his pyjamas in the dock charged with 'cold-blooded time wasting' by a stern judge. The Sunday Times version is unconvincing and cliche ridden - a pretty blond woman exchanges flirtatious smiles with a wet young manager as she helps him become more assertive in the chair. The second part of the Sunday Times offer is in the style of a television documentary. The newspaper's editor, Andrew Neil, chairs a panel of meetings experts and Peter Hobday, the broadcaster, interviews company executives about what sort of rooms they like to hold their meetings in. The result is bland, and will only be informative to those who can keep their minds on it. If managers take note of any of the tips in either of the videos their investment will not be in vain. A recent survey of US executives showed that a third of all time spent in meetings is wasted. If they spend a little more time a lot less pleasurably watching the Sunday Times version, at least they can comfort themselves that they have saved several hundred pounds in doing so.</p>

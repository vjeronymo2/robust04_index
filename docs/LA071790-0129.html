			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP;  </P> <P> TOWARD A NEW KIND OF LATIN REVOLUTION: POWER TO THE MIDDLE CLASS;  </P> <P> THE BUSH PLAN AIMS TO REVIVE LAGGARD ECONOMIES WITH INVESTMENT, TRADE AND DEBT  RELIEF. THE WEALTHY OLIGARCHIES WOULD LOSE OUT IN THE PROCESS.  </P> <P> President Bush's new program offering Latin American countries unprecedented  opportunities to expand trade ties with the United States, win help in reducing  their debts and attracting foreign investment is meant to foment nothing less  than a new revolution in the region.  </P> <P> While he has not said so specifically, Bush wants to see power in Latin America  wrested from the corrupt oligarchies that have dominated the region's economies  for the past four decades and transferred to the long-fettered middle class,  according to knowledgeable analysts.  </P> <P> And the big question now is how aggressively the region's new democratic  governments will respond. Initial reactions have been positive but slow in  coming. Chile was the first to express interest in such a trade pact.  </P> <P> The oligarchies, a legacy of the Spanish conquistadores, controlled their  economies directly until the 1950s, when Argentine economist Raul Prebisch  captured the region's fancy with a call for protection from imports, which was  accompanied by a move to state ownership of private industry.  </P> <P> When the region adopted Prebisch's policies, the government-owned enterprises  became the major drain on national economies and provided a steady channel of  income for the top economic classes, which obtained ownership shares and  provided management skills.  </P> <P> Today, state-run industries that in many cases benefit only a handful of  wealthy families are subsidized by government borrowing and by taxes imposed on  the relatively small populations of middle-class taxpayers. Latin economies are  choking on the resulting debt.  </P> <P> Alan J. Stoga, analyst for Kissinger Associates, former Secretary of State  Henry A. Kissinger's New York consulting firm, argues that restructuring the  Latin economies so they can operate on free-market principles is as central to  any recovery in the hemisphere as it is to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "There's absolutely no doubt that absent any restructuring of the Latin  economies, there is nothing even worth talking about," Stoga said. "There will  be no partnership at all."  </P> <P> That is the rationale behind Bush's trade-rather-than-aid approach. The new  democratic governments are strapped by debt and crippling inflation. If  Washington can encourage them to abandon "Prebischism," it can weaken the  oligarchies and boost the middle class.  </P> <P> That, in turn, would help democracy take root, bolster American economic ties  with the region and strengthen American security interests throughout the  Southern Hemisphere, according to government and private strategists who  specialize in Latin America.  </P> <P> Although Bush's new proposals have attracted little attention, analysts say  they constitute the most sweeping set of incentives since the "Alliance for  Progress" program that John F. Kennedy proposed to help counter Fidel Castro's  appeal in the 1960s. Here are the major points:  </P> <P> * The United States will negotiate a bilateral free-trade agreement -- designed  to cut tariffs and increase the flow of trade -- with any Latin country that is  willing to undertake the kinds of reforms needed to shift to a market-oriented  economic system. U.S. and Mexico already have begun preliminary work aimed at  launching more formal trade talks later this year.  </P> <P> * Washington will help set up a $300-million international lending pool to  finance the infrastructure and technical aid needed to convert state-owned  industries into private corporations and attract more foreign investment to the  region.  </P> <P> * Reversing its previous opposition, Washington would consider forgiving  portions of the billions of dollars in debts that Latin countries owe the U.S.  government -- a first step toward matching the writedowns that commercial banks  have taken on their Latin loans.  </P> <P> * And last week, Bush asked the annual seven-nation economic summit in Houston  to launch a multibillion-dollar international effort to provide aid and  technical help to Latin countries just as the Western nations have done for  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The series of rapid-fire proposals has come as a result of a rare personal  involvement by the President, reflecting both his own longtime interest in the  region and his belief that helping to bolster democracy there is important to  U.S. national interests.  </P> <P> Though born in Connecticut, Bush spent much of his early career in Texas, where  -- as Commerce Secretary (and fellow Texan) Robert A. Mosbacher says -- "you  learn a lot about the Mexican economy almost by osmosis." One of Bush's sons,  Jeb, married a Mexican national.  </P> <P> More important, Bush acquired a professional interest in Latin American during  his years as director of the CIA and, later, as vice president -- an interest  that continues today.  </P> <P> Besides rushing out his new initiatives, Bush is scheduled to visit Brazil,  Argentina and other Latin American countries in September. U.S. strategists say  he has tentatively decided to take three more trips to the region over the next  12 months.  </P> <P> To be sure, there is no guarantee that Bush's new proposals will have a major  impact. As Washington's cynics have pointed out, the World Bank and the  International Monetary Fund have been pressuring the Latins for years to make  needed reforms, without success.  </P> <P> Just the same, by accident or not, Bush's new proposals come at a time when  many of the region's new democratic governments are moving precisely in that  direction -- and may be receptive to the promise of expanded markets abroad.  </P> <P> Mexico, under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, has begun a sweeping reform  of its economic and trade policies that virtually reverses four decades of  corporate statism. Brazil just announced an even more dramatic overhaul.  </P> <P> Venezuela has made some modest but important reforms. Argentina is just  beginning. Costa Rica and many of the smaller Latin American countries are  moving rapidly toward free-market economies.  </P> <P> Moreover, the shift is being accelerated by a growing fear among Latin American  governments that the increasing preoccupation of the Western powers with the  emerging East European democracies will leave little or nothing in the aid pot  for Latin America.  </P> <P> It is just for that reason that Bush's own new program -- offering  opportunities for expanded trade benefits and for an international aid effort  -- virtually parallels the one that the allies have set up for the former  Eastern Bloc.  </P> <P> Many of the region's new governments are actively pondering the President's  proposal, and it is hoped more will be ready to respond by the time Bush visits  the area in mid-September.  </P> <P> But the real test will come after that, when -- if the Latins take Bush up on  his plan -- the United States must make good on the President's offer.  </P> <P> The Latins have made some progress before, noted Kissinger Associates' Stoga,  but Washington has not always provided the rewards.  </P> <P> If both sides come through and Washington forges a genuine partnership with the  region, Stoga says, that could be a real revolution. If not, both sides will be  disappointed -- again.  </P></p>

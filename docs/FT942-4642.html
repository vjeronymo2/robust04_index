			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Britain ruled in breach of EU employment law: Companies must consult workforces about changes British employers will, for the first time, face a statutory obligation to consult employees when planning to make more than 10 redundancies or when transferring workers from one business to another, after two rulings by the European Court of Justice. The rulings, which said Britain was in breach of EU laws protecting workers' rights during the contracting out of public services, also pave the way for compensation claims by employees over dismissal and loss of benefits. The decision by the Luxembourg court means that companies - even non-unionised ones - will have to ensure there is adequate machinery for consulting their workforces. This could range from setting up committees elected by employees to simply notifying workers in advance of changes. Mr Fraser Younson, vice-president of the Employment Lawyers Association, said: 'This is the most important development in UK industrial relations in the past 20 years,' The Luxembourg court said the UK had failed to implement key aspects of the European acquired rights (1977) and collective redundancies (1975) directives. In translating the European rules into English law through the 1981 Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment ) Regulations, known as Tupe, the UK limited the requirement to inform and consult workers to those employers who recognised trade unions. The judgment, which was not unexpected, was played down by the government as a 'technicality'. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the vast majority of employers already had mechanisms for consulting with employees. But the ruling was welcomed by trade unionists and Labour politicians. Mr John Monks, Trades Union Congress general secretary, said: 'The right of workers to be consulted over redundancies and transfers is a key element of social policy which had been deliberately denied to British workers.' The government is expected to introduce the required changes to legislation in the next few months. The European court also confirmed that the UK was guilty of excluding the public sector from the job security and wage protection provided to workers by Tupe. Last summer, the government fell into line with the rest of Europe by extending Tupe to cover the public sector. However, yesterday's ruling confirms the right of public sector employees who had not been covered by the legislation to sue the government for compensation.

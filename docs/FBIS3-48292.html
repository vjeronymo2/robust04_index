			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Haruo Tanikawa: "Diligently Maintaining </F> Balance by Effectively Peeling Off Deferred Loans"]    [Text] Although life insurance loans for the first  half were favorable at the start, growth has been slowing since  June because of interest rate sensitive clients. For life  insurers, who cite an increase in loans for stable earnings  assets as their priority policy, it seems a discouraging start.  At one time, there had been criticism from the banking world  about the interest dumping of life insurance loans, but the  various major companies strongly denied it. Rather, they are  troubled by the level of long-term interest prime rate that is  less than the cost of liabilities.  <H5>  "No Dumping" </H5>   "The scant demand for funds has been consumed by government  affiliated financial institutions and life insurers who are  waging an offensive with low interest as a weapon. There is no  room left for us to enter."    Thus laments a person in charge of loans at a long-term  credit bank. According to the talk of those involved, the  various major trading companies borrowed 50 to 100 billion yen  from life insurers between this April and June. The term is 10  years, and the rate that was accomplished with callable terms  (repayment midway is possible when interest drops) was according  to their rating and sometimes yen-yen swap quotes, but on the  level of LIBOR flat. It is said that even were some cases with  minus 20 basis points. The cries rose from banks that "it is 40  basis points lower than the rate that can be offered by our  bank."    It is true that the various life insurance companies deny  "suspicions of dumping" by the banking world, saying that "loans  with interest lower than the long-term prime, which broke the  record for lowest in the past, strangle our own necks. Even  though the term of life insurance loans is longer compared to  long-term credit banks and has the advantage, it is not greatly  lower than long-term prime." (Meiji Mutual Life Insurance)    Indeed, super excellent firms which have a high rating can  select the interest that is the best bargain from diverse forms  of interest such as long-term prime fixed, long-term prime  variable, new long-term prime, LIBOR spread, and bond issue cost  while looking at the trends of the swap market. Depending on the  interest situation, it seems that there have been loans at  interest lower than long-term prime rate (including fixed  interest returned to LIBOR base) which life insurers "inevitably  from the viewpoint of general transactions" (leading life  insurer) consider their standard.    It is true that the intense interest competition in loans to  such super excellent firms is "reciprocal," including city  banks, trust banks, and long-term credit banks. (A major life  insurer) Conversely, they complain of the restrictions on life  insurers, saying that "there is no concept of a spread loan in  life insurance where the acceptance of liabilities can only be  limited term buy backs and limited impact loans." (same)    Moreover, Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance considers that  "firms to which LIBOR apply are basically an AA rating or above  and the number of companies can be counted on both hands.  Additions to LIBOR are over 30 basis points as a rule." Both on  the point of scale and in the aspect of interest, they deny the  prominence of life insurers.  <H5>  Start Was Favorable, But... </H5>   The changes in balance truly indicate that life insurance  loans are struggling the same as banks. The total amount of  general lending at the end of July for 27 domestic companies was  50 trillion yen. It was a 7.2 percent increase over the previous  year and seemed favorable compared to city banks and long-term  credit banks, but these figures included deferred loans to banks  for the second half of fiscal 1992. In the first half of this  year when the acceptance of new deferred loans ceased, life  insurance loans also were directly affected by the blow of the  sluggish economy.    The start in the first half (April, May) was favorable.  Expectations were high for an economic recovery and while  feelings of future higher quotations for long-term interest  rates were rising, an increase close to 10 percent for the  annual rate was realized as the result of "the demand for funds  by firms which had held off borrowing from January to March  being manifested centering on April and May." (Nippon Life  Insurance)    "Not much difference is seen in loan clients viewed by  business sector" (Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance), but in these  times, the weight of funds of restructuring has been great in  fund needs. In other words, they have been equity redemption  funds and allowances for early repayment funds for borrowing in  the period of high interest rates.    However, when a yellow signal lit up in the economic  recovery  at the beginning of June and a feeling of future lower  quotations for interest rates spread, the corporate demand for  funds quickly cooled. Rather, repayments exceeded new loans, and  the balance declined in June and July. It leveled off during  August, had a slight increase during September, and it seems  there will be a 1-2 percent increase in the total for the last  half.  <H5>  "Would Be Good If It Were a Net Increase" </H5>   For the past several years, many life insurers have  clarified  their position on the importance of loans. The share of loans in  increased assets exceeded 60 percent prior to 1975. However, the  share gradually dropped and fell to 10 percent in fiscal 1986  with the situation of life insurers in the background such as  the invigoration of aggressive investment in designated money in  trusts and investment in foreign bonds aimed at profits from a  rise in stock prices due the external factors of the decline in  demand for funds accompanying the shift to a period of low  growth and shift by big corporations to direct procurement of  financing.    Afterward, while corporate demand for capital again became  brisk in the bubble era, bank loans became subject to the  introduction of BIS regulations, increases in them were curbed,  and the loan share of life insurers recovered and in the past  several years has progressed on the level of 40 percent.    For life insurers who must stably employ long-term funds and  earn a working profit (income gain) exceeding the assumed  interest rate, it is said that "long term loans are the most  appropriate as the portfolio." (major life insurer) Especially  now that the myth of the upward slant of stock prices has  crumbled and they have learned the bitter experience of  investments in foreign bonds having suffered large exchange  losses with the rapid rise of the yen, that idea is even  stronger.    Nippon Life Insurance, for example, in the period of the  past  three years has increased the staff of branches in charge of  medium to small firms and individual loans from 100 to 150  people.    Meiji Mutual Life Insurance developed "a total corporate  service (TS system)" beginning in 1991. The corporate division,  which handled only corporate insurance and corporate pensions  also had a loan function along with the existing finance  division. In April 1992, persons in charge were also assigned to  branches in major regional cities, and "success has been  achieved in cultivating new customers."    With the increase in corporate bankruptcies, however, there  also is a concern that "life insurers who do not touch daily  fund settlement of accounts will be beaten by banks in  safeguarding credit." Sumitomo Mutual Life Insurance is  proceeding with a review of in-house financing regulations for  thorough credit management of all their client corporate groups  for this reason.  <H5>  Laments Amount of Drop in Long-Term Prime Rate </H5>   For life insurers, who are bound by the assumed interest  rate  agreed upon with the insurance contractor, the prolonged low  interest rate situation "has hit like a body blow." (Medium life  insurer) Regardless of the fact that the assumed interest rate  dropped from the 5.5 percent up to then to 4.25 to 4.75 percent  beginning in fiscal 1993, overall liability costs are in "the  mid 5-percent level." (major life insurer) Although it was  settled by finally dropping the lowest guaranteed interest rate  for pension funds and qualified pensions to 4.5 percent,  application begins in April 1994 and it will remain at 5.5  percent until then. Looking only at long-term prime which is the  base interest for loans, it has become a complete backspread.    At the present time, there are no signs that major life  insurers are relaxing in their position of emphasizing loans and  at least they are not publicly talking of another drop in the  assumed interest rate. However, the shadow cast by the prolonged  sluggish economy is gradually becoming larger.</p>

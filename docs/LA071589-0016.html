			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH'S SENTENCE IN IRAN-CONTRA FIASCO  </P> <P> North gets off with a slap on the wrist. That man did more to desecrate our  flag and make a mockery of what America stands for than could a platoon of  flag-burning arsonists. He violated the very basis of our democratic society in  the name of patriotism. His actions were either very misguided, or very  hypocritical.  </P> <P> Gesell's actions are understandable, if a bit parochial. I don't consider North  to be a violent criminal, but his crimes were indeed crimes of violence --  violence to the people of Central America, violence to people around the  Persian Gulf, violence to democratic adherents in every country.  </P> <P> The United States does try to show that democracy is the best form of  government that imperfect man has yet devised. Unfortunately, North threw a  great big monkey wrench into the works, and our ability to set a good example  has suffered greatly.  </P> <P> CLEMENT SALVADORI  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

For  the first time in the history of independent India, the vital  sector of agriculture will be subjected to an international  discipline which has been basically evolved to suit the  interests and requirements of industrialised countries and which  shows little understanding of the problems and needs of a  country like ours where trade considerations are marginal and  subsidiary and where the process of economic development is  essential, says Mr S.P. Shukla, former Finance Secretary to the  Government of India and former ambassador of India and Permanent  Representative to GATT at Geneva.    The main objectives of the Dunkel Draft on agriculture are  to  free the agricultural sector from all forms of controls and  interventions by the government and from all restrictions on  imports, so that the dominant multinational corporations (MNCs)  in the agribusiness find easy access to the markets of  developing countries such as India.    Changes are being sought on four fronts: (a) Lowering of  subsidies given to various agricultural inputs, such as  fertiliser, electricity and water, (b) importing a given  percentage of domestic consumption even if the country is able  to meet its needs from domestic production; (c) introducing  patent rights in agriculture; and (d) scrapping of priority  sector credit programmes that would directly affect agriculture.    The Dunkel draft also places strict restrictions on the  subsidation of food, as in India's public distribution system  (PDS). According to Dunkel, subsidised rations may be given to  only those fitting certain "clearly defined criteria related to  nutritional objectives." The World Bank, in various reports, has  been demanding precisely the same. The Dunkel proposals require  the countries to maintain the public distribution system only  through purchase at market price.    This means the government cannot interfere with the price  settlement mechanism, as it can do now. The consequences of  buying at market price may not be apparent in times of plenty,  but in times of shortages, compulsion to buy at market prices  can mean suicidal for the country's ability to procure and stock  food and release for consumption at subsidised rates. This in  itself would be enough to push us into a dependence on imports.  The buffer stocks have been critical in stabilising the prices  of essential foodgrains.    The second threat for the agricultural sector would come  from  the open competition with the cheap imports, largely from the  granaries of the Western countries. The Dunkel proposals  stipulate minimum market access for imports to be provided by  the countries which do not import foodgrains.    India being only an occasional importer of foodgrains, would  have to allow imports. In the first year of implementation of  the Dunkel proposals two per cent of the country's domestic  consumption would have to be imported and this figure has to go  up to 3.33 per cent at the end of 10 years.    The implications of such compulsory imports are two-fold:  (a)  domestic production would face competition from the cheap  imports provided by MNCs engaged in agribusiness; and (b)  attempts by the country to achieve self-sufficiency in food  would be thwarted.    The penetration of cheap imports could lead to a diversion  of  consumption from local products, resulting in a greater  dependence on imports. This would cause (a) the uncertainty that  comes with dependence on imports, and (b) the scarcity of  foreign exchange required to pay for imports.    Implications of a cut in subsidies in the European Community  whose subsidy on agriculture amounts to something like $200  billion are being interpreted by the Commerce Ministry as a  great benefit. A 20 per cent cut in the EC would mean roughly  $40 billion less subsidy in the EC. This cut will get expressed  in the increase in prices of temperate crops and not tropical  crops which constitute India's export interests. The temperate  crops include edible oil, wheat, sugar, meat and milk products,  fruits and vegetables. In edible oil we are not self-sufficient  and still import a large part of our consumption.    The market access compulsion and higher world prices will  increase our import bill. So also for sugar. Importing at the  1986-88 level would mean importing significant amounts of sugar.  As for wheat, rice and major cereals, we are just about  self-sufficient. And depending upon, whether it has been a good  crop or bad, we still are on the threshold of importing. So in  signing the GATT our negotiating position would be not only as  net exporters but with the stagnant growth of foodgrains after a  period of 15 years, we may even become net importers. Thus  higher world prices of these commodities will be to our  disadvantage and not advantage.    According to Mr S.P. Shukla: "The most draconian aspect of  the new discipline is in the area of domestic support regimes.  The industrialised countries have enjoyed, for a long time,  complete autonomy in the management of their agriculture. They  pursuade strong and complex regimes of domestic support policies  through direct state intervention as well as indirect support  measures.    Having reached a stage where agriculture constitutes a very  small component of their economy both in terms of their national  product as well as the employment potential, and also having  reached a stage where the trade angle is far more important for  their agriculture, they have now prescribed a strict discipline  on domestic support which has to be followed by everybody."    Between 1982-1987, Japan extended 72.5 per cent subsidy to  its farmers, the European Community 37 per cent, and the US  26.17 per cent. Whereas India extended a negative subsidy of  2.23 per cent, i.e., India taxed its agriculture.    Introducing intellectual property rights (patents) in  agriculture would have far-reaching consequences. In the  developing countries any improvement brought about in the plant  varieties are not considered an exclusive private property of  the individual or organisation undertaking this activity.  Developed countries on the other hand give exclusive rights to  anyone developing new varieties of plants or seeds for a  definite period during which he or she can use the monopoly  rights to exploit the market.    This system, as prevailing in the developed countries, is  now  sought to be forced on the developing countries. If this system  is adopted by the developing countries, the farmers would get  into a serious problem as agriculture would be based on imported  varieties as under the Green Revolution in India. The use of  seeds over which a patent holder may have an exclusive patent  right would create a permanent dependency.    Indeed the rights enjoyed by the owner of the patented seeds  are such that they do not allow the harvested seeds to be sown  for the subsequent year's production. Every year the farmer has  to approach the company supplying the seeds to meet the  requirements for sowing. The inimical consequences for the  farmer can be better appreciated when one remembers that all  major seeds companies in the world today are MNCs which trade  not only in patented seeds but also in the patented chemicals  that would have to be used to obtain best results.    The advent of biotechnology and the pressures on developing  countries like India to patent biotechnological innovations has  given rise to the possibility that domestic agriculture in these  countries would be facing dependency syndrome. Biotechnology has  been presented as the future technology for agriculture and is  being developed in the laboratories of the MNCs. Claims have  been made (which are largely unsubstantiated) that biotechnology  has the potential of bringing about rapid increases in  productivity in agriculture. But the adoption of this technology  would lead to permanent strings of dependency on the MNCs.    The Dunkel proposals have yet another dangerous implication  for agriculture. The priorities of the financial sector (bank  and insurance) are being altered through the new rules for trade  in services which the Dunkel proposals are seeking to introduce.  Priority sector lending, a policy in banking which many  countries like India have claimed to follow, would have to be  discontinued. The agriculture sector, one of the major  beneficiaries of priority sector lending would be deprived of  funds.    Sweeping changes being attempted through Dunkel proposals  have met with widespread opposition, especially from the farmers  worldwide. The Asian women peasants, Korean farmers, cultivators  in Japan, French farmers (most serious threat to GATT) and  American people's networks, feel alarmed at the designs to take  away control of all agricultural inputs--land, seeds, etc.--from  the hands of small farmers by the powerful agribusiness firms.  Collectively they are voicing their concern over the attempts to  control agriculture and the lives of those dependent on it, by  the corporate interest through seeds.    In Korean farmers have launched an anti-GATT campaign to  resist further opening of Korean markets to rice imports. There  are reports of various massive protests from Japanese and South  Korean farmers against rice imports under American pressure,  (while writing this article December 7, 1993).    Mr Shukla who is also co-chairman of the National Working  Group on patent laws (India) warns: "The long-term implications  of the threat to autonomous policy-making as a whole are too  serious to be assuaged by complacent calculations of the present  level of support, by unsubstantiated and vague hopes about  increased exports or by private clarifications sought from the  GATT bureaucrats about some unclear formulations."</p>

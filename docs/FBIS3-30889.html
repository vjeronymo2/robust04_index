			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Medhmed Hodzha, deputy for the Rights and </F> Freedoms Movement, DPS, by Mira Stefanova and Nataliya Vuchkova;  place and date not given: "Mehmed Hodzha: DPS Is Full of  Informants"]    [Text] [KONTINENT] Mr. Khodzha, why did you leave the DPS  Parliamentary Group at this very moment?    [Hodzha] I was certainly not prompted by any emotional  reasons. My doubts started as early as in late 1992. I was  restrained by the concern about the DPS unity and about  preventing the DPS constituents from learning about our  disagreements, about the processes underway in our parliamentary  group and in the Central Council. I very seriously objected to  the developments in late 1992, when Mr. Stefan Savov was  overthrown from the post of parliamentary chairman. I still do  not understand why all this happened. The same applies to the  subsequent events with the fall of Filip Dimitrov's government  and the efforts to form a cabinet under Yordan Sokolov. As  early as at that time I suspected my party's leadership of  biased intentions. I had the feeling that all their actions  were inspired by exterior forces, that it was not the wish of  our constituents they were following, and that all these  developments did not serve the people's interests. Naturally,  the DPS Parliamentary Group and the Central Council found very  convenient motives to explain the situation to their  constituents, pretending that all their actions were aimed at  solving the people's socioeconomic problems.    [KONTINENT] Mr. Hodzha, what makes you so sure that your  misgivings and forebodings about such biased actions have  already been confirmed?    [Hodzha] The DPS Central Council and the Parliamentary Group  had decided that a bill or a draft resolution on disclosing  personal police files should be moved as soon as possible, or in  case another parliamentary group should submit such a proposal,  our group would support it. Nevertheless, our leadership and  its entourage did not support the draft resolution in question  when it was submitted.    [KONTINENT] Do any former police informants exist among the  DPS members?    [Hodzha] They definitely exist. A leading member of  parliamentary group had the insolence and arrogance of proposing  to the group that we should support the nomination of Filip  Bokov [from the Bulgarian Socialist Party] as head of the  Bulgarian delegation to the European Parliamentary Assembly.  This was a question of principle for us. It could have been  our second great blunder. It was prevented with great efforts.    I am genuinely concerned about the negligent attitude of our  DPS Parliamentary Group leadership, about its unwillingness to  visit the areas of our constituents. In the community of  Dzhebel, in part of the Krumovgrad, Ardino, and Kirkovo  communities, even not one kg of the "Basma" tobacco variety has  been purchased. last week a telegram was dispatched to all  members of parliament from the Kurdzhali election district, with  copies of the letter to the National Assembly Presidium and the  Council of Ministers, asking for their presence at a meeting  scheduled to take place on Saturday [29 February]. No one  attended the meeting. What does it mean? It means a total lack  of responsibility whatsoever toward the electorate. The excuse  of one of our Parliamentary Group leaders was it would have been  our duty to pass a bill on tobacco growing and processing and to  force the government and the Bulgartabak Company to set a  minimum purchasing price. However, much more than that is at  stake. The existence of a whole economic branch and the  survival of numerous human beings are at stake, as a matter of  fact.    [KONTINENT] Would you return to parliament after the next  elections as a deputy of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS],  for example?    [Hodzha] It depends on the local people, namely on the  constituents. I am not the one to decide. If people,  regardless of their ethnic origins, think that I would be  eligible on the basis of my behavior and my actions, on the  basis of my stand, if they become convinced that I am capable of  defending their interests, I would not decline such a proposal.  Naturally, I leave everything to them. I would not have the  courage to appear before those people and try through mediators,  or through hired persons, to persuade them that they should put  my name on the list of candidates for the next elections.    [KONTINENT] Whose interests is the current DPS leadership  serving in your view?    [Hodzha] They are serving alien interests, under all  circumstances. I understand their dilemma. They are really  under severe pressure, but in what case can someone be subject  to pressure and blackmail? It can only be done with something  stronger than a police file. Those people are trained [by  Communists], and they would not get the permission of certain  agencies outside the DPS to do something more for democracy.  They are simply not free to do so.    If I had been a traitor and an informant, if I had really  worked against my fellow villagers, I would not hold my present  position, because no one would have elected me. However, there  is something much more serious at stake. The DPS leadership is  just following somebody's secret instructions. Such leaders  cannot be free and they cannot possibly act in the interest of  their constituents.</p>

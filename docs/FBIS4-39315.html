			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Kanat Saudabayev, who is on a visit  to Moscow, met Oleg Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the  Russian Government. They had a detailed and frank exchange of  opinions on a wide range of problems of mutual interest.  Special attention was focused on the necessity to increase  integration processes both in political and economic spheres.  Soskovets, in particular, stressed the importance of removing  the tendency to politization of economy, which has manifested  itself of late. The sides expressed their belief that it is  urgent to invigorate work and implement the agreements reached  during Nazarbayev's first ever official visit to Russia in late  March. Big hopes to this effect are placed on the  Kazakh-Russian intergovernmental commission. Concurrently, in  the interests of overcoming the decline of production, both  states should actively use possibilities connected with  development of direct contacts between separate regions and  enterprises, and encourage targeted investment in business.</p>

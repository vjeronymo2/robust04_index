			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> NEA Ads: A liberal political action group will start a series of radio and  print advertisements in defense of the National Endowment for the Arts in  select markets targeted in part to reach key Republican members of Congress.  The Washington-based People for the American Way said its radio spots --  scheduled to start running in some markets today -- will feature Garrison  Keillor, Kathleen Turner and Colleen Dewhurst. Print ads -- scheduled to run  starting in mid-June in the New York Times, USA Today, the Hollywood Reporter  and Daily Variety -- include graphics of Roman images of nude women, complete  with black rectangles and a headline reading, "Imagine if Jesse Helms had been  a Roman senator."

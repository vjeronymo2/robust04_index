			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts climb on speculation of further interest rate cuts THE UK government bond market gained three-quarters of a point in volatile trading, with speculation about further interest rate cuts and a change in the funding rule serving to drive up the market. The gilt market started on a strong note, continuing Wednesday's rally, but early gains were wiped out by profit-taking. However, gilt prices later picked up ahead of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Mansion House speech. Dealers said the gilt market hoped that Mr Norman Lamont's speech would contain promises of further cuts in interest rates as well as possible changes in the full funding rule. The 9 per cent gilt due 2008 rose from 102 15/16 at Wednesday's close, to end at 103, while shorter-dated issues ended weaker or unchanged. THE Bundesbank's decision to leave its key interest rates unchanged, coupled with the release of poor inflation figures, disappointed the German government bond market, and bunds ended lower on the day. Consumer prices for the western German state of Hesse rose 0.6 per cent in the month to mid-October and were up 4.0 per cent from a year ago. The preliminary western German inflation rate showed a month-on-month increase of 0.4 per cent and a year-on-year rate of 3.8 per cent - higher than expected. The inflation figures killed hopes for an easing in the near term and pushed bund prices lower. New issuance in the D-Mark sector also helped to depress bund prices yesterday following the formal pricing of the Republic of Finland's DM1bn Eurobond issue. The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 91.59 and reached a high of 91.66 early on, but then dropped to a low of 91.18. US Treasury prices were firmer at the long end of the market yesterday, with sentiment receiving a mild boost from a tightening in the election race and some poor jobs figures. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/4 at 96, yielding 7.584 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, however, down  1/16 at 99 27/32 to carry a yield of 4.316 per cent. Traders reported that, with the week's main economic statistics and the two big Treasury auctions out of the way, business was extremely light, although there was some retail interest during the day. That was probably sparked by the day's only economic news, which provided some support to buyers. The latest weekly jobless claims figures showed an increase of 8,000 people claiming state unemployment insurance, a slightly bigger rise than expected by market analysts. Recent jobs numbers have suggested that labour market conditions were gradually improving, but yesterday's jobless claims data cast a cloud over that judgment. The latest opinion polls from the presidential race also affected the market. They showed that Governor Bill Clinton's lead over President Bush has narrowed into single digits. Although some observers believe it is too late for Mr Bush to catch up, the figures indicate the final result could be much closer than expected. This buoyed Treasury investors, who over the past few weeks have been selling government securities on fears that, if Governor Clinton won the presidency, he would quickly institute an aggressive fiscal policy that could push up interest rates, revive inflationary pressures and widen the deficit. Any sign that Mr Bush still has a fighting chance, therefore, was greeted warmly by the market. THE Bank of France cut one of its key money market intervention rates yesterday, but dealers said the move had little impact on the French government bond market. The central bank lowered the rate on its five-10 day securities repurchase agreements from 13 per cent to 10.5 per cent - the level at which it had been before the recent currency turmoil. Dealers said the move was intended to signal that the French franc was no longer under pressure from speculators. Yields on short-dated bonds ended the day slightly higher, while the long end was unchanged. JAPANESE government bonds continued to rally as short-term money market rates fell to their lowest in four years. The December futures contract climbed from its opening of 107.41 to a high of 107.55, and closed at 107.50. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 145 moved from 4.73 per cent to close at 4.715 per cent. The yield touched 4.705 per cent, the lowest level for the benchmark since December 1988. The market took its bullish tone from the easing in short-term interest rates.</p>

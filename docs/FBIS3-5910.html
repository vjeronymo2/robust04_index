According to the National Plant Quarantine Service on  Friday,  74,520,000 tons of imported grains and special crops were found  unacceptable.    The amount accounted for 44.1 percent of the total brought  into the country last year.    By item, the "unacceptable" goods represented 75 percent of  the total corn imported last year, 74.3 percent of raw coffee,  38.7 percent of sesame, 35.1 percent of red bean, 33.3 percent  of soy bean, and 8.9 percent of wheat.    The quarantine service had importers exterminate blight and  insects before the items affected were cleared through the  customs. Those which could not be properly disinfected were  discarded.    The imported items discarded last year included 502 tons of  acorns and 309 tons of dried fernbrakes, both from China, and 28  tons of grapefruits from the United States.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Josef Suk - Wigmore Hall It is the bicentenary of Mozart's death, the centenary of Prokofiev's birth, and the 150th anniversary of Antonn Dvorak's. The first is being celebrated everywhere, the second has just been marked on the South Bank, and the almost unsung third was sweetly commemorated at the Wigmore Hall on Tuesday night with a recital devoted to his violin and piano music, performed by his great-grandson Josef Suk and the fine pianist Gordon Back. More momentous tributes to Dvorak's genius can easily be imagined - his violin and piano pieces are distinctively minor, though generally enjoyable; and there was something business-like about the concert - one piece tossed off after another - that scarcely honoured him. Suk's blood-relationship with him counted for little, as far as I could sense, in the way of mystique; there was small sense of occasion. But Suk is an absolutely sterling player, with a big, warm, assiduously vibratoed sound and a masterful technique. There is an air of instant accomplishment about his music-making, as though difficulties can't exist; at the same time there is a slightly stifling uniformity about his interpretations; he always seems to be moving between decisive despatch and tearful intensity, without investigating intermediate shades of feeling. He is the opposite of a mannered player. The programme went backwards in time from the Four Romantic Pieces, Op. 75, of 1887 (the third, with its contrast of flowing piano part and jerky violin rhythm, commanded attention) to the brief, unusual Nocturne, Op. 40, begun in 1875; then lurched forward for the final item, the well-beloved unpretentious Sonatina in G, Op. 100, of 1893. The bubbling melodious appeal of the latter (inescapeably nostalgic for anyone who learned the violin at school) was all the more refreshing after the full-dress Sonata in F, Op. 57 (1880), which was given a sympathetic enough reading earlier (nice bravura passage-work from Mr. Back at the end) but still seemed dutiful and dull. The stormy section of the Ballade in D minor, Op. 15 (1884), found Suk in splendidly vigorous form.</p>

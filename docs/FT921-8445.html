			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Luck and good management behind IMF success: The astonishing turnaround in the Dominican Republic's economy THE octogenarian president of the Dominican Republic spends most of his evenings between 7pm and 9pm signing the cheques to pay the central government's bills. Surrounded by ministers and advisers, President Joaquin Balaguer, though blind, is reputed to be painstaking. He will not sign a cheque if there is no money to cover it, an approach that sounds like a perfect way to ensure the government balances the budget. In fact, it has guaranteed no such thing: by focusing purely on cash in hand and bills when presented, it takes no account of the transactions being undertaken on the government's behalf. Furthermore, it ignores the operations of the central bank, with which central government was running up substantial arrears, and the rest of the public sector. This was why, despite a Victorian housewife's approach to the central government's budget, President Balaguer's government was printing money at a rate sufficient to produce unprecedented inflation of over 100 per cent in 1990. In the second half of 1990, the Dominican Republic appeared on the brink of financial collapse. Many households were suffering power cuts for 20 hours or more a day, many lost water supplies for much of the day. Petrol and food shortages developed, damaging the important tourist trade. The net foreign exchange reserves were negative and the government was behind in payments to all its creditors, forcing the World Bank, an important source of development capital, to suspend disbursements on its loans. However, since then, there has been an astonishing change. Most estimates suggest prices rose by less than 5 per cent in 1991. Most forecasts for this year suggest it will climb back, perhaps into double figures, as the economy recovers from the sharp decline of the last two years. Because interest rates were freed, and adjusted for inflation yielded positive returns for depositors, Dominicans have started to bring money back from the US, where interest rates have dropped. Perhaps up to Dollars 300m entered the country because of this last year, helping to stabilise the exchange rate. This was expected to have declined to 14.50 pesos to the US dollar by the end of last year, according to the economic programme agreed with the International Monetary Fund in the middle of last year. Instead it has stood since April at around 12.50 pesos to the dollar. Dominican central bank figures show the public sector deficit dropped from 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1989 and 5.1 per cent in 1990 to 0.1 per cent last year. Arrears to the World Bank and other international organisations were cleared in April. Rarely has the IMF seen such a rapid turnround. The programme was launched only in August 1990 by President Balaguer soon after he started his sixth term of office. Dismissing the former central bank governor, President Balaguer appointed Mr Luis Toral, a party official but no economist. Mr Toral appears to have taken the advice of the IMF, which could not lend money immediately while the government was behind in payments to international financial institutions. But by not signing an agreement with the Fund until last July, Mr Toral has managed to create the impression domestically that the new programme was entirely fashioned in the republic. This approach may have helped avoid riots such as those that greeted previous IMF austerity measures in 1984, even though the economy has shrunk considerably since the measures were introduced. Official figures suggest GDP fell 5 per cent in 1990 and stayed static last year. With official data in the country often unreliable, some private estimates suggest GDP may have fallen by a further 2 per cent last year. The government's success in bringing down inflation, and the renewed prospects for growth, suggest a rare combination, for the Dominican Republic, of good luck and good economic management. The measures included a unification of the four exchange rates and a liberalisation of the exchange rate regime, and the interest rate liberalisation. They stopped the central bank issuing currency without money from central government, and most significantly slashed subsidies on many goods including electricity and petrol, which having more than trebled in price is now close to world levels. The government used the sharp rise in oil prices caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait as the pretext for raising gasoline prices. When prices subsequently fell, Dominican consumers saw no benefit. The government coffers did, however. Mr Andres Dauhajre, executive director of a Santo Domingo pro-market study group, the Economic and Development Foundation, estimates the rise in oil prices lowered the public sector deficit by the equivalent of 2 per cent of GDP. The government now makes money on every gallon of petrol sold, and petroleum imports have dropped from 50,000 barrels a day to about 34,000. Structural reforms, such as reforming the customs code, have also been undertaken. Tax reform and financial sector reform are also firmly on the agenda. The difficulty is that, while much more remains to be done to convince those inside and outside the country that some reliable and consistent rules will apply to economic activity in the Dominican Republic, much of what has been done so far has been accomplished by decree. Thus they are not fixed in law and can easily be cancelled by decree by this or future administrations. Neither are people convinced that the government's economic policy is guided with a medium or long-term aim in mind. Policy appears to be decided still 'on a day-to-day basis', according to Mr Hugo Guiliani Cury, a former central bank governor and now a bank president. Still, the measures appear to have generated more optimism than has existed for years over the prospects for the Dominican economy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Nikolayev Oblast -- On 22 May, Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk made a working trip to the town of Pervomaysk,  during the course of which he was at a [Ukrainian poet]  Shevchenko festival, which took place under the name: "In a  Free and New Family." After it had ended, Kravchuk replied to  questions from journalists.    Speaking about the actions of Crimea's parliament, which has  renewed the text of the Republic of Crimea's Constitution in its  6 May 1992 edition (in particular it is about mutual relations  between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and  agreements, dual citizenship, and setting up military formations  on the peninsula's territory), Ukraine's president noted that  the appeal by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko to the  world community condemning the position of the Crimean deputies  had received the support of many international organizations.    The head of the Ukrainian state assesses the "Ostankino"  Television Company's portrayal of the events on the Crimean  peninsula as the conscious incitement of people to confrontation.    Replying to a question regarding the work of Ukraine's  Supreme Council, Kravchuk emphasized that the beginning was more  optimistic than the further work of the parliament. "Although  when we were discussing the Crimea issue in the Supreme Council  I saw that the majority of deputies had a responsible attitude  to the Crimean problem." In the opinion of Ukraine's president,  life will put everything in its place and parliament will occupy  the proper statesmanlike position.    Kravchuk observed that he had not changed his views on the  presidential election. In this, in particular, he is supported  by the leadership of Nikolayev and its oblast. "In order to  elect a president it is necessary to create a legal basis for  power. Incidentally, Crimea is a vivid confirmation of this.  Crimea got autonomy in 1990, but the law on the delimitation of  powers was adopted two years later. In this time the legal  vacuum was filled, which led to a situation where the  accumulated political and legal problems may be resolved only by  returning to a starting position."    To a question regarding the truth about our state being  pushed "from below" toward a federative system, the president  said that in order to elaborate federative laws one should have  a professional parliament and work every day for three years.</p>

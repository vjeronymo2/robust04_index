Shortly after his arrival,  the two governments held bilateral talks in the Presidential  Villa. State House correspondent, Chris Ngu, reports on  President Ousmane's first stay in Abuja.    [Ngu] The Nigerien [Nigerois] President was received on  arrival by the head of state, General Sani Abacha, and top  members of his administration, including the chief of general  staff, Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya and a number of  ministers. The airport reception featured the traditional  21-gun salute, a guard of honor inspected by the visiting head  of state, and displays by Nigerian cultural groups. Bilateral  talks were held behind closed doors. However, in the opening  session just before the talks proper, head of state, Gen.  Abacha, had said that Nigeria-Niger relations over the years  could justify reference to Nigeriens as brothers. He said he  looked forward to additional new ways of forging closer and more  fruitful relations between both countries.    President Ousmane expressed similar hope as Gen. Abacha. He  said the Niger-Nigeria relations have been reinforced over the  years by geographical, historical, and cultural factors common  to both countries. He said he hoped that the talks will help  consolidate relations between the two countries. The outcome of  the talks is yet to be made public. About now, a state banquet  in honor of the visiting head of state should be taking place in  Abuja. He is expected to return to his country tomorrow.</p>

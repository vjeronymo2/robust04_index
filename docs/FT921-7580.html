			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UN worried by cost of Yugoslav operation THE United Nations Security Council is expected to approve a formal resolution today launching the long-awaited international peacekeeping force for Yugoslavia, the first ever in continental Europe. However, the cost of the proposed year-long operation was estimated last night to be as much as Dollars 635m, raising questions whether the UN could afford this and the possibility that members might insist on cuts. Earlier estimates did not exceed Dollars 400m. The increase resulted from proposals by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, for a 40 per cent increase in force personnel to about 14,000, including 530 police. A financial document was promised yesterday and then withheld until further discussions could be held with the US, Britain, France, Russia and China, the Security Council's permanent members, which must foot much of the bill. Current peacekeeping operations have already created severe financial problems for the UN as many members have failed to pay their contributions. The US is the biggest delinquent. With the Cambodia peacekeeping operation expected to cost the UN close to Dollars 2bn in the next 12 months, questions now are being asked as to whether the organisation may be getting out of its depth financially.</p>

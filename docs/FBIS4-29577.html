			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Tokyo NHK General Television Network at  0000 GMT on 19 June, in its 60-minute live roundtable discussion  program titled "Sunday Discussion," carries an approximately 21-  minute interview with Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa on the  situation on the Korean Peninsula. The program, entitled "The  Issue of the DPRK's Suspected Nuclear Development -- What Is  President Kim Il-song Really Thinking?," is participated in by  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, Keio University professor Masao  Okonogi, NHK Political Department reporter Ryuichi Tejima, and  later by Serig Harrison -- according to on-screen caption -- a  member of the Carnegie International Peace Foundation and Pak  Su-kil -- according to on-screen caption -- director of the ROK  Foreign and Security Affairs Research Institute, with NHK  Commentator Takashi Yamamoto serving as moderator.    At 0002 GMT, after a brief video review on recent  developments in the situation on the Korean Peninsula, Yamamoto  introduces today's guests, explaining the program will have two  parts with the first half placing emphasis on an interview with  Foreign Minister Kakizawa and the second half of the program  will be for discussions among the participants in the NHK studio  and participants in Seoul and Washington through a satellite  hookup.    Yamamoto first asks Kakizawa about his evaluation of the  drastic change in the situation following former U.S. President  Carter's visit to the DPRK. Kakizawa says: "In talks with  Carter, the DPRK sent various messages such as the freezing of  its nuclear development program and a guarantee for nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]. I  think the DPRK gave positive answers in the talks. In this  sense, the talks have provided the basis for talks between the  United States and the DPRK... [pauses] truly speaking there is  the possibility that the talks will be considered as having  paved the way for future U.S.-DPRK talks. In this sense, the  talks were meaningful." He adds that after hearing the details  of the talks form Carter, the Clinton administration will add  finishing touches through diplomatic channels to what has been  discussed between Carter and Kim Il-song. But he says it will  take some time before the third round of U.S.- DPRK talks is  held.    Asked what he thinks about the possibility of summit talks  between South and North Korea, Kakizawa notes: "We hope that  summit talks will materialize. But the two sides need to  discuss at the working level details of the talks, such as  places for them, and I think such working level talks will be  held early next week."    At 0005 GMT, South Korean Foreign and Security Affairs  Research Institute Director Pak Su-kil joins the program via a  satellite hookup. Asked about how the South Korean Government  views the DPRK's offer to hold summit talks. Pak, speaking in  Korean with voiced-over simultaneous translation in Japanese,  quotes Kim Yong- sam as accepting the DPRK's proposal to hold  summmit talks. Pak then cites what was discussed between Kim  Yong-sam and Carter in Seoul on 18 June.    In the NHK studio, Keio University professor Okonogi gives  his view on the situation, saying Pyongyang aimed to take the  opportunity of Carter's visit as breakthrough in the situation.  Saying Pyongyang has turned to taking a flexible, realistic  approach, Yamamoto asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa what he thinks  of such an attitude. Kakizawa answers: "The DPRK has taken such  an attitude mindful of the fact that its replacement of all of  the fuel rods from experimental reactors has caused unexpectedly  harsh criticism by the international community, including China.  I think Kim Il-song must have thought that if no progress were  made in the situation, resolutions for sanctions against the  DPRK will be adopted at the UN Security Council [UNSC], thus  driving Pyongyang into a corner, and that it is necessary to  decisively provide a breakthrough, as professor Okonogi has  said, by taking advantage of Carter's visit to Pyongyang before  the situation becomes worse for the DPRK. But there are still  some vague points in Pyongyang's position. Although Kim Il-song  has reportedly proposed freezing the nuclear development  program, I wonder what he means by freeze. He also said the DPRK  will freeze its program if the United States extends cooperation  in transforming its graphite-based reactor into a light-water  reactor. But it takes much time, and I wonder who will bear the  cost. In addition, when Pyongyang comes to accept the IAEA  inspections, I wonder -- although there are nuclear facilities  that are believed to be radioactive waste storage facilities --  whether the DPRK will accept special inspections of such  facilities. Special inspections of such facilities enables  the IAEA to judge whether reactors have been operated for  nuclear development purposes in the past. Unless special  inspections are made, the IAEA will not be able to grasp the  facts concerning nuclear development. For this reason, I wonder  whether the DPRK will accept special inspections." Citing Kim  Il-song's previous remarks that the DPRK has nothing to hide  expect military facilities, Kakizawa says: "I think, if what he  means by military facilities are the radioactive waste storage  facilities, there is a wide gap between the West and the DPRK in  their views on special inspections."    Yamamoto says it is still unclear whether inspections will  be made to judge whether the DPRK tried to develop nuclear  weapons in the past, and asks Foreign Minister Kakizawa how  Japan will deal with the issue of the DPRK's past nuclear  development activities. Kakizawa notes: "Japan is serious about  this issue because it considers that if the DPRK comes to  possess nuclear weapons in the future, it would drastically  change the framework of security in Northeast Asia and that the  DPRK's missiles, which are under development now, would become a  direct threat to Japan. Another concern is that if the  DPRK should come to develop nuclear arms, it would be a serious  blow to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT] -- which is  signed by 164 nations -- and cause distrust between NPT member  nations." He adds that if other nations should come to possess  nuclear weapons one after another, it would create a world trend  that seriously runs counter to Japan's three principles of not  making, possessing, or bringing in nuclear weapons. He then  says: "I hope the DPRK's past nuclear development plans will  also be included in the subject of inspections."    NHK reporter Tejima also asks what approach Japan will take  in having the DPRK's past nuclear development plans inspected.  Kakizawa says: "This will be the major issue to be solved." He  then notes the need to make efforts to keep close ties with the  United States and South Korea to ensure that the IAEA  inspections will include inspections of the DPRK's past nuclear  development activities. Asked if Japan plans to call on the  United States to make it clear that inspections will include  inspections of the DPRK's past development activities, Kakizawa  says it is necessary to see based on the results of coming  various talks between Washington and Pyongyang, reiterating  Japan welcomes the favorable development of the situation.    At 0018 GMT, Carnegie International Peace Foundation member  Serig Harrison in Washington joins the program through remote  hookup, citing U.S. Government reaction to the outcome of  Carter-Kim Il-song talks, stressing the effect of Japan's  cooperation in building a light-water reactor. Kakizawa says  "it is not easy for the government to win the people's  consensus" on cooperation in building a light-water reactor  because past talks between Japan and the DPRK on normalizing  diplomatic relations ended in failure due to the DPRK's own  convenience. Regarding the possible resumption of Japan- DPRK  talks, Kakizawa says: "Japan always opens its door to the DPRK.  If the DPRK wants to resume talks, Japan is willing to take its  seat for talks." Asked whether it is necessary to continue to  discuss sanction measures, Kakizawa says: "Although discussions  on sanctions will be continued until the situation becomes  clear, I think calls for sanctions at the UNSC will be toned  down because of the DPRK's positive message."    As for sanctions against the DPRK, NHK reporter Tejima  explains the major points of the sanctions proposed by the  United States. He then asks Kakizawa what went on in his recent  talks with Chinese leaders. Kakizawa reviews the outcome of his  talks, explaining China's basic stand of settling the issue  through dialogue. Citing the government as previously saying it  will act within the limits of the Constitution, Yamamoto asks  what it means by the limits of the Constitution. Kakizawa says  it is necessary to discuss to what extent Japan can implement  sanctions if they are adopted at the UNSC.    As the last question, Yamamoto asks Kakizawa what role Japan  can play in settling the issue. Kakizawa says: "Since the DPRK  seems to be placing emphasis on dialogue with the United States,  Japan intends to exchange opinions with the United States and  cooperate in materializing U.S.- DPRK talks." He stresses it is  also important to keep close contact with South Korea, China,  and Russia. At 0038 GMT, the interview with Kakizawa ends and  he leaves the studio.</p>

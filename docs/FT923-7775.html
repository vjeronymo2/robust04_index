			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Markets: Big brother casts cloud over water stocks - The Bottom Line SOMETHING odd has been happening to your water shares. The 10 privatised water and sewerage companies, which were planned as conservative, almost predictable, investments, have spent the year being anything but. For one thing, water has been the best-performing sector in the stock market this year, gaining almost 30 per cent relative to the All-Share index. For another, share prices have fluctuated wildly so far this month, rising and falling by several per cent each day. The gyrations are less mysterious than they appear. But they raise a valid question. After such strong gains, is it not time to take some profits and seek growth elsewhere? There are two reasons water stocks have performed so well. First, they were oversold ahead of the election on fears of a Labour victory and possible political interference. When Labour lost, the shares rallied even faster than the market. Second, as gloom about the economy mounted again during the summer, professional investors switched into water shares for their defensive qualities. Water companies are affected by recession because businesses go broke and houses go unoccupied. But because they are monopolies, the companies are protected from much of the downturn. And because of the pricing structure agreed before privatisation, they have been able to raise prices regardless. They also have the added attraction of guaranteed dividend growth, at least for the next couple of years. The water industry is being asked to invest at least Pounds 30bn on water and sewage improvements during the decade. To fund that investment, higher dividends are needed to keep institutional shareholders happy. Last year, dividends grew 10 per cent, compared with 3-4 per cent for the market, and similar growth is expected this year. As a result, water companies' shares are yielding just over 7 per cent, a 25 per cent premium to the market. With other companies, this could be a hint investors expect the dividend to be cut. But with dividends from the water sector secure, and with bigger companies like BP cutting their payments, water stocks still have plenty of supporters. 'If you think the market is motoring ahead, it's probably time to take a profit,' says Bill Dale, an analyst at SG Warburg. 'But if there's still more bad news to come, it is not time to dump your water shares. ' The question mark hanging over water stocks, however - and a contributory reason for their high yield - is regulatory. On Thursday, Ian Byatt, director-general of the regulator Ofwat, began a long process of negotiations with the companies which will end in 1994's periodic review of their pricing levels. The market was worried ahead of his presentation in case he started getting tough on companies, as the gas and telephone regulators have done. In the end, he concentrated more on the costs of meeting tough environmental standards and scarcely addressed the more sensitive issues of pricing and profit. Shares in Thames Water fell 7.5 per cent ahead of Byatt before recovering nearly all the gains once the market realised it was a false alarm. Welsh Water, thought to be at risk from regulatory clampdown, fell 6 per cent but then clawed back most of the losses. The sector index climbed nearly 4 per cent on Thursday alone. This kind of market turbulence is likely to become chronic in the lead-up to the periodic review. Next month, Byatt releases his thoughts on last year's profits. Next February, companies will submit business plans to Ofwat. The regulator will then discuss, and by 1994 decide, price caps for each company. It will also decide effective rates of return on investment and suggest levels of borrowings. Companies' unregulated profits, made in new areas like waste management, will also be reviewed. It is too early to say what effect the review will have on profits. But the regulatory regime is most likely to get tougher. Companies' K numbers, the amount they can raise prices ahead of inflation, are likely to be lowered when their interest bills will be rising to pay for new investment. Real dividend growth could fall from about 5 per cent to 1 per cent a year. Some observers say potential bad news is reflected already in share prices. Others remember that markets detest uncertainty. Either way, and even if market fears are exaggerated, the sector looks to be heading towards a period of underperformance until these issues are resolved. If so, the question is one of timing. In the short term, prices will be supported by general economic worries. Investors who switch out of water when there is a general upswing in market confidence will be placed best. Those who do not trust their timing can afford to make good this year's gains and wait.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Classicists rue decline of role in industry OLD rivalries between arts and science students resurfaced at the Oxford Union last night as captains of industry debated their relative merits. The motion before the house was that the British economy was better served by science graduates than arts graduates. Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM UK and a former Oxford classicist, told the chamber that arts graduates were vital to British industry. Ms Judith Hann, a presenter of the BBC's Tomorrow's World, complained that her employer was run by woolly-minded arts graduates incapable of analytical thought. Her husband, an arts graduate in a senior BBC post , was sitting on the opposition benches. Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman and another classicist, remarked with some regret that he and Sir Anthony were probably the last generation in which classicists would lead so much of British industry. Figures from the Oxford careers service indicate that the days of Oxbridge graduates of any discipline leading British industry may be numbered. Last year, the proportion of Oxford graduates going into manufacturing was the lowest since the second world war, at less than 5 per cent. Graduates themselves seem to have decided that degree discipline is irrelevant and the subsequent professional training is what matters: accountancy and law are now the favourite careers.</p>

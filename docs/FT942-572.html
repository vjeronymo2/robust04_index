			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Survey of Computer Networking (10): United, we stand a better chance - Groupwar / Good communications and the ability to share data helps make organisations efficient. Networked applications keep the work flowing, whether in finance, retail or manufacturing In a business world connected by networks, communication has become a vital part of competition. It is almost as important to understand the basics of how things connect, and the vital flow of processes, as it is to do the job itself. Speed of response is now a vital element of business: if not, then some rival organisation will move in first and win the business. The fashion for 'business process re-engineering' (BPR) has brought another challenge to human aptitude: how to adapt working practices and skills to a more efficient working of the entire organisation. The shift in thinking is not unlike the impact on manufacturing of 'just-in-time' techniques, but the target of most business process re-engineering is not the inventory of goods, but of people. Cutting costs, doing a better job, providing a better service with fewer staff, is the focus of many BPR projects. As a mere 'enabling' technology, networking is the method under-pinning many of these changes. Users have already caught on to the potential of e-mail alone: the sales of Lotus Development's LAN-based cc:mail and Lotus Notes products have doubled over the last few years, with an estimated 5m users worldwide. The next wave is 'workflow,' groupware and so-called 'intelligent' document management systems, (EDMS) often front-ended by document image processing (Dip) which is used to scan in images of paper documents. Early document management systems tended to be 'departmental.' They worked in a closed loop, relying on scanning in of paper (Dip), and beginning and ending the process in under one roof. That changed with the arrival of wide area networks using heterogeneous hardware, and with the fact that much internal information actually originates in electronic form. A workflow system, such as the Caress system used by British Airways to process customer complaints, can now use the network to access other departments, sending and receiving information vital in solving a customer's problem. The more recent availability of high-quality ISDN lines for data transmission adds another possibility to workflow applications: the sending of images as well as messages. Mr Rory Staunton, senior analyst at Gartner Group UK, is responsible for the Intelligent Document Management Service in Europe. He notes two intertwined themes: workflow tools, which he says originally arose as a way of differentiating document imaging products; and a clutch of emerging technologies including EDI, electronic data interchange, intelligent workflow and GIS (Geographical Information Systems). 'Workflow has extended well beyond distributing images towards business process modelling tools,' he says. 'In Europe, such products as ICL's ProcessWise, IBM's Flowmark and Staffware from SCMC are now being used to model business processes. They are enabled by modern high-speed LAN communications, but what is interesting is the emergence of high-speed networks in Europe such as ISDN. This has suddenly enabled traditional back-office operations to be brought nearer to customers so that they can add value.' As an example, he says that Phrasea of Paris, in the media business, is distributing quality colour images from its picture library, sending a high quality image down the line in 15 seconds - 'that has revolutionised the job of picture selection. The effect is to enable companies to reconsider the structure of their company document repositories, so that they can maintain the integrity and security of central archives whilst still delivering the latest information when it's needed, where it's needed - in other words, moving towards just-in-time documents, which don't go out of date unlike their paper counterparts.' Another option, for infrequently connected users, is to replicate the document repositories, a feature that characterises the market leader, Lotus Notes, which works by copying the database and sending it elsewhere. Mr Staunton puts the other 'enabling' technologies into order of importance: imaging, followed by Edi, then applied intelligence systems, and fourthly, GIS. 'Although those are key technologies for re-engineering, IT departments still talk about TCP-IP, client-server, and object oriented databases. The IT community still has to grasp the challenge of becoming 'enablers' of re-engineering rather than technology pushers.' In the automotive industry, which pioneered so much co-operative development in Edi, document management is providing the next step. Ford is using Intergraph software, an EDMS system with roots in technical authoring and desktop publishing, to create, publish, translate and distribute the documentation, workshop manuals and training material for its first 'world car,' the Mondeo. Ford's partner in developing an all-purpose vehicle, Volkswagen, uses the same system, which will help cut down the tight timescale in which such documentation has to be produced. The new vehicle is being built in Portugal: the documentation can in theory, be done anywhere. Office automation, the most visible and obvious of targets for streamlining, still poses IT problems, not least of infrastructure. The London Borough of Tower Hamlets recently rebuilt its entire IT operations, using five different but interconnected local area networks. The restructuring, helped by networking specialist Fibronics, had to be done within days, so essential was the network to the service Tower Hamlets provides. Eddie Best, business co-ordinator at Tower Hamlets, already notes a change in culture - 'with the new network there is a greater amount of shared data, which means more people are better informed. We are also experiencing a change in culture towards communication by electronic means. E-mail is quickly becoming indispensable.' Processing power in office automation applications, such as at Tower Hamlets,uses only a fraction of the computing power available. Financial applications, especially those involving complex computations, slow down networks much as heavy loads used to slow down the processing on mainframes. Nor are networks as adaptable to uneven processing loads. One solution is JetNet, a PC system that works on the time-sharing principle. As yet unproven on a very large scale - except in one remarkable application for the main telecommunications authority in New Zealand - it shares out unused PC power across the network to speed up intensive processes such as calculation and compilation. In financial and trading applications, more conventional solutions include the high-volume servers from Auspex Systems. Auspex specialises in high-speed file servers for applications like fixed income, and foreign exchange trading: anything involving fast processing for a great number of users. In mathematically intensive applications such as Collaterised Mortgage Obligation (CMO) calculations, the volume of processing can put a strain on networks. An increasing amount of 'intelligent' analysis, based on pre-determined rules, increases the workload further. 'Networks have lowered the costs of analytical applications dramatically, combined with Unix and inexpensive Ethernet high-speed networking,' explains Dr Bruce Nelson, chief technologist at Auspex. 'Large groups such as Amex can now use networks of low-cost Unix computers for intensive processing. Everyone is looking to keep costs at rock-bottom. 'IT planners in a lot of financial institutions probably think of putting 50-100 users of Ethernet and token ring networks for such applications as word processing. But for advanced trading applications, such as foreign exchange options and CMO, the computational power needed is so high that as few as 10 workstations can burn up an Ethernet.' It is this trend that has driven companies like Auspex to supply server products that can support 24 simultaneous Ethernets with four simultaneous FDDIs (fibre distributed data interfaces), and hundreds of gigabytes of online disc storage, he says.</p>

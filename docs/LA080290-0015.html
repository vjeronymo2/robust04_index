			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> AMERICANS HAVE HAD ENOUGH;  </P> <P> ARTS POLLUTED WITH FILTH CAN MAKE A SOCIETY SICK UNTO DEATH.  </P> <P> Referring to Roseanne Barr's rendition of the national anthem, before the San  Diego Padres-Cincinnati Reds game, Johnny Carson joked, "I haven't heard a  sound like that since I had my cat neutered."  </P> <P> As Barr finished shrieking out the verses of "The Star-Spangled Banner," 30,000  fans stood and booed. She then grabbed her crotch and spat.  </P> <P> This time, Roseanne's patented crudity didn't play; she went too far. Players  and fans alike were revolted by her swinish mockery of a ceremony Americans  take as a sign of reverence for their country. The singing of the national  anthem is a moment of patriotic unity, of suspended disagreement, before  athletic rivalries ensue. The booing at Jack Murphy Stadium spoke not only for  the President, who found her conduct outrageous, but for the country.  </P> <P> Maybe, just maybe, Americans have had enough.  </P> <P> Recently, the rutting music of 2 Live Crew, lyrics to which are so vile they  cannot be printed here, got a Ft. Lauderdale distributor charged with obscenity  -- to general applause.  </P> <P> The National Endowment for the Arts has become a standing joke around every  political campfire for funding an exhibit of the late Robert Mapplethorpe's  photographs that featured a shot of him with a bullwhip sticking out of his  rectum, for funding the "Piss Christ" of Andres Serrano, for funding the  performances of one New York lady who masturbates and urinates on stage.  </P> <P> In the last 12 months, America has begun to react as a healthy body ought when  slowly fed poisons that can kill it. But reaction is not enough. Conservatives  need to exploit this mood of national rage against filthy and blasphemous art,  against general coarseness and crudity, to rally a movement to recapture  America's culture.  </P> <P> "Seventy years ago," James Cooper writes in American Arts Quarterly, "the  Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci . . . wrote (that) the important mission for  Socialism was to 'capture the culture.' By the end of World War II, the liberal  Left had managed to capture not only the arts, theater, literature, music and  ballet, but also motion pictures, photography, education and the media."  </P> <P> Nowhere was the capture more complete than the arts.  </P> <P> Recently, in Washington, there appeared a new sculpture -- rows of oil drums,  protruding from the ground at 45 degrees, up to 15 feet in the air, painted  gold. Someone said the meaning of the work has to do with the price of oil.  </P> <P> It is minimalist junk of a kind to be found today in front of virtually every  federal building in Washington. Where did this junk come from? How did this  happen, when conservatives have won five of six national elections, and,  presumably, had a voice in what kind of "art" went in front of our federal  buildings?  </P> <P> To most Americans, as long as the art is not outrageous, it is irrelevant. This  is a mistake. Just as water polluted with mercury will slowly destroy the  brain, drinking for decades from a culture polluted with modernist dreck can  make a society sick unto death.  </P> <P> "(W)hile conservatives have kept alive a political alternative to Marxism  (capitalism)," Cooper writes, "they abandoned cultural standards that might  serve as an alternative to modernism.  </P> <P> "In the words of Samuel Lipman, publisher of the New Criterion, 'the Right  voted with their feet.' Conservatives returned to moneymaking and Cold War  strategies, straightened out their George Stubbs engravings of English  thoroughbred horses on their office walls, and forgot about the whole matter.  After all, they reasoned, how important is culture?  </P> <P> "They made little connection between the decline of education and family values  and a subsequent rise in the crime, drugs (and) violence destroying society  with its nihilistic anti-Americanism.  </P> <P> "Conservatives seemingly never read Mao Tse-tung on waging cultural war against  the West. Such essays were prescribed reading for the Herbert  Marcuse-generation of the 1960s, who now run our cultural institutions."  </P> <P> It is not enough, then, to protest. Anger and outrage against the gross and  blasphemous need to be channeled into a plan to recapture the culture. If the  NEA is not defunded, it should be taken over and cleaned out, beginning with  Chairman John Frohnmayer, extending to every review panel that passed on the  disgusting art. And Bush and his Cabinet officers ought to order the junk  outside the Cabinet departments dug up, put on the auction block and replaced.  </P> <P> Why should we go abroad and be awed by the public art of once-great nations and  have to return home to be embarrassed by the public art of the greatest nation  on Earth?  </P></p>

Morris] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- Two of the Green Party's (GP)  candidates in the Western Cape have left the party in outrage at  a manifesto which calls for the legalisation and mass production  of dagga as a purportedly ecologically sound alternative  resource. The GP's manifesto--with the words "Freedom of Choice  printed in an arc over a dagga leaf--also calls for freedom of  choice for private consumption of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana  etc."    Candidates Ian Williams and Zarin Thomson had no idea these  were central tenets of Green policy. Mr. Thomson said: "The  initial constitution which I agreed with when I accepted  candidature differs significantly from the manifesto upon which  the Green Party is contesting the election. The new Green Party  manifesto supports the legalisation of marijuana, and advocates  narcotic usage. This contrary to my personal philosophy," he  said.    The manifesto suggests the mass cultivation of hemp  (cannabis  sativa, popularly called dagga) would be good for the ecology,  and the economy. It advocates the dagga plant as a  "self-fertilising cash crop" with uses ranging from producing  "green (ethanol) fuel" to clothing.</p>

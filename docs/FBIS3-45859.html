This will raise the amount of U.S. aid to Belarus for  dismantling the missiles in the former Soviet republic to 100  million dollars.    Clinton arrived here today following his summit meeting with  Russian President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow.    Clinton also signed an agreement with the chairman of the  Belarus Supreme Soviet, Stanislav Shushkevich, for promoting and  protecting investments in Belarus.    Shushkevich highly approves of the U.S. proposal to  establish  a "partnership for peace" relationship between Western nations  and former Eastern Bloc countries.    In return, Clinton pledged support for the democratization  process and economic reforms in Belarus.    Clinton also met with the chairman of the Belarus Council of  Ministers, Vyacheslav Frantsevich Kebich.</p>

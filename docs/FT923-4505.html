			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Ford to spend Dollars 1bn on Spanish plant for new engine FORD, the US carmaker, is to invest more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) for development and production of a new small engine range in Valencia, Spain. The new plant, which will have capacity to build up to 550,000 engines a year - 2,550 a day - is expected to start production in May 1995 on an existing site, with full production to be reached in 1997. The engines will be used mainly in Ford's Fiesta and Escort cars and will replace the group's HCS small engine range, also produced in Valencia. The investment is a further step in Ford's ambitious plan to replace most of its European engine range by the mid-1990s and follows the launch late last year of its medium-sized Zeta engines, which are being produced at its Bridgend plant in south Wales, where about Pounds 300m has been invested. The Dollars 2bn Zeta engine programme is for a 1.6-2.0 litre family of engines. They will also be produced in Cologne, Germany, and in Mexico. In Europe they are already being fitted in the Escort/Orion and will also power the replacement car for the existing Sierra to be launched early next year. The Sigma engine to be built in Valencia, will be a four cylinder, 16 valve, twin-cam power unit, with an aluminium block and cylinder head. It will be a range of 1.0-1.4 litre engines. The new engine has been designed and developed for Ford by Yamaha of Japan, which won a contract for the full development of the engine up to the prototype stage. Yamaha is responsible for about a third of the total development work on the engine. This is the first time Ford of Europe has contracted out such an important element of its mainstream engine development programme to an outside engineering company and the first time it has turned to Japan. Ford says the scale of its existing commitments to develop new engines made it impossible to develop the entire Sigma engine project with its own engineering resources in Europe. Ford itself will carry out the testing, evaluation and production engineering for the engine. It has previously indicated that it could invest in a second production phase for the Sigma engine with an additional capacity for 300,000 engines a year, which would probably be built at Valencia or at Bridgend. Ford's engine programme is being drastically updated, however, and it is also working to develop the Orbital two-stroke engine as an alternative unit to power small cars, including a possible minicar smaller than its Fiesta supermini.</p>

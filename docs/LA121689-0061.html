			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD DE KLERK GET A STATE VISIT?  </P> <P> Like his predecessor, Pieter W. Botha, South Africa President Frederik W. de  Klerk is intent on repairing relations with other nations. Thus, much is being  made in Pretoria of the royal reception De Klerk was accorded on his visit to  the Ivory Coast, his first visit out of the country since his election. But  there is nothing to judge the significance of the trip beyond its cordial  atmospherics.  </P> <P> Unlike his predecessor, De Klerk has articulated a commitment to broad  political change. This has inspired suggestions that Washington follow the  example of the Ivory Coast with an invitation for a state visit by De Klerk and  a relaxation of sanctions. This would be a mistake, as the Bush Administration  seems to understand. Washington, wisely, has adopted a wait-and-see attitude  while giving the new South African leader the benefit of the doubt until proven  otherwise.  </P> <P> Caution is dictated by two considerations. First, the reforms that De Klerk has  undertaken, however remarkable they may seem against the background of  repressive racism in South Africa, are largely cosmetic and do not yet address  the fundamentals of racism and segregation that drive apartheid. And, second,  what few reforms there are appear to be coming in response to pressure, not  least the pressure of American sanctions (even though they have not been  faithfully applied).  </P> <P> The goal of the Bush Administration is "a nonracial and democratic South  Africa," Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for African affairs,  told Congress recently. De Klerk has rejected both concepts, affirming instead  government by groups, meaning races, while rejecting universal suffrage in the  sense commonly understood in practicing democracies -- that is, one person, one  vote.  </P> <P> Cohen spelled out some of the conditions required if there's to be any chance  to achieve the dialogue De Klerk has promised the people of South Africa. Among  those conditions are an end to the 4-year-old national state of  emergency,release of Nelson Mandela and the other political prisoners, return  of the political exiles and legalization of the African National Congress and  other opposition groups that are now banned.  </P> <P> The new assistant secretary recognized the importance of "balancing pressure  and incentives" and, in so doing, specifically committed the Administration "to  effective enforcement of our existing sanctions." This commitment is now being  tested following exposure in The Times of flagrant abuses in steel imports from  South Africa by Americans ready to look for loopholes rather than adhere to the  intent of the law. This matter is now under review by the State Department.  </P> <P> As we understand Administration thinking, it will be watching the next session  of the South African Parliament with special interest. The Parliament convenes  in February and ends in July. On its agenda will be De Klerk's call for  abolition of the Separate Amenities Act. Though promising, that would be but a  modest beginning of what needs to happen if there is to be true dialogue. His  cutbacks in military service and the military budget also are promising. So was  his surprise visit with Mandela -- and his commitment Friday to cooperate with  Mozambique. But only when there has been fulfillment of the fundamentals for  dialogue can Washington usefully consider an invitation to De Klerk to come to  the White House.  </P> <P> Yes, communication is important, and Felix Houphouet-Boigny, president of the  Ivory Coast, whose collaboration with South Africa is long-standing, may have  helped it along. Other South African presidents have been welcomed to Abidjan,  but none with the ceremony accorded De Klerk. The meaning of the visit,  however, will be measured not just in expanding contacts between Pretoria and  other African nations, but what it means for the disenfranchised black majority  in South Africa.  </P></p>

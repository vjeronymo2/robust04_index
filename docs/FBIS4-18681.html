			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mario Segni, Pact for Italy leader, by </F> Antonello Caporale; place and date not given: "Segni: `Now I  Will Begin Again, Starting With the TV Channels'" -- first three  paragraphs are LA REPUBBLICA introduction]    [Text] Rome -- "I am telling you: to the bitter end." To  the bitter end? "I am prepared to lay down in front of  Montecitorio [Chamber of Deputies] in order to get this law  passed. I am prepared to enter into an alliance with the devil  in order to succeed."    Mario Segni has finished keeping Lent. Today, it is his turn  to speak, epitomizing the defeated. He has seen his home burnt  down, the home which he built with his own hands: the new  electoral law, the prime minister's direct election. This was  supposed to mark the renewal of democracy. He was supposed to  be the new leader. Everything went up in smoke.    The [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi bulldozer first knocked  him down and then crushed him. The enemy troops even conquered  the Sassari stronghold. Now he has to start again from scratch.  He has 12 deputies and four senators with him. Little more  than nothing at all.    [Caporale] From where will you start?    [Segni] From TV. From a profound and thorough reform of the  broadcasting system. The Mammi law [on broadcasting] is a  farce. We need serious rules. Here in Italy we are facing a  problem which is the number one problem in terms of maintaining  a democratic system. In no other western country is there such  a close association between a politician, who is a candidate for  the premiership, and a monopoly of private information.    [Caporale] Is it only now that you have become aware of this  anomaly?    [Segni] We were aware of this risk also during the election  campaign, but I must admit that we had not realized the  seriousness, the sheer extent of the problem. We made a  mistake, and the fact that someone like myself, with so many  commitments, has no time to watch TV, must also be blamed for  this. Can you imagine that until yesterday evening I had never  watched TG4 [fourth channel TV news]? It is really a disgrace.  It is such a farce that I find it almost incredible.    [Caporale] Do you think it was the TV networks that enabled  Berlusconi to win?    [Segni] Of course, it cannot be denied that they had a  decisive impact. Without the TV cameras, Forza Italia could not  have become a winning idea.    [Caporale] For his part, [Northern League Secretary] Bossi  is  looking for you to discuss federalism.    [Segni] I know people will find it hard to believe this, but  nobody has approached me yet.    [Caporale] If he does approach you, will you agree to meet  him? Considering he torpedoed the agreement that you had just  reached with Maroni [League lower house floor leader]...    [Segni] He has not yet approached me. If and when he does, I  will know what to reply.    [Caporale] What?    [Segni] Before any other discussion, we must tackle the  media  issue, including both the press and broadcasting. First we must  tackle TV and the newspapers, and then federalism, taxation, and  what not. The constitutional review, the reshaping of the  state, if they must take place, must be carried out only after  democratic rules have been fully restored.    [Caporale] What are you proposing?    [Segni] I am thinking in terms of a single RAI [state  broadcasting company] network, and a single Fininvest network,  and no shared interests with the press. It should no longer be  possible to get around this by transferring assets to family  members. It is shameful that the Mammi law allows this. But,  make no mistake, I would like to stress that this aim of ours  should not be interpreted as an attempt to get back at  Berlusconi. In fact, I would be very glad to hear that Forza  Italia also considers this issue an absolute priority.    [Caporale] The rules governing the media have become your  fixation. Are you perhaps thinking in terms of a referendum?    [Segni] I have not yet thought in those terms. Of course,  moving in that direction is open to us.    [Caporale] In the meantime, we are faced by the government  problem.    [Segni] We had warned that the Right, just like the Left,  was  a sum of opposing forces, not a homogeneous alignment.  Berlusconi cheated the voters, there is no doubt about it. It  was a contrived victory. It was contrived by the TV networks,  and handed over to Italians in the form of a ready-made ballot  to be placed in the ballot box. These considerations, however,  cannot conceal the truth. And the truth is that the Right has  won. Of course, I can see the winners already jumping at each  other's throats. In fact, they are using bazookas against each  other. I am tempted to tell Italians: We had warned you that  this would happen. But, at this point, the victors must try to  govern the country. Italy is waiting for a government.    [Caporale] What if they do not succeed? Will we go back to  the polls?    [Segni] No, it is madness to dissolve a parliament which  must  still be built. If this coalition declares itself bankrupt,  other avenues must be found.    [Caporale] Which?    [Segni] It is up to the president of the republic to find  them.    [Caporale] If Berlusconi fails, would you be prepared to  lead  a caretaker government?    [Segni] No, absolutely not. It is high time for me to say  what I think, loud and clear. I did not win, I am outside this  race. I will do my job as a deputy, in the opposition.    [Caporale] By the way, some people have invited you, in no  uncertain terms, to pack up and leave the Chamber of Deputies,  too. You, the referendum leader, were flunked by the Sassari  voters in your uninominal constituency. You only made it into  parliament thanks to the proportional parachute -- meaning the  system against which you had fought.    [Segni] I have given this some thought too. If I am back in  parliament, it is only because our banner won an unexpected  success in the proportional ballot. However, you must not  forget that the little space we had on TV was only used to  publicize the single joint banner with the Popular Party [PPI],  the "Pact for Italy." Not a word was ever said of the other  banner. To this you must add that we were absent in no less  than 10 constituencies, and that we were not given a cent to  explain that there was also a "Segni Pact" on the gray ballot.  Despite such a catastrophe (in fact, I was sure we would not  reach a quorum), our banner, in the proportional round, almost  obtained 5 percent of the vote. If we had been present  throughout the national territory, we could have easily obtained  8 or 9 percent -- which is the result obtained by the League.  This is why I am still here.    [Caporale] Will your Pact constitute a separate group from  the PPI group?    [Segni] We will be an autonomous group, although we will  have  a consultative pact with the other group.    [Caporale] Why is this? Have problems arisen also in the  center?    [Segni] No, we had decided to move in this direction before  going together into the election campaign.    [Caporale] Are you concerned that some of your deputies may  "betray" you to side with the victors?    [Segni] This is not the case, and will not be the case.    [Caporale] It is being said that the Pact's tax expert  Giulio  Tremonti would also find a place in a Berlusconi government.    [Segni] I do not believe so, not in the least.    [Caporale] Deputy Segni, if you could go back, would you  follow the same road all the way?    [Segni] This is a difficult question, a whole new interview  would be necessary to answer it. We all make mistakes.    [Caporale] Are you thinking of the mistake made with Achille  Occhetto [secretary of the Democratic Party of the Left, PDS]?    [Segni] No, despite everything, I believe I was right to say  clearly what I thought, and to part company. The PDS has always  believed it was the motor, the pivot, the hub. Let us not  forget what happened barely a month after the referendum.  Already in July, the PDS had reached an agreement with [Rete  leader] Orlando and Rete, and was preparing to reach one with  Communist Renewal. You can imagine what would have happened in  December, after the victory in the local elections. The PDS  felt that it was the boss, this is the truth.    [Caporale] Does the same apply to Democratic Alliance [AD]?    [Segni] The fact that AD has had none of its people elected  under their own banner is an indication of its political  marginality compared to Botteghe Oscure [PDS headquarters]. My  challenge, our challenge, was something different: countering  the Left by means of a genuine liberal-democratic option.    [Caporale] You did not succeed.    [Segni] But we have all the time in the world to try again.</p>

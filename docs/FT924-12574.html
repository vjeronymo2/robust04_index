			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Observer: All aboard There is a curious appropriateness to the rumour that Alan Clements is to be the next chairman of Trafalgar House. Clements, an ex-corporate bureaucrat from ICI, is an archetypal nice chap. But since he retired from ICI at the end of 1989, his every move has precipitated boardroom mayhem. He joined Granada as a non-executive director, and the chief executive was deposed. He joined the paper-maker David S Smith and the chief executive unexpectedly stepped down. He joined Brent Walker and George Walker was booted out and the company is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. He joined Mirror Group and Robert Maxwell fell into the sea. It sounds like Sir Nigel Broackes will be lucky to get out in one piece. Given this sort of career it is hard to see how Clements can kick up a stink about Hongkong Land's understandable wish to add two of its men to the Trafalgar House board, in the absence of any other fresh faces. Rodney Leach is a seasoned corporate financier, and Sir Charles Powell has impressive political connections. Both are worthy additions to a group of non-executive directors who badly need strengthening.</p>

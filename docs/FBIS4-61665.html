According to  judiciary reform, changes in both the Ministry of Justice and  other justice organs will take place, he specified.

No personnel cuts will be  enacted in the Ministry of Justice, excluding the vice-minister  and five employees from auxiliary personnel. At the same time,  an expansion of the Department of Legislation is planned, for  its employees are overtaxed by the number of legislative acts to  be designed and transferred to the Parliament for adoption  [words indistinct].</p>

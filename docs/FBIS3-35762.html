			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Kuchina and Yuriy Sizov] </F>   [Text] Riga January 28 TASS -- Latvian Prime Minister  Valdis Birkavs believes that talks with Russia should be  continued, although his country has already covered its half of  the road.    "The limit of our concessions to Russia has been exhausted,  but we should continue the talks. There is no other way. The  two countries cannot be brought together by military methods,"  he said in an ITAR-TASS interview.    Responding to the question about the situation of the  people,  who have no Latvian citizenship (they account for about one  third of the population), the prime minister said: "I believe  the problem is being artificially kindled. People are looking  for a better place to live, and the fact that there is no  massive exodus from Latvia is the best proof that no section of  the population feels as economically handicapped."    In his opinion, the citizenship problem will be resolved and  a corresponding law will be adopted in due time. "Previously we  paid no attention to citizenship. Now that the problem is being  discussed continually, that rumours begin to circulate about  some massive deportations which no one intends to implement,  people want to have citizenship as a sort of an anchor. If the  problem is settled on a legal basis, then people will feel that  they have guarantees for peaceful work," the Latvian prime  minister said.    According to Birkavs, there are three ways to normalise the  situation. "Very careful naturalisation is the first one. An  absolutely free repatriation to the ethnic homeland along with  the financial support of this process is the second one. And  there is one more way: emigration to third countries, which, of  course, will not acquire massive proportions," the prime  minister said.    Responding to the question about Latvia's attitude to the  partnership for peace programme, the prime minister praised it  and added: "The suggested mechanism of a peaceful settlement of  conflicts is valuable to us, because the security problem will  be an acute one for Latvia during the coming two or three  years." He believes that if Latvia joined the programme earlier,  it could have counted on NATO support during the recent dramatic  aggravation of relations with Russia (it is worth recalling in  this connection that the aggravation was the result of an arrest  of two Russian generals by Latvian local authorities.)    The head of the Latvian Government believes that "the time  has come to analyse military systems of other countries. We  were part of the Soviet system long enough and came out from it  not with the best of recollections. This is why the orientation  towards the NATO structures is obvious, and it will be  continued," he said.</p>

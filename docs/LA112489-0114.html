			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> BONANZA: The holidays mark the beginning of the annual California gold rush for  store owners -- and in Orange County in particular. . . . The average  general-merchandise store here grossed $3.9 million last December, much higher  than the $3-million national average. . . . Yet, the mother lode is even richer  elsewhere. The average was higher in Los Angeles, Oakland, San Jose, Newark,  N.J., and Bridgeport, Conn. . . . The highest average was in New York City, a  whopping $8.4 million. Steve Emmons  </P></p>

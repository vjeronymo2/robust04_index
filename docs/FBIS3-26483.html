A provincial meeting of directors of  industrial and commercial bureaus concluded yesterday. Chai  Songyue, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and  executive vice governor, stated: We should comprehensively  implement various industrial and commercial administrative  reforms, and should establish authoritative market-related law  enforcement and supervision organs.    Chai Songyue urged industrial and commercial administrative  organs to earnestly study and implement the "Company Law" as  well as help enterprises become independent legal entities which  are incorporated and disbanded in accordance with the law, and  which operate independently and assume full responsibility for  their own profits and losses, in keeping with reforms of the  modern enterprise system and the enterprise registration and  management system.    Chai Songyue added: Industrial and commercial administrative  departments at all levels should actively work with relevant  departments to vigorously cultivate markets, especially those  for production means and factors, in accordance with the demands  raised by the provincial party committee and government. We  should conscientiously perform the glorious duty of overseeing  and managing the large socialist market. At present, we should  pay special attention to overseeing and managing grain, cooking  oil, and vegetable markets, and should investigate and sternly  deal with the practices of manipulating and cornering markets  and of driving up prices. We should also stabilize markets and  work in earnest to ensure supplies to fill "rice sacks" and  "shopping baskets."    Chai Songyue said: We should judge things against the  criterion of "whether they are conducive to the three causes"  [conducive to developing the productive forces of our socialist  society, to increasing the overall strength of our socialist  country, and to improving the people's living standards]. We  should correctly understand the status and role of the non-state  sector. We should not only continue to develop the individual  and private sectors in areas where the state economic sector is  underdeveloped, but should also encourage the development of  such sectors in areas where the state sector has a relatively  sound basis. We should intensify our education, supervision,  and management of operators of individually- and privately-run  enterprises, instructing them to love their party and country,  respect their professions and abide by the law, work honestly,  pay taxes according to relevant regulations, operate legally,  and seek healthy development.    Other speakers included Kong Xiangyou, vice chairman of the  provincial people's congress Standing Committee, and Lu  Songting, secretary general of the provincial government.</p>

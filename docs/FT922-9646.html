			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Last tactical nuclear missiles leave Ukraine MOSCOW announced yesterday that the last tactical nuclear missiles had been withdrawn from the Ukraine to Russia in record time, ending suspense over whether Kiev would fulfil a promise to get rid of them by July 1. Lt-Gen Sergei Zelentsov, of the Commonwealth of Independent States joint command, said the transfer was completed on Tuesday night. It would help ensure that the number of nuclear states did 'not grow,' he said. The announcement is a first success for the republics' attempts to reassure the west over the future of the vast nuclear arsenal which they inherited from the Soviet Union. A Russian foreign ministry representative said he hoped the four republics with strategic missiles - Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - would soon agree a formula for jointly ratifying the Start treaty on reducing long-range missiles. It was signed last year but not ratified by the US and the Soviet Union. Apart from Russia, Ukraine has 176 strategic missiles, Kazakhstan 104 and Belarus 54. The announcement on tactical missiles was confirmed by an aide to the Ukrainian defence minister, Mr Konstantin Morozov, who said: 'Ukraine is trying to behave in such a way as to inspire trust in its policies.' The news coincided with a US tour by Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, who sent alarm bells ringing two months ago when he said he was suspending the shipment of tactical missiles to Russia because he was not sure they would be dismantled. A Ukrainian spokesman in Moscow said Ukraine, would be seeking international guarantees for its security. In Washington, Mr Kravchuk merely said Ukraine would transfer all the tactical nuclear weapons on its territory by July as originally planned. He said he expected Ukraine to sign the Start treaty. President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, who has made no such promise, was quoted by Itar-Tass news agency as saying he would give up all nuclear weapons if he received guarantees for his republic's security from the US, China and Russia. Lt-Gen Zelentsov said it would take from next month until the year 2000 to dismantle the tactical weapons and recycle for civilian use the weapons-grade plutonium contained in the warheads.</p>

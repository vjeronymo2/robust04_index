			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Taunton Cider flotation faces mixed prospects TAUNTON CIDER, the next flotation that the public has to consider after furniture retailer MFI's offer closes today, would appear to have a lot going for it. The Pounds 78.5m share offer is an opportunity for investors to enter one of the few growth areas in the drinks market - cider sales have been growing consistently over the last five years, whereas the overall beer market is shrinking - and Taunton has been sneaking market share from its larger and already quoted competitor, Bulmer Holdings. Of more questionable merit, Taunton also has an enviable record of introducing new brands, particularly in the higher margin premium end of the market - new brands carry a higher risk of failure as well as higher growth potential if they take off. At 140p, however, the issue is not cheap as it comes to the market at 15.1 times its historic earnings, and at about the same level as established Bulmer. Half the 58.39m shares on offer have already been placed with institutions and the balance underwritten at this price. But what appears to be emerging from the gloom of a nervous market and the poor public demand in The Telegraph Group and Anglian flotations is a retail investors' strike now that the sale of shares through book-building has effectively killed off the stags. In the long term Taunton, like Anglian and MFI, is no doubt a sound investment in good management and a growing market. But even if Taunton were priced as a good buy, which it is not, there seems little to be lost from waiting to see how the aftermarket develops rather than clawing back shares from the underwriters.</p>

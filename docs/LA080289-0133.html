Final  </P> <P> COKE AD CAMPAIGN DRAWS FIRE FROM HISPANIC PAPERS  </P> <P> The Coca-Cola Co. announced a television advertising campaign today targeting  Hispanics but drew immediate criticism from some Spanish-lanugage newspapers  because they are being excluded from the effort.  </P> <P> The campaign, called "Discovery 92: Heritage and Future," includes English,  Spanish and bilingual commercials featuring actress Rita Moreno and regional  Hispanic leaders.  </P> <P> At a news conference, representatives of Coke told disgruntled Spanish-language  newspaper publishers they would consider expanding the campaign to include  newspapers.  </P> <P> "We are very disturbed that there is no allocation for Spanish-language print  advertising," said Aaron G. Lopez, the publisher of El Directorio Hispano, a  bilingual newspaper based in Reading, Pa.  </P></p>

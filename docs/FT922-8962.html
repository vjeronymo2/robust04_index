			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Business Air Travel (5): Some fares may be less - The US AIR TRAVEL in the US for the business executive has undergone a radical shake-up in recent weeks. The overhaul started in mid-April, when American Airlines, one of the nation's largest carriers, announced that it was restructuring all its domestic fares. Out went the morass of discount offers, including corporate discounts, leaving the company to promote four basic fare classes. These comprise first class, full coach, seven-day advance purchase, and 21-day advance purchase. (This last class was subsequently changed to 14-day advance purchase, as competitors piled in). American explained that it would switch to a mileage-based system and claimed that, as a general rule, the new fares would be cheaper than those previously pertaining in these particular classes. For instance, it pledged that first class fares would be 20-50 per cent below previous levels. Full coach fares (now called AAnytime fares) would be 38 per cent lower In truth, matters were never quite that simple. Mr Bob Crandall, American's chairman, was quick to point out that the carrier's business class fares on the New York-Los Angeles route would not be affected, for example. Nevertheless, the carrier estimated that its new structure would mean that the total number of different fares offered would shrink dramatically, from over 500,000 to nearer 70,000. American's move has been variously interpreted. Some commentators have suggested that it was a response to the persistent threat posed by smaller competitors. On the one hand, Mr Carl Icahn's bankrupt Trans World Airlines has been undercutting virtually all other carriers in the domestic market, in a desperate effort to win customers. This has cost the airline dearly - it has produced operating losses of Dollars 34m and Dollars 49m in January and February respectively - but there is no doubt that travellers prepared to take a chance on TWA's continued existence have generally flown via the carrier at extremely cheap rates. On the other hand, Southwest Airlines - based, like American, in Texas  - has been running very attractively-priced services on high-density business routes. (Indeed, in the furore which followed American's move, Southwest probably scored the best publicity coup by saying: 'We'd like to match American, but that would mean we'd have to raise our prices.' Mr Crandall, however, had other explanations for his carrier's initiative. He claimed that the move would be justified by the subsequent cost-savings, the medium-term increase in business which should develop, and by travellers' switch to 'higher-quality' tickets. For example, a businessman might now buy a cheaper full fare ticket, instead of searching for complex discount fare arrangements (which often involved throwing part of a ticket away, or swinging Saturday night stay-overs). Some commentators agree with the airline chief's analysis. 'American is willing to take diminished yields in the short term to reduce the costs of maintaining a structure with half a million separate fares,' commented Avmark, the aviation consultancy. 'It is an attempt to break the recession-induced stagnation in air travel growth and put more people in the airline's seats  .. It makes economic sense only if your pockets are deep enough to stand those reduced yields for a time.' The immediate response from rivals - for the most part - has been to match American's move. United, Delta, Continental, Northwest and USAir, for example, all pledged immediately to remain 'competitive'. And they did their best to battle back against American's aggressive advertising campaign: United, for instance, quickly countered American's AAnytime fares, with its own new 'Fair Fares'. TWA, meanwhile, said it would continue to undercut substantially on certain routes. At the end of the day, this radical pricing overhaul has probably brought gains and losses for the business traveller. A year ago, when the Gulf War drove away air traffic and bankruptcies were rife in the industry, special discount fares meant that air travel was extremely cheap. That benefited both the general public and many business travellers, except those booking at the last minute. With the level of discounts diminishing somewhat since then, the current initiative means that business executives can now take a straightforward, unrestricted coach fare more cheaply. That is the upside. The downside are the decisions by American - and some others - to phase out corporate discounts and introduce a Dollars 25 fee for each reticketing requirement. And for those business travellers who are able to book ahead, the array of discount fares has certainly subsided - even if the continued presence of financially-troubled carriers in the industry means that they have not disappeared altogether.</p>

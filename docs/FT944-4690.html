			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Ross hit with Pounds 502,000 debt as Gemforce folds The recent disposal of In-Flight Supply Services (International) by Ross Group, the consumer products and technical services company, has run into difficulties. The purchaser, Gemforce, a private interest controlled by Mr Ross Marks, a founder and former executive director of Ross, has gone into voluntary liquidation leaving outstanding debts to Ross of more than Pounds 500,000. Ross has had a number of problems in recent years arising mainly from loss-making companies it purchased on a Pounds 23m acquisition spree over three years up to 1992. Yesterday its share price dropped by 1.5p to close at 5.5p. Gemforce paid an initial Pounds 225,000 in cash for In-Flight in October. Further payments were to include a yearly Pounds 100,000 in royalties for five years, along with an extra Pounds 250,000. Mr Marks was also to assume responsibility for around Pounds 350,000 borrowings of In-Flight. Ross said that discounting the royalty fee, a debt of Pounds 502,000 was outstanding from the sale but the company expected some recovery. Ross reported profits of Pounds 15,000 in the six months to June 30.</p>

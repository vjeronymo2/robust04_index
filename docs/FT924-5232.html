			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: VASP chief is given 90 days to solve problems THE HEAD of the struggling Brazilian airline VASP, privatised in 1990, has agreed to step down if he is unable to resolve the company's severe financial problems within 90 days. Mr Wagner Canhedo, majority shareholder and president of VASP, agreed to the move at a meeting with federal and state officials, stockholder representatives and union leaders. Mr Canhedo bought 60 per cent of the airline from Sao Paulo state in the privatisation. The state remains the largest minority shareholder, followed by an employee fund. State and federal officials are opposed to public intervention to rescue the airline, Brazil's second-largest carrier. VASP's most important suppliers of leased aircraft have repossessed their airliners. Negotiations continue over 13 grounded aircraft owned by Guiness Peat Aviation (GPA) of Ireland - itself facing a debt rescheduling - and nine owned by Ansett Worldwide Leasing, a US-based subsidiary of the Australian company. The accord with Mr Canhedo must be agreed by Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo state. Mr Fleury, who is on a visit to Europe, told the FT in London yesterday that he would not accept the proposal before hearing the results of an auditor's report into the airline's finances. He insisted that VASP would not be returned to state ownership. VASP has maintained international flights but has been forced to juggle domestic schedules. The airline's total debt is about Dollars 800m, up from Dollars 700m when Mr Canhedo took over. Last year it lost Dollars 214m.</p>

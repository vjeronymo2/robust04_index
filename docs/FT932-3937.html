			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Christian Salvesen rises 64% to Pounds 75.9m - Strong performance from all core activities CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, specialist hire and manufacturing group, yesterday reported a strong performance by its core activities and was optimistic regarding growth opportunities. Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits expanded by 64 per cent to Pounds 75.9m and earnings per share almost doubled to 19.1p (10p). The new accountancy standard had little impact on the latest figures, but the previous year's comparatives were slashed by including an extraordinary charge of Pounds 19.1m above the line. Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said: 'On the old accountancy basis both pre-tax profits and earnings per share are up by over 11 per cent. We are delighted to report that all our business service activities have moved ahead.' The distribution division, which makes 44 per cent of group trading profits, increased trading profits by 13.6 per cent to Pounds 35.1m, with continental Europe and the US showing good advances. In the more mature UK market, where the group supplies retailers such as J Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, distribution profits increased by 3.5 per cent to Pounds 20.5m. Trading profits from specialist hire increased by 19.3 per cent to Pounds 28.4m, in spite of a disappointing performance from Light and Sound Design, which suffered from the slump in pop concerts in Europe and the US. Salvesen Food Services, which processes and freezes own-label vegetables, increased trading profits by 6 per cent to Pounds 12.4m, in spite a small reduction in the volumes processed. Salvesen Brick's trading profits fell from Pounds 3.9m to Pounds 1.7m, although the business increased its share of a sharply reduced market. Cashflow remained strong, helped by the Pounds 28.5m proceeds from the sale of the group's Oilfield Technology subsidiary. Gearing fell from 34.9 per cent to 14.5 per cent. Under FRS 3, earnings per share rose to 19.1p (10p). A final dividend of 4.6p (4.1p) gives a total of 7.8p (7p), an increase of 11.4 per cent. COMMENT The headline figures were in line with expectations, although a strong performance by distribution compensated for the hire division's disappointments. Mr Masters is happy with the balance of the group, which now obtains 95 per cent of trading profits from business-to-business services. That strong defensive stance accounts for the re-rating which the group's shares have enjoyed in the past three years. Forecast profits of Pounds 85m put the shares, down 4p to to 352p, on a prospective multiple of 16.5. The 15 per cent premium to the market is well deserved on a long-term view of the group and its quality management, but the shares may continue to mark time while institutions focus on shares with more immediate recovery potential.</p>

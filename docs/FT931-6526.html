			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Yeltsin seeks peacekeeper role: Russian leader wants right to curb conflicts on his borders PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin told the international community yesterday that Russia must be given a free hand to act as guarantor of peace in the former Soviet bloc, possibly with special powers granted by the United Nations. Fresh from a 12-day break at a country house near Moscow, the Russian leader said he believed 'the world community is increasingly coming to understand Russia's special responsibility in this difficult task'. His country had 'a heartfelt interest' in suppressing conflicts round its borders, he told an open meeting of the political council of the influential centrist Civic Union bloc. 'The moment has come when responsible international institutions, including the United Nations, should grant Russia special powers as guarantor of peace and stability in the region of the former (Soviet) Union,' Mr Yeltsin said. At the same time, he stepped up the battle at home over the division of power between president and parliament. He warned his opponents he would no longer tolerate their blocking of constitutional and economic reform. He did not feel bound by oath to the present constitution, which is a patched up version of the old Soviet era document. 'If we refuse to divide powers, we will get dictatorship or anarchy,' he said. The strength of his latest call for more power for the president appears to indicate he is contemplating decisive action soon in the power struggle. Mr Yeltsin's warning to the international community comes at a time when western states are in despair at their inability to control the fighting in former Yugoslavia. The Russian president appears to be assuming that major foreign states would not protest too much about Russian 'peace keeping' in the former Soviet Union where there are similar nationalistic disputes. The remarks also signal that Russia is no longer willing to accept the fiction of being one among equals in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russian troops are already enmeshed in fighting in Georgia and Tajikistan; holding an uneasy peace in Moldova; and in the Baltics where tension is rising between the native and Russian populations. There is also tension between Russia and Ukraine over the Black Sea fleet. Jurek Martin, in Washington, writes: On the question of Russia's economic and political reform, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday offered an unqualified endorsement of US support for Mr Yeltsin, who is due to meet President Bill Clinton on April 4. Mr Christopher said in a television interview that the Russian president's convictions in favour of 'greater democracy and freedom' made him 'in our estimate the best choice in Russia'.

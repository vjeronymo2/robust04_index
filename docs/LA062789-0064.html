			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 443 INSURERS SEEK ROLLBACK EXEMPTIONS;  </P> <P> 15 TOP SELLERS OF AUTO COVERAGE TRY TO AVOID PROP. 103-MANDATED RATE CUTS  </P> <P> Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has announced that 443  property-casualty insurers doing business in the state, including all 15 of the  top sellers of personal auto coverage and 14 of the top 15 sellers of  homeowners' coverage, have filed applications to be exempted from Proposition  103-mandated rate rollbacks.  </P> <P> This means that 281 of California's 724 licensed property-casualty insurers  apparently have not filed such applications, although department officials  cautioned Monday that most of these might not be required under the law to give  rollbacks in any case.  </P> <P> Milo Pearson, chief of rate regulation for Gillespie, estimated that as many as  100 of the companies that did not file sell workers' compensation insurance,  which is not affected by the rollback provisions in Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Others of those companies that did not file may be licensed to sell Proposition  103-regulated lines of insurance but do not actually do so, Pearson said.  </P> <P> Consumer advocate Steven Miller, who examined the filings, said some companies  may have filed under collective group names although he said there were some  indications that as many as 150 companies required to file for rollbacks  exemptions, if they were going to get any, had not done so.  </P> <P> Gillespie will provide a complete list of companies that have voluntarily  agreed to give rollbacks or are required to give them by virtue of not filing  for exemptions in a week or two, department aides said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Gillespie declared, "most applications simply asked to  maintain current rate levels. The department has started reviewing the  exemption applications and will be announcing public hearings or issuing  decisions on them shortly."  </P> <P> According to the recent state Supreme Court decision upholding most of  Proposition 103, companies will be exempted from the rollback requirement if  Gillespie finds that the rate reduction would deny them a "fair return" on  their investment. Gillespie has indicated that in some cases she may order  smaller rollbacks than specified under Proposition 103. The initiative provided  for 20% cuts from rates in effect in November, 1987.  </P> <P> The only company among the top 15 sellers to voluntarily implement the  rollbacks in either auto or homeowners insurance was USAA (United Services  Automobile Assn.), which has announced it will cut premiums for its homeowner  lines.  </P> <P> On the other hand, USAA Casualty, the company's standard as compared to its  preferred sales auto firm, was one of only three carriers among the top 15 in  either auto or homeowners to ask Gillespie for permission to raise its rates  above current levels. It asked for a 9.9% increase. A standard firm sells to  riskier drivers than the preferred firm.  </P> <P> Most other firms were content to try to hold to their present prices, giving no  rollbacks but asking for no increases either.  </P> <P> In order of sales, the insurers asking for exemptions from the rollbacks in  auto insurance were State Farm Mutual, California State Auto Assn. (the  Northern California Auto Club), Allstate, Farmers, the Automobile Club of  Southern California, 20th Century, Mid-Century (the Farmers standard seller),  Mercury Casualty, USAA, State Farm Fire and Casualty (the State Farm standard  seller), GEICO, Hartford Underwriters, and Safeco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rate Increases  </P> <P> USAA Casualty, one of two of the top 15 firms asking for a rate increase, is  the 14th-largest seller. The 15th largest, Progressive Casualty, asked for a  0.38% rate increase.  </P> <P> In homeowners insurance, only All West, the 11th-biggest seller, asked for an  increase -- 4.9%. USAA, which agreed to give the 20% rollback, is the  6th-biggest seller of homeowners' insurance.  </P> <P> Requesting exemptions from homeowners' rollbacks, in order of sales, were State  Farm Fire and Casualty, Allstate, Farmers, California State Auto Assn., Safeco,  Fireman's Fund, Chubb Insurance, Aetna Casualty and Surety, 20th Century, Blue  Ridge, Prudential, West American, and Transamerica.  </P> <P> In her statement, Gillespie said for the first time that she will order  "special audits" of the rollback exemption filings "as deemed necessary," thus  apparently acceding to calls in recent weeks from some consumers' groups for  such detailed audits.  </P> <P> Gillespie has promised to complete all decisions on rate rollbacks by Nov. 8.  </P></p>

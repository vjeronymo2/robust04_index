			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Letter: A convention for banking that has proved a disaster Sir, The claim by Mr Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, to be innocent of blame for the plight of the banks ('UK bank losses blamed on government policies', January 19) is not acceptable, for he is guilty of fostering the Basel (not Basle]) convention. Lex (January 19) remarks that the banks should have lent to those who had a sustainable cash flow instead of preferring those who offered security. The convention encourages banks to seek security, however phoney. Its risk-weighting provisions allow twice as much lending to secured borrowers as to the unsecured. Therefore, provided it could maintain the same interest margin, a bank could double its earnings per share by lending to bad secured risks rather than to good unsecured borrowers. The provisions probably also favour large companies against small private companies, because many of the latter will for tax reasons have their premises, their best security, in a controlling directors' pension fund. Although the convention is only now coming into force as an international agreement, its provisions on capital adequacy were known by 1987 at the latest. The committee's final recommendations are dated July 1988. Banks' lending decisions have doubtless been influenced by the convention for at least five years. The Basel convention was an example of that most prevalent of late 20th century diseases, short-sighted do-gooding. It sounded marvellous when presented by its academic supporters on paper, but has been a disaster in practice. It should be replaced immediately by a simpler agreement which sets a capital adequacy ratio of perhaps 6 per cent with no risk-weighting at all. The capital base should be wholly equity and represented by realisable assets. There should be no second tier capital because loan capital is still loan capital, however much subordinated, and can therefore precipitate an untimely liquidation.

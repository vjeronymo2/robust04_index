			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / BBC urged to boost its international broadcasting role The government yesterday urged the BBC to expand its commercial role in the UK and around the world and to transform itself into an international multi-media organisation. The encouragement for the BBC to become more of an international broadcaster, with the help of private partnerships and private capital, came in a white paper that also endorsed its existing role as the UK's main public service broadcaster. The government policy document argues that the BBC: can continue all its existing broadcasting services including two national television channels and five national radio services including Radio One; should have a new 10-year Royal Charter running from January 1 1997; and should be funded by a universal licence fee at least until the year 2001, followed by a review in the light of technical developments then. A review will decide whether the post-1996 licence fee will be linked to the retail price index - as it is now - or set at RPI minus a percentage figure. The BBC welcomed the broad thrust of the paper and described it as a vote of confidence. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, said yesterday: 'What this (white paper) is about from our point of view is evolution not revolution: a two-pronged approach that maintains the BBC's public services with a sharp focus and developing its commercial activities to compete worldwide.' To help the BBC develop more commercial activities in the hope of supplementing the licence fee, the government plans to allow the Independent Television Commission and the Radio Authority, the regulator of commercial radio services, to license commercial services owned or partly owned by the BBC. At present, this is forbidden by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The implication is that the BBC would be able to become involved in satellite and possibly other commercial broadcasting services in the UK, although Mr Brooke declined to be specific. The government, which is insisting on a complete separation of the BBC's public service and commercial activities, also emphasised that BBC governors would ensure the aims of BBC Worldwide, the new international division, remained consistent with the corporation's objectives. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of the ITV Association, said the BBC should not use programmes funded by licence fees in risk ventures in the UK. The main uncertainty now facing the BBC is over its transmitter system. The government and the BBC are to explore options, including full or partial privatisation, designed to inject private finance into the corporation's transmission services. The move could help to finance an early entry by the BBC into digital terrestrial television, technology that could enable many more television channels to be created. The BBC is looking at the possibility of launching the first digital channels as early as 1997 if they can be funded. BBC role and funding reinforced by review, Page 11 Editorial Comment, Page 21</p>

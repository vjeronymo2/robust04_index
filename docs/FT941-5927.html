			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Salinas gives ground to soothe rebels: Concessions may hit public support for Zapatistas The preliminary agreement reached on Wednesday between Mexico's Zapatista rebels and the government demonstrates the remarkable ability of Mexico's political system to resolve seemingly intractable conflicts quickly and pragmatically. The tentative accord comes little more than two months after the Zapatistas declared war on the Mexican army in the southern state of Chiapas and demanded the resignation of President Carlos Salinas and his cabinet. Mr Salinas's government swiftly dismissed the rebels as 'transgressors of the law,' backed by foreigners and radical priests. But the prospect of a prolonged conflict in the run-up to this August's presidential election and the vulnerability of the economy to civil unrest persuaded the president to make sweeping concessions to the masked rebels. These concessions should transform Chiapas, the state's relationship with indigenous peoples, and have important effects on the rest of the country. Under the 32-point draft agreement the government has promised to meet rebel demands for a new and more democratic electoral law in Chiapas, to return land taken from peasants there and divide large farms. It will also draw up a new state penal code, and dramatically increase spending on schools, hospitals, housing, and basic infrastructure. The government will provide a local radio station for indigenous peoples, and appoint an attorney general for defence of Indian rights. It will propose a law for indigenous peoples allowing them to incorporate local customs into their laws. It will also outlaw the expulsion of Protestant Indians from Catholic communities. The government proposals do not meet all the rebel demands, specifically their call for legal action against three former governors of Chiapas and the ousting of Mr Salinas from the presidency. The government formally rejected the rebel insistence that peace talks include national democratic reforms. However, the government has indirectly met such demands by negotiating electoral reform with opposition parties in Mexico City. Electoral laws are likely to be agreed shortly. The provisional agreement still has to be approved by Zapatista supporters, but government officials believe this is likely. Even if the rebels do not support the agreement, the concessions should undercut much of their public support, which has been their most effective weapon against the state. If the agreement is ratified by the rebels, the accord would mark a personal victory for Mr Salinas. Having come close to seeing his presidency unravel in the days after the peasant uprising, he can now take credit for restoring peace to the region, and for proposing social and economic reforms that much of the country supports and that do not by themselves threaten his project to modernise Mexico's economy. However, resolution of the conflict will not come without a cost. Government concessions to armed rebels may legitimise further violence as a solution to social and economic problems, and make the task of ruling Mexico more difficult in the future. Mr Salinas has also had to agree to an electoral reform that he had previously opposed. By reducing government control of electoral boards and giving the opposition more equal access to the media, the reform will make it more difficult for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party to win elections through fraud. It also raises the possibility, for the first time in modern Mexican history, of an opposition victory. The agreement raises still further the profile of Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to Chiapas. He was instrumental in persuading the president to make concessions to the rebels, and in pushing through the national electoral reform. While most observers consider the prospect unlikely, Mr Camacho is now in a stronger position to run as an independent candidate for the presidency, challenging Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the candidate of the ruling party and favourite to succeed Mr Salinas. As indicated by the sharp rise in Mexico's stockmarket after the announcement of a preliminary accord, peace should boost investor confidence in Mexico's economy. In recent days the peso has come under fire, with investors worried about low growth and the pressure that has been put on the government to keep interest rates low. Even with a peace agreement, the divisions within Chiapas have deepened since the New Year uprising and are unlikely to disappear quickly. Many ranchers and government officials in Chiapas view the Zapatistas as little more than terrorists. While a minority, they hold most of the region's economic power and are sure to oppose elements of the peace plan that call for appropriation of large farms and electoral reform. For their part the Zapatistas and their sympathisers have been liberated by the uprising, losing their fear of the landowners and PRI officials. But if there is resistance or delay in compliance with the promised reforms, they may take up arms again.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking To Implement Section 113 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OST and the FAA are in the process of reviewing the provisions of Section 113. Because the rules previously proposed are in many respects not consistent with Section 113, the OST and the FAA are considering new regulations to implement the new law, and currently intend to publish a proposed rule for public comment as soon as the review is complete. Notwithstanding the 90-day period prescribed in the 1994 Authorization Act to complete rulemaking, the OST and the FAA will provide an opportunity to comment on the proposal, although commenters can expect a relatively brief period for public comment in view of the 90-day period for rulemaking provided in the legislation. We anticipate publication of proposed regulations by October 15, 1994 with a comment period of approximately 15 days. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Related Actions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By a separate notice being published simultaneously in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , OST is extending the comment period on the Proposed Policy until October 15, 1994 and announcing our intention to issue a supplemental notice. We anticipate that the supplemental notice will be published not later than October 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment of Notice 94&hyph;18 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In consideration of the differences between the rules proposed in the NPRM and the provisions of Section 113 of the 1994 Authorization Act, the OST and the FAA believe that there is no further reason to seek public comment on the special provisions in the NPRM for air carrier complaints related to whether airport fees are reasonable. At the same time, the remaining procedures proposed in the NPRM, which would apply to the various other kinds of complaints filed against airports relating to Federal requirements, are not affected by the 1994 Authorization Act. Accordingly, the OST and the FAA are withdrawing Subpart J of the rule proposed in the NPRM, and are continuing the proposal of all remaining provisions of the NPRM. In order to permit additional time for commenters to consider the proposal as revised by the withdrawal of Subpart J, the OST and the FAA are extending the comment period. Comments on the proposed rule are now due on or before December 1, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NPRM proposed the adoption of a new procedure for the filing, investigation, and adjudication of complaints against airports for violation of certain statutes administered by the FAA. The new procedures would be substituted for existing procedures under 14 CFR part 13. With the exception of the deletion of the procedure for resolution of complaints by airlines regarding airport fees, the rule proposed in the NPRM has not changed. Accordingly, as stated in the NPRM, the expected economic impact of this proposed amendment would be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation is not warranted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed in the preamble, the FAA has determined that this change to the proposed regulation is not economically significant under Executive Order 12866. However, due to the public interest in this rulemaking, this proposed rule is considered significant under the Executive Order. The FAA certifies that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This proposal is considered significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1978). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14 CFR Part 13 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement procedures, Investigations, Penalties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 14 CFR Part 16 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement procedures, Investigations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Partial Withdrawal of the Proposed Amendments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 13 and adopt new part 16 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR parts 13 and 16) as proposed in Notice 94&hyph;18, except that proposed Subpart J of the proposed rule, entitled ``Subpart J_Alternate Procedure for Certain Complaints Concerning Airport Rates and Charges,'' and related references to Subpart J in the index of the proposed rule, are hereby withdrawn. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, on September 12, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Cynthia Rich, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Assistant Administrator for Airports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;23022 Filed 9&hyph;13&hyph;94; 3:34 pm] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

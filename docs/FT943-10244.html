			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Samsung to launch Ricoh countersuit Samsung Electronics said yesterday it plans to file a countersuit soon against Ricoh, the Japanese office equipment maker, in an escalating legal battle over patent rights on facsimile machines that could affect the companies' sales in the US. The announcement by Samsung, South Korea's largest electronics company, follows a patent infringement suit filed with the US International Trade Commission against it by Ricoh on Monday. The Samsung suit, which will be filed with the ITC or in a US district court, will claim that Ricoh has infringed at least two of the Korean company's patents on circuit systems that control the operation of facsimile machines. Samsung dismissed charges by Ricoh that it violated two patent rights. 'The technology claimed by Ricoh was developed by other facsimile equipment makers earlier than its use by Ricoh,' a Samsung official said. 'The patent infringement claimed by Ricoh concerns only a minor part of fax machine technology, while we claim that Ricoh has infringed on patents that represent a major part of the technology,' he said. Some analysts believe Ricoh filed the suit, which would prevent Samsung selling facsimile machines with the disputed technology in the US, in an attempt to protect its market share. Samsung will seek an injunction against all Ricoh's facsimile machines sold in the US and will seek monetary damages for patent infringement, which mirror the penalties being sought by Ricoh. The Korean company claimed that independent examinations conducted in the US confirmed Ricoh had used Samsung technology in its facsimile machines. The former president of Korea Electric Power (Kepco), South Korea's state-owned electricity monopoly, has been arrested on charges of accepting bribes involving an order for Canadian nuclear reactors. Mr Ahn Byong-wha, who is also a former trade and industry minister, is accused of accepting Won200m (Pounds 161,000) from the Korean agent for Atomic Energy of Canada, which supplied three nuclear reactors to Kepco. Mr Ahn allegedly demanded the money in an attempt to bribe other government officials to extend his term as Kepco president, which lasted from 1989 to March 1993. He fled to the US last year when prosecutors began investigating bribes charges but later returned to Korea.</p>

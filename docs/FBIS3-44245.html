			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [Begin recording] [passage omitted covered by  referent item] [White] Now I gather that the Foreign Ministry  today was anxious to deny that they put in any kind of request  for a task force including South Africa?    [Maurison] Yes, it is true, the foreign minister  categorically denied the fact that [word indistinct] task force  which is getting ready to come to Lesotho to enter the (?focus)  between the two factions of the army. He said that the  Government of Lesotho knows nothing about the meeting in  Gaborone and the outcome of such a meeting, and as such, they  will never accept any foreign task force because they are in  complete control of the situation at home.    [White] But, I thought that the Botswana minister [as heard]  was in Gaborone for this meeting?    [Maurison] The Lesotho deputy prime minister and the  minister  of law and justice were both attending the Gaborone meeting.    [White] So, how can they deny any knowledge of it?    [Maurison] I think it is very easy for the foreign minister  to deny knowledge of this because in the last few days  government has been saying one thing today and then denying it  flatly the next day, but everybody knows that the deputy prime  minister was in Gaborone for the meeting with the minister of  justice.    [White] But the official line now is that they don't want  any  kind of outside intervention?    [Maurison] The foreign minister assured the army at  Makoanyane barracks that the government would never accept any  foreign task force from South Africa or anywhere for that  matter.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- The government maintained  Thursday that the likely decision to deploy U.S. Patriot anti-  missile batteries in South Korea was long planned by Seoul and  Washington and is unrelated to the current situation on the  Korean peninsula.    Some, including the opposition camp, are anxious and tense  over the decision's impact on negotiations on the North Korean  nuclear problem and the threat of an attack.    Government officials said Seoul has long asked the Pentagon  to send the defensive antimissile batteries and that the  decision is unrelated to North Korea's suspected nuclear  program, but voiced worries over possible tension on the Korean  peninsula because of the move.    Chongwadae [presidential offices] confirmed Wednesday's  foreign press reports on the plan, saying it was long worked out  and is just being materialized now and has no connection to the  current situation on the Korean peninsula or the nuclear  negotiations.    Washington is looking into the delivery now in time with its  withdrawal of the missiles in Europe, a presidential aide said,  adding that linking the matter with the North Korean nuclear  issue was seriously wrong.    The Patriot system, which emerged as a hero in the Gulf war,  is designed to protect airfields by knocking incoming missiles  off course or destroying them in the air.    Another presidential aide said deployment of the Patriot  missiles is just a defense for South Korean air and sea ports,  adding that he is worried that Pyongyang might "abuse" Seoul's  decision.    Without openly opposing the move to improve national  security, the Foreign Ministry cautiously expressed worries at a  possible negative effect on ongoing negotations on nuclear  inspections between Pyongyang and the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA).    A Foreign Ministry official said he had heard the  Pentagon's idea met little opposition from the State Department,  but that Washington is looking at it positively because it  cannot deny a request from the senior U.S. commander in Korea.    Foreign press reports say that Gen. Gary luck, chief  commander of American forces in Korea, made the suggestion,  which is likely to be approved by President Bill Clinton.    "How can we (Seoul) oppose it when the U.S. Government has  approved the plan?" asked the official.    A second Foreign Ministry official said that there was a  small possibility that U.S. arms dealers had some say on the  issue, it will cause a controversy if Washington asks Seoul to  buy Patriot missiles later.    In recommending the move, Luck said that Patriot  anti-missile  batteries were necessary for the safety and security of the  South Korean population.    But there are arguments that the Patriot system, which takes  quite a time to launch its anti-missile missiles, is ineffective  on the Korean peninsula because of the many mountains and short  distances involved.    Some observers say they suspect Washington's motivation in  selling the anti-missile batteries to Korea when they proved  poor at shielding large populated areas from attack in the Gulf  war. [sentence as received]    Lawmakers are keeping a wary eye on the reported U.S. plan  to deploy Patriot missile batteries in South Korea in view of  the cost requirements, though they expect that the advanced  system, once deployed, to counter-balance North Korea's nuclear  weapons development program.    Chong Chae-mun, chairman of the assembly foreign affairs and  national unification committee, is for deployment of the system  but says that the Patriot batteries should be removed when North  Korea is cleared of nuclear suspicion.    Rep. So Su-chong, DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] defense  committee manager, says the effect on North Korea's nuclear  development program is important and the anti-missile missiles  will have the effect of pressing North Korea to give up its  nuclear weapons development program.    Rep. Kwak Yong-tal (DLP) calls for a cautious approach to  the  issue, saying the government should take into full consideration  the economic burden of deployment and maintenance of the Patriot  batteries.    Rep. Kang Chang-song (DP) [Democratic Party] agrees to  short-term deployment but wants an in-depth study of the  political and strategic aspects of the presence of these  anti-missile systems in the country and of the cost.    His party's position is more cautious, with the DP saying  the  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea may provoke North  Korea.    Rep. Cho Sun-sung, chairman of the DP national unification  and international relations committee, is worried that the  presence of the missiles in South Korea may provoke Pyongyang to  downgrade its relations with Seoul from bad to worse.    It is desirable to make a decision on this issue after the  International Atomic Energy Agency takes action on the North  Korean nuclear issue in its Board of Governors meeting slated  for Feb. 21, because the Patriot missile deployment issue is  closely related to the North Korean nuclear issue, he says.    The Patriot missile deployment plan may be considered an  expression of Washington's firm stance on the North Korean  nuclear issue, he adds.    Rep. Yim Pok-chin (DP) says the government should approach  the issue guardedly because deployment of Patriot missile  batteries in relation to North Korea's nuclear development  program may upset Pyongyang.    Rep. Chong Tae-chol (DP) says he is worried about the  proposed Patriot missile deployment in the country because it is  based on North Korea's development of nuclear warheads. He also  doubts the Patriot's effectiveness, quoting a report of the  South Korean joint chiefs of staff as saying Patriots are not  effective in intercepting North Korea's Scud missiles.</p>

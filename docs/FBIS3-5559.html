			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Mar. 9 (YONHAP) -- Kim Nam-su, 61, one of 76  North Koreans taken prisoner during the Korean War (1950-53) who  opted for a third country in a POW exchange following the  cease-fire, arrived in Seoul on Wednesday afternoon from Brazil,  where he has lived for the past 40 years.    "I'm very pleased to return to my home country, which I've  long dreamed of," he said upon descending down from a Korean Air  plane.    Kim went to Brazil via India in 1954 and was imprisoned in  1963 for stabbing a Japanese-Brazilian to death in a quarrel  with fellow Japanese-Brazilians over their contempt for him as a  Korean. A Korean church in Sao Paulo helped him get out of  prison in 1975, but he killed a Chinese-Brazilian in 1979 and  was then placed in a mental hospital.    Aided by a campaign for his release by the Korean community  in Brazil, he was freed on Feb. 4. His return to Seoul was  arranged by Father Kim Tong-ok of the Korean Catholic Church and  the Korean Consulate-General in Sao Paulo.    Kim was the second of the 55 North Korean POWs living in  Brazil to come to Seoul, following Yim In-ho's return last year.  He will spend the rest of his life in a Catholic nursing home  in Eumsong, North Chungchong Province.    Born in Kosong, Kangwon Province, in 1933 and forced to join  the North Korean Army while attending high school in Wonsan  during the Korean War, Kim said, "I'd like to spend the rest of  my life doing something meaningful to me, though I'm old and  feeble."    Meeting him at Kimpo International Airport was Kim Chun-cha,  who said he might be the brother she parted with in North Korea  during the war. He failed to recognize her, however.</p>

Statement of Work <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States is the only industrialized nation that lacks a comprehensive and coherent system to help its youth acquire the knowledge, skills, abilities, and information about the labor market necessary to make an effective transition from school to career-oriented work. Three-fourths of America's high school students do not attain four-year college degrees. Many of them do not possess the basic academic and occupational skills necessary for entry into high-skill, high-wage careers in the changing workplace or to pursue further education. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to create a national framework for high-quality, statewide school-to-work transition systems that enable young Americans to identify and navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace, the Secretaries of Education and Labor have developed the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Under this initiative, which is based on the recently enacted ``School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994,'' the Departments of Education and Labor are using current legislative authority in fiscal year 1994 to begin the development and implementation of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems in every State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Helping youth who reside or attend school in impoverished rural and urban communities navigate paths to productive and progressively more rewarding roles in the workplace will require extraordinary efforts due to the distinctive needs and limited resources in such areas. Within high poverty areas, existing family and community resources are often severely strained; traditional educational experiences in the schools fail to motivate many students to learn; high rates of joblessness and dependency exist among adults, restricting the number of positive role models; and access to high-skill, high-wage jobs and postsecondary education and training is severely limited. In order to permit a concentration of resources to address such barriers affecting the educational and training experiences of youth in high poverty areas, the Departments are conducting the competition announced in this notice to award grants to local partnerships serving youth who reside or attend school in urban or rural high poverty areas to develop and implement local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives that meet the requirements established in the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The overall purpose of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to support the development and initial stages of implementation of statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems within which local partnerships will apply to the State for funds to develop programs. Under the initiative, each State is expected to receive a State Implementation Grant, described below in ``Grant Program Schedule,'' under which the State will be required to expand the State's School-to-Work Opportunities system over time to cover all geographic areas of the State, including those with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth. However, through separate competitions, local partnerships_including those serving youth who reside or attend school in a high poverty area_may apply directly to the Federal Government. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that the States will benefit from the experiences of the local partnerships and may incorporate successful elements of local initiatives into their statewide systems. Local and State programs may be developed by enhancing existing programs such as tech-prep education, career academies, youth apprenticeship, cooperative education, school-to-apprenticeship, and business-education compacts. However, the purpose of funding under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is not simply to augment existing programs, but rather to build statewide systems that provide opportunities for all students to achieve the benefits and outcomes of the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative. Building comprehensive systems will likely involve a combination of enhancing existing programs, establishing linkages among them, and developing an effective framework that connects both existing and new programs in a meaningful way. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Youth in urban and rural high poverty areas may require academic and needs assessments prior to participation in School-to-Work Opportunities programs so that any skill deficiencies may be identified and elevated to grade-level performance and any participation barriers may be alleviated. Due to such additional measures that may need to be taken prior to local program implementation in a high poverty area and to the often high incidence of at-risk youth in such areas, achieving school-to-work objectives in a high poverty area may take more time, innovation, and resources than in those local areas where the incidence of high poverty is not so concentrated. Although the Departments recognize this,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> the expected outcomes for all local School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives are the same. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition, since the overall purpose of funding under the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is to build statewide systems, a local partnership serving youth who reside or attend school in high poverty areas will be required to consult with the State within which it is located on the State's plans for creating a statewide School-to-Work Opportunities system, as well as consult eventually with the local partnership in the State-designated geographic area within which it is located. The purpose of such consultations is to assure that School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives funded under this notice meet the same high standards and lead to the same outcomes as other School-to-Work Opportunities initiatives throughout the State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Grant Program Schedule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

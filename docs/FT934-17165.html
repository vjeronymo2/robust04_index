			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Confident Major dismisses leadership threat MR JOHN Major has dismissed the possibility of a challenge to his leadership in November amid indications that his opponents on the right of the Conservative party cannot muster enough support for a contest. His confidence follows assurances from Lady Thatcher that she will use her influence on the right of the Tory party to defuse an immediate threat to the prime minister. In spite of her well-known criticism of a range of government policies, ministers have been told Lady Thatcher will use a newspaper interview tomorrow to voice public support for Mr Major. They will attempt to cement the truce at next week's Blackpool conference by highlighting the achievements of her administration during the 1980s. But with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, determined to keep open the option of tax increases in his November Budget, ministers are still bracing themselves for a wave of unrest at the Blackpool conference. Members of the rightwing '92 group' of Tory MPs warned yesterday that the group's decision to discourage public attacks on the prime minister did not mean they were ready to halt their campaign against tax increases. They hope a threatened conference backlash against the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel will strengthen their position and increase the pressure for additional cuts in public spending. Mr Clarke, however, is still thought to regard higher taxes as essential to speed up the reduction in the government's Pounds 50bn borrowing requirement. The prime minister has privately ridiculed suggestions that Mr Clarke has been deliberately positioning himself as the front-runner in any leadership contest. The two are working closely together on the shape of the Budget. After careful soundings by Tory party managers, Mr Major has told colleagues he is certain that his critics will not secure the support of the 34 Tory MPs needed to trigger a leadership challenge next month. That view is shared by his opponents, although some were warning yesterday that if Mr Major does not restore his grip on the government, the position would quickly change. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, hopes to exploit the fact that many grassroots activists are annoyed by the sniping at Mr Major by some MPs. In spite of anger in the constituencies over VAT and over rising crime rates, there is little support for a leadership contest. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, will seek to answer the concern over law and order with a speech to the conference signalling a reversal of the 'liberal' approach adopted by successive home secretaries during the 1980s. In particular, he will announce changes in the law relating to a defendant's automatic right to silence.</p>

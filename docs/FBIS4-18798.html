			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Security forces have captured 26 persons after  determining that they caused an outbreak during an unauthorized  demonstration in Ankara yesterday condemning the intense Serbian  attack in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    According to a statement issued by the Ankara Governor's  Office, it was determined that these persons provoked the crowd,  and caused the stoning of the UN representation, the U.S.  Embassy, the TRT General Directorate building, and the True Path  Party headquarters. Noting that these persons were captured with  Molotov cocktails, hammers, and assault knives in their  possession, the statement adds that an investigation into the  incident is under way.    On the other hand, an inquiry was started in Istanbul into  the unauthorized demonstration condemning Serbian aggression  which was held in Taksim. The Prosecutor's Office opened an  investigation into two private television channels who aired the  demonstration held in Taksim. Officials of the Bakirkoy and  Kucukcekmece Chief Public Prosecutor's Office stated that they  placed a request to TGRT [TURKIYE Radio and Television] and  Inter Star for the videotapes of the demonstration. The  officials stated that, if necessary, the concerned parties of  the two private channels may be taken to court on charges of  provoking and encouraging the public to commit crimes.    The authorities further stated that the slogans and placards  used during the demonstration in Istanbul's Taksim Square are  being analyzed and if found offensive necessary legal steps will  be taken.</p>

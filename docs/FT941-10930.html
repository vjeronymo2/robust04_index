			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Prices top out in a volatile environment - London There were signs late last Friday that the UK equity market may at last have topped out as share prices weakened following the Federal Reserve move to lift short-term interest rates. The market has become increasingly volatile, as trading activity and the value of customer and marketmaker business has hit record levels. Last week saw all the main equity market indices - the FT-SE 100, the Mid 250, the All-Share and the Smaller Companies - race ahead to all-time highs and, more importantly, to all-time inflation-adjusted records. July 1987 was the last market peak - two months before it crashed 500 points in two days. However, towards the end of this week, share prices tumbled, the market being hyped by a dealer-driven story that a wave of European interest rate cuts was imminent. This would have produced a burst of buying in equities as international institutions continued their search for value in a low interest rate environment. The Bundesbank council's refusal to cut rates upset the equity market apple cart, producing a near 50-point swing in the FT-SE 100. However, there is more to the market's short-term performance than purely rate cuts. Some see the carrot of lower rates as better for the market than an actual cut. 'The longer the authorities leave it, the better,' said one senior trader. 'The minute they cut, this market will slide.' The equity market's rise this week was once again underpinned by the futures market. Friday saw a development in the equity market as the OMLX market introduced its futures and options contract on the Mid 250 index. The Mid 250 has consistently outperformed the senior FT-SE 100 index this year, rising a startling 9.4 per cent compared with the FT-SE 100's 1.5 per cent. Much of this rise, traders argue, has been prompted by heavy demand for the Mid 250 stocks by the big integrated securities houses, which have been aggressively marketing various covered warrants and derivatives instruments to their institutional clients. The OMLX launch will be followed by the London International Financial Futures Exchange, whose Mid 250 futures and options contracts commence trading on February. Salomon Brothers, the influential US securities house, and a rampant bull, rates the UK equity market as its most favoured in Europe, with a year-end FT-SE 100 target of 3,950. Salomon forecasts base-rate reductions to 4 per cent, in order to offset fiscal tightening, a strong recovery in earnings and further increases in institutional and private cash flow in 1994. It says the UK's public finances are likely to be the strongest in Europe by 1995-96. The broker expects earnings growth of over 38 per cent for 1993, 16 per cent for 1994 and 12 per cent for 1995. The risks to the market, Salomon says, are posed by potential internal strife in the Conservative party.</p>

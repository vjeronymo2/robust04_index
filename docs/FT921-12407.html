			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Bush to stress growth in Congress address PRESIDENT George Bush will unveil a long-awaited US economic growth package tomorrow, as well as deeper cuts in defence spending, in a speech aimed at reviving his popularity. The anti-recession proposals and the promise of a 'peace dividend' are expected to be the centrepiece of Mr Bush's State of the Union address to Congress tomorrow night, the launch-pad for his campaign to win re-election in November. Mr Samuel Skinner, White House chief of staff, said yesterday the speech and the fiscal 1993 budget to be announced on Wednesday would be dedicated to putting the US back to work and 'getting government off America's back'. Mr Bush is likely to call for a 90-day freeze on new government regulations. Mr Skinner blamed environmental restrictions on logging in the Pacific north-west as a prime example of regulations which had cost 'thousands of jobs'. The president may also seek the scrapping of a luxury tax on boats, another hindrance criticised by Mr Skinner. The White House has given the State of the Union address advance billing worthy of the Gettysburg Address. It hopes the address will simultaneously restore public confidence in the economy and mark the turnaround in Mr Bush's fortunes. The speech comes just three weeks before the key New Hampshire primary election. Mr Bush, who has promised 'long-term' solutions to the economy and disavowed 'quick fixes', is nevertheless expected to propose a variety of sweeteners for the middle-income voters who make up most of the electorate. These are expected to include a personal tax exemption of up to Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 552) per child, a Dollars 5,000 tax credit for first-time home-buyers spread over two years, expanded individual retirement and savings accounts, a health tax credit for the poor and middle class, and faster depreciation for business investments. Mr Bush is also expected to press for a cut in the capital gains tax. However, Democrats signalled yesterday that the price of passage for this in Congress would probably be a tax on the wealthy - which the president opposes. Mr Bush is also expected to propose cuts of up to Dollars 50bn, beyond those already contemplated, in defence spending over the next five years. In the coming months the Democratic majorities in the House and Senate will determine how many of his proposals actually pass into law. Reuter adds: Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, was yesterday given an enhanced role as director of communications, as President Bush moved to halt a perceived failure to put across his proper message.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Find a workspace of your own - In A Nutshell Managed workspaces avoid the difficulties associated with the conventional long-term property leases but can be difficult to find because they are often not advertised through estate agents. The London Directory of Managed Workspace lists more than 350 business centres inside the M25 ring. It gives details of the size of the spaces available, costs and type of accommodation - office, studio, warehouse or workshop - and offers advice on issues such as tenancy agreements, planning permission and insurance. From South London Business Initiative, 444 Brixton Road, London SW9 8EJ. Tel. 071 274 4000 ext. 384. 88 pages. Pounds 5.</p>

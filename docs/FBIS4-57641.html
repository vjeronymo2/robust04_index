			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued on behalf of the Colombian Constitutional </F> Court by Court President Jorge Arango Mejia in Santa Fe de  Bogota on 18 May]    [Text] Statement from the president of the Constitutional  Court, as spokesman for the Court:    1. As a lawyer and a judge, I refuse to issue in haste an  opinion on the varied and complex judicial issues raised by the  president of the Republic in his 18 May (17 May) statements. It  is necessary to study them thoroughly.    In addition, as president of the Constitutional Court, I am  forbidden from engaging in controversies surrounding the Court's  decisions, regardless of whether a citizen or the chief of the  Executive Branch himself starts them.    2. The Constitutional Court's decisions, arrived at through  a  majority vote, are the decisions of the institution, not just  the decisions of those who voted in favor of a decision, because  neither the Constitution nor the law requires unanimity. This is  why the attempt to create divisions and dissension over the  Court's vote is inadmissible. There is only one Constitutional  Court.    3. The Constitution stipulates the separation of government  branches. Thus anything that entails interference by one branch  in the inherent functions of another contravenes the  Constitution itself. We will have to determine to what extent  the president of the Republic's disapproval of the  Constitutional Court's decision respects the Court's autonomy,  complies with the constitutional mandate established for  harmonious collaboration among government branches, and  contributes to institutions' normal procedures.    4. The Constitutional Court has ruled and will continue to  rule with resolute autonomy, thereby fulfilling its duty to  safeguard the integrity and preponderance of the Constitution as  stipulated in Article 214. The Court must always remain detached  from pressure and flattery, regardless of who exerts the former  and who utters the latter.    Finally, the public must understand that when the  Constitutional Court issues a decision, it does so to meet its  exclusive commitments without the need for or opportunity to  consult anyone or anything other than the Constitution.    [Dated] Santa Fe de Bogota. 18 May 1994    [Signed] Jorge Arango Mejia.</p>

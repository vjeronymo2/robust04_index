			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- A consumption tax hike is  needed to finance a possible increase in social security costs  in the face of Japan's rapidly aging society, the chief of a key  government advisory panel on tax affairs said.    Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, said his panel  will  provide options such as a hike in the controversial consumption  tax, an increase in social insurance premiums or no raise in  social security costs to meet an aging society.    "But it will be understood naturally the best way is a raise  in the consumption tax," Kato said in an interview with KYODO  NEWS SERVICE.    The issue of how to respond to the nation's aging population  with tax measures has been in the spotlight for some time.  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed two months ago to sell  a proposal to introduce a national welfare tax to fund more than  welfare alone.    The Finance Ministry has been pushing for a hike in the  consumption tax as a way to raise funds to meet the needs of an  aging society. Kato is viewed as close to Finance Ministry  bureaucrats.    Kato, a professor emeritus at Keio University, also points  to  the need to implement administrative and fiscal reforms and to  rectify the heavy dependence on direct taxes for state revenue.    But Kato said no one can expect administrative and fiscal  reforms to save government spending in the short run, and a  sweeping reform of the so-called unfair taxation system could  result in additional tax revenue of only 1 trillion yen.    As for a local consumption tax proposed by the Home Affairs  Ministry, Kato said he would like to discuss it in the form of a  possible retail tax instead.    He also said his panel will take up the issue of whether or  when to introduce a taxpayers' numbering system.    "It's no good to say just 'we'll consider it.' I hope to  draw a conclusion on the issue, including whether to introduce  it, by setting a deadline," he said.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Takeover talk drives equities higher RECENT market speculation that a substantial corporate deal or straight takeover bid is about to hit the London market refused to die down and continued to drive share prices sharply higher. The bid story was said to have provided the late impetus in the Footsie future, which closed at an 11-point premium to fair value over the cash market. London's recent strong performance - the FT-SE 100 Index has risen by more than 45 points in the past three trading sessions - was all the more impressive against a background of renewed weakness on Wall Street at the opening of trading in New York yesterday and continuing uncertainty about German interest-rate policy. A meeting is scheduled this morning at the Bundesbank at which a decision whether to maintain or cut interest rates will be taken. The FT-SE 100 Index settled a net 13.5 higher at 2,869.6, slightly outperforming the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which moved up 18.4 to 3,115.9. Dealers were encouraged by the latest good turnover numbers for the equity market, which showed 737.7m shares traded on the day, with Footsie 100 stocks accounting for volume of 275m shares. The turnover was given a substantial boost by the placing, via a bought deal, of 36.9m shares in Meggitt Holdings, the engineering group, by BTR. Allowing for double counting of the shares, to include the buying and selling of the stake, the deal contributed 74m shares to the day's total market turnover. Ironically, BTR has been viewed as one of the most likely predators waiting to strike in the market. Lucas Industries was again mentioned as a possible target. Other bid candidates included many of the building materials stocks. Already given a massive boost by ever increasing evidence of recovery in the UK housing market, the sector remained among the best performers in the FT-Actuaries indices amid persistent stories that MB-Caradon might be about to launch its long expected move into the building materials arena. In a long list of outstanding performers, Hepworth, Heywood Williams, Marley and Tarmac were prominent. Housebuilders posted hefty gains, with Taylor Woodrow heavily traded and, rather surprisingly, attracting vague takeover speculation. Barratt Developments and Bryant Group also saw exceptionally heavy support. The main thrust behind the Footsie 100, however, came from the drugs sector, where big rises in stocks such as ICI, Glaxo, Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham accounted for more than nine index points. The drugs stocks encountered very heavy US support overnight as US investors increasingly adopted the view that the shares have been oversold in recent weeks. Mining group RTZ was the worst performer in the Footsie 100, reacting to an earnings downgrade by Warburg Securities. BAT Industries, the tobacco to insurance group, was also under pressure. A utilities sector badly mauled in the recent past provided two firm features in the Scottish generators, which responded to positive comments by Goldman Sachs, the highly influential US investment bank. Sedgwick, the insurance broker, was given a boost by a Smith New Court buy recommendation.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Letter: Stabilising effect of the Church . . . Sir, Your graph ('Bank urges stable prices', November 12) showing the price level over the last 700 years makes one point very clearly. Prices were stable until King Henry VIII became Supreme Head of the Church in England. Surely this demonstrates (at least as well as anything is demonstrated in economics) that what we need for price stability is not an independent Bank of England but an independent Church of England.

			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Budget Analysis): Go on and figure it out - Self-assessment Self-assessment, the new tax system which comes on stream in 1996-97, will affect about 8m taxpayers. Most of the system is already in place and indeed, for some businesses started this year, it is already working. Not since the introduction of Paye half a century ago has there been such a large reform of the tax system. How will it work ? Does self-assessment affect me? If you already make a personal tax return, it almost certainly will. The tax affects the self-employed, business partners, company directors, some employees, and some pensioners. What happens if I already make a return via my accountant? You can carry on as before. What is the biggest difference about the new system? Unlike the present system, your tax liability will be based on figures you provide. So I just have to fill in a form? In essence, yes. Once you have completed the form you will be able to calculate your tax liability as well. If you want to leave this job to the Inland Revenue, you will have to file your form earlier. What else is new about the tax? The new system is based on 'current year assessment' which means that your tax bill for any year relates to your income in that same year. Why are the Inland Revenue doing this? The new system brings together all income and capital gains, to be taxed at one time. The Revenue say it will be simpler, quicker and more accurate. When does the new tax start? The main changes to the tax system will come on stream in the year 1996-7. The first self assessment tax returns will be issued in April 1997 and will need to be sent back by January 31 1998. So the new tax form has to be filed in January? Yes, by January 31 after the end of the tax year it covers. If you have decided to let the Revenue calculate your liability the form has to be in by the previous September 30. Is the form easy to fill in? That is debatable. It is not one form but several. The Revenue is going to great lengths to design it so it is easy to follow. It will contain checklists to help you collect the right information and also includes explanatory notes. What do I have to put on the form? A good example is the form on employment. The draft schedule suggests that to fill this in you will need documents like your P60, a P11D, a P9D, and receipts for the allowable expenditure you have incurred. And you must fill in an employment schedule for each job you do. Do I have to get this information on my own? No. Employers also have to help and the Budget gave details about their duties which many observers think are quite strict. Crucially, employers are going to have to give you a lot of detail about benefits in kind. Will I get a whole set of the new forms? No. The Revenue will only send you the forms they think are relevant. For example, you might get the forms on pensions, investments, and capital gains. You can always ask for help if you are one of the four million taxpayers who do file returns without the help of an expert. How do I pay? You pay twice a year. Your previous year's income is used to calculate two payments on account - half on January 31 and half on July 31. The first payment also contains either a top up or a refund, to bring the previous year's payments into line with the actual tax liability. Any penalties for late filing? Failing to submit a return will cost Pounds 100 and a further Pounds 100 after six months. Any penalties for late payment? A five per cent surcharge is suggested for tax unpaid 28 days after January 31 and a further five per cent if still unpaid after six months. Interest will be charged on late payments. Will the Revenue accept my figures? Initially, apart from obvious errors, your self assessment form will be processed before it is checked. So the tax the Revenue expects from you will normally be based on your return. But they will check the form later and if the Revenue wants more information or think something is wrong they will get in touch. The Revenue will also check a sample of returns to monitor the system and keep it fair. In most cases the Revenue has 12 months from the filing of your form to tell you they intend to make inquiries. What will the Revenue inquiry involve? The Revenue can ask questions but you have the right to go to an independent appeal commissioner. In the end you might need to amend your original return, or the Revenue will do it for you. If I need help now where can I go? Any tax inquiry office or tax office will help (in the telephone book under Inland Revenue). There is a whole raft of informative leaflets available. You can, of course, always ask your accountant or tax adviser.</p>

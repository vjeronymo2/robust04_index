			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Employment Authorization for Persons in Proceedings (Section 274a.12(c)(13))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would eliminate 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(13), which provides that a person in exclusion or deportation proceedings who is not detained and not subject to a final order of deportation may apply for employment authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments opposed this change on the ground that persons in deportation proceedings who have filed no applications for relief, but who contest their exclusion or deportation on other grounds, will have no other basis to obtain employment authorization and support themselves.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in the supplementary information to the proposed rule, virtually all persons who are not detained and are subject to exclusion or deportation proceedings are eligible to apply for employment authorization under other provisions of 8 CFR 274.12(c). Retaining this paragraph would be inconsistent with the intent of this rule to limit access to employment authorization to asylum applicants whose cases are granted or whose cases are not decided promptly. Accordingly, this portion of the proposed rule is adopted without amendment in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> 20. Fee for Applications for Employment Authorization (Section 274a.13)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Proposed Rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would have amended section 274a.13 to provide that an applicant for employment authorization under section 274a.12(c)(8) (relating to asylum applicants) must pay a fee upon both the initial application and applications for renewal of work authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous comments criticized the proposal for imposing a filing fee upon asylum applicants. These comments are summarized under heading 4. We consider these comments to be directed as well to the proposal to charge a filing fee for initial applications for employment authorization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined that the final rule will require payment of a fee only upon application for replacement or renewal of an employment authorization document. This is consistent with the decision not to charge a fee for the filing of an application for asylum. It also is reasonable to charge a renewal fee to those who have previously been granted employment authorization. As part of an ongoing comprehensive economic analysis of its entire fee structure, the INS will examine alternative sources of funding for employment authorization adjudications, including the possibility of a user fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, based upon the following factors. This rule principally affects the adjudication of individual claims for asylum and withholding of deportation and thus would have no significant economic impact on small businesses, organizations, or state or local governmental agencies. The amendments to regulations concerning the issuance and renewal of employment authorization documents could have a small and indirect impact upon business entities by withholding employment authorization in certain cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice considers this rule to be a ``significant regulatory action'' under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, and accordingly submitted this rule to the Office of Management and Budget for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule will not have substantial direct effects on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Attorney General has reviewed this rule in light of section 2(c) of Executive Order 12778 and finds that the rule meets the applicable standards provided in section 2(b) of the order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Clearance numbers for these collections are contained in 8 CFR 299.5, Display of Control Numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim rule's amendments to 8 CFR 208.3(a) and 208.4(a) are superseded by amendments made by this final rule. The interim rule's amendments to 8 CFR 208.4(b) are adopted without amendment as part of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8 CFR Part 208  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8 CFR Part 236  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Immigration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8 CFR Part 242  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

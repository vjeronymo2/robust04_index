			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pochin's bucks trend with rise to Pounds 2.46m SOME LAND and property sales making 'substantial profits' enabled Pochin's, the Cheshire-based civil engineer and building contractor, to buck the sector trend, by raising pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.46m in the year to May 31. Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said that there had also been 'a healthy income from our property and investment portfolio' and that there had been a 'significant reduction in operating costs'. Group turnover declined from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 32.8m. Some 85 per cent of this derived from contracting, which includes 'property development, design and build and traditional contracting', with the remaining 15 per cent from concrete pumping. Since the year-end, Pochin's has acquired the assets of Phillips, the concrete pumping division of AF Budge. Before the acquisition and in a market with about 300 pumps, Pochin's had about 100, ASD had 40 and Phillips 20. Since then, ASD has gone into liquidation. Earnings slipped to 167.6p (169.6p) per share. The dividend for the year is lifted by 5p to 29p via a final raised 31 per cent to 21p (16p).</p>

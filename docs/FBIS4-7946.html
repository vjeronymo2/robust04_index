			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 6 (CTK) -- The approval of 13  privatization projects on February 15-16 by the government of  former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar was illegal, according to  a report by the parliamentary Committee for Privatization.    The report said that Meciar's government had violated its  own  privatization concept by agreeing without justification to give  advantages to a select group of buyers. Committee member Jozef  Zselenak read the report in parliament today.    After accepting the report, parliament asked the committee  to  look into the government's approval of privatization projects  approved between February 17 and March 11, the date the Meciar  government fell from power.    According to the report, the Meciar government approved the  direct sale of state companies to pre-selected buyers even if  the buyers could not demonstrate their ability to make the first  payments. For some firms -- such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal  Nemsova, ZOS Vrutky and ZOS Trnava -- the buyers could not  demonstrate that they had enough financial resources for  developing the company.    In several cases, direct sales were approved even when there  were competing buyers, whose offers were often better than the  approved buyer.    Deputies of Meciar's now-opposition Movement for a  Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS) attacked the report as subjective, misleading,  and "full of lies." One HZDS deputy said the report reminded  him of the nationalization of 1948. "I hope the elections are  not nullified and the 1950s replayed," he said.    Privatization Minister Milan Janicina dismissed HZDS  accusations that members of the new coalition government wanted  certain privatization projects for themselves, and reassured  deputies that all of the 13 enterprises, whose privatizations  were rescinded, would be re-entered in the privatization process.</p>

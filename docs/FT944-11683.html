			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Revenues increase 20% at United Healthcare United Healthcare, one of the leading US managed care groups, recorded a 20 per cent rise in revenues in the three months to the end of September as enrollment in its health plans continued to grow strongly. The Minneapolis-based group said that enrolment was up 19 per cent from a year earlier, at 2.1m, while revenues grew to Dollars 956m. The company restated year-ago figures to reflect acquisitions made in the meantime. The company operates health maintenance organisations, preferred provider organisations and other health plans, which have grown rapidly in popularity among companies looking to hold down the cost of healthcare for their employees. In spite of the rapid growth in enrollment over the past year, United Healthcare said the costs of providing medical care had risen less rapidly than its income. Medical costs in the latest period equalled 79.4 per cent of its premium income, down from 82.1 per cent a year before. Net income for the third quarter rose to Dollars 80.8m, or 46 cents a share, from Dollars 54.8m, or 32 cents, the year before, in line with market expectations. Earlier this year, United reported a Dollars 1.4bn profit from the sale of a subsidiary, Diversified Pharmaceutical Services, to SmithKline Beecham.</p>

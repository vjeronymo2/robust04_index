			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Business Travel (Update): All survive Sydney plane crash An aircraft chartered by the Australian Army crashed into Sydney's Botany Bay shortly after takeoff from the city's international airport yesterday but all 25 people aboard were rescued, officials said. The passengers and crew were rescued by fishing boats after the DC-3 plane, which was headed for Norfolk Island 930 miles east of Australia, plunged into the water about 50 yards from the runway. David McNichol, a reporter with The Australian newspaper aboard the plane, said: 'We got up to about 300 feet, and the port engine gave a couple of coughs and died. 'We came around in a big circle. Obviously the pilot was trying to get us back on the runway but he just couldn't make it and we slammed pretty heavily into the water. 'The nose of the plane went well under and, when we sort of picked ourselves up off the floor, water was pouring through the overhead vents. I looked out the window and all I could see was ocean floor. But the plane then staggered back up to the surface.'</p>

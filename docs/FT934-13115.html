			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26): Young climbers show promise - Emerging markets / Investment in the economies of developing countries is becoming easier AS THE developed economies of the US and Europe continue to record low economic growth after a prolonged period of recession, investment houses are turning to some of the world's 'emerging' stock markets for higher returns. The main emerging markets are in South America, the Far East, South Asia (especially India and Pakistan) and central and southern Europe. Some of these markets, such as China, have recorded spectacular growth over a short period. China's growth rate for the first half of 1993 was 14 per cent, according to GT, compared with expectations of only 1.5 per cent growth for the developed world over the same period. GT expects the Chinese economy to slow to 6-8 per cent growth in the first half of 1994, which is still high by most standards. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank affiliate devoted to private sector investment in the developing world, has been particularly active since the late 1980s in fostering the development of capital markets and privatisation in developing countries, which has made it easier for investment houses to invest in emerging markets. Emerging stock markets, which are found in Asia, Latin America and parts of Europe, appear therefore to hold out the prospect of more attractive investment opportunities over the next few years than those in developed nations. This has prompted a spate of emerging-market unit or investment trust launches over the past year. For many private investors, risk and emerging markets go hand in hand, and these are not markets in which to place savings you could not afford to lose. A worldwide fund is less risky than a regional fund, because of its increased diversification. Moreover single-country funds are likely to be highly volatile, because the stock markets involved are so illiquid. Enthusiasts argue that, far from being risky, adding an emerging markets element to a general portfolio will lessen its volatility, because, unlike developed stock markets, emerging markets are not closely correlated. 'Falls in the equity market of Mexico tend to be related to conditions in that country and do not lead on to a collapse in Taiwan,' says Framlington's Simon Key. 'Similarly, a coup in Thailand will not have an impact on investments in Argentina. Also, emerging markets tend to be less affected by developments in the major capital markets of the US, UK and Japan.' Many of the recently launched emerging markets funds have been investment trusts. What is the advantage of using a unit trust instead? In the investment trust world, emerging markets can go in and out of fashion. When markets are fashionable, trusts often trade at a premium to net assets; that is, investors must pay, say, 105p to buy 100p of assets. But when markets fall from grace, funds can slump to wide discounts. Many emerging market investments trusts are now trading at a premium because of their popularity at the moment. An investor in a unit trust does not face this problem; units trade at asset value. Instead, the disadvantage which unit trusts face is that the illiquid nature of emerging markets may force the manager to sell his best holdings at the wrong time if the unit trust needs cash to meet redemptions. Unit trusts are also subjected to the restriction that they cannot invest more than 10 per cent of the fund in an unapproved market. 'This is not a major consideration for us,' says Maurice O'Shannassy, fund manager of Mercury Asset Management's Emerging Markets fund, launched in August. 'The major markets are approved, but we can access the unapproved markets through ADR listings and by buying country funds, especially if they are at a discount.' Emerging-market unit trusts are included in the international equity growth sector. There were eight worldwide funds in existence in September, managed by City of London, Framlington, Gartmore, Martin Currie, Mercury, Prosperity, Schroder and Stewart Ivory. Framlington, Mercury and Schroder do not yet have a one year record, but of the rest, City of London and Prosperity have been shown consistently good performance. City of London is top of the whole sector over one, two and three years to September 1, according to Hardwick Stafford Wright, and 10th in the five years to September 1. Prosperity is top of the sector over the five years to September 1, and in the top five over the one, two and three years to September 1. City of London is unusual, because it invests in emerging markets through closed-end funds and not directly. Richard Carswell, director of City of London, says: 'We buy into country funds domiciled offshore and managed by reputable organisations, which trade on a wide discount to asset value because they do not receive the same kind of publicity as onshore closed-end funds.' Roger Bade, fund manager at Commercial Union, which is the investment adviser to Prosperity, says his approach is bottom-up stock selection in a country which has growth opportunities. 'I steer away from countries which are losing control over their inflation, so Brazil or Turkey are unattractive to me.' Charges are in line with other unit trusts, and most have savings plans. The initial charges are: 6 per cent at Prosperity and Martin Currie; 5.75 at MAM, 5.25 per cent at Gartmore; 5 per cent at City of London, Framlington and Stewart Ivory. Annual fees are: 1.5 per cent at City of London, Gartmore and MAM; 1.25 per cent at Stewart Ivory, Martin Currie, Framlington and Prosperity.</p>

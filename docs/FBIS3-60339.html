			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Okunlola: "The Environment"] </F>   [Text] Up to $12.5 million (N275 million) is to be spent  over the next five years by the United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP) on the installation and adoption of  environmentally sound strategies for managing danagerous toxic  and hazardous wastes in Nigeria.    All the 30 states and Abuja, the Federal Capital, as well as  seven Federal Ministries are to be involved in the  implementation of the scheme, which is to commence next month.    The programme focused essentially on the development of an  executive capacity for managing industrial pollution, which had  been highlighted under Agenda 21, at the 1992 June summit of the  United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  (UNCED), as a major threat to the environment.    The principal sources of industrial pollution are petroleum  and petro-chemical industries; manufacturing industries; and  agricultural industries, particularly producers of pesticides.    Already, a two-member consultancy team has been rounding off  preliminary work on the establishment of a programme outline  that will involve the scope, priority areas and modalities for  executing the programme.    The team comprised a New York-based environmental engineer,  Mr Larry Quinn, who recently returned home, and a Nigerian  specialist in pollution control and analytical chemistry,  Professor Oladele Osibanjo.    The programme will, however, be executed and co-ordinated by  the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (FEPA), with  participation also being drawn from the Ministries of Petroleum  Resources; Health and Human Resources; Industries; Water  Resources and Agriculture; Mines, Power and Steel; and  Transport, which should normally deal with marine pollution  control.    "Right now, we do not have any marine pollution control.  Ships dump anything on our shores and our oceans. We do not have  the manpower, though, on paper, they have the responsibility," a  source disclosed at the week-end.    Specifically, the programme will involve the training of a  corps of pollution control managers in all the three tiers of  government, who will monitor existing industries and prevent  environmentally unfriedly industries from coming into the  country.    Other aspects of the grant will comprise the supply of  scientific and technological equipment towards equipping some of  the ministries involved in the programme, training of the  personnel to man them, and generation of some of the  environmental data base required for the project.    The first two years will be used in training staff, but  these  people will now be used in generating data upon which future  planning can be based.    Besides the staff development aspects of the consultancy  schedule, the specialists were also expected to have drawn up a  detailed outline of specific environmental control needs in the  country.    Key areas of interest already highlighted for documentary  review by the consultants are: Control of industrial pollution;  management of agrochemicals; control of water pollution;  promotion of environmentally sound technology; and monitoring  and assessing of the environment and natural resources.    The programme itself is a fallout of on-going efforts by the  Nigerian Government to establish a comprehensive environmental  management support scheme, to be funded both nationally and by  donor agencies.    Following the outcome of a 1991 multi-sectoral needs  assessment exercise, the issue of environmental management had  topped the list of identified problem areas requiring support  services.    These had included development of a programme of natural  resources, soil and biodiversity conservation; combating drought  and desertification, and stimulation of urban and community  development schemes.</p>

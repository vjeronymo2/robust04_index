			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement of the Presidency of the Patriotic Political </F> Association Cameria" -- ATA headline]    [Text] Tirana, May 31 (ATA) -- The ominous letter the  chairman of the Omonoia organisation, Sotir Qiriazati, sent, on  behalf of the organisation's General Council, to the ex-premier,  Costantinos Mitsotakis, and which was published on May 29 in the  Albanian mass media, has caused a deep indignation among the Cam  martyred population, whose wounds caused by the Greek chauvinism  have not yet been healed and which will be repeated by Qiriazati  and tools like him at the expense of the generous and noble  Albanian people.    Since the first days of the creation of the Cameria  Association, in its program we have supported the right for  prosperity of the Greek minority in Albania, thinking that only  in this way can the two minorities, the Greek minority and that  of the Albanians of Cameria, as pillars of the same bridge of  the Albanian-Greek friendship, be respected and enjoy the rights  they deserve. But, unfortunately, until now we have observed no  such sign of good will and humane clearness on the part of the  representatives of the Greek minority in Albania. We want to  remind the rebels and those following them that the "Cam  question" is not a theoretic invention or a technique of  Albanian political parties, as stated by the ominous letter of  Omonoia's General Council, but an act practically realised by  the blackest Greek chauvinism, which expelled us from our  millenary hearths through genocide.    "The Cam question" is one of the most unprecedented  tragedies  committed by those who today boast of "the most ancient  democracy" in the world, and which Qirie [Mr.] Qirizati wants to  bargain over. Also, on this occasion, we want to remind all  those who consider our question as illegitimate that the  martyred population of Cameria is determined on its way to  finding a solution and winning the rights denied to it, not in  the way pursued by the present chiefs of the Greek minority in  Albania, but guided by the world human principles. Finally, we  want to remind all those who see daydreams that Cameria, the  land of our predecessors, is the South Epirus, inhabited by us  since the ancient times.</p>

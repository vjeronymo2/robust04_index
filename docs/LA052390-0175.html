			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: 'LOLITA' COMING BACK -- WITHOUT THE '62 NO-NOS  </P> <P> THE RETURN of "Lolita"? Yes. Agent Irving Lazar sold Vladimir Nabokov's classic  novel -- about a mature man obsessed by a 14-year-old nymphet -- about 25 years  ago. It was then made into a wonderful 1962 movie, directed by the great  Stanley Kubrick via MGM/7 Arts/Allied Artists.  </P> <P> Now the film rights have returned to Nabokov's estate representative, Nikki  Smith, and Smith and Lazar have sold "Lolita" all over again -- to Carolco  Pictures International, a major independent.  </P> <P> Their asking price this time was $1 million, and "Fatal Attraction" director  Adrian Lyne is to be at the movie's helm.  </P> <P> You do remember the original, a movie somewhat hampered by the strictures,  mores and no-nos of the time. Noel Coward and Laurence Olivier were each sought  for the leading role of the lecherous Humbert Humbert, who marries Lolita's  mother to be near his heart's desire. James Mason ended up playing the role,  with Sue Lyon as the nubile adolescent, Shelley Winters as her mother, and  Peter Sellers as the driven observer, Quilty.  </P> <P> So, you can begin casting in your head for the new Carolco version that will  allow unhampered license in this day and age to Nabokov's exquisite, delicious  and literary story. (This freedom does not necessarily mean the film will be  improved upon in Version 2. After all, Nabokov wrote his own screenplay and was  Oscar-nominated for the effort.)  </P> <P> THE NEW YORK POPS has become a highly visible "hit" after seven uphill years of  striving annually at Carnegie Hall in a night sponsored by The New York Daily  News. It seems Skitch Henderson and his musicians have "arrived" at last,  mysteriously, as in all "overnight" successes. Even the dinner after was a hit  in the Plaza Ballroom.  </P> <P> We ended with a vulnerable Liza Minnelli, paying tribute to New York and to  Sammy Davis Jr. in a rousing and sentimental finale.  </P> <P> IN SPITE of the poor reviews, producer David Brown announces that "The Cemetery  Club," Ivan Menchell's comedy at the Brooks Atkinson Theater in New York, has  been acquired by Disney for Touchstone Pictures. Let's hope they also take the  award-winning actors -- Eileen Heckart, Elizabeth Franz and Doris Belack. I  wouldn't listen to the critics on this one; audiences seem crazy about this  play. Brown has become the hottest new boy on the block. He also has "Tru" and  "A Few Good Men" on Broadway.  </P></p>

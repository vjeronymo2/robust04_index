			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / International Company News: Lotus meets forecasts with profits of Dollars 5.8m LOTUS Development, the US personal computers software publisher best known for its spreadsheet programs, reported stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter sales. Income after charges for job cuts and consolida-tion of operations was in line with analysts' forecasts. Revenue in the fourth quarter was Dollars 249.2m, a 32 per cent increase over sales of Dollars 188.4m in the same period a year ago. Net income declined to Dollars 5.8m, or 14 cents a share, after a Dollars 23m restructuring charge which was higher than anticipated. In December, Lotus announced plans to cut its workforce by 10 per cent, eliminating about 4,000 jobs, and said it would take a fourth-quarter charge of between Dollars 14m and Dollars 18m. The charges were higher because consolidation of facilities was 'more aggressive than previously anticipated', the company said. In the corresponding quarter of 1990, Lotus reported a net loss of Dollars 31.6m, or 74 cents a share, reflecting a Dollars 53m one-time charge related to the acquisition of Samna, another software company. Including the fourth-quarter restructuring charge, Lotus' net income for 1991 totalled Dollars 43.1m, or 98 cents, compared with Dollars 23.3m, or 54 cents, after the Samna acquisition charge. For the year, revenues rose to Dollars 828.9m from Dollars 692.2m in 1990. 'We are extremely encouraged by the strong business momentum experienced in the fourth quarter,' said Mr Jim Manzi, president and chief executive officer. The company's 1992 goals include expanding spreadsheet market share and building on the expanding market for personal computer communications software. Lotus also said it would expand its efforts in portable and pen-based computing.</p>

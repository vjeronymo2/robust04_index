The entire constitution  of the federation of the Croats and the Muslims, as a community  of originally sovereign peoples in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has been  more or less completed. In this way a foundation stone has been  laid for the restoration of peace in the Balkans. However, this  will also depend on the behavior of Karadzic's Serbs, who are  supposed to return a third of the conquered Bosnian territories.  The Russian influence on the Serbian side will be crucial in all  this. For the time being, though, there have been no encouraging  signals from Belgrade yet, the Austrian media and political  observers assess.    The expert Croatian-Bosniak commission is supposed to  continue preparations until 17 March--as requested by the  Bosnian side because of Ramadan--on all the relevant documents  for the final agreement.    Charles Redman, special envoy of U.S. President Bill  Clinton,  arrived in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna this afternoon to take  part in the continuation of the Croatian-Bosniak talks.

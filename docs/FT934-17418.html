			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Polly Peck charges dropped THE Serious Fraud Office yesterday effectively ended its Polly Peck prosecutions when it dropped all charges against Mr John Turner, the company's former group accountant originally due to stand trial alongside Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive businessman. The criminal proceedings against Mr Nadir remain active and the SFO yesterday insisted it would bring the Polly Peck chairman to trial if he could be brought back from northern Cyprus where he fled in May to avoid prosecution. Efforts, including diplomatic moves, are still being made by the government to ensure Mr Nadir's return. However, the central problem - the lack of an extradition agreement between northern Cyprus and the UK - remains. Investigators close to the case concede that the chances of Mr Nadir returning to stand trial in the foreseeable future must now be regarded as remote. Mr Asil Nadir, speaking from his home in northern Cyprus yesterday, said he was delighted the charges against Mr Turner had been dropped: 'It's great news. Let's hope my case will also be dropped.' The trial of both Mr Turner, who faced two charges of false accounting, and Mr Nadir, who faced 13 charges of theft involving Pounds 34m, had been due to begin on Monday at the Old Bailey. However, Mr Robert Owen QC, for the SFO, told the court yesterday that there was 'little prospect' of Mr Nadir returning to the UK by then. He said that the SFO's case had been that Mr Turner had made accounting entries to conceal the thefts carried out by Mr Nadir. Mr Turner's defence would be seriously prejudiced if he were tried before a jury had brought in a verdict on the alleged thefts by the Polly Peck chairman. There was also a conflict in the evidence due to be given by Mr Nadir and Mr Turner over the accounting entries. It would be 'manifestly unjust' to postpone proceedings against Mr Turner indefinitely while waiting for Mr Nadir to return to face trial. Mr Turner, who had always denied the charges, was formally acquitted by the judge and had costs awarded in his favour. Mr Turner said he he was 'clearly pleased' with his acquittal.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIALTY SHOPS GIVING STUDIOS A NEW SHOWCASE  </P> <P> After perusing the Judy Jetson cosmetic kits and Fred Flintstone bolo ties, Pat  Hockings found just what she wanted: a $2 refrigerator magnet with the likeness  of her Space Age cartoon hero, George Jetson.  </P> <P> "I've always been a Jetsons and a Flintstones fan," said Hockings after  shopping at a Torrance gift shop owned and named after Hanna-Barbera, the  Hollywood animation studio whose cartoon characters populate the store. "There  is nothing in there you really need. You just go into the store for the fun of  it."  </P> <P> George Jetson has joined Kermit the Frog and Mickey Mouse in the mall in the  most recent effort by Hollywood studios to exploit the popularity of their  well-known film and television characters. The market for such shops, however,  is limited by the small number of entertainment firms with a stable of  characters that have broad appeal.  </P> <P> "I would not expect this to be a trend that can be duplicated by everyone,"  said Sarah A. Stack, a retail industry analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill  Richards. "I think very few cartoon or character franchises have the impact of  Disney."  </P> <P> So far, Walt Disney Co. and Hanna-Barbera have opened up company-owned stores.  Jim Henson Productions, which has agreed to be purchased by Disney, has a  licensing agreement with a Toronto-based chain of stores called Muppet Stuff.  Meanwhile, the Children's Television Workshop agreed to let a California toy  store and children's apparel chain use the name and characters of its popular  "Sesame Street" program.  </P> <P> In a growing mail-order operation, Time Warner Inc. hawks Bugs Bunny jelly  beans and "Murphy Brown" coffee mugs and shirts through its Warner Bros.  Collection catalogue.  </P> <P> Hollywood studios have long derived profits from licensing the likenesses and  names of their characters for use on everything from T-shirts to Yogi Bear's  Jellystone Park Camp-Resorts camp grounds. The new stores lend the studios and  their productions greater exposure and can serve as an important marketing tool  if managed well, say industry analysts.  </P> <P> And in tough economic times, the name of a well-known and trusted entertainment  program or character goes a long way in setting a new retailer apart from  competitors. "It's the integrity" of the name that is valuable, said Gene  Platin, who heads the four-store Sesame Street General Store chain.  </P> <P> The merchandise of these stores meshes with retailing and demographic trends.  "We have noticed is a big surge in children's toys, children's clothes, family  oriented gift items and just fun types of things," said Iris Callie, vice  president of leasing for Westfield Inc. Westfield operates the Westside  Pavilion, where Hanna-Barbera opened its first mall store in July.  </P> <P> Walt Disney Co. launched the trend three years ago when it opened the first  Disney store in Glendale. The chain, which helps promote recent Disney film  productions, has grown to nearly 80 stores, including its first international  outlet on London's fashionable Regent Street.  </P> <P> Disney spokesman Chuck Champlin said the company is "very pleased with the  operation," which will grow to more than 100 stores next year. "We don't see  any decrease in the popularity, and we get many repeat visitors in each  stores," he said.  </P> <P> The stores also give Disney more power to control and manage the carefully  cultivated image it has created for its characters. "You could argue that many  of the Disney characters are brands . . . and as long as they continue to  cultivate the core images of those brands they can do no wrong," said Robert  Kahn, executive director of corporate image consultants Landor Associates in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Children's Television Workshop also scrutinizes the operations of the  Sesame Street General Store chain, said Platin. "Every product that does not  carry the Sesame Street name they have to approve. Our buyers cannot just go  out and buy a crayon set. They have to send it to New York (where the workshop  is based) to get approval" first.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Hanna-Barbera, whose productions have often dominated  Saturday morning childrens' television programs, joined the fray by opening a  store at the Universal Studios Tour in Florida and then in malls in West Los  Angeles and Torrance.  </P> <P> "Our classic characters are going to be very important," said Sandra Gilbert,  vice president of Hanna-Barbera's retail operations. "But it's the new  characters and the new shows that will add freshness to the stores."  </P> <P> The stores, decorated in the vivid colors used in the Flintstones and Jetsons  television cartoons, are geared to attract and entertain kids and their parents  with a mix of gifts, toys and apparel. At the back of the stores, a space-age  console out of a Jetsons cartoon lets kids view Hanna-Barbera cartoons.  </P> <P> Aiming at nostalgic parents and children is a strategy that seems to have paid  off.  </P> <P> "Cartoons never burn out -- I still watch the Flintstones," said Kris Dykes of  Torrance, who picked up a Scooby-Doo whistle at the Hanna-Barbera store in the  Del Amo Fashion Center. "I have a kid, and every time we walk by the store she  goes inside."  </P> <P> Dykes said there is enough room in the retailing world for Hanna-Barbera and  Disney stores to grow. At the Del Amo Fashion Center, Disney officials say  business has actually increased since a Hanna-Barbera store opened in the same  mall in September and several shoppers say the patronize both stores.  </P> <P> "We go to the Disney store all the time," said Jennifer Peterson, a San Pedro  resident who had just finished strolling through the Hanna-Barbera store with  her two infant daughters. "I like it, and there is something for kids to do,"  she said of the store.  </P> <P> But the Del Amo Fashion Center, the largest shopping mall in Southern  California, may be the exception in housing both a Disney and a Hanna-Barbera  store.  </P> <P> "I would not see a need to have both a Disney store and a Hanna-Barbera," said  Callie at the Westside Pavilion, which also houses a small Muppet Stuff store.  "With a Hanna-Barbera store, there is no need for a Disney store."  </P></p>

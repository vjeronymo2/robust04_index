			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Kingfisher to dispose of non-core Charlie Browns Kingfisher, the retailing group encompassing Woolworth, B&amp;Q, Comet and Superdrug, announced yesterday it had decided to sell Charlie Browns Autocentres, the automotive repair and aftercare retailer. Mr Nigel Whittaker, Kingfisher corporate affairs director, said the announcement was to 'avoid leaks', and the decision was taken because the business was not core. Kingfisher bought the 42-outlet Charlie Browns chain in April 1987 and since then had expanded the business to 79 outlets with turnover of 'just under Pounds 50m'. Mr Whittaker said that when the group had been asked about Charlie Browns' profits, the answer had always been: 'a modest contribution'. Founded in Shipley, West Yorkshire, Charlie Browns is spread across the north and Midlands. Mr Whittaker said that in the mid-1980s, Kingfisher had been looking for out-of-town opportunities along the lines of B&amp;Q. It tried Homecentres for furniture and Autocentres for motor parts and servicing. Charlie Browns was bought to bring the servicing expertise necessary. The motor side was modelled on the The Pep Boys, a US business resembling a blend of Halfords and Kwik-Fit. In August, Mr Bill Bailey left B&amp;Q, where he had been carrying out a strategic review, to head Charlie Browns. He would be advising on the sale, said Mr Whittaker.</p>

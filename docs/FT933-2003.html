			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Metal group suitor under wraps - The mystery surrounding Union Miniere WHO IS courting Union Miniere? That is one of the best kept secrets in the mining and metals business. Some time has gone by since UM's owner, Societe Generale de Belgique, started discussions with a 'potential industrial partner' for UM and when the half-year results were announced last week La Generale mentioned them again. But even those analysts closest to the companies have no idea of the potential partner's identity. Perhaps this is because UM has given them so much else to think about. It has thrown itself enthusiastically into a cost-cutting exercise designed to improve margins by BFr4bn (Dollars 116m) a year by the end of 1994 and to have full impact in 1995. At the same time a change of strategy will see UM reduce its exposure to the highly-cyclical zinc market while investing in copper, precious and special metals and recycling. This startled the metals industry because UM is the western world's biggest producer of refined zinc. Now it wants to quit zinc mining by selling its US and Swedish operations within five years. The remaining European refining business will be used to fund expansion elsewhere. The reorganisation is going smoothly so far: 1,312 people have been made redundant, about 10 per cent of the workforce, and BFr2.35bn of savings were achieved by the end of 1992. Although net group operating profits fell by 46 per cent to BFr478m in the first half, UM believes the rationalisation helped keep it in the black in 'an extremely unfavourable economic environment'. What of the partnership talks? The original idea was for the partner to buy about 30 per cent of UM for between BFr14bn and BFr17bn and thus reduce La Generale's stake to just above 50 per cent. Analysts suggest a deal was very close earlier this year but the relationship has cooled and it is now unlikely SGB will cut its UM shareholding this way. Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, UM's chief executive, who is leading the discussions, certainly gives the impression there is no urgency. He meets executives of UM's potential partner every now and then 'to discuss strategic issues'. He says: 'It might make sense for the companies to meet every two or three months and one day we might have a deal. It might take three months, it might take two years.' A sale to an industrial partner would 'be an exciting way of reducing the La Generale shareholding - but we could always use the stock market instead'. In fact, La Generale made a start recently when London stockbrokers Smith New Court bought 5.2 per cent of UM from SGB and sold it to a number of institutions for about Pounds 50m. These corporate manoeuvres will continue. Compagnie Financiere de Suez, the French investment bank, in 1987 won a bruising battle with Italian financier Mr Carlo De Benedetti for control of SGB, Belgium's biggest holding company. Now Suez wants to sell its industrial interests within five years and concentrate on financial services. Therefore many analysts assume that La Generale eventually might sell all its UM shareholding. Mr Rodier hopes that none of this will interfere with the initiatives he is taking at UM. The group took shape after the Suez takeover when all the metals-related activities of La Generale - including Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt and Vieille Montagne - were put into one company, but one that lacked strategic direction. Mr Rodier was recruited from Metaleurope, another European zinc group where he was chief executive, early in 1991 to provide that direction. He split the group into 12 divisions to make it more responsive and gave much more responsibility to the management of each division. And, as a first step towards restoring UM to profitability, at the end of 1991 he brought forward by a year closure of the zinc operations at Overpelt in Belgium, which lost BFr300m in 1991, and shelved indefinitely a plan to double annual capacity to 400,000 tonnes at the Balen refinery, also in Belgium. Mr Rodier says UM previously was making only an 8 per cent return on capital over the business cycle whereas La Generale sets a target of 14 per cent. To achieve that target UM must improve its operating margin by BFr4bn a year by 1994-95 compared with 1991. The initial plan estimated that 51 per cent of the BFr4bn savings required would come from cuts in industrial and administrative costs, 28 per cent from increasing commercial margins, 15 per cent by increasing production volumes and 6 per cent from carefully screening investments. Some BFr1.5bn of savings were realised by the closures at Overpelt and cutting headquarters staff. Another BFr1.5bn will come from a large number of small projects, such as opening up manufacturing bottlenecks, restructuring, dropping products and so on, most of which are to be realised at the Hoboken plant in Belgium which recycles lead and waste materials to produce precious metals. The final BFr1bn is to come from a 'basket of ideas' from divisional managers. UM is the biggest producer of refined copper in Europe and sixth largest in the world but has no mines or smelters of its own. Much of its output goes to produce downstream products such as its own Contirod wire. The copper refinery at Olen in Belgium needs to be modernised - a decision will be taken early in 1994 - but to make that worthwhile UM must secure more raw material supply. At present, it gets about one third from its stake in the Cananea mining-smelting operations in Mexico and it is in the final process of signing a 10-year supply deal with another big smelting company. This would involve expansion of an existing smelter by an annual 50,000 tonnes for between USDollars 50m and Dollars 100m. UM also intends to invest BFr1bn in waste refining activities, lead/copper smelting and recycling activities at Hoboken. Recycling of cars will grow dramatically in the next 10 years and UM is considering investing between BFr500m and BFr1bn to become one of the key players. Analysts expect Mr Rodier to sell off non-core assets such as investments in Asturienne, a mica products company, the OVP Plascobel plastics operation and Sibeka, a diamond company. But they are still guessing about the potential partner which is supposed to reduced UM's exposure to the metals price cycle.</p>

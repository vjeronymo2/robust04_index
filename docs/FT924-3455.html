			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): High costs wipe GIS off the map Geographical information systems, one of the most promising developments in information technology in recent years, are failing to fulfil their commercial potential in the UK. A primary cause may be the government's attitude to the price of information, which is biased towards recovering the total cost of collecting and disseminating the data. This contrasts strongly with the situation in the US where the price of information collected by government agencies is related only to the cost of dissemination and is, for the most part, copyright free. The consequence, as a study* by Michael Blakemore, senior lecturer in geography at Durham University and Gurmukh Singh, chairman of the UK Association for Geographic Information, points out, is a healthy GIS industry in the US while its UK equivalent is failing to thrive. GIS is an analytical tool of remarkable power which has applications throughout government, business and industry. The systems ally the processing and imaging power of the computer to physical maps and survey data. Cross relationships between many kinds of data can be investigated and analysed in spatial terms. An example of the kind of question which is particularly well suited to analysis by GIS is the provision of hospital beds in the London area. Existing provision can be mapped against a variety of factors - incidence of disease, general practitioners' prescribing patterns, social security benefit payments, housing and so on. The UK position on charging seems to derive from the 'Rayner' doctrine of the 1980s, interpreted as meaning that the collection of statistics was primarily for government use and that other organisations wishing to use the data would have to pay the full cost. Earlier this year, however, Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer, made it clear that official statistics were produced not just for the government but for the benefit of business and the public at large. He did not, however, indicate any change in charging practice. In the US, Blakemore and Singh argue, low-cost dissemination of information has had a positive effect on the US economy. They give as example the Tiger project developed by the US Bureau of the Census. A computer mapping file of boundaries, roads, transportation, rivers and so on, it was designed to save costs in the enumeration of the US Census. It is available at low cost and free of copyright; some 71 companies are already indicating interest in offering value-added products based on the data. Blakemore and Singh argue: 'It is highly unlikely that, even reducing for size of economy, the UK 1991 Census will stimulate such a level of activity and this lessens the opportunity to employ more people and to create more tax revenue.' While there are arguments to be made on both sides of the equation, it does seem that charging full cost for the raw material of GIS is misguided. First, the information has already been paid for out of public funds and only the cost of further dissemination should have to be recovered - even in the depth of a recession. Second, there are concerns among GIS providers that government departments could compete against them with the opportunity to use their privileged position unfairly. Third, the market will be seriously skewed if the price of information is set by cost recovery targets rather than by what the market will bear. The argument is not only about fair treatment for GIS companies, however. GIS is one of the critical IT disciplines and not one in which the UK should allow its skills to deteriorate or lie fallow. Market testing of the collection of government statistics could be a first step towards the level playing field. *Cost-Recovery Charging for Government Information. A False Economy?</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Significance of the Signing of the </F> Agreement"]    [Text] It can be said that with the signing of the  agreement on implementing the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles in Cairo yesterday by Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin a new stage in  the history of the Palestinian people has begun. This stage  will have repercussions -- which hopefully will be positive --  on the overall situation in the region, although this will  definitely depend on subsequent developments, whether in terms  of the Israeli side's approach in implementing the agreement  objectively and reasonably or in terms of local and internal  Palestinian, Arab, and even Israeli positions.    For example, on the Palestinian level the new agreement  requires a maximal spirit of positive citizenship, a sense of  responsibility, and a realization that the stage which the  Palestinian people have entered is actually fundamentally  different from previous stages in their history.    Now the entire world is watching to see how the Palestinians  will deal with the opportunity that has been given to them to  prove that they not only deserve this opportunity but also that  they can exploit it well. If the Palestinian people's sons  prove their competence and their social, political, and  civilized cohesion, this will convince the international  community -- enemies more than friends -- that the Palestinian  people are worthy of the legitimate rights which they are  demanding.    The Palestinians alone do not bear the future consequences  of  the agreement. The Israeli side, which possesses the powers of  implementation and -- if it so desires -- the ability to place  temporary or sometimes permanent obstacles, is more than a  partner in determining the agreement's future. Negotiations are  still being held over some pending issues in the agreement  itself despite the fact that the two sides have signed the  agreement. In reality, there are many Israeli practices that  encumber the residents and do not conform with the agreement's  spirit. Among these are the continued closure of Jerusalem to  the occupied territories' residents, the Israeli authorities'  delay in releasing thousands of Palestinian prisoners, the  measures imposed on Hebron since the al- Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, and the preventing of the majority of Palestinian  workers from reaching their work places inside the Green Line.    Despite all the negative points, the agreement reached  through intensive efforts by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak  and his government, the sponsorship of the United States and  Russia, and the participation of Norway and other European  Community countries and international powers represents --  according to the consensus of the international community -- a  good prospect for launching a new era of peace and coexistence.  Also, according to the Palestinian concept, the agreement  constitutes an initial step toward the achievement of the  Palestinian people's legitimate demands. From this premise, it  is the difficult beginning of a long march requiring cooperation  and unity for reaching the aspired for inalienable goals.</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Letter: Long hours not necessarily smart hours Sir, You rightly highlight the serious social consequences of long working hours ('Macho Managers', July 3). However, the equally serious problem is the damage they inflict on the UK's already appalling competitive situation. The debate as a whole is completely on the wrong tack and obscured by the ambiguity of one government arm describing average 55-hour weeks as 'outrageous' while another fights in the European trenches for 48-hours. The reality is that working harder (meaning longer) may assuage job-fears, may be macho, may even be the last twinge of the Puritan mind. However, it is counter-productive to real output, as any serious research demonstrates. Worse still, as my own experience as a Girobank general manager and subsequently at XTAQ confirms, upwards of 20 per cent of the remaining truly 'productive' time is continuously misapplied in unnecessary, or poorly handled, work. This is true from top to bottom of most organisations, with breathtaking implications for UK plc's bottom-line. So the awful truth: after decades of worrying about investment, trades unions, technology and any other excuse we can lay our hands on, our international competitors still work smarter and shorter hours. There is no magic to this and, thankfully, the good news is that structured solutions are available, applied and working very successfully. The question is whether our culture can cope with a new hero: the man leaving on time, his tasks successfully and effectively complete. Or must he remain the last man at his desk, groaning over his overflowing filing trays? Paul Williams, chief executive, XTAQ, 18th floor, St Alphage House, 2 Fore Street, London EC2</p>

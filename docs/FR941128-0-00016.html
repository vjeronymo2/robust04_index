			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Significant Risk to the Fund  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In approving an application to conduct or to continue to conduct an activity which is not permissible for a federal branch, the FDIC must determine that the activity in question ``would pose no significant risk to the deposit insurance fund''. The phrase ``significant risk to the deposit insurance fund'' is defined in &sect;346.1(r) of the final regulation. Significant risk to the deposit insurance fund shall be understood to be present whenever there is a high probability that the BIF may suffer a loss. It is not necessary that engaging in the activity in question will result in the insolvency or threatened insolvency of the insured state branch before a significant risk of loss to the BIF is considered to be present. This definition is substantially similar to the definition that is used in &sect;362.2(m) of the FDIC's regulation governing the activities of state banks and the FDIC is of the opinion that the definition in the final regulation should parallel the part 362 definition. None of the commenters addressed this issue. Thus, the definition contained in the proposed regulation is being adopted without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Divestiture or Cessation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event that an insured state branch is required to cease conducting an activity, &sect;346.101(d) of the proposed regulation set forth the guidelines that must be followed to divest or cease the impermissible activity. Generally, this section provides that the insured state branch shall submit a written plan of divestiture or cessation within 60 days of (1) being notified by the FDIC or the Board that an application to continue to conduct the activity has been denied, (2) the effective date of the regulation in the event that the foreign bank elects not to apply for permission to continue to conduct the activity, and (3) any change in statute, regulation, official bulletin or circular, order or interpretation issued in writing by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, or decision of a court of competent jurisdiction that renders the activity impermissible. Divestiture or cessation shall be completed within one year, or sooner if the FDIC so directs. (&sect;346.101(f)(1)). The commenters did not address this issue. Therefore, this section of the proposed regulation is being adopted without substantive change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Delegation of Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 346.101(g) of the final regulation delegates authority to review and approve divestiture and cessation plans to the Executive Director, Compliance, Resolutions and Supervision, and the Director of the Division of Supervision, and where confirmed in writing by the Director, to an associate director, or to the appropriate regional director or deputy regional director. The FDIC received no comment on this section of the proposed regulation and, thus, it has been adopted unchanged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 302 of the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&hyph;325, provides that amendments to regulations which impose additional reporting or other new requirements on insured depository institutions shall take effect on the first day of a calendar quarter which begins on or after the date on which the regulation is published in final form, with certain exception which are not applicable in this case. Thus, this final amendment to Part 346 shall become effective on January 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 346  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Bank deposit insurance, Foreign banking, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, 12 CFR Part 346 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 346_FOREIGN BANKS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

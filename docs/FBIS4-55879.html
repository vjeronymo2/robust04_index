			<p>BFN     [Text] Trstenik, Yugoslavia, May 23 (TANJUG) -- Serbian  Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic said on Monday that the  implementation of the Yugoslav programme of monetary  reconstruction and economic recovery had proved highly  successful over the past four months. In a meeting with the  leadership of the Prva Petoljetka holding company in the central  Serbian town of Trstenik, Marjanovic said that the hard currency  reserves stood at 336 million dinars (one dinar trades for one  deutsche mark), that budget deficits were no longer covered by  primary issue and that economic loans had been substantially  increased. Speaking about the results of the programme,  Marjanovic said that from January 24 (when the programme was  launched) until the first week of May, the prices had been  completely stabilized and inflation slashed to zero.    The prices of industrial products dropped by 14.6 percent  and  average salaries increased from 25 dinars in January to 116  dinars in April, Marjanovic said. Average prices are still  high, but this is due to inflation before the programme was  launched, he said and added he hoped that the prices would  continue to drop, especially as the production was growing.    The economic recovery programme was architected by Dragoslav  Avramovic, a world-renowned economic expert and the current  governor of the Yugoslav Central Bank.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Blood, sweat, tears and Spears - The medicine being applied to aid recovery at Jones &amp; Shipman 'THIS COMPANY never used to have a make-or-buy policy. It made,' says Mr John Wareing, managing director of Jones &amp; Shipman, the Leicester-based company which is one of the most famous surviving names in Britain's machine tool industry. 'When I arrived in 1990 they made their own packing cases. They were the best packing cases in the world but it wasn't cost-effective,' he recalls. J&amp;S no longer makes packing cases, but it is not out of the woods yet. This week, Mr Wareing will be meeting an unidentified trade investor, believed to be a continental European machine tool company, which may take a stake in the company as part of a possible new equity issue. The talks could herald a new start for a company founded in 1899 but which until recently was 'a dinosaur dying on its feet,' according to Mr Len Weaver, chairman. They could also lead to the kind of cross-border collaboration that the fragmented, financially weak European machine tool industry badly needs. Over the years, J&amp;S has suffered from the same problems that bedevilled other UK machine tool companies now long departed - technological conservatism, arrogance towards customers, and an inward-looking management prone to infighting. Its big problem in the current recession, though, was its manufacturing strategy. 'If you've got a big machine shop and there's no work coming through it becomes a massive overhead,' says Mr Wareing. As sales dived from Pounds 30.9m in the year ended March 1990 to Pounds 15.9m in 1991-92, turning a Pounds 2.1m pre-tax profit into a Pounds 7.35m loss, Mr Wareing tried everything to stem the flow of red ink. The workforce was cut from 750 in 1990 to 520 by last July, short-time working was introduced, but, he says, 'all the medicine was not going to work.' Eventually, last July, Mr Wareing unveiled a strategy that would be the last chance for survival. J&amp;S would sell its honing and small tools businesses to concentrate on its core business of grinding machines, virtually ending in-house machining of parts by switching to out-sourcing, and reduce its manufacturing space. A year later, the main machine shop at Leicester is unrecognisable. Empty areas are roped off, the manufacturing space has been reduced by more than half, and the overall workforce has been cut to 324 and will level off at 260 by October. It has been a year, says Mr Wareing, of 'blood, sweat, tears and Spears' - a reference to Mr Alan Spears, the new manufacturing director who joined the company last August. 'We couldn't have done all this with someone who had been here 20 years and had a sentimental attachment to anything,' says Mr Wareing. Mr Spears and his team vetted 584 suppliers, visited 178 and signed up 12, all from the UK, for long-term supply deals. This will rise to 25 soon as ad-hoc outsourcing is converted into long-term arrangements. The effect on the company's operating ratios has been equally dramatic. Break-even levels have been halved in the past two years, says Mr Wareing, and a third of the reduction has come in the past year. Meanwhile, Mr Wareing has slashed the J&amp;S management from 39 before the recession to just 16. There is a long way to go, but Mr Wareing is now much less worried about J&amp;S' competitiveness against its continental rivals - companies like Elb and Blohm of Germany and Switzerland's Magerle and Kellenberger, which all subcontract as a matter of course. Unfortunately, however, the restructuring has gone awry financially. Originally, J&amp;S believed it could fund it internally, but this has not happened for three reasons: The small tools business was sold in February to a division of Suter for Pounds 780,000, but Mr Wareing decided to keep the honing machine business, realising the potential of selling grinding and honing machines as a package; One plot of vacated land next door to the main factory has been sold subject to contract, but two others are unsold. 'I'm not going to sell the family silver at silly prices,' says Mr Wareing; The recession has continued to depress order books. Mr Wareing does not want to borrow any more, preferring to keep gearing at its current level of 40 per cent. Instead, he says: 'We now need to convert some debt into equity by going to the City for some money.' How much, and in precisely what form, is not clear but Mr Wareing is hoping institutions will line up behind the trade investor to provide the cash. The deal, he concedes, is very important for J&amp;S. 'It will give us the headroom to complete the reorganisation, continue with our product development programme and take the business forward.' In spite of its past mistakes, J&amp;S deserves to survive and prosper. Its shares may have plummeted from a 1990 high of 177p to 22p yesterday, valuing it at Pounds 2.68m, but it is one of the biggest and most innovative UK machine tool builders and employers. Over the past two years J&amp;S has emerged as a world leader in 'creep feed' grinding technology which it acquired from the US Brown &amp; Sharpe company in 1991 and has since developed further. Creep feed grinding removes large amounts of metal from a part in one go, giving increased productivity compared with conventional machining. It is used extensively in the aerospace industry but J&amp;S is already selling it in non-aerospace markets where the technology has hardly scraped the surface. On top of this, J&amp;S has notched up important successes recently in the Far East, and has re-established its name in the US market by substituting its own sales operation for a joint venture with Brown &amp; Sharpe. Mr Wareing sees signs of increasing confidence in the UK market, and says devaluation in Europe has given J&amp;S a tremendous advantage in Europe to add to its internal productivity improvements. The only problem is that continental markets are going the opposite way to the UK at present. The identity of the trade investor is likely to be revealed in September, and 1992-93 results have been delayed because of the talks. Some observers believe the best solution would be a German partner. J&amp;S acknowledges it is very weak in the German market, which in spite of its current doldrums is still the most important market in Europe. Two things seem certain about the planned equity issue. In the current climate in the European machine tool industry, the deal will be mutually beneficial. And shareholders, which include Postel, Invesco and Prudential, will suffer some dilution depending on the terms. However, Mr Wareing is the sort of no-nonsense executive that the City likes to see running engineering companies, and seems to have investors on his side. 'He's delivered on virtually everything he promised, which is not an easy job in a company with so many traditions,' says one institution. 'The proposals don't cause us a problem, and our main point of concern is that the company survives and goes forward.'</p>

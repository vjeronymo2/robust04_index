			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alcan mothballs Brazilian capacity ALCAN ALUMINIUM'S Brazilian subsidiary said yesterday that it was temporarily suspending production of 27,000 tonnes a year of aluminium at its smelter in Aratu, Bahia state, reports Reuter from Rio de Janeiro. The Alcan Aluminio do Brasil plant in north-eastern Brazil produces 57,000 tonnes a year of primary aluminium. With the suspension it will produce 30,000. The company on Tuesday began turning off one of its two lines of furnaces at the smelter. Alcan Alumino said the move was temporary and that as soon as economic conditions permitted the furnace line would be reactivated. In the last two years the company has accumulated losses of about Dollars 20m because of a prolonged economic recession in Brazil. It also blamed low domestic and world aluminium prices, which it said were about 20 per cent below its production costs, as well as high electricity tariffs in Brazil. Alcan Alumino said that electricity costs, which accounted for about 35 per cent of its total production costs, were about 70 per cent above what was paid by most of the world's top producers.</p>

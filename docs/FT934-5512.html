			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / J R D Tata: symbol of the Indian spirit of enterprise Mr J R D Tata, the urbane industrialist who headed Tata, India's largest commercial grouping, for more than 50 years and was a symbol of his country's entrepreneurial spirit, died yesterday aged 89. Tributes flowed into Tata's Bombay headquarters, including a message from President Shankar Dayal Sharma, who said Mr Tata would 'always be remembered for his patriotic services' in many fields. Jehangir Ratanji Dadabhai Tata, the son of an Indian father and a French mother, was born in Paris in 1904 into one of India's wealthiest families. He made full use of the opportunities offered by his privileged life: businessman, pioneer aviator, and champion of many causes ranging from India's nuclear development to population control. He piloted aircraft until well past 80, skied until he was 85 and retained his seat on the board of Tata Sons, the group's core company, until his death. He spoke French better than English and both better than any Indian language, yet he devoted his life to India. He stayed out of politics, but he often criticised India's socialist programme, an approach which cost Tata companies dear when it came to securing government investment approvals. Flying was Mr Tata's passion. As a boy in France he watched Louis Bleriot's earliest flights. In 1925, he became one of the first Indians to secure a commercial pilot's licence. In 1932, he founded Tata Air Services, a forerunner of Air India, the national flag carrier, and piloted its maiden flight. After the nationalisation of aviation in 1953, Mr Tata was made Air India's honorary chairman - a post he retained until 1978, when he was sacked by a government jealous of his influence. Mr Tata later said it was his life's biggest setback. Mr Tata's business career began at 21 after he completed military service in France. Mr Tata wanted to go to Cambridge, but his father told him to move to India to join Tata as an unpaid apprentice in the group's steel business. A year later, Mr Tata's father died and Mr Tata inherited his seat on the Tata Sons board. In 1938, the chairman died and, at the age of 34, Mr Tata was chosen to succeed him. Mr Tata ruled with a light hand and gave managers freedom to work independently. Just as Mr Tata pursued aviation, other executives expanded the group's interests in engineering, motors, chemicals, hotels and many other industries. As the group's sales rose to their current annual total of over Dollars 4.5bn (Pounds 3.04bn), so investments became increasingly diverse. Until the late-1970s, Mr Tata's charisma held the group together. But in the 1980s, the group began to look increasingly incoherent, with its ageing managers often too busy guarding their own fiefdoms to respond to commercial challenges. Mr Tata was criticised for retaining to power for too long. In 1991 he finally handed over the chairmanship of Tata Sons to his cousin, Mr Ratan Tata. Mr Tata gave much time to causes of national interest. In 1945, he set up the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, a pioneer of India's nuclear programme. In the early 1950s, he was one of the first advocates of population control - an issue over which he quarrelled with Jawaharlal Nehru, who believed a large population made for a powerful country. In 1992, Mr Tata received the United Nations Population Award. Mr Tata, who had no children but is survived by his wife, died in a hospital in Geneva, where he had gone for a holiday and for medical treatment.</p>

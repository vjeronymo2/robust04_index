			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Gaza Mayor Dr. Zakariya Makki, in </F> Gaza, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, date not given; from the  "Dialogue From Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Let us begin with the situation inside  the occupied Arab territories, especially since yesterday marked  the Land Day anniversary.    [Makki] Actually, the assassination of six leaders of the  Fatah Hawks in Jabalya -- and I mean assassination -- was  deliberate while peace talks were in progress yesterday to  resume Palestinian-Israeli negotiations. This caused a very  severe shock in Gaza.    The Gaza Strip is in a very sad and volatile situation. The  streets are volatile and the people's feelings are inflamed.  People are upset because of the loss of good young men who were  assassinated without warning and without any resistance on their  part. They were not going to war but to attend a ceremony when  they were assassinated by special forces or Israeli military  units....    [Al-Jundi, interrupting] Israel's justification that the  Israeli (?forces) thought they were members of Hamas is  unacceptable. We would like to note here that there is no  difference between the Hamas Movement and the Fatah Movement, as  both are Palestinian movements.    [Makki] This is certain. As for us, we do not distinguish at  all between all the Palestinian movements. Today we are  speaking about peace, but how can we speak about peace while  these youths are being killed by those who say that they are  negotiating with parties belonging to Fatah? The death of these  youths caused severe agitation among the public and general  resentment in the strip. Furthermore, the Strip is under a  security siege and in a bad economic situation and people view  peace as an Israel trick on the Palestinians. One hand  negotiates and the other kills the Palestinian people. [words  indistinct] and this is totally unacceptable.    [Al-Jundi] Do you believe that the current deterioration of  the situation in the occupied Arab territories is a natural  result of the delay in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord?    [Makki] We have repeatedly said that the continued  occupation  of Palestinian land in Gaza, the West Bank, and Hebron is a  source of friction and agitation. The Israelis must now  withdraw immediately, leave the Palestinians to handle their own  affairs, and allow the Palestinian police to enter the West Bank  and Gaza.    These malicious settlers who do not understand any human  ethics and relationships also must not remain among us in Gaza,  Hebron, or elsewhere because they represent time bombs in the  West Bank and Gaza, causing friction, disturbances, and problems  between the Palestinians and Israelis.    If a genuine peace is sought, I believe that the  settlements--and this fact has been proved--cannot exist under a  real peace between the Arabs and Israelis.    [Al-Jundi] What do you think about Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin's previous statements that he is not willing to  evacuate the Jewish settlers from the Palestinian city of Hebron?    [Makki] We tell all the Israelis: If you truly seek peace  and not world publicity -- they gained a great deal in the peace  process [sentence incomplete as heard]. We say to Mr. Rabin  that if he sought a genuine peace, Rabin had the opportunity to  remove these settlers after what they did in the Hebron  massacre, which is a disgusting act for anyone.    [Al-Jundi] Can we say that there can be no peace in the  occupied lands as long as there are settlements, which are time  bombs?    [Makki] Most certainly, if these settlements remain on  Palestinian land the word peace will be meaningless. I know  these settlers well. They are charged and hateful. They hate  every Arab, every Muslim, and all Palestinians, and they are  armed.    Hence, we believe that to achieve a genuine peace surgery  should be performed to remove all factors that hamper the  process. I believe that the most important thing is for the  settlements to be removed immediately and for Israel to  implement the peace agreement by withdrawing its forces. Of  course, we seek peace from the bottom of our hearts and this  makes us wonder how can we face the public. The Palestinian  people are very aware.    We talk with them [the Israelis] openly and sit with them in  Taba, Cairo, Madrid, Washington, and New York while our people  are being killed everywhere.    What happened in Gaza today is considered a massacre, a  slaughter. The Hebron killings happened inside the mosque, but  scores were also killed outside the mosque. This confirms that  there are instructions issued to these military forces to  immediately kill anyone carrying a stone, wearing a mask, or  belonging to this or that organization.</p>

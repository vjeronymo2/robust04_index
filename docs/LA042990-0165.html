			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PARKING TICKETS: ROLE OF FIRM IS QUESTIONED  </P> <P> A year ago, when Los Angeles contracted with Datacom Systems Corp. to collect  delinquent parking tickets, the company projected it could collect 5% to 10% of  the city's unpaid citations.  </P> <P> Now, with unpaid fines reported at nearly $249 million, the company has  collected $5.6 million -- slightly over 2% -- and has not yet resorted to the  aggressive ticket collection methods spelled out in the contract.  </P> <P> Some elected officials are asking whether more money could be collected,  especially now that the city faces fiscal problems.  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley recently ordered the city's Department of Transportation to  report by this week on the status of collection efforts, and some City Council  members recently have questioned whether the contractor has done an adequate  job.  </P> <P> "Their performance has been inadequate," said Councilman Nate Holden, who  chairs the council's Traffic and Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> "Even if we were able to get 20% of $250 million, that's . . . $50 million,"  said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee.  "That could go a long way to dealing with our budgetary problems."  </P> <P> City parking officials praise the contractor's collections approach and note  that 70% of the tickets written each year are paid.  </P> <P> Much of the outstanding $249 million is uncollectable, parking officials say,  because the owners of the ticketed vehicles cannot be identified.  </P> <P> "It's like milking blood out of a turnip," said Jay Carsman, the city's parking  ticket coordinator.  </P> <P> Datacom, currently known as Lockheed Information Management Services Co., has  been paid $32 million to process the city's parking tickets since 1985 and has  received at least $1.3 million more to collect delinquent tickets in the last  year. The contract comes up for renewal later this year.  </P> <P> Lockheed already has come under fire for its ticket collection efforts in Los  Angeles. Last year, the city received a storm of complaints after the company  sent 50,000 ticket notices to people who did not own the vehicles when the  parking citations were issued.  </P> <P> Lockheed Information Management Services, a Teaneck, N.J.-based subsidiary of  defense contractor Lockheed Corp., has been no stranger to controversy. When it  was called Datacom, the company was implicated in the political corruption  scandals of New York City four years ago. One former city official and a local  Democratic leader were convicted of paying bribes to obtain business for  Datacom, and a former president of the company testified that he had authorized  bribe payments.  </P> <P> The company, though not charged with any crime, lost its contract in New York  City and suffered negative publicity around the country.  </P> <P> Since 1986, the company has installed new leadership, instituted an ethics  program and made a number of other changes, according to Thomas J. O'Neil,  Lockheed Information Systems senior vice president.  </P> <P> "It was a very difficult time," O'Neil said in an interview. "It probably  served to make us tougher and better."  </P> <P> While becoming an acknowledged leader in the municipal parking industry,  Lockheed has lobbied energetically for contracts in several cities and has  hired a number of former government officials.  </P> <P> Since 1983, Lockheed/Datacom and its officials have contributed at least  $71,400 to city and county elected officials in Los Angeles, with about half of  the money given to Bradley, campaign records show. The company also has hired  Julie A. Sgarzi, who served as a transportation aide to Bradley from 1977 to  1981.  </P> <P> As a regional vice president for Lockheed, Sgarzi served as project manager  when the company signed its five-year contract with the city in 1985. She is  now a senior vice president. Last year, the mayor appointed Sgarzi to the  Cultural Affairs Commission.  </P> <P> The current head of Lockheed's Los Angeles office is Edgar Hayes, who  previously was director of data processing for Los Angeles County. Lockheed  holds a $2.6-million, three-year contract with Los Angeles County to process  parking citations for county unincorporated areas and several cities, according  to county officials.  </P> <P> "We have hired folks from the public sector," said O'Neil, who himself had been  a Boston official before he went to work for Datacom in that city. "How better  to understand the process? It is logical, ethical, and moral."  </P> <P> The company currently processes parking citations for 100 U.S. cities or  counties, O'Neil said, including Boston, Washington and New Orleans.  </P> <P> At least 250 cities and counties contract out such services, according to Marie  Witmer of the Institutional and Municipal Parking Congress, a Virginia-based  clearinghouse on parking issues.  </P> <P> Lockheed's relationship with Los Angeles began in the early 1980s when the City  Council sought to increase revenue by centralizing the city's fragmented  parking enforcement, citation processing and collections system. In 1983, the  council selected Datacom and a consultant, Brophy &amp; Associates, to perform  a study that led to the current system.  </P> <P> Brophy &amp; Associates was headed by John Brophy, now president of Lockheed  Information Management Services. A former Washington parking official, he has  marketed the idea that cities could make a lot of money through centralized  parking management combined with aggressive ticketing, towing and use of metal  "boots" to immobilize cars with several outstanding tickets.  </P> <P> Over the last decade, his ideas appealed to officials in a number of cities  facing increasingly tight budgets, including Los Angeles. In 1984, the mayor  and council decided to implement the Brophy/Datacom concept. The next year  Datacom won a five-year contract to implement its own plan, beating out three  other bidders.  </P> <P> Since 1985, the number of tickets issued by traffic officers employed by the  city's Department of Transportation has quadrupled to 4.3 million, and revenue  has climbed from $18 million in 1984 to $90 million in 1989.  </P> <P> Under its contract, Lockheed uses its computer system to process tickets and  track payments, and the company staffs the city's payment offices. The company  is paid $1.18 to $2.48 to process each ticket, whether the fine is paid or not.  </P> <P> In January, 1989, the City Council approved a contract amendment authorizing  Lockheed to collect fines on delinquent tickets for a 30% commission. The city  attorney ruled the contract award could be made without competitive bidding.  </P> <P> When the contract was awarded, officials who oversee parking collections told  the council that the city had 800,000 unpaid citations amounting to $35  million.  </P> <P> Recently, officials told The Times that there are 5.4 million unpaid citations  worth nearly $249 million.  </P> <P> When asked how much money is collectable, city officials and Lockheed have  provided estimates ranging from $35 million to $162 million. They said the  amount would be clarified in their report to the mayor.  </P> <P> City Council President John Ferraro said through a spokesman last week that he  is "totally surprised by the disparity in numbers and wants an investigation  into the facts."  </P> <P> "Thirty-five million dollars is a far cry from $249 million," Holden said. "My  question is what are they talking about?"  </P> <P> Holden voted against the additional contract award because of Lockheed Corp.'s  past business ties to South Africa.  </P> <P> Lockheed's 1989 agreement with the city said the company could pursue an array  of ticket collection strategies such as skip-tracing -- a method of finding  valid current addresses -- and making telephone collection calls.  </P> <P> But since then, Lockheed's collection efforts have been limited to sending  letters to non-paying parking violators.  </P> <P> City parking officials say they jointly decided on a strategy of sending  letters as a first stage of collection before resorting to more aggressive  methods.  </P> <P> "That strategy is in the process of being reviewed," said Parking Administrator  Robert Yates, who oversees the contractor's operations for the city's  Transportation Department.  </P> <P> The Times recently reported that 75,000 vehicles had five or more tickets, and  that the top violators each owed several thousand dollars in fines.  </P> <P> After inquiries from The Times, prosecutors from the city attorney's office met  with parking officials to consider ways to seek payment from the worst parking  violators, some of whom have up to 200 tickets.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Maureen Siegel, acting chief of criminal operations, said:  "We're looking at prosecution remedies, civil remedies and legislative changes  that could impact our ability to collect a larger percentage of unpaid fines."  </P> <P> Lockheed's contract with the city expires this fall. Lockheed has submitted  proposals to win the new contract, along with Andersen Consulting, a division  of Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., and Tixon Corp. of Detroit.  </P> <P> Times researcher Cecilia Rasmussen contributed to this story.  </P></p>

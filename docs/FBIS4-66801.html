			<p>CSO     [Text] Patna, March 16--The 35th national conference of the  All-India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) concluded here yesterday  with a call for organisational unification of the trade unions,  to wage battle against the new economic policies of the Central  government, which, according to it, was dictated by the IMF and  the World Bank in the name of free market economy and  globalisation.    Briefing mediapersons on the concluding day of the five-day  conference, the newly elected general secretary of the AITUC, Mr  A.B. Bardhan, said that it was felt at the conference that there  should be one union in an establishment, one industrial  federation at state and national levels and one central trade  union at the national level, which would function democratically  and independently. The AITUC had called upon unions at the  grassroot level and trade union centres to come together on the  basis of a common outlook and common programme of action, he  added.    Commenting on the demand of the Centre for Indian Trade  Union  (CITU) for formation of a confederation of all trade unions, Mr  Bardhan said that it could be the beginning, but it was not  enough. The merger of trade unions should be the ultimate aim.  Hence, the current session welcomed the decision of the AITUC  and the Hind Majdoor Sabha (HMS) to constitute co-ordination  committees at different levels, with a view to pave the way for  an eventual merger. Such a committee at the national level had  already been formed, Mr Bardhan said.    The resolution, adopted at the conference, says that  transnational corporations are being given free access almost in  every sphere and public sector enterprises are being  systematically dismantled. Workers and employees are facing the  grim prospect of closure, retrenchment and mass unemployment  under the new economic policies. Alongside this, national unity  and integrity are being endangered by communal and other  divisive forces. The country's independence and sovereignty are  under grave threats.    The resolution on minimum wages adopted at the conference  pointed to the fact that much larger section of workers were in  the unorganised sector and there was disparity in wages in  various states and hence this disparity within a region should  be removed.</p>

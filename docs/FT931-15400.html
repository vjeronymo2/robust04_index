			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Italy The odds seem stacked against Italy's privatisation programme raising much enthusiasm abroad. On a gloomy view of the cycle, the government has chosen a poor time to offer up its industrial assets. The complexity of the state holding companies and the restructuring required to knock them into shape hardly promise a smooth transition to the private sector. Since the government soaks up the lion's share of domestic savings, attracting overseas investors could be more than a matter of convenience. All the more reason for the government not to shirk the issue of majority control. Concern over the treatment of minority shareholders extends beyond Italy. Few investors would want a minority stake in any company viewed as strategically important by government. But the experience of creditors to Efim, the state holding company put into voluntary liquidation last July, has left the international financial community especially suspicious of the Italian public sector. Outright trade sales of the smaller and juicier assets - such as ENI's mechanical engineering side - should go well enough. However, the jury is out on the next stage of the process until the government has declared a firm policy on golden share holdings and the like. If the government really wants international support, it must convince investors that it is after the wider benefits of privatisation rather than just the cash.</p>

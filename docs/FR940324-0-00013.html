			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Continuous flow passenger oxygen equipment is certificated for use up to 40,000 feet; however, for rapid decompressions above 34,000 feet, reverse diffusion leads to low oxygen partial pressures in the lungs, to the extent that a small percentage of passengers may lose useful consciousness at 35,000 feet. The percentage increases to an estimated 60 percent at 40,000 feet, even with the use of the continuous flow system. Therefore, to prevent permanent physiological damage, the cabin altitude must not exceed 25,000 feet for more than 2 minutes, or 40,000 feet for any time period. The maximum peak cabin altitude of 40,000 feet is consistent with the standards established for previous certification programs. In addition, at high altitudes the other aspects of decompression sickness have a significant, detrimental effect on pilot performance (for example, a pilot can be incapacitated by internal expanding gases). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decompression resulting in cabin altitudes above the 37,000-foot limit depicted in Figure 4 approaches the physiological limits of the average person; therefore, every effort must be made to provide the pilots with adequate oxygen equipment to withstand these severe decompressions. Reducing the time interval between pressurization failure and the time the pilots receive oxygen will provide a safety margin against being incapacitated and can be accomplished by the use of mask-mounted regulators. These special conditions therefore require pressure demand masks with mask-mounted regulators for the flightcrew. This combination of equipment will provide the best practical protection for the failures covered by the special conditions and for improbably failures not covered by the special conditions, provided the cabin altitude is limited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of proposed special conditions No. SC&hyph;93&hyph;8&hyph;NM was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67716). No comments were received, and the special conditions are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action affects only certain unusual or novel design features on one model of airplane. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these features on the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 25 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aircraft, Aviation safety, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority citation for these special conditions is as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1344, 1348(c), 1352, 1354(a), 1355, 1421 through 1431, 1502, 1651(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. 1857f&hyph;10, 4321 et seq.; E.O. 11514; and 49 U.S.C. 106(g). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Special Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the following special conditions are issued as part of the type certification basis for the Learjet Model 45 series airplanes: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Operation to 51,000 Feet <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pressure vessel integrity.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The maximum extent of failure and pressure vessel opening that can be demonstrated to comply with paragraph 4 (Pressurization) of this special condition must be determined. It must be demonstrated by crack propagation and damage tolerance analysis supported by testing that a larger opening or a more severe failure than demonstrated will not occur in normal operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Inspection schedules and procedures must be established to assure that cracks and normal fuselage leak rates will not deteriorate to the extent that an unsafe condition could exist during normal operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) With regard to the fuselage structural design for cabin pressure capability above 45,000 feet altitude, the pressure vessel structure, including doors and windows, must comply with &sect;25.365(d), using a factor of 1.67 instead of the 1.33 factor described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ventilation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In lieu of the requirements of &sect;25.831(a), the ventilation system must be designed to provide a sufficient amount of uncontaminated air to enable the crewmembers to perform their duties without undue discomfort or fatigue, and to provide reasonable passenger comfort during normal operating conditions and also in the event of any probable failure to any system that could adversely affect the cabin ventilating air. For normal operations, crewmembers and passengers must be provided with at least 10 cubic feet of fresh air per minute per person, or the equivalent in filtered, recirculated air based on the volume and composition at the corresponding cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8,000 feet. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Air conditioning.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.831, paragraphs (b) through (e), the cabin cooling system must be designed to meet the following conditions during flight above 15,000 feet mean sea level (MSL): (a) After any probably failure, the cabin temperature-time history may not exceed the values shown in Figure 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) After any improbable failure, the cabin temperature-time history may not exceed the values shown in Figure 2. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pressurization.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the requirements of &sect;25.841, the following apply: (a) The pressurization system, which includes for this purpose bleed air, air conditioning, and pressure control systems, must prevent the cabin altitude from exceeding the cabin altitude-time history shown in Figure 3 after each of the following: (1) Any probable malfunction or failure of the pressurization system. The existence of undetected, latent malfunctions or failures in conjunction with probable failures must be considered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any single failure in the pressurization system, combined with the occurrence of a leak produced by a complete loss of a door seal element, or a fuselage leak through an opening having an effective area 2.0 times the effective area that produces the maximum permissible fuselage leak rate approved for normal operation, whichever produces a more severe leak. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

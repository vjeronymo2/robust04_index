			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: The green view on subsidiarity With the French referendum on Maastricht imminent, it has been disconcerting how little coverage has been given to the environmental priorities of both the existing and proposed European Community. A key question governing effective environmental protection is whether the dogma of free trade should be allowed to continue to override national environmental concerns. Greenpeace, the environmental group, has challenged this view, calling for changes that allow countries in the EC to take unilateral action to protect their environment even if they override the sacred objective of the freedom of movement of goods and services. However, such questioning is not found in the Maastricht Treaty or the debate surrounding it. Instead, 'subsidiarity' has been promoted as a key term since the Danish 'no' vote. This has been brought to the fore in an attempt to calm those who perceive that Maastricht means the loss of sovereign control to Brussels. Subsidiarity, put simply, means that action should be taken at a Community level only where it would be more appropriate than taking action at a national or regional authority level. In order for environmental protection to become a basic goal of the EC, the principle of 'subsidiarity' has to be harnessed to this end. 'Green subsidiarity' would be defined as confining EC intervention to those areas where it will be more effective than national action in ensuring maximum protection of the environment. Thus the EC would not be able to hinder member states from introducing more stringent environmental measures than the Community norm, regardless of whether it might be an impediment to some trade within the Community. The mechanism would also make the EC's harmonised levels of environmental protection a floor beneath which no member state's environmental standards would be allowed to drop. Last month, for instance, France closed its border to German waste after the discovery that trucks which were supposed to carry household waste also contained syringes, bloodbags and other dangerous hospital waste. Around the same time the Swedish government was warned by the EC Commission that its draft regulation on ozone-depleting substances was contrary to the proposed trade arrangements between itself and the EC. Sweden wants to introduce a ban on the imports of products containing or produced with CFCs, HCFCs and other ozone destroyers. The Commission is concerned that these measures will be considered too stringent and would go further than EC regulations. On the other hand, there is the speculation that the UK government could use the principle in the opposite way to weaken domestic adherence to the restrictions imposed by the EC's Bathing and Drinking Water Directives. The principle of 'green subsidiarity' applied to these cases would mean that decisions would be made at the level which would ensure maximum environmental protection. Its use would allow France to maintain controls on the imports of German toxic waste. It would also mean that Sweden's proposed bans on products containing, or produced by, ozone-depleting chemicals would not have to be watered down in order to ensure their right of passage into the European Community. The UK, however, would not be allowed to retain its sorry title of 'The Dirty Man of Europe' by using 'subsidiarity' as an excuse to drop its bathing and drinking water standards below those of the EC directives. Allowing some member countries to go further than the EC norm would create new competitive pressures in Europe and over time could be expected to lead to the ratcheting up of national standards. An additional impetus that might need to be considered would be to allow a country to set environmental conditions for access to its markets. Regardless of whether Maastricht will need to be renegotiated, the European Community's major environmental problems will remain largely unsolved unless tackled at such a fundamental level. 'Green subsidiarity' thus provides the mechanism for ensuring both the maximum protection for the environment and the emergence of a group of nations which are constantly increasing their environmental standards.

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / DTI urged to take over training role: Department of Employment's future bleak The Commons trade and industry committee is to recommend the transfer of responsibility for training from the Department of Employment to the Department of Trade and Industry. The move will fuel speculation about the employment department's future. In a report on UK competitiveness to be published next week, the committee will single out the short-term culture of the City as one of a number of structural weaknesses that are damaging Britain's prospects. However, in conclusions reached as the government puts the finishing touches to its own competitiveness white paper, the MPs will argue that the decline in UK manufacturing can still be arrested. The white paper, which the DTI plans to publish before May 19 - the official start of the European election campaign - is expected to act as a mid-term manifesto, pulling together a range of government policies on education, training and manufacturing. It should enable Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, to maintain a high political profile in advance of elections that could have a critical bearing on the future Tory leadership. It is generally accepted that a poor Conservative performance would deal a devastating blow to Mr John Major's premiership. Next week's report - prepared by a committee with a Conservative majority - will suggest that the taxation system should be used to try to change the short-term culture of the City. It calls for consideration to be given to an adjustment of taxes to make executive share options less attractive. The MPs believe these options can be damaging because they give managers an incentive to keep their company's share price high and discourage them from cutting dividends, even when this would be in the company's long-term interest. They also believe that ministers should consider using tax incentives to encourage investors to adopt a longer-term approach to investing in small companies. The MPs believe that shifting primary responsibility for training to the DTI is one of a number of measures that could be taken to improve the effectiveness of government programmes. Such a step would lift the DTI's annual budget by up to Pounds 2.3bn. Senior Tory officials have been floating the idea of scrapping the employment department this summer as part of the expected cabinet reshuffle. Details of the report emerged as Mr Michael Portillo, the rightwing chief Treasury secretary, used a speech in London to set out his own agenda for improving competitiveness. Pledging to resist pressure for Britain to sign up to the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, Mr Portillo said the government had put in place a framework in which business could flourish. Britain had stabilised its share of world trade in manufactured goods after decades of decline, he said. Further improvement depended on 'investment, education, training and infrastructure'.</p>

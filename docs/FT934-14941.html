			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Molyneaux snubs Dublin meeting MR JAMES Molyneaux, leader of the Ulster Unionist party, has ruled out an imminent meeting with Mr Dick Spring, Irish foreign minister, to discuss the Hume-Adams peace initiative, in spite of strong interest in Dublin for such a meeting. Mr Molyneaux yesterday said: 'I already know what's in (the initiative). It is a grandiose scheme calling for the self-determination of the whole of Ireland and designed to go over the heads . . . of the people of Northern Ireland.' The UUP is not demanding to be briefed on the initiative and Mr Molyneaux has no plans for an imminent meeting with Mr Spring. This contradicted reports in the Irish media that Mr Molyneaux was already in Dublin. 'I am flattered to discover that I am the first mortal to appear in two places at once,' he said. 'I have been working a long time to achieve that.' The reports appear to be fuelled by the Irish government's keen interest to talk to the unionist parties. The Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin said: 'We would very much look forward to a meeting with the unionist leadership if it could be arranged.' Mr Molyneaux did not specifically rule out the possibility of a meeting at a later stage. The Irish government was briefed last week on the Hume-Adams peace initiative by Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party. Details are being kept secret for fear that what is now considered a nascent peace process could be halted by publicity before all parties have been given a chance to consider the proposals. Unionist interest in the initiative was indicated earlier this week by the Rev Martin Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast, who said that Sinn Fein would be accepted by the UUP at the negotiating table if there was to be a total cessation of violence. What remains to be clarified are the terms on which the IRA would abandon its 25-year military campaign. Mr Ken Maginnis, UUP deputy leader, said yesterday that an end to violence would require the handing-over of all arms caches by the IRA and other paramilitary groups.</p>

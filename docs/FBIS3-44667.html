			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on New Year interview with Jiang Xinxiong (5592 1800 </F> 7160), general manager of the China National Nuclear  Corporation, by staff correspondent Lu Zhenhua (7120 2182 5478);  place, date not given: "Jiang Xinxiong on China's Nuclear  Industrial Development"]    [Text] The year behind us was one that saw the  comprehensive development of the China National Nuclear  Corporation. How strong is the momentum of development for the  corporation in this new year of progress, both in reform and  opening up and in economic development? With this question in  mind -- a question that concerns many readers -- this  correspondent interviewed Jiang Xinxiong, general manager of the  China National Nuclear Corporation.    "Speeding up structural reform and promoting development,  both in science and technology and in economic power -- these  are the targets for our corporation in the new year," said Jiang  Xinxiong by way of opening the conversation, and already holding  forth: "Only thus can we match with the corporation's line of  thinking on development, genuinely maintain our status as a  hi-tech force commensurate with our country's nuclear status,  build a new nuclear- powered electricity system and a nuclear  industrial system capable of meeting the demands of national  energy development, and create a diversified operating mode and  production force with a greater market share. Only then can we  make new contributions to the development of the nuclear  industry in the next century."    Showing deep gratitude to the tens of thousands of the  corporation's workers, he said: "In 1993, thanks of the  efforts of one and all, we scored good results." Since its  second grid- connected generation last March, the Taishan  nuclear power plant has maintained steady, high-power  operations, generating a total of 1.73 billion kwh by the end of  last year, reaching 65 percent of its capacity. This feat has  received good comments from experts inside and outside the  country. The work design on the second-phase project is in full  swing, and an almost 1,000-m tunnel has been bored. The No. 1  generating unit of the Daya Bay nuclear power plant is operating  normally, achieving its full-load operating capacity on 27  November 1993. Jiang also stressed that the corporation's  research and development department had achieved a number of  results, nine of which were awarded Eureka Prizes at the 42d  Brussels International Invention Fair. China's uranium  enrichment technology and equipment also have achieved  breakthroughs. China has built up a workshop producing  components for an imported 900,000 kw water-pressurized reactor,  which passed the examination of the importer. This signals  China's ability to produce domestically and in a systematic  fashion the fuel components for 300,000-, 600,000-, and  900,000-kw nuclear-powered generators. The adoption of the  underground submersion [rong jin 3310 3190] and piled submersion  [ye dui jin 0396 1018 3190] methods in uranium mining cut the  average cost by 30 percent.    Jiang Xinxiong also talked about the Chinese nuclear  industry's effort to open overseas markets, the export of  nuclear products for peaceful purposes, nuclear technology, and  engineering projects. He said the project to export nuclear  power plants to Pakistan had been going well since the  completion of the first-phase concrete cement grouting last  August, which had prompted talks between Pakistan and China on  building a second 300,000-kw nuclear power generator. Contracts  have been signed for the export of two 300,000-kw nuclear power  generators to Iran. Last year, the foreign-exchange earning  exports of the corporation's nuclear industry arm grew 75  percent from the previous year.    General Manager Jiang changed the subject: "This year is a  good opportunity for the corporation to speed up development."  He also believed that deepening reforms and switching nuclear  industrial firms' operating mechanisms are the keys. Through  pilot projects in modern corporate systems and through moves to  push enterprises toward the market, enterprises will grow  stronger internally and workers will get incentives. Only thus  can enterprises adjust to the new socialist market economy  system.    "This year the corporation is focusing on large-scale  projects. Civil engineering work will start for the two  600,000-kw generators in the second phase of construction at the  Taishan nuclear power plant, and the No. 1 generator at the Daya  Bay nuclear power plant is in its final preparatory stages and  will be in commercial operation in February. The corporation  will further strengthen overseas cooperation, and will create  conditions to propel toward the construction stage the export of  nuclear power plants to Pakistan."    General Manager Jiang said: This year, the corporation will  concentrate its energy on giving play to its superiority,  actively participating in market competition, and opening up  overseas and domestic markets. It will work toward the targets  of raising the annual gross nuclear industrial output value by  22.1 percent, and of raising the proportion of the gross output  value of civilian products throughout the industry. He said  with deep feeling: "This year happens to the 40th anniversary  of the founding of China's nuclear industry. We should  celebrate this glorious day with new successes!"</p>

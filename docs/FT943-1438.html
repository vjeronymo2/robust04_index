			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / SPD's troika starting to totter The authority of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the Social Democrat (SPD) party leader, was challenged yesterday by his rival-turned-partner, Mr Gerhard Schroder. Old rivalries between the two men re-emerged as Mr Schroder demanded an equal say in negotiations with potential coalition members and the process of sharing out departmental responsibilities in the event of an SPD victory in the forthcoming federal elections. Less than a month before the poll and just three weeks since Mr Scharping recruited Mr Schroder and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, Saarland premier, into a 'troika' to lead the party's campaign, Mr Schroder said it was not acceptable that 'some have to walk while others ride on horseback'. The party leader was only 'the first among equals', he said. Opinion poll results had stabilised since Mr Schroder joined the campaign. Although the SPD was still trailing Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and their Christian Social Union allies, and SPD supporters should not raise their hopes too high, this showed the troika was already a success, Mr Schroder said. It had 'stopped the free-fall' in public opinion towards the party, he told the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung. Mr Schroder, who was beaten by Mr Scharping in last year's vote for the party leadership, had joined the ad hoc leadership team after standing aloof insisting he would fight on his home ground, Lower Saxony. He said yesterday the right to an equal say in forming a government was an implicit condition of his agreeing to join. He once again staked his claim to a 'super ministry' for economics, transport and energy. It was 'very likely' he would be granted this range of responsibilities in any SPD-led coalition, he said. The attempt to pep up Mr Scharping's conservative style with Mr Schroder's populist aggression and Mr Lafontaine's charisma was widely interpreted at the time as a sign the party had accepted its leader stood little chance alone against Mr Kohl. Now the risks involved in putting three men with such contrasting styles on the hustings together appear to be emerging. Mr Schroder was recently seen on television telling supporters that he and Mr Lafontaine had discussed which jokes they would tell during the campaign and had decided Mr Scharping should not be allowed to tell any. While the trio is due to appear together on several occasions before voting on October 16 - with one open-air outing booked for next Tuesday in Frankfurt - media attention is still closely focused on Mr Scharping. Consistent rather than rousing, he is presenting himself as the man of the middle ground, mimicking the nothing-disturbs-me style of Mr Kohl, in an apparent attempt to lure the CDU vote. However, his speeches so far have shown little variation in tone, content or temper. Bidding to unseat Mr Kohl who is campaigning for his fourth four-year term after unseating the SPD's Mr Helmut Schmidt, Mr Scharping refers constantly to the SPD's hey-day leaders, Mr Willy Brandt and Mr Schmidt, as his role models. Mr Schroder, meanwhile, has adopted a characteristically more direct and aggressive style with direct attacks on the chancellor: 'Kohl and Co are done for. They have got to go.'</p>

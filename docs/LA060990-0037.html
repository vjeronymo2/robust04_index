			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY PUT A SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE ON GAMES  </P> <P> Almost every day I read about athletes involved in drug abuse, assaults and  rapes.  </P> <P> It seems to me that if you can justify this coverage, you could surely devote  some space to California Special Olympics June 22.  </P> <P> There will be no under-four-minute miles, no 19-foot pole vaults and no 75-foot  shotputs. What there will be is a sporting event in the purest sense, athletic  competition for the joy of participation.  </P> <P> There will be no athletes signing endorsements or receiving huge sums to war a  brand of shoes. But make no mistake about it: These are athletes.  </P> <P> WILLIAM ASH, Santa Monica  </P></p>

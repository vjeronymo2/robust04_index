			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / FT Exporter (35): Grounds for guarded optimism - Although there is as yet no cause for real celebration, encouraging signs for exporters are beginning to emerge / Guest Column, Malcolm Stephens It is a common - and, indeed very human - trait to feel that you are living and working in more difficult conditions than any previous occupant of your desk. This has certainly been true of the exporters, trade and export finance bankers and credit insurers among whom I have worked for more than 30 years. Yet perhaps now a number of things are looking a little better than they have done for some years. Most people who export or provide export services have seen a decade or more where few of the many changes have seemed for the better. From the norm of one or two countries being unable to pay their debts at any one time, the international debt crisis has rapidly led to not only more than 50 countries in serious default and rescheduling their export credit debts with the Paris Club, but also to the spread of what is euphemistically called 'debt forgiveness'. Some see the latter as an insidious trend to rewarding poor performing debtors, while others see it as coming to terms with reality. Whichever is true, it is expensive for those who pick up the bill. For many, things went from bad to worse when debt problems in the developing world coincided with deep and prolonged recession in OECD countries and the collapse of a whole trading system in eastern Europe. As a result, ministries of finance and treasuries sought to control the provision of export credit by state agencies and enforce significantly higher premium rates (some, such as those in the UK Treasury more vigorously and 'successfully' than others). Credit committees of banks also decided that cross-border lending was no longer an activity they found attractive. In addition, exporting companies found unprecedented competition in those relatively fewer markets combining demand and creditworthy buyers. In wondering if things are now looking a little brighter, I am not among those who feel that the debt crisis is over. The debtor queue has got longer, rather than shorter in the past year and some of those joining it have uncomfortably large debts. My reasons for suggesting some optimism are partly psychological, but they also arise from that fact that the depth of the problems have forced changes of policy in many institutions, not only public and private, but also among multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). There are clear signs that the recession in the OECD is lifting. This is of special importance to those countries whose exports are concentrated on OECD buyers. Low interest rates also help. While the overall picture is patchy, the next year should see exports rise and buyer insolvencies and defaults fall. Another encouraging sign for exporters in OECD countries should be the increasing competition between credit insurers, especially in the vital area of short-term business. The traditional role of government in this area is being questioned and is changing. This is not restricted to the UK - where the worst fears of exporters over the privatisation of ECGD's short-term business have simply not been realised. Indeed, privatisation has opened up the whole market and more than 10 insurers - including some of Europe's biggest - now claim to offer credit insurance in the UK. This increase in competition is improving service to exporters, but is exerting downward pressure on premium rates. There are also signs that capital goods exports to non-OECD markets are picking up, although there is some 'skewing' in the concentration of demand in Asia and the Far East. It is for these sort of exports that the infamous 'level playing field' is of most significance and it is arguable that cross-border differences in facilities have lessened in most areas, apart from that of premium rates. Greater discipline has been attached, via the OECD Consensus, to the application of interest rates, long-term credit and mixed credits. Indeed, some would argue that, as interest rate subsidies have been phased out, some flexibility in the length and repayment profile of projects should be allowed (even encouraged), particularly on limited recourse projects. No one, for example, expects say a Metro system in Belgium to pay for itself in six or seven years, so why should it do so in a non-OECD country? Even in the sensitive area of premium rates, some of the high rate countries (especially the UK) have reduced many of their rates and increasingly determined efforts are being made within the European Union and the OECD to find a standard for premium rate-setting to reduce current disparities. Another encouraging sign is the greater willingness of the international financial institutions, especially the EBRD and the World Bank, to work with the export credit agencies (ECAs). A more flexible approach is needed if co-financing is to take place on any scale. The international financial institutions have not been alone in misunderstanding the ECAs' role (and how it differs from that of aid administration agencies) and in underestimating the financial and other pressures ECAs are under from ministries of finance and, increasingly, from legislators to avoid claims and losses of the past. The EBRD is looking at what needs to be done for and with the ECAs to produce co-financing and thus improve the gearing international institutions can achieve from sharing in the financing of a project. Some of the signs are good, but there is a long way to go. Another helpful trend is the greater emphasis on project financing and limited recourse financing. This is a useful technique for some projects and some buyers and buying countries. Translating the theory into practice is not always easy but provided banks and contractors are willing to share risks with the ECAs the willingness of institutions to put time, effort and money into areas such as developing skills to handle such financings will bear valuable fruit. The key may well be to steer clear of unrealistic expectations and to look more kindly at those who lend and take risks rather than those who simply advise. In suggesting that there are grounds for guarded optimism among exporters, I stop short of euphoria. This is partly because a number of the factors mentioned above represent signs of change, rather than fully-fledged developments. Optimism must, therefore, be tempered by the fact that all involved with exports and the financing and insuring of trade must face up to a series of difficult questions, the solution to many of which will involve the slaughtering of sacred cows. Who, for example, is going to finance sales, especially of capital goods and projects to the poorest countries? Who is going to finance large but vital infrastructure (non-foreign exchange earning) projects, not only in Russia, but also in a long list of developing countries? How long will it take to invent and develop mechanisms for export credit and export finance which facilitate multi-sourcing for large projects? Are the capital markets a reliable source of finance for projects and do they have any appetite for risks or risk sharing? Will the availability of such funds for projects survive either a rise in US interest rates or the first signs os a debtor going to the Paris Club? With the spread of privatisation and the desire of an increasing number of governments to withdraw from commercial and industrial activities and involvement of many kinds, what is the future, for example of the World Bank's traditional insistence on government guarantees and preferred creditor status? How long will it take for a legal and financial infrastructure to develop in Russia and other former Comecon countries such that it is possible to make credit rating judgements on individual buyers and to find acceptable commercial banks to extend guarantees? Until we have begun to find answers to some of these questions, I doubt it is possible to be really optimistic.

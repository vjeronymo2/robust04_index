			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OPEN DOOR TO SUE VENTURA COUNTY FOR TRIAL COSTS  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Supervisors Tuesday gave its attorneys the go-ahead  to sue Ventura County for $169,000 in expenses, which they say are owed from  the trial of convicted child killer Theodore Frank.  </P> <P> Frank was convicted in late 1979 for the abduction, rape and torture slaying of  2-year-old Amy Sue Seitz. The child was abducted from her aunt's house in  Camarillo in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Frank's case was moved to Orange County because of extensive pretrial  publicity.  </P> <P> Lon Watson, Orange County assistant county counsel, said the supervisors voted  unanimously to try to recoup costs from the trial because the statute of  limitations was about to expire.  </P> <P> At the time of his arrest in 1978, Frank was a convicted child molester who had  been released from Atascadero State Hospital just six weeks earlier.  </P> <P> Frank was sentenced to die at San Quentin for the Amy Sue Seitz murder. But six  years later his death sentence was overturned by the state Supreme Court, and a  second penalty trial was held. Frank again was sentenced to die and sent back  to San Quentin.  </P> <P> Watson said the disputed expenses were incurred since 1985.  </P></p>

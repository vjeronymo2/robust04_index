			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / FT Interview: Euro-club's new arrival - Theodoros Pangalos The club rules of the European Union conventionally demand certain standards of courtesy and tact between member states, and above all from whoever holds the EU's rotating presidency, whose main job is to forge consensus, or at least keep the 12 on the same side. Thus, when the incoming president of the Union's Council of Ministers describes Germany, one of the EU's most powerful member states, as 'a bestial giant with a child's brain', it is a sure sign of interesting times ahead. Greece, arguably the EU's weakest member state, takes over the presidency on January 1 for six months, and the author of those remarks, deputy foreign minister Theodoros Pangalos, will be the Greek presidency's most visible face as chairman of the foreign ministers of the 12. This year's return to power in Greece of Mr Andreas Papandreou and his Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement (Pasok) sent tremors right across the Union's political spectrum. Irrespective of ideological affiliation, many of Greece's partners worry that Mr Papandreou's past equivocations over European integration could resurface. Greece, under its previous conservative government as well as under Pasok, is obstinately opposed to EU diplomatic recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia unless it agrees to change its name. Athens insists that behind what it calls 'the Skopje government's' choice of Macedonia lies a claim on the northern Greek region of the same name. A Greek presidency is widely seen as a loose cannon on the deck of a European ship, which, badly buffeted in the currency markets and the voting booths during the past 18 months, is far from back on an even keel. Mr Pangalos, outspoken and articulate, is well aware of prevailing sentiments. 'The easy way they explain that is to say that the crazy Greeks elected a crazy government which will do crazy things,' he says. 'I'm trying to disappoint that point of view.' He will not find this easy. One senior Greek conservative politician reckons that, at best, 'it will be a mediocre but uneventful presidency'. But predictably, he warns that Mr Papandreou, in frail health and in the past unwilling to delegate, has a record of being unpredictable. Mr Pangalos believes that the resurgence of Greek socialism discomfits those who had written off the European left. 'The presidency will be one of the Union, not one representing Greek interests,' he states. 'Greece offers a challenge for the EU,' he says. It is far away, it enjoys little more than half the EU's average per capita wealth, and its debt, budget deficit and inflation far outstrip the average in a Union set on economic and monetary convergence. Greece is the largest net recipient of funds from the EU budget, standing to receive some Ecu20bn in regional aid over the next six years. But two thirds of this flows back to German, British and French contractors, Mr Pangalos says. 'We are a good client of the EU because we are such lousy exporters,' he adds. The wars in former Yugoslavia have caused a rift between Athens and its partners, not only over the Macedonia question, but because of Greece's close ties with Serbia, the target of international sanctions as a result of its aggression in Bosnia. But before that, Greece managed to keep many of its partners in episodic irritation by blocking aid to Turkey, and therefore the 12's attempts to develop a more coherent Mediterranean policy. Turkey not only aspires to membership of the Union, but after the collapse of the Soviet Union is seen by leading EU members as having a pivotal role in the former Soviet republics of central Asia. Standing in the way of closer links is historic Greek-Turkish enmity, which Mr Pangalos, for one, has done nothing to play down. In another notorious recent comment, he described the Turkish government as 'muggers', who were 'dragging bloody boots across the carpets of Europe'. Aged 55, Mr Pangalos is a French-trained lawyer and economist. His roots are as colourful as his rhetoric. His father was a fighter pilot, and his grandfather was an anti-monarchist general who carried out a celebrated, bloodless coup in 1925. Unlike most Pasok luminaries, emigres to socialism from the old Centre parties, Mr Pangalos was until 1968 involved in Greece's once-powerful Communist movement. Deprived of his Greek citizenship by the colonels' junta, he spent 1969 to 1978 teaching at the Sorbonne in Paris, and organising opposition in Europe to the dictatorship. He was elected to parliament when Pasok came to power in 1981, soon becoming deputy trade minister and then European Affairs minister. This will be the third Greek presidency he has been closely involved in. The first Greek presidency, in 1983, was 'correct', he says, but ended in deadlock because of the Anglo-French row over the UK's refund from the European budget. The Papandreou government, he says, was successful in its second stint in the chair in 1988, and, he adds with a glint in his eye, received a letter of congratulations from Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Thatcher possibly discerned in Mr Pangalos the pragmatic core behind the bombast. On Macedonia, he said last month that the name controversy was 'a lost cause for Greece', provoking calls for his resignation. He argues that 'we should get rid of the pending issues'. The Macedonian government has 'never said that is the border. We live in a dangerous neighbourhood,' he says. 'Their flag' - the emblem of a Macedonian dynasty founded 50km south of Salonika - 'is a provocation. Claiming you are descendants of ancient Greeks is very flattering for us, but please find something from your own territory.' Settle this, he says, and the rest will fall into place. 'We recognise the (Macedonia/Skopje) state, and we want the state to be there. We'll be the ones with the conflict on our border, not you,' he fires back. 'What we ask is not much: they have to abandon the dream of uniting Macedonia under their leadership.' Mr Pangalos has identified the main challenge of Greece's presidency as bringing the accession negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway to a successful conclusion. A success in the enlargement negotiations would signal Greece's real arrival in the Euro-club. And maybe then the rule book some of Greece's partners are now waving censoriously at Mr Pangalos could stand some colourful additions.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Railtrack pressed on Scottish line Railtrack, which will run Britain's rail infrastructure from next April, is to be pressed to electrify a line between Edinburgh and Glasgow to test government willingness to fund rail projects that do not produce an adequate rate of return. A study by consultants Oscar Faber TPA presented yesterday showed that electrifying the route via Falkirk, the commuter line between the two cities, was the best option for its future. It would attract passengers from the roads, the consultants said. While it would not meet the government's required 8 per cent rate of return on investment, a good case could be made for seeking a government grant when social and non-user benefits were taken into account, the study said. Mr Paul Prescott, director of Railtrack Scotland, said that if the project were evaluated on the same basis as a road scheme 'it would come out almost higher than upgrading the M8 motorway' between Edinburgh and Glasgow. In its rail privatisation white paper last January, the government said it was 'ready to provide support for investing in the railway for schemes which, although not earning an adequate financial return, provide a substantial cost-benefit return when wider benefits are taken into account'. Electrifying the 47-mile line would cost about Pounds 75m, of which Pounds 50m would be spent on new trains. The 100mph trains would run every 15 minutes instead of the present 30 minutes, and permit a journey time of 44 minutes compared with the present 50 minutes. The study was commissioned by ScotRail and Strathclyde, Central and Lothian regional councils, which want to contain road congestion. ScotRail and the councils will now press the government through Railtrack to help finance the project. The initial approach will be to the Scottish Office. Mr Cyril Bleasdale, director of ScotRail, said a decision was unlikely for two years. 'It's a vision and a long-term strategy,' he said. Mr Malcolm Waugh, chairman of Strathclyde regional council's transport committee, said it would be 'a test case of the government's new policy'.</p>

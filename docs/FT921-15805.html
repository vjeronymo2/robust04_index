			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bush aide warns EC over objections to Gatt text US FARMERS will not easily be convinced that the so-called Dunkel text for the Uruguay Round of negotiations in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is sufficient for reforms to go ahead, the Oxford farming conference was told yesterday. If Europe persisted in its objections to the text - proposed by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, as a way out of the present deadlock - the round could end in failure, said Mr Gary Blumenthal, special assistant to President George Bush for agricultural trade and food assistance. 'If Europe says 'too far', I fear for the whole round.' Referring to Mr Dunkel's deadline of January 13 for country responses to his proposals, made on December 20, Mr Blumenthal said the US would 'not let a time-frame drive the agreement.' However, it would like an agreement this year. In a strong attack on the European Community's Common Agricultural Policy, he suggested that 'poverty through dominance' was a more fitting theme for the conference than 'prosperity through excellence'. 'Prosperity through excellence is thematically incomplete without substantial reform of government policies which reward the inefficient, pacify or misdirect the industrious and punish the ineligible,' he said. Pointing out that the EC was spending, directly and indirectly, Dollars 160bn a year on agriculture, he said that government-supported prosperity for European farmers had meant impoverishment for farmers elsewhere in the world. He said it was inexplicable to Americans that Europeans tolerated such high taxes to support the CAP. EC consumers had to spend 21.6 per cent of their incomes on food, compared with 12 per cent in the US. 'EC wheat prices are 60 per cent higher than the world price, barley and beef prices are nearly double and milk prices are nearly triple the world price,' he said. Not only did the EC block the admission of goods, it then used export subsidies to dump surpluses on the world market. This cost the US Dollars 8bn in 1989 and led to global losses of Dollars 27bn in agricultural trade, he said. After Gatt reforms, EC farmers would capture their fair share of a free world market. The conference had been far too inward looking. 'I strongly urge you to look at the world market, not just the home market.' However, if the Gatt talks failed, 'I won't say I blame Europe but it is hard to accept that the blame lies on both sides of the Atlantic'. Mr Blumenthal rejected accusations that the US said one thing and did another, and that US subsidies were comparable to those in the EC. He said US farmers had been enthusiastic about the Gatt talks in the early stages, but only a 'quality' agreement under which they could be seen to benefit would rekindle their enthusiasm now. Mr David Harvey, of the Department of Agricultural Economics and Food Marketing at Newcastle University, said that volatile prices for world agricultural commodities could be put down mainly to the fact that 90 per cent of world trade was not free. This destabilised both the world market and the EC budget. He urged farmers to take on board the clear message that market forces were here to stay in the agricultural industry.</p>

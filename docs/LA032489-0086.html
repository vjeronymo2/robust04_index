			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RELEAGUING PLAN CALLS FOR ALEMANY TO LEAVE DEL REY  </P> <P> As recently as last season, three of the Valley-area's most prominent Catholic  high schools competed together in the Del Rey League. But if a releaguing  proposal is approved by the Catholic Athletic Assn., Alemany, Crespi and Notre  Dame will play in three different leagues beginning in 1990.  </P> <P> Notre Dame left the Del Rey and joined the San Fernando Valley League this  school year. Under the proposal, Alemany would leave the Del Rey and join La  Puente Bishop Amat, Torrance Bishop Montgomery, Santa Ana Mater Dei, Playa del  Rey St. Bernard and Santa Fe Springs St. Paul in a six-team league of  coeducational schools.  </P> <P> Crespi would remain in the Del Rey with St. Francis, Loyola and St. John Bosco.  Those three would be joined by Bosco Tech and Servite in a six-team league of  boys-only schools. Neither of the proposed leagues has yet been named.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley League of Bell-Jeff, Chaminade, Harvard, Notre Dame,  St. Genevieve and La Salle would remain unchanged.  </P> <P> Schools have until March 31 to file objections to the plan. The proposal will  go before the Catholic Athletic Assn. at a meeting next month. Alemany's  principal, Father Michael Nocita, said that he probably will not object. He  wants Alemany to remain in a Division I league and is confident that the  Indians can compete at that level despite a disappointing showing this school  year. But he has concerns about travel.  </P> <P> "I don't see any big problems, except travel time, which is an extreme  drawback," he said.  </P> <P> Crespi Athletic Director Paul Muff said that his school also will support the  proposal, saying the chances are good it will pass.  </P> <P> "We're happy with it because it keeps the Del Rey together and we have good  relationships with those schools," he said. "Of course, we no longer have a  Valley rival in the league and that's a drawback."  </P></p>

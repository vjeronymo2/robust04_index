			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- According to FRG Environment Minister  Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union), a concrete date for  the closure of the fatal reactor of Chernobyl, which has been  demanded for years, cannot be given at present. "Unfortunately,  I have to say that the chance of its closure cannot be called  very concrete," he admitted in a DPA interview on Sunday [24  April]. Toepfer made these comments with a view to the upcoming  eighth anniversary of the reactor catastrophe of Chernobyl on 26  April 1986.    The original decision of the Ukrainian Parliament to close  the entire plant by 1993 has meanwhile been revised, despite  protests "from Germany and other Western states," Toepfer  explained. He pointed out that Ukraine has again and again  presented the question of power supply as "the bottleneck that  prevents the two reactors in Chernobyl that are still operating  from being switched off." Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister  Valeriy Shmarov also made this clear at the latest Chernobyl  conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in  Vienna. Nevertheless, the majority of representatives called  for its closure.    Toepfer pointed out that the problem of power supply also  applies to the other 12 nuclear reactors of Soviet design in  Central and Eastern Europe, which are still unsafe and continue  to produce electricity. He said it is now of prime importance  in the case of Chernobyl to renew the protective concrete cover  -- the so-called sarcophagus of the exploded reactor block,  across which cracks are meanwhile running -- in order to keep  the still highly active radiation contained within. According  to Toepfer, a relevant competition of ideas for its renewal has  been concluded. A French and a German proposal had been rated  best. The participating enterprises had formed a consortium.    He said that the presumable costs will amount to billions  [currency not specified]. According to him, it is still open  how they are to be raised. Therefore, "the international  banking system headed by the World Bank will have to be  approached once again," Toepfer stressed. The approximately 1.2  billion German marks [DM], which have been designated so far by  24 industrial and threshold countries, including the European  Union and the FRG, are largely destined for other securing  measures and the qualification of the operating staff in the  eastern reactors. Bonn alone will provide more than DM250  million by 1995.</p>

The Proposed Decision and Order sets forth the procedures that the DOE has tentatively formulated to distribute to eligible claimants $870,000, plus accrued interest, obtained by the DOE under the terms of a Consent Order entered into with Dane Energy Company on December 16, 1993. The funds were paid towards the settlement of alleged violations of the DOE price and allocation regulations involving the sale of crude oil during the period December 1978 through December 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OHA has proposed to distribute the Consent Order funds in accordance with the DOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (the MSRP). Under the MSRP, crude oil overcharge monies are divided between the federal government, the states, and injured purchasers of refined petroleum products. Refunds to the states would be distributed in proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products during the price control period. Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any member of the public may submit written comments regarding the proposed refund procedures.

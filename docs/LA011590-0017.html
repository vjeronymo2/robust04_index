			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMMIGRANT KIDS  </P> <P> I was pleasantly surprised to note The Times had recognized the efforts of the  Alhambra School District in its editorial "Bridges for Immigrant Children"  (Dec. 27). Overcrowding is but one part of the problem.  </P> <P> Meeting the needs of a multicultural enrollment and making public education  work for immigrant children is a constant challenge. Children, as well as  parents, need support in order to make a successful transition into American  society.  </P> <P> I consider the Alhambra School District fortunate for having had the vision to  prepare for our immigrant newcomers. Much of our success comes from our  dedicated bilingual teachers and English-as-a-second language specialists who  use their knowledge and talent toward turning their students into productive,  English-proficient participants while nurturing a respect and appreciation for  the many different cultures present in our schools. It is never easy, but  nobody ever said it would be. In Alhambra, we see the positive results from  meeting the challenge head-on.  </P> <P> DORA S.

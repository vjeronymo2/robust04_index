			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: KNICKS HIRE MACLEOD AFTER FIRING JACKSON  </P> <P> The New York Knicks fired Coach Stu Jackson Monday and hired John MacLeod, who  vowed to take a "realistic approach" toward the struggling team.  </P> <P> The Knicks, whose record is 7-8 overall, 3-5 at home, have been criticized for  lack of discipline and spark.  </P> <P> MacLeod, who coached the Phoenix Suns for 14 seasons and the Dallas Mavericks  for three, ranks fifth among active NBA coaches with 675 victories. He was  fired early last season by Dallas.  </P> <P> "I will emphasize the positive and stay away from the negative," MacLeod said.  "But I will not say things are hunky-dory when they are not."  </P> <P> Things were not going well for the Knicks this year under Jackson, who had no  previous head coaching experience. Their struggles at home only magnified the  overall problems.  </P> <P> "It just didn't work out as well as we thought," General Manager Al Bianchi  said. "I'm not going to go into the specifics or step on anybody."  </P> <P> Jackson was not available for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): A triple-B portfolio reshuffle - . . . in which Mr Ledger and Mr Stagge help John and Alison beat an attack of mid-life ennui, and the birthday season looks brighter / The Plowshares JOHN PLOWSHARE is facing his 50th birthday. A sobering thought for anyone, but particularly sobering when you haven't been keeping up the payments into your personal pensions because of the effect of the recession on your firm. The thought of getting older - can it really be half a century? - and of getting older on less cash than he had planned, has kept John distracted and miserable for several days. It has finally got on Alison's nerves, particularly as she, too, has been distracted and miserable and nobody has noticed. Her misery stems from a feeling of guilt, that nobody has made sufficient fuss of Lucy and Toby, who have achieved 21 and 18 respectively in the past year. These were birthdays which, in pre-recession days, would have been marked by the Plowshares with a fairly substantial party at the very least. John and Alison finally meet, both distracted and miserable, wandering around the conservatory late one evening. 'What is the matter with you?' each asks the other. And sad stories are exchanged. 'I feel so old,' howls John, collapsing on to an ancient and uncomfortable Rattan chair. 'I've got friends retiring at 50, but there's no way I can even think of retiring for at least another 20 years on my current pension provision.' And I feel such a killjoy,' moans Alison. 'We could have done a little more for the children with their coming-of-age birthdays, let alone for your 50th birthday. I'm so bored with being careful with cash on a day-to-day basis.' The only obvious source of cash is the Plowshares' savings and portfolio of unit trusts, which they put together 18 months ago under the sensible advice of Mr Stagge, of stockbrokers Stagge &amp; Hoppitt, and Mr Ledger, their accountant. Since then, they have received endless bits of paper and statements and the odd thing to sign, but they have no clear idea of what their holdings are actually worth. John and Alison make an appointment, and later in the week go off to visit Mr Stagge. At the time of sorting out their portfolios, he had recommended that they move the bulk of their money out of the building society, where interest rates on deposit accounts were dropping, and invest it in unit trusts. This appears to have been rather a good idea. To the Plowshares' surprise and joy, their portfolios are looking extremely healthy. increased by 29.6 per cent on an offer-to-offer basis over the 18 months. The Plowshares' original Pounds 50,000 is now worth Pounds 64,817, and, much to Alison's pleasure in particular, the best performing part of the portfolio has turned out to be the Pacific Basin funds that she was particularly keen on. The Peps have managed a respectable performance, too. The Plowshares put a further Pounds 6,000 each in from the building society in this tax year and now have Pounds 24,000 invested in Peps - now worth Pounds 28,000. Beyond that, they have Pounds 26,000 rainy-day money in the building society, which is kept in Alison's name for tax purposes. However, it is not all good news. Flushed with the thrill of having increased their capital fairly easily, the Plowshares move on to visit Mr Ledger, the accountant. 'You're not nearly up to scratch on your pensions, Mr Plowshare,' says Mr Ledger, sternly. 'I would recommend that, as your portfolio has done so well under Mr Stagge's care, you take your Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax allowance out of your unit trust portfolio, before indexation, and catch up on your premium holiday. Say, Pounds 2,000 for the last two years plus an additional Pounds 1,800 into your pensions.' It turns out that, at age 50, John is entitled to put 25 per cent of his net relevant earnings from his partnership into a pension and gain 40 per cent tax relief; so he is well within his allowances. In fact, if he had sufficient cash, he could apply a back-tracking technique over the last six tax years to take advantage of unused tax relief. However, his cash-flow clearly won't allow this at the moment. Meanwhile, Alison could also take up to Pounds 5,800 tax-free out of her portfolio if she wished, and Mr Ledger recommends that she also put Pounds 750 into a new personal pension plan, which she can pay net of basic-rate tax relief. Alison decides that she would like to gift Pounds 1,000 to her daughter Lucy and Pounds 500 to Toby from her capital gain. This, it turns out, is well within the annual Pounds 3,000 exemption for gifts, and so will not incur any tax. A further recommendation is not so popular with Alison. 'You could always transfer some of your portfolio gain, or some of the building society money over to your husband, so that he could make a further contribution into his pension,' says Mr Ledger. After some noisy debate, over which we will draw a veil, Alison agrees to transfer Pounds 3,000 of the capital gain on her portfolio to John, with which he can top up his pension - a transfer which attracts no taxation. On their way home, Alison reflects, rather mournfully: 'I suppose I feel like a generous sort of person now - which is some comfort. I mean, I've given away Pounds 4,500 to my immediate family. . . But I still feel like a killjoy.' 'And I still feel old,' adds John. But the Plowshares are sensible people; and it doesn't take them long to work out that the solution to this one is a party to mark all three birthdays - and to help Alison continue to feel generous. Help in compiling this feature was provided by SM Searle, from Gerrard Vivian Gray, who put together the portfolio, and David Oldridge, of Hill Oldridge, who supplied financial advice. Who's who The Plowshares, a couple in their late forties, live in one of the smarter bits of North London. John is a partner in an architectural practice and earned Pounds 60,000 last year, though this year times have proved harder and his earnings are down to Pounds 50,000. . . Alison has a part-time job as a receptionist for the local GP. The Plowshares have two children: Lucy, who is 21, at university in the Midlands, and Toby, 18, about to leave school. . . Following the deaths of John's parents and his subsequent inheritance, the Plowshares have a portfolio of unit trusts, a Pep each and some rainy-day money in the building society.</p>

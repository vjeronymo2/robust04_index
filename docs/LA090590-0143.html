			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BODY FOUND IN BACK SEAT OF CAR  </P> <P> The body of a woman that was found this morning in the back seat of a car  alongside a busy Van Nuys street went unreported for three or four days, Los  Angeles police said.  </P> <P> The 51-year-old woman who lived in a home nearby is believed to have died of  natural causes, Detective James Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> Her name was not released pending notification of her family. She was found by  a passerby about 1 a.m. in the back seat of her car parked in the 6600 block of  Hazeltine Avenue, Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> The passerby called the Fire Department and paramedics, who initially examined  the body and notified the Police Department that the woman could have been shot  in the head. But detectives determined that decomposition of the body led to  the erroneous conclusion.  </P> <P> Police estimated that the woman died sometime over the weekend. An autopsy will  determine the cause of death.  </P></p>

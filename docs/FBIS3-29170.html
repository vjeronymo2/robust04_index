The Food Agency is selling an initial 14,000 tons of U.S.  rice, 16,000 tons of Chinese rice and 20,000 tons of Thai rice  for a trial period in February.    U.S. rice from California has already reached retail  outlets.  The government sold the Californian rice to wholesalers from  February 8 at prices some 16 percent lower than the price of  domestic rice.    The Thai and Chinese rice is likely to hit the supermarket  shelves at different times around the country because of delays  caused by inspections and snowfalls. In Tokyo it is likely to  reach consumers by Friday.    The Chinese rice is similar to the medium short-grain  Japanese staple, while the Thai rice is the long-grain type.    Wholesalers and retailers alike are striving to fit the rice  into categories which might appeal to customers. Many rice  outlets have indicated they will not blend the different types  of rice and will market the imported rice separately in small  bags.    Blended rice is likely to become more commonly available on  the market after March when larger volumes of foreign rice are  released for sale, according to Food Agency sources.    Japan began to import rice as an emergency measure after a  poor harvest last year left the nation with a major shortfall of  its main staple.    In December, Japan agreed at global trade talks to partially  open its rice market, breaking a long-standing policy of barring  most imports of rice.    Japan is expected to import as much as two million tons of  rice to make up for the shortage resulting from last year's  worst postwar harvest.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster shareholders' Viacom move rejected A Delaware court yesterday rejected a move to block a Dollars 1.25bn investment by Blockbuster Entertainment, the US home video company, in cable television group Viacom. The application had been brought by some shareholders in Blockbuster, which had agreed to pay Dollars 55 a share for a stake in Viacom to provide cash for the cable TV company's winning bid for Paramount Communications. Viacom's non-voting 'B' shares were trading yesterday at Dollars 29. The Delaware chancery court said blocking the investment would case 'enormous uncertainty with widespread repercussions, causing Paramount Communications stockholders to reconsider their decision to tender their shares under Viacom's tender offer'. Blockbuster shareholders have yet to vote on whether to accept an all-share offer for the company from Viacom. Although it has already received the backing of Blockbuster's board, the deal has come under fire from some shareholders given the sharp fall in Viacom's share price.</p>

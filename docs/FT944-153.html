			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Kenyans go on equity buying spree: Leslie Crawford on the build-up to the Nairobi bourse opening to foreigners The decision to open Nairobi's Stock Exchange to foreign investors from January was enough to send prices and trading volumes soaring in the last two weeks of 1994. The NSE's cramped trading floor saw business jump by 35 per cent as local investors bought all the blue-chip shares they could muster. The NSE index rose from 3,556 points in mid-December to 4,559.40 in the final trading session of the year. But the speculative buying spree, ahead of an anticipated avalanche of foreign orders for Kenyan equity, may yet leave speculators high and dry. Most analysts believe foreign investors are unlikely to make an early move into Kenyan shares. Although Nairobi's 13 licensed stock brokers have been bombarded with faxes from abroad, inquiries are still at an early stage. Factors which make Nairobi less attractive than other emerging markets include the strength of the Kenya shilling (which makes Kenyan securities expensive in dollar terms); the expensive 2.5 per cent brokerage commission fixed by NSE members; a lack of liquidity in the market - only 2.73 per cent of the total listed number of shares are traded in a year; and relatively high price-earnings ratios, ranging from 11 to 28 for the most actively traded stocks. In addition, the NSE has comparatively little to offer compared to its larger sister in South Africa. The NSE's 52 listed companies have a total market capitalisation of only Dollars 2.35bn (Pounds 1.5bn), compared with Johannesburg's market capitalisation of Dollars 250bn. It is true that there are many well run and highly profitable listed companies in Kenya, particularly in the financial sector and among the tea and coffee estates. But most of these tend to be subsidiaries of big multinationals - Brooke Bond, Barclays, Standard Chartered, BAT - and analysts believe it may be wiser for foreign investors to buy shares in the parent companies and avoid the country and foreign exchange risks of Kenya. 'This is a very small and a highly speculative market,' says one of Nairobi's top stockbrokers. 'What worries me is that it might become a casino with the entry of foreign capital. You only need Dollars 20m to manipulate Kenyan shares any way you want.' The average daily trading volume rarely exceeds Dollars 150,000. New investment regulations aim to limit the impact of foreign capital on the small bourse by restricting foreign investors to a maximum 20 per cent shareholding in publicly quoted companies. But it is hard to foresee even that amount of shares becoming available in such an illiquid market. Many brokers believe the NSE should concentrate on attracting more local companies and investors, before wooing foreign investment funds whose individual portfolios dwarf the size of the entire Nairobi bourse. 'We have held a number of seminars on how companies can benefit by going public,' says Mr Jimnah Mbaru, NSE chairman and chief executive of Dyer and Blair stockbrokers. Since the liberalisation of interest rates last year, Mr Mbaru believes it makes more sense for Kenyan companies to finance new investments by issuing equity rather than borrowing from banks. He expects a minimum of eight new companies to seek a listing on the NSE in 1995. With much of East Africa adopting increasingly convergent economic policies  -exchange rates are being freed, trade barriers are coming down, foreign investment is being encouraged - Mr Mbaru also believes Kenyan manufacturing companies will need fresh capital in the coming year to take advantage of an expanding regional market. Finance houses may also be tempted to go public, as the Central Bank is raising their minimum operating capital requirements. Such changes are expected to increase the relevance of the NSE as a source of domestic capital for the Kenyan economy. But it may be wishful thinking to believe that Nairobi's still-infant stock market will attract anything more than a marginal interest from overseas.</p>

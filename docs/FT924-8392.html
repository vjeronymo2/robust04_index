			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Credit Lyonnais to take controlling stake in BfG CREDIT Lyonnais, the aggressive French state-owned bank, yesterday won agreement to take 50.1 per cent control of BfG Bank, Germany's sixth largest private commercial bank, for DM1.42bn (Pounds 570m). This is the climax of a five-year campaign by Credit Lyonnais to boost its presence in Germany, the biggest gap in its international branch network. BfG has 170 branches in western Germany against which Credit Lyonnais has 23. The French bank will pump an initial DM740m of equity into undercapitalised BfG. DM540m will be in cash and the remainder as shares in its German subsidiary, Credit Lyonnais Deutschland. This will give Credit Lyonnais an initial 26 per cent stake. It will buy the 24.1 per cent balance to obtain a majority in equal parts from BfG's existing owners, Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), the insurance group, and BGAG, the German trades union holding company. Credit Lyonnais, the latest in a long line of big French investors in Germany, hoped to improve access to the German market through a partnership with Commerzbank, Germany's third largest bank, but four years of talks broke down last autumn. AGF, the French state-owned insurer, asked Credit Lyonnais to consider buying BfG early this year to help the insurance group consummate a separate alliance with AMB. The German insurer, looking for an exit from what had proved a costly diversification into banking with formerly loss-making BfG, agreed terms with AGF. Yesterday's deal completes a rare example of two French state-owned groups helping each other in the German market. BfG, which yesterday welcomed the deal, is restructuring. Its staff has been cut from 7,000 to 5,200, allowing it to make a DM120m operating profit last year, against a DM390m loss a year earlier. Mr Alexis Wolkenstein, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Europe, said BfG should be profitable this year, but this depended on provisions on BfG's DM3.5bn of sovereign loans. It set aside 50 per cent provisions for bad sovereign debt at the end of last year, and this would rise to more than 70 per cent in the current year, said Mr Wolkenstein.</p>

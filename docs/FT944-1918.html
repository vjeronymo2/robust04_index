			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / International Company News: German bank in deal for Polish licence Westdeutsche Landesbank is to take a 24.9 per cent share in a capital issue by the ailing Bank Morski in Szczecin and become the second German bank to obtain an operating licence in Poland. The German bank, which applied to open a wholly-owned subsidiary in Poland 12 months ago, made the move after the National Bank of Poland (NBP), the central bank, said it would only issue licences to foreign banks if they were willing to help shore up the private sector by buying into troubled banks. Westdeutsche's partner in the venture is the state-owned Polish Development Bank which is to take 75.1 per cent of the new issue. Bank Morski has been managed by receivers for a year and NBP has promised to help finance its recovery.</p>

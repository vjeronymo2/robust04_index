			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> CHICAGO BEARS PICK WAUKEGAN PARK FOR WINTER TRAINING SITE  </P> <P> The Chicago Bears have picked a Waukegan office and business park as the site  of their cold-weather training facility.  </P> <P> The Bears plan to lease the land at $1 a year and erect an inflatable temporary  facility, said Patrick Fox, vice president and project manager of Amli  Development, which owns the site.  </P> <P> It will be 80 yards long, 60 yards wide and about 65 feet high, he said, with  artificial turf and a constant temperature about 60 degrees. It should be  available for use by Nov. 1.  </P> <P> The deal is for two years, Fox said, with an option for a third. His long-term  goal is to have the Bears build a permanent practice facility and headquarters  at the site.  </P> <P> The Bears accelerated their search for a cold-weather facility in August when  players staged a protest during a rainy pre-season practice at Bear  headquarters at Lake Forest. In the past, the team has suffered at Lake Forest  with poor weather and frozen turf as the season wore on.  </P></p>

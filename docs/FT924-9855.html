			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Electrical retailing Midlands Electricity may be throwing in its lot with Eastern's and Southern's electricity shops consortium, but the combined group lacks the potential to shine. The venture intends to keep most of its high street shops while electrical retailing's centre of gravity moves relentlessly out of town. Three separate corporate images will also be maintained, making it difficult to establish a national brand. Nor is there yet an attractive format to replace the dreary look of the traditional electricity showroom. The approach can in part be explained by the desire of the regional electricity companies (RECs) to maintain a high profile with consumers. There are also customer service requirements which pin the companies to town centres. But given the very tough market for electrical goods, the electricity shops look increasingly like spoilers which can afford to stay in the game only because they have rich parents. Under the circumstances the complaints from Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of Dixons, are hardly surprising. Whatever the truth about suggestions of cross-subsidy, the losses incurred by the retailing operations of the RECs are a gnat-bite compared with their electricity transmission profits. The financial strength of the RECs also allows them to bid up the price of potential sites. Then again, Dixons' view of competition in electrical retailing is in contrast to its fears about monopoly when it was defending itself from Kingfisher.</p>

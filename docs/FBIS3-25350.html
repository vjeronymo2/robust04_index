However the government newspaper, JORNAL DE ANGOLA, says  government troops are under heavy guerrilla pressure in Caxito,  some 50 km from the capital, Luanda. The paper said today that  the northerly towns of Nnambuangongo, Ucua, and Ambriz fell to  the army after fierce battles with UNITA [National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola] rebels which began in mid-January,  but it gave no casualty figures.    Independent sources in Luanda said there was still heavy  fighting in the border regions between Bengo, more than half of  which is in government hands, and Uige Province, wholly held by  UNITA.    In the southernmost province of Huila, where army-rebel  clashes have broken out, a military spokesman in the chief town,  Lubango, said troops had recaptured the iron mining town of  Jamba, after a five-day fight to dislodge UNITA units, which  overran Jamba on 3 February.</p>

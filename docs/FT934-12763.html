			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Viacom raises bid to step up battle for Paramount THE TAKEOVER battle for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, intensified last night when Viacom, the cable television company, raised the value of its friendly bid to match a Dollars 4.8bn cash tender offer for 51 per cent of Paramount announced on Thursday by hostile bidder QVC Network. Viacom, acting with the agreement of the Paramount board, said it too would begin a cash tender offer for 51 per cent of the company's shares, starting today, at a price of Dollars 80 a share. The remainder of Paramount's shares would be acquired later in a stock swap, also worth around Dollars 80 a share on the basis of Viacom's shares at Friday's stock market close. The new bid appeared to value Paramount at around Dollars 9.5bn, roughly the same as QVC's offer, though last night Viacom claimed its bid to be worth about Dollars 10bn. Viacom's initial bid was worth around Dollars 7.5bn. The increased bid had been widely expected on Wall Street since QVC forced the pace of the battle last Thursday with the announcement of its cash tender for Paramount's shares, due to start by this Wednesday. Viacom, by offering the same terms as QVC in its tender, will be hoping that shareholders will be won over by the fact that its bid has the agreement of the Paramount board, and by the claims of synergy made by the two companies. However, many shareholders seem likely to hold back, in the expectation that the bidding still has some way to escalate. Viacom's new offer sharply increases the amount of cash in its bid, from around Dollars 1.1bn to Dollars 4.8bn. The stock-swap element of the deal would involve 0.2048 of a share of Viacom class A voting stock, 1.08317 of Viacom Class B non-voting stock, and 0.20408 of a share of new convertible exchangeable preferred stock, for each share in Paramount. The boards of the two companies said their amended merger agreement also gave them the flexibility to go ahead with a single stage merger transaction, rather than the new two-stage deal, if they wanted to do so. Viacom said the new preferred stock would have the same yield, conversion price and call protection as the Dollars 600m of preferred shares it recently sold to Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain, and the Dollars 1.2bn sold to Nynex, the Baby Bell telephone company. The financial backing of these two companies boosted Viacom's war chest, helping it to launch yesterday's higher offer.</p>

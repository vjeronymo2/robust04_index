			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libreville, 9 Mar (AFP)--Gabon's main opposition  leader Father Paul Mba Abessole, who is accused by the  government of fomenting the violent clashes in Libreville from  21 to 24 February that left nine dead, left the Gabonese capital  yesterday evening for Paris, an opposition spokesman disclosed.  Father Mba Abessole is going to France "to take some rest, and  he will maintain contacts with his friends," the same source  said without stating the duration of his trip. The National  Lumberjacks Rally leader, who was accompanied by an opposition  delegation and seen off by several dozen supporters at  Libreville Airport, was able to "board the aircraft without any  difficulty," the spokesman added.    Since security forces besieged his residence on 23 February,  Father Abessole has not made any public appearance. The  government has specifically accused him of provoking the  four-day disturbances which rocked several areas in Libreville  at the beginning of the general strike called by a  pro-opposition trade union to demand postdevaluation salary  increases. Several opposition leaders belonging to the High  Resistance Council chaired by Father Mba Abessole are currently  in Paris.</p>

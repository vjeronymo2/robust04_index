			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (12): Foreigners move in - The Food Industry It was 40 years ago that the first locally manufactured food products of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate, were offered to the Turkish housewife. Today the foods sector is again attracting foreign attention as incomes rise, urbanisation gains pace and consumers become more brand conscious. The interest is focused on the whole range of activities from food processing to distribution and retailing. According to Treasury figures, foreign investment in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors outpaced any other area in 1992 with permits for Dollars 283m approved, compared with total investment in manufacturing of Dollars 1.2bn. The amount in 1991 was even higher at Dollars 364m. Much of the capital is still targeted at the domestic market, particularly in tobacco where both Philip Morris and Reynolds have made sizeable commitments in the past year. But there is also a significant trend in export-oriented food manufacturing, with tomato paste and fruit concentrates being the favoured products. In addition, the retail industry is starting to attract big foreign names, with Carrefour, the French stores group, due to open its first hypermarket in the Asian part of Istanbul before the end of the year. Promodes, also of France, is looking at a possible venture with the local Dogus Holding. Prisunic of France is seeking a local partner. And Migros, originally a joint venture between the Swiss and the local Koc group but now controlled by the local partner, is rationalising its smaller stores, while increasing the product range of its larger outlets. Begindik, a meat processing group from Kayseri, has opened a series of hypermarkets, including one housed under the vast Kocatepe mosque in Ankara. Several manufacturing joint ventures have been set up. Jacobs Suchard, the Philip Morris affiliate, earlier this year agreed with the local Sabanci's Marsa company to market and eventually manufacture a range of confectionery products. There remain some big players. For example, Ulker, a chocolate manufacturer, is larger in Turkey than Nestle. But as competition intensifies, bankers expect more mergers as foreign names, in the wake of Turkey's move to achieve a customs union with the European Union in 1995, buy up market share. In 1992 Unilever took over Komili liquid oils company, in an agreed merger in what one western banker has described as the first example of a foreign multinational putting a value on a Turkish brand name. Corn Products of the US, owner of the Knorr soup brand name, has bought out its local partner, in this case another Koc company. Coca-Cola is seeking to acquire its local bottling operations. Cargill of the US has acquired the Vanikoy glucose operation. 'If you want to move ahead aggressively, then the only way is to acquire the competition,' says a leading foreign food concern. In the early days food processors were vertical operations where the manufacturer was often involved in everything from seed production, through cultivation to packaging and marketing. The export sector was and still is largely in intermediate goods, many of which end up back on Turkish shop shelves as finished products. In the dry goods sector, Unilever was very much the pioneer. From just two products in 1950, today the range covers some 100 brands. Unilever enjoys a unique position in the market with a sales team of more than 400, supplying some 2,600 wholesalers and almost a third of Turkey's 180,000 small retail outlets or bakkals. In 1990, Sana, Unilever's sunflower oil and one of its original brands, was the company's largest single product worldwide. Such was its initial success that sana is now the Turkish word for margarine. 'Ten years ago when a housewife went to her local shop, she would ask for Sana not as a brand but as a product name,' says Mr Taksin Tuglular, technical director of Unilever Foods Turkey. Today, Unilever makes sales of Dollars 800m and is the largest food company in Turkey, with a dominant position in margarines and liquid oils. It has recently launched its Algida ice cream range. It remains a tough market. Total demand for margarine is decreasing, as consumers switch to liquid oils. New entrants are also sharpening the competition. The Turkish consumer is becoming more choosy and as a result more importance is being placed on packaging and marketing. Unilever's production is still targeted at the domestic market. However, around 10 per cent of output goes to exports. Its principal markets are in the Middle East, particularly Iraq, where Unilever is selling Vita. In the Black Sea countries, it sells its Aymar products; but the company stresses this is relatively new territory. Turkey has long been an exporter of hazelnuts and other agricultural products but the export of processed foods got under way only in the 1970s, when the Ecevit government gave incentives to farm co-operatives. This gave a spur to the frozen fruit and vegetable producers although a number of operations subsequently failed through lack of capital. A good example is tomato paste where Heinz of the US, offering technical assistance in exchange, sourced some of its material locally. Turkey is now the world's third largest producer, after the US and Italy. It is also the largest supplier to the Japanese market. Indeed Japan's Kagome and Sumitomo now have equity stakes in the Koc group's Tat Konserve, the largest local producer. But if the sector is really to take off, there will also have to be significant new investment in frozen distribution infrastructure. This is a vital constraint on the fresh product business. It is also a factor to a producer like Unilever, particularly when launching a new product nationally, currently the best way to expand sales in the local market.</p>

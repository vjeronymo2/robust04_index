			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A spartan approach that beats the recession  -The challenge facing Kwik Save to consolidate its recent rapid sales growth FOR MOST British companies and their shareholders, hopes of any improvement in profits depend heavily on when the recession ends. But the challenge facing Kwik Save is to continue to prosper once better economic times return. During the past decade, the company has increased annual sales and pre-tax profits four-fold by doggedly pursuing a 'no frills' formula of selling branded grocery products at prices 5 to 10 per cent below those charged by the bigger supermarket chains. Central to its strategy have been tighter cost controls and modest capital investments. While J Sainsbury and Tesco have been building out-of-town superstores at about Pounds 25m each, Kwik Save has stuck mainly to smaller, more spartan, high street sites costing no more than Pounds 1m a time. Though the formula has given Kwik Save the highest return on capital in the industry, its margins are barely half those of its larger rivals. However, Mr Graeme Seabrook, Kwik Save's chief executive, has always insisted that the key to rising profits lay not in bigger margins but in rapid sales growth. The economic downturn and the changing structure of the food retailing industry have played into his hands. The company claims that its customers are no longer confined to poorer shoppers but include a growing number of more affluent households attracted by Kwik Save's emphasis on the value of its products as much as their absolute price. Mr Seabrook says Kwik Save has also benefited from the growing polarisation of the retailing industry, which has increased the pressure on weaker middle-market chains such as Asda, Gateway and the Co-op. During the past two years, Kwik Save's market share has risen from 6.5 per cent to 8.9 per cent, largely at their expense. The question is how successfully Kwik Save will be able to maintain the rapid volume growth essential to its long-term development. Mr Seabrook insists there is unexploited potential, pointing out that Kwik Save's sales per square foot were still only half those of Sainsbury's. However, the strategy faces challenges from two directions. First, the growth of competing discounters, including Aldi of Germany and Netto of Denmark, which have opened about 100 stores in Britain. Kwik Save says its newer rivals have made little impact. However, it admits that it has held them at bay by offering extra deep discounts and introducing cheaper 'secondary' brands in stores which faced direct competition. The second challenge is to retain the customers it has picked up in the last few years. It is still unclear how far these gains are permanent and stem, as Kwik Save claims, from a lasting consumer attachment to value, or whether they are due to temporary bargain-hunting induced by the recession. The company's response has been to try to define a distinctive image, which differentiates it clearly from both the discounters and from the bigger supermarket chains. To counter the threat of discounters such as Aldi, which sell a limited number of items in warehouse surroundings, Kwik Save has cautiously expanded its product range and is investing in improved displays and computerised check-outs. It is also building larger edge-of-town stores, though some of the floor space is let out to other retailers. To differentiate itself from Sainsbury and Tesco, it has stepped up advertising - particularly posters and illuminated displays - which stress its price advantage and 'no frills' approach. It is a marketing strategy which requires a careful balance. How well it succeeds is unlikely to become clear until well after the recession.</p>

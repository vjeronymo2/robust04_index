			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Monday Interview: Second fiddle's new tune - Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, talks to Hugh Carnegy Shimon Peres, once an ebullient prime minister but now forced to play second fiddle to his old rival, Yitzhak Rabin, wears a rather stern face in public these days. But as he talks in his office in the barrack-like foreign ministry in Jerusalem, the subdued tone suddenly gives way to a smile, as he hits on a metaphor to explain his objection to Palestinian demands at the Middle East peace talks in Washington. The Palestinian delegation is demanding that self-government arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza currently under discussion amount as nearly as possible to full independence. 'They want a child without a pregnancy,' he declares. 'That's a little hard to achieve.' The smile evaporates at the suggestion that, as far as the Palestinians are concerned Israel seems intent on ensuring they do not even manage to conceive. 'Look, we are doing things which are tangible and real. They can see by the criticism and opposition that exists in Israel that we are serious.' If the foreign minister is irritated, it is probably because the Labour-led coalition has been somewhat disappointed by the Palestinians at the Washington talks. Just as the Palestinians had hoped for greater concessions from Mr Rabin's government, which ousted the unyielding Likud administration of Yitzhak Shamir in June's Israeli elections, so the new coalition had thought the Palestinians would be rather more co-operative than they have proved. Still, Mr Peres himself expressed some satisfaction with the way the peace talks were progressing when they broke up last week for a 10-day recess. A breakthrough, both with the Palestinians and with Israel's other great foe, Syria, may yet materialise over the coming months. The real reason Shimon Peres appears a little morose, his friends say, is that he has not fully come to terms with being number two in the government. For Mr Peres, Labour's general election victory - which banished the Likud into opposition for the first time in 15 years - had a bitter taste. A few months before, Mr Rabin had been elected party leader, ousting Mr Peres from the position he had held since 1977. The man who for so long led the fight against the Likud found himself out of the spotlight when victory finally came. But Mr Peres is a resilient politician. Close associates say he has not given up hope of recapturing the party leadership. So he campaigned energetically for Rabin during the election. He also swallowed his pride when taking the foreign minister's post, accepting that Mr Rabin would run the core of the peace talks - the bilateral negotiations with the Palestinians, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Mr Peres is in charge of the multilateral talks between the various parties covering arms control, economic co-operation, water, the environment and refugees. Nevertheless, Mr Peres has backed the prime minister fully over the proposals made to the Palestinians in Washington for the self-government arrangements. These arrangements would have effect for five years while negotiations are held on a final agreement on the West Bank and Gaza. Israel cannot at this stage agree to the legislative powers sought by the Palestinians because, Mr Peres says, this would pre-empt the negotiations for a final settlement which are not due to start until three years after the 'interim' stage takes effect. Neither he nor Mr Rabin has ever conceded the idea of a fully independent Palestinian state in the occupied territories. They talk in terms of some sort of federation with Jordan. But from Mr Peres's viewpoint, Labour's commitment to a permanent settlement based on ceding territory - the 'land for peace' formula enshrined in UN resolutions 242 and 338 which underpin the peace talks - means that Palestinian suspicions of a hidden Israeli agenda are unfounded. A longstanding Palestinian fear is that the Israelis intend to make the interim agreement the basis of a final settlement. This Mr Peres denies. 'It doesn't have a permanent nature. This should be a sort of trial period which will give all of us time to reach a permanent solution.' No doubt Mr Peres will be pressed on these issues when he meets British and French leaders this week. He will in turn urge them to press the Arab side to be more flexible in Washington. But Mr Peres says European countries - both individually and collectively through the EC - can play their most active role in the multilateral rather than the bilateral negotiations. Mr Peres acknowledges that progress in the five strands of multilateral talks - due to resume this month - will depend largely on progress in the bilateral talks. But he believes it is in the multilateral sphere that 'a different Middle East' can really be shaped. It is appropriate that Shimon Peres should head Israel's effort in the multilateral negotiations. He has long had a vision of how, given a measure of peace, the Middle East as a whole might prosper through building regional co-operation in vital areas such as arms control, water and trade. He looks to Europe, with its experience of building the Common Market, for help by giving advice on the development and financing of the necessary institutions. In return, he is prepared to let the EC play an enhanced role in the various multilateral forums - for example on arms control. Mr Shamir rejected a greater European role on the grounds that the community was biased towards the Arabs. Arms control is very difficult and Mr Peres has no illusions. It will have to be done 'gradually, in small steps', he says. But he has an altogether more expansive vision when it comes to regional economic co-operation and sharing resources such as water. 'We are united by the lack of water. We have to organise the assembly, the distribution and the production of water because, as you know, the rains do not pass through customs and the rivers do not follow frontiers.' Peres advocates a Benelux-like economic union between Israel, Jordan and the Palestinians and, beyond that, regional arrangements for open trade. The benefits to Israel, with its strength in technology, of being able to trade with its hitherto inaccessible Arab neighbours would be great. But Mr Peres says there would be advantages for all sides. 'The whole region of the Middle East is not such a big market, not for the Arabs, not for us. We think by organising a real market with open borders and free commerce the Arabs stand a chance to raise their standard of living.' For Mr Peres, this is in Israel's interests. 'I believe the economic standard of living decides the political standard of behaviour. When people are poor they are hostile and desperate. There is no answer to (Islamic) fundamentalism by writing a new Koran. You can do it by enabling people to read it differently.' This kind of vision of a Middle East transformed is alluring, but it seems a distant dream. 'We can go very far, because we start from a very low point,' responds Mr Peres. He acknowledges that his government's motive for peace is also driven by a more chilling vision in a region which spends Dollars 50bn a year on arms. Since coming to power, Mr Rabin has frequently stated that the disappearance of Soviet backing for Israel's Arab enemies and Iraq's defeat in the Gulf war have opened a 'window of opportunity' for peace in the region. But he also says that within a few years circumstances could easily change as countries such as Iran and Syria - and perhaps once more Iraq - acquire big arsenals of advanced non-conventional weaponry. Israel, which already possesses nuclear arms, is itself honing its weapons capability. But it fears it will find it difficult to maintain its technological lead. It is this which is seen by Mr Rabin and Mr Peres as the long-term threat to Israel's existence, not the dispute with the Palestinians. They do not share the Likud's ideological commitment to keeping the West Bank and Gaza. And so to them, the Palestinian issue, so often regarded as the core of the conflict in the Middle East, has come to be seen as an awkward obstacle which must be resolved in order to help defuse a much greater threat. 'Today the heart of the conflict is the attempt to nuclearise the Middle East,' says Mr Peres. 'How to save the Middle East from that conflict is the major issue. We have to have peace before the skies are filled with non-conventional missiles which threaten us all.'

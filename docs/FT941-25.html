			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Technical selling wave batters copper market Copper prices tumbled yesterday under the weight of computer-driven technical selling in New York and operators taking profits before Easter in London. Having started the day at Dollars 1,940 a tonne, the three-month price crashed through two technical support levels - at Dollars 1,920 and Dollars 1,900 - to close in London at Dollars 1,890.25, down Dollars 46.25 and its lowest for four weeks. Nearly all big copper consumers and merchants were waiting for this correction, suggested Mr Ted Arnold, metals specialist at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. 'They were hoping the market would cool down a bit during the summer and were anxiously waiting to buy any and all price dips down from 86 cent a pound (Dollars 1,895 a tonne) to 80 cents (Dollars 1,763).' He pointed out that demand for copper in the US was so strong that the States had to import more than 30,000 tonnes in March, while in Europe, not only was demand picking up, but supply was becoming 'something of a problem'. He thought copper would not go much below 80 cents a pound in 1994 and should be back at 95 cents by the year-end. Mr Wiktor Bielski at Bain &amp; Company, part of the Deutsche Bank group, was even more bullish. He suggested that copper supplies were tight, as a 120,000-tonne fall in global stocks in the past three months indicated, while demand in the US was roaring ahead. He forecast copper would be back at Dollars 1 a pound (Dollars 2,204 a tonne) by the end of 1993. He said yesterday's fall in London had been triggered because speculators were not able to force the price upwards through technical resistance at Dollars 1,950 a tonne and decided to take some profit instead.</p>

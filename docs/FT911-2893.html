			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Leading Article: Just say no to Mr Bush IS SLOW GROWTH about to be replaced by no growth in the world economy? Yes, according to the US Treasury. No, according to most forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund. The US administration's lobbying for a concerted cut in world interest rates is, therefore, likely to fall on deaf ears at this weekend's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the group of seven industrial countries. At least the ears that matter will be deaf. The recession in the US is not as serious as the administration suggests - to judge by the financial markets, at least. The Dow Jones Industrial average has risen by 10.5 per cent in the past three months alone, while the US dollar has risen by 18 per cent against the D-Mark over the same period. Nor do US economic indicators paint an overwhelmingly gloomy picture. The US is now in its third quarter of an unexpectedly deep recession; but surveys of consumer confidence have maintained their immediate post-war strength and housing starts are beginning to increase. US monetary policy has been steadily easing over the past two years. But the Federal Reserve, worried by inflation and maybe scenting recovery, has appeared unwilling to cut interest rates further in recent weeks. Yet the US administration's call for concerted interest rate cuts is more than an attempt to put pressure on its chairman, Mr Alan Greenspan. With the US presidential campaign on the horizon, the administration is nervous that a home-grown recovery may be as slow and sluggish as was the onset of recession last year. Successive interest rate cuts have not stimulated spending by US consumers to any great extent. The added threat of a prolonged period of slow, or even no, growth in Europe and Japan sends shivers down the presidential spine. New variation No wonder Mr Bush is pursuing a new variation of a familiar theme: encourage the rest of the world to pull the US out of recession, by trying to convince it that this is in its own interest. Yet the divergent aims and economic performance of the Japanese and Germans do not bode well for Mr Bush's chances. The Japanese have kept a noticeably low profile in recent weeks as the duo of Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, and Mr David Mulford, Treasury under-secretary for international affairs, have hawked their wares. After over a year of tight monetary policy the Japanese economy is slowing. Economic growth may slip below 4 per cent this year compared to 5.6 per cent in 1990 - a slump by recent Japanese standards, but unsustainably high for any other G7 country. Policy co-ordination Japan may ease interest rates over the next few months. But even if a reduction in their interest rates were desirable, the Japanese would be reticent over agreeing to another bout of policy co-ordination. The Japanese authorities blame the expansionary monetary policy that followed the 1987 Louvre accord for the Japanese asset-market bubble and the subsequent need to restore sanity to the Tokyo stock market. In Germany, the next move may be up. The Bundesbank still fears that the west German economy is over-heating, never mind the economic collapse that is occurring east of the Elbe, which it blames on Mr Helmut Kohl. Yesterday's announcement that wholesale sales in the western Lander rose by 10 per cent in real terms in the first quarter will have stiffened the Bundesbank's resolve, particularly with wage negotiations in the crucial engineering industries threatening to deliver wage rises of 7 per cent or more. Nor has the weakness of the D-Mark over the past month eased its worries. It seems, then, that a concerted effort by the big three to stimulate the world economy by cutting interest rates is unlikely and undesirable. If the US economy does need a further monetary boost, what better time to provide it unilaterally than a week after the dollar reached its highest level for 16 months? It is the recession-bound European economies, rather than the US, which have most to gain from a concerted cut in interest rates. A rise in interest rates in Germany combined with a cut in the US might push the D-Mark back to the top of the exchange rate mechanism and so make cuts in French, Italian and UK rates more difficult. Why, then, has Mr Norman Lamont aligned himself so firmly with the Germans against the Brady proposal? Perhaps he is suffering from an excess of zeal. Perhaps he believes those Treasury forecasts of imminent recovery. If so he is among the few who do. But perhaps he realises that the UK government has almost no chance of engineering a strong recovery before the general election. If so, lower inflation is likely to be all the government can bring to the hustings.</p>

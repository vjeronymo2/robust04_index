			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 10 May (MENA) -- Lebanese Prime Minister  Rafiq al-Hariri has confirmed his insistence on staying at home,  not carrying out his duties, and clinging to his stance on  making major changes in his government.    In statements made today, he said that he is determined to  implement his changes and that he will not accept any mediation  that would keep the government situation unchanged no matter  what the consequences.    Al-Hariri explained that his proposal of a ministerial  reshuffle by increasing the cabinet members from 30 to 34 and  enlarging the Christian representation in his new government  aims to secure the government under unstable domestic and  regional circumstances and to enhance national unity.    The Lebanese prime minister said he seeks to liberate the  executive authority from interventions and pressure and that the  country's domestic situation can no longer tolerate the policy  of settlements and blackmail of the state's interests.    In his statements, he disclosed existing differences between  his ministers' stances, which have caused problems in the  government's solidarity. He openly charged that some of his  ministers have been unproductive and contentious and called for  ending the Christians' boycott of participation in the executive  authority.    Main Christian parties, such as the Phalangist Party, the  National Bloc Party, and the National Liberal Party, rejected  participating in any new government led by al-Hariri in the  presence of the current Chamber of Deputies, which they describe  as illegitimate after they boycotted the parliamentary elections  in August 1992.    Al-Hariri, who is staying home for the second day, asked  some  of his supporters who demonstrated yesterday asking him to  change his mind about staying home to stop these demonstrations,  warning of any incidents by some suspicious elements that might  harm the security situation in the country.    The Lebanese Interior Ministry today issued a statement  banning any demonstrations without prior license.    Informed Lebanese circles believe that the current  atmosphere  on the street might usher in an open confrontation between the  legislative and executive authorities since Chamber of Deputies  Speaker Nabih Birri called today for a plenary session of the  chamber on 25 and 26 May without defining an agenda for the  session.    These circles fear that the exchange of criticism between  the  government officials might escalate, now that the cabinet crisis  is threatening a political crisis between the leadership of the  presidency, the Chamber of Deputies, and the cabinet. But some  optimistic circles expect Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim  Khaddam to play a decisive role in resolving this crisis after  he returns to Damascus from Johannesburg tomorrow evening,  Wednesday.    These circles do not rule out the possibility of holding an  expanded summit meeting in Damascus attended by Lebanese  President Ilyas al-Hirawi, Nabih Birri, and Rafiq al-Hariri, as  well as by Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad as a necessary step to  stop this crisis from escalating.</p>

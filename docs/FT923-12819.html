			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: GE to halt buy-back programme GENERAL Electric, the US group with interests ranging from power systems to financial services, yesterday turned in an 8 per cent improvement in second-quarter earnings, in line with expectations, but said it would halt its Dollars 10bn stock buy-back programme at the Dollars 5bn level. Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said the company would complete the stock buy-back programme before the end of the year. 'By taking this action during this uncertain economic period, the company assures its triple A debt rating and maintains the financial flexibility to take advantage of global recovery opportunities. 'The company will, however, continue to repurchase on an ongoing basis shares required for employee programmes. These purchases should amount to approximately Dollars 400m annually.' He added that GE had no plans for any significant acquisition. For the second quarter, net earnings totalled Dollars 1.216bn, or Dollars 1.42 a share, against Dollars 1.131bn, or Dollars 1.30 in the same period of 1991. Consolidated revenues advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 15.4bn from Dollars 14.8bn. Net earnings for the first six months of 1992 rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.274bn from Dollars 2.130bn. Earnings per share were 9 per cent higher at Dollars 2.65 against Dollars 2.44. Consolidated revenues were up 3 per cent at Dollars 28.9bn from Dollars 28.1bn. During the quarter, GE's operating margin slid to 12.6 per cent from 12.9 per cent in the 1991 second quarter. The decline reflects significant pricing pressures. Earnings from GE's financial services grew 24 per cent, thanks to double-digit increases at GE Capital, its main asset-holding arm and Kidder, Peabody, its stock-broking arm. The company said its NBC television network also had double digit growth. GE will increase its quarterly dividend by 7.3 per cent, or 4 cents a share to 59 cents effective with its September third-quarter dividend.</p>

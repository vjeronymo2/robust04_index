			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Nadir's Cyprus lawyer rejects obstruction charges MR MENTES Aziz, the lawyer for the Polly Peck companies in northern Cyprus, yesterday rejected charges that he initially obstructed the administrators, and criticised them for issuing writs against Mr Asil Nadir and himself. He claimed that considerable progress had been made until writs were taken out in 1991 by Mr Christopher Morris of accountants Touche Ross, who is one of the administrators to Polly Peck. 'We never contested that the companies belonged to the shareholders,' he said. 'But the administrators' mandate depended on a court order. Had they (the administrators) been the appointed board of PPI London there would have been no problem.' His accusations were strongly denied by Touche Ross in London. 'Our writs were only issued one year after fruitless negotiations had commenced,' the firm said. It stressed that the writs covered only the individuals and did not disrupt the businesses in northern Cyprus, and added: 'They did business in the UK and should know the requirements and consequences of becoming insolvent.' There is believed to have been some disagreement between the administrators over the strategy of issuing writs, although the decision to proceed was taken with the approval of the Polly Peck creditors' committee. Mr Aziz launched 23 suits in the local courts to prevent access to the PPI companies on the island. The north Cyprus authorities blocked attempts by the administrators to create two new companies in May 1991 to take control of the Polly Peck assets in northern Cyprus, with Mr Richard Stone, a joint administrator, and Mr Nadir as directors. Polly Peck's four hotels and Sunzest, the fruit export business, were to be vested in Voyager Leisure. Unipac Packaging Industries, the packaging plant in Famagusta, was to be renamed Unipac Holdings. Both companies were to be 99 per cent owned by PPI (Holdings) BV. It also emerged yesterday that five leading financial institutions in the UK and the US hired Kroll Associates, the international private investigators, to examine Mr Nadir and his business empire over a three-year period beginning in May 1988. Mr Jules Kroll, the chairman, said yesterday he had advised his clients that Polly Peck was a 'high-risk' venture. One of the financial institutions is understood to have broken off its relations with Mr Nadir, three others cut back their exposure, while a fourth continued its involvement. Mr Kroll said that his company had raised concerns about the high level of profits being made by some of Mr Nadir's fruit packaging operations which it could not adequately explain. It is understood that Citibank was one of the banks that asked Kroll to investigate Mr Nadir, although Mr Kroll refused to comment on this yesterday other than to confirm that the bank was a client of his. The possibility that the high profits might have been linked to arms and drugs dealing was investigated, but no evidence to suppport this was found by Kroll.</p>

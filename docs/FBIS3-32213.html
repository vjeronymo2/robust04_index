			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brazilian Ambassador to the United States Paulo  Tarso Flecha de Lima has sent a protest letter to the president  of the World Bank over the statement by World Bank Director Said  Hussein.    During a speech to the America's Society, which groups most  of the bankers with whom Brazil is renegotiating its foreign  debt, Hussein said Brazil is the biggest cloud on the Latin  American horizon.    In his letter, the Brazilian ambassador said he is surprised  at this statement because a World Bank official like Hussein  cannot denigrate the image of a country which that bank should  help.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Company News: Building a presence in Germany - The push by Korean construction equipment groups Korean construction equipment makers are mounting a belated push into the German market to ensure they do not miss the remaining opportunities from reunification. Two of the big three Korean producers, Samsung Heavy Industries and Hyundai Construction Equipment, are negotiating with German entrepreneurs to set up dealer networks. Germany accounts for about 37 per cent of the European construction equipment market. The Korean producers have been reluctant to enter the German market because of the strength - and number - of domestic manufacturers, and the fear that German customers would be reluctant to accept their products. The moves by the two companies will be viewed with some unease by western producers. After the inroads made by the Japanese companies into the European market in the 1980s, the activities of the Koreans could further intensify competition in Europe. Daewoo has been producing excavators at a factory near Mons in Belgium since late 1990, establishing, like the Japanese, a manufacturing presence ahead of the European single market reforms. Mr Sang-Kyu Kim, Euro Daewoo's director of planning and international sourcing, said the product range at the Mons factory would be steadily increased from the current two models to five by the end of 1993. Samsung entered the European market only three years ago, 13 years after Daewoo, and sold just 100 crawler excavators last year. This year, however, the company hopes to raise sales to 280. Mr Ki-Jeh Cho, head of overseas marketing at Samsung's construction equipment division, said manufacturing in Europe would be viable once sales reached about 500 units. A special team in Korea is studying whether Samsung should manufacture in Europe through a joint venture, by acquisition, or by building a greenfield site. Mr Cho expects a decision next year with production beginning, perhaps, in 1994. The third big Korean producer, Hyundai Construction Equipment, began selling in Europe in early 1990. However, it has also been looking for manufacturing sites, and has come close to a decision at least once. The German initiatives by Samsung and Daewoo reflect a growing confidence that their machines will be accepted there, having been proven elsewhere in Europe. Hyundai is taking a more cautious approach, selling small numbers of machines in Germany via its Belgian dealer. The Koreans recognise they need to respond to reunification and its implications for Germany's relative position in the European market. The UK has long been Daewoo's biggest European market, but has been badly hit by recession. Korean construction equipment technology is often underestimated by western rivals, and the three producers' overseas expansion - like that of the Japanese before them - has been underpinned by their stranglehold on a strong domestic market. Some observers, however, criticise them for being slow to take decisions, especially on overseas manufacturing. The assault on Germany may already have missed the best of the growth in the market since reunification. Daewoo is looking to establish dealer networks in Germany and Italy, and has had proposals from some manufacturers for product exchange deals. Samsung is talking with many prospective dealers in Germany, and also to importers. Mr Cho said deals were imminent. Historically, Daewoo and Samsung have tended to sell machines in Europe at 5 to 10 per cent below prices for western and Japanese equipment, in an attempt to establish a presence. Now, said Mr Cho, prices relative to Japanese machines are being raised, a further sign of the Koreans' increasing confidence.</p>

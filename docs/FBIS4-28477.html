			<p>BFN     [Text] At the 13th meeting at the prime minister's  official residence on 8 June, members of the "Defense Policy  Council," an advisory panel to the prime minister, agreed to  "review the significance" of the Japan-U.S. security pact. The  security agreement was the main pillar of Japan's security  policy in the Cold War era. However, considering changes  following the end of the Cold War era, the panel has decided to  review the significance of the security pact.    The panel plans to discuss specifics at future meetings. At  present, there is a strong opinion within the panel that "the  pact should not be defined as mere the framework of Japan-U.S.  security arrangements, but it should be characterized as a  nucleus of a security system in the Asia-Pacific region."    Besides conventional cooperation such as assuming burdens  for  maintaining the U.S. forces in Japan, the panel is expected to  discuss giving more support to the U.S. forces stationed in the  region. Concluding an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement  (ACSA), which allows Japan and the U.S. forces to mutually  provide goods such as fuel, is also a topic to be discussed by  the panel.</p>

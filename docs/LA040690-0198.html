			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUSTON TAKES MASTERS LEAD FROM DONALD  </P> <P> First-round leader Mike Donald bogeyed his first two holes today in the second  round of the Masters and lost his lead to John Huston.  </P> <P> Donald, who had an 8-under-par 64 in the opening round, fell one shot behind  Huston, who birdied the second hole.  </P> <P> Both are first-timers in this event, the first major championship of the 1990s.  </P> <P> Huston shot a 66 on the 6,905-yard Augusta National course on Thursday, a day  when Masters rookies occupied three of the top four places.  </P> <P> Peter Jacobsen, in the Masters for the seventh time, had a 67 and Bill Britton,  the other rookie, had a 68.  </P> <P> Both Jacobsen and Britton parred their first two holes today as the leaders  began play under overcast skies.  </P> <P> The temperature was in the 70s and there was a 30% chance of rain.  </P> <P> Three others had 3-under-par totals in the early stages of the round that will  serve as the halfway cut for the low 44 scorers and ties and anyone within 10  shots of the lead.  </P> <P> Curtis Strange, winner of the last two U.S. Opens, PGA champion Payne Stewart  and 1985 Masters champion Bernhard Langer of West Germany all had 3-under  totals.  </P> <P> Stewart's figure was through six holes today, Langer four and Strange three.  </P> <P> Japan's Jumbo Ozaki birdied two of the first three holes to get to 4-under, but  then bogeyed the next two.  </P> <P> Greg Norman, one of the pretournament favorites, was in danger of missing the  36-hole cut after a 72-150.  </P> <P> Jeff Sluman shot a 68 and Steve Jones a 69, leaving both with 146 totals.  </P> <P> Lee Trevino got in shape to survive the cut with a 69-147, playing in the  twosome with Norman.  </P> <P> Scotland's Sandy Lyle missed the cut two years after winning the championship.  He shot a 74 for 151.  </P> <P> Arnold Palmer, who helped create the popularity of golf and the Masters in the  late 1950s and early 1960s, also missed the cut for the seventh year in a row.  </P> <P> Palmer, a three-time champion, birdied two of the first four holes but couldn't  keep it going. He finished at 80-156.  </P> <P> Paul Azinger, winner of the season-opening Tournament of Champions, had a  76-156.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Turkish Ambassador to Bonn Onur Oymen -- </F> recorded]    [Text] We welcome the German Government plans, in the wake  of recent regrettable incidents in Germany, to extradite to  Turkey some of our citizens who have committed crimes here in  Germany. We declare that we are ready to cooperate with the  German authorities in this matter.    Allegations to the effect that those who will be extradited  will be executed or tortured in Turkey consists entirely of the  propaganda waged by extremist organizations. This is what we  are explaining to the Germans. We are discussing these issues  with various organs. Such a mechanism exists between the  Foreign Ministries of both countries. We have a committee  comprised of the under secretaries of the Foreign, Justice, and  Interior Ministries. Moreover, we decided to set up a  cooperation committee between the Turkish and German Justice  Ministries. I believe that it will not be difficult to reach an  agreement with Germany on these and similar issues. It is  important to trust one another and I believe that this mutual  trust exists.</p>

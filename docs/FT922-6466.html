			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions THREE WEEKS ago, we believed it was too simplistic to say directors were selling just because shares were over-valued. To some extent that still holds good, but there is some evidence to suggest the recovery in certain sectors has been more than discounted in present share prices. One such area is building materials. Directors of Ibstock Johnson, the brick manufacturer, have been heavy sellers since July last year. The chairman, Paul Hyde-Thompson, made sales totalling 529,000 shares at prices ranging from 81-94p. The selling stopped in December when the share price fell to around 60p, but recently Hyde-Thompson made another significant disposal. His residual holding has been reduced to 128,000. Isotron appears to be one of those companies where the share price is virtually unaffected by directors' sales. Five directors sold shares recently, but the previous co-ordinated sales have been shrugged off by the market. William Baird, the textile group, has enjoyed a tremendous run since the announcement of results at the beginning of April. John Jackson has taken advantage of that rise to sell 513,000 shares at 265p, leaving him with 1.6m.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                      Sector   Shares      Value    directors  ------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Arjo Wiggins Appl            Pack      5,515        15         1 Baird (William)              Text    513,242     1,360         1 BM Group                     EngG     72,255       260         1* Booker                       FdMa      8,000        37         1 BTR                          OthI     70,000       341         1* Clarke T                     Elec     12,170        12         1 Eurotherm Intl               Elns      6,000        24         1 Gresham Telecomputg          Elns    400,000        40         1 Haemocell                    Hlth     12,000        17         1 Hewden Stuart                C&amp;C      14,700        16         1 Hunting (cnv pref)           EngA     22,000        21         1 Ibstock Johnsen              BdMa    163,200       147         1 Isotron                      Misc     33,500        78         5 Kingfisher                   Stor    168,739       911         1* Life Sciences                Hlth    152,663       272         1* Logica                       Elns    100,000       228         1 Low &amp; Bonar                  Pack     23,076        72         1 Macallan-Glenlivet           Brew     25,000        45         1 McKechnie                    OthI     25,000        88         1* Pearson                      Med      20,000       173         1* Record Holdings              EngG    250,000       238         1 Senior Engineering           EngG    701,627       593         1* Smith &amp; Nephew               Hlth    104,000       170         1* UDO Holdings                 Misc     11,900        30         1 Watmoughs (Hldgs)            Med       9,300        41         1  ------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Aberdeen Trust               OthF     99,000        35         3 Aberforth Split              InTr     95,000       100         1 Alexandra Workwear           Text     20,000        21         1 BM Group                     EngG     20,166        73         1 Bedford (Wm)                  n/a    200,000        43         1 Cardiff Property             Prop     11,020        18         2 Gresham Telecomputg          Elns    340,000        34         1 Hadleigh Ind                 EngG     28,500        16         2 Hunting                      EngA     11,250        20         1 MAI                          OthI     10,000        12         1 Merchants Trust              InTr      5,000        11         1 Tomkins                      OthI     37,245       181         1 Trio Inv Trust               InTr     20,000        10         1 Witan Inv Trust              InTr     15,136        26         1 Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

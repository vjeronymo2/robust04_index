			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sara Lee to Drop 'Light' Claim: Sara Lee Corp. will drop the words "light  classics" from the packages and advertising of some whipped dessert products  under an agreement it signed with the attorneys general of nine states.  Although the company said the complaint has no merit, it said it settled the  suit to save legal expenses and will pay $80,000 for the costs of the  government investigation. A Sara Lee spokesman said the attorneys general  objected on the grounds that light implied fewer calories. The nine states  involved are California, Iowa, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri,  New York, Texas and Wisconsin.  </P></p>

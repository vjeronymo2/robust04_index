			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The Belgrade daily POLITIKA, in an  article entitled "Bonn Continues To Protect Zagreb" published on  page 7 of its 7 February issue, writes that while, on one hand,  the Croatian leadership is being threatened with "empty words"  for the policy it is conducting in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  demonstration that all participants in the bloodshed in Bosnia  are being treated equally, Germany, in fact, continues to  protect Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is confirmed in that  day's Croatian newspapers which "conspicuously published the  information that German defense officials have denied Croatian  military involvement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for which Croatia  has been threatened with international sanctions in a most  serious way."    POLITIKA states that while it is clear to the citizens of  Croatia that the country's army is participating in the fighting  in neighboring Bosnia- Herzegovina because the citizens  themselves are being "mobilized and taken across the border,  many returning in coffins," the defense attache at the German  Embassy in Zagreb, Colonel Per Shvan [name transliterated from  Cyrillic] claims that he had just visited units of the 7th Guard  Brigade of the Croatian Army which are stationed in the area of  Sibenik and Zadar and that he has established that the brigade  is "intact" and that it is not active outside of the territory  of the Republic of Croatia. POLITIKA notes that this is the  brigade reported to be fighting the Muslims in central Bosnia.    Colonel Shvan, who was accompanied on this "inspection" by  representatives of the German Defense Ministry, stressed that he  would inform appropriate officials in Germany of his findings,  POLITIKA reports.    "Thus Croatia was provided with the argument -- precisely by  the German side -- that it is not involved in the battles in  neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. The German representatives did  not visit the citizens who have been forcibly mobilized in the  Kroacija Barracks in Zagreb, from where they are sent to the  battlefield in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although even some Croatian  newspapers have written about this and published the names of  persons jammed into military prisons for refusing to go to the  undeclared war in the neighboring state," POLITIKA concludes.</p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bond fund managers heave a sigh of relief - Tracy Corrigan, Conner Middelmann and Sara Webb find modest signs of a recovery The agonies of the past month are finally easing for those bond fund managers who clung to economic fundamentals, while selling by hedge funds and proprietary traders drove prices further and further down. After giving up as much as six months' worth of gains in the past four weeks, European bond prices are staging a modest recovery. 'We have become much more optimistic over the last few days that we have seen the worst,' said Mr Paul Abberley, head of fixed income at Lombard Odier. 'The main thing is that the hedge funds seem to have stopped selling.' Unlike hedge funds and proprietary traders, traditional fund managers tend to take a long-term view on their investments, based on economic fundamentals. From their viewpoint, European bond markets appeared attractive at the start of this year, even after disappointment over the Bundesbank's slow pace of interest rate easing set in. Logically, then, the  1/4 point increase in US short-term rates should not have caused a turnround. The economic cycle in the US is well ahead of Europe, and further easing of European interest rates is still widely expected. 'In the big picture, we do feel the correction and bloodbath (in European bonds) has been overdone. In the last week we've been adding to our positions,' said Mr Jonathan Kelly, manager of Fidelity's Global Bond Fund in Boston, with about Dollars 750m under management. Investors have been particularly encouraged by the fact that European bonds rallied last Friday, while the US market fell in the wake of a substantial drop in US unemployment. This rekindled hopes that the European market is no longer tracking the US market. Not surprisingly, though, investors are adopting a cautious stance, even to the prospect of this decoupling. 'It is probable that we will now see a phase of decoupling from the US, but I don't think we'll go in the opposite direction,' said Mr Karl-Wilhelm Knigge, senior portfolio manager responsible for international bonds at Union Investment Gesellschaft, which manages a total of DM37bn. Mr Udo Behrenwaldt, managing director of DWS, Deutsche Bank's fund management subsidiary, agrees: 'I don't think Europe will totally decouple (from the US), but further rate cuts by the Bundesbank will help European bond markets achieve greater independence from the US Treasuries market.' Given the lack of support from the US market, the rebound in European bond prices is likely to be somewhat constrained. Another check on the rally could be the number of long positions still in the market. 'The 'conventional' fund management community is still very long (on European bonds) and will take the opportunity to reduce exposure as the market moves up,' said Mr Abberley. Further, Mr Kirit Shah, international strategist at First Chicago, points out that 'the pool of investors has shrunk significantly; hedge funds and trading houses won't buy as madly as they did in the past'. Nevertheless, many bond fund managers say they are now cautiously increasing their exposure to European bonds. Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore, said he was extending the maturity and putting new money to work in the European government bond markets as it was a good buying opportunity. 'We have done some selling but have remained long throughout; given that we are driven by market fundamentals, we had to stay long,' said Mr Abberley. He adopted some more protective positions by outright selling and by switching from high to lower yielding bond markets, but now favours the high-yielding bond markets. Fidelity also increased its position in Europe last week. 'All we've done in the (bond market) sell-off is reshuffle our positions . . . we've placed renewed emphasis on France and Italy by adding to our positions and going along the curve.' There are still some black clouds on the horizon, though. The European bond market could well prove vulnerable to a further rise in US interest rates or US inflationary fears, political disruption in the former Soviet Union, or the US/Japan trade dispute. And without the heavy inflow of capital from speculative investors, the return to last year's peaks could take some time.</p>

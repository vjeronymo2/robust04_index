			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Major to act on 'open government' MR John Major has signalled his intention to push ahead quickly with measures to open the Whitehall machine to greater scrutiny following his general election promise to promote more open government. As the cabinet yesterday approved its legislative programme for the Queen's Speech next week, colleagues said the prime minister was determined to remove some of the secrecy which surrounds ministerial decision-making. Among the measures will be publication for the first time of the responsibilities and membership of cabinet committees which make many important government decisions. Civil servants have also been asked to update and publish the 'guidance for ministers' which sets out rules to prevent conflicts between ministers' private interests and public responsibilities. Mr Major remains opposed to any formal legislation on freedom of information, but has indicated that much unnecessary secrecy can be dispensed with without complicated legislation. In spite of opposition from the cabinet office, the prime minister is expected to press ahead with a relaxation of the procedures under which many government papers remain secret well beyond the traditional 30-year rule. He has also called for the abolition of many of the 80 or so statutory restrictions which apply to the disclosure of information to the public or press. The cabinet's deliberations on the Queen's Speech ended with the endorsement of a programme which Downing Street said would emphasise the new government's commitment to 'choice, opportunity and freedom'. As well as the legislation to implement the Maastricht treaty - which Mr Major wants to get through the Commons by July - and a new finance bill to put the remainder of the Budget into law, it will foreshadow about a dozen other bills. Prominent among them will be measures to pave the way for the privatisation of British Coal and British Rail, to impose further restrictions on trade unions, to implement plans for a national lottery, and to tighten the rules on asylum-seekers. There will also be a leasehold reform bill, legislation to set up a nationwide rents-into-mortgages scheme and a measure to establish the Urban Regeneration Agency to oversee the government's inner cities programme. Among other possible measures in a parliamentary session due to last until October 1993 are a bill to reduce the threshold for the Post Office's letter monopoly and a significant criminal justice bill to respond to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on miscarriages of justice. Ministers will also consider legislation to privatise the Northern Ireland electricity industry and to strengthen the protection available to consumers who are misled by the descriptions of goods offered for sale. Sir Terence Higgins, a senior Conservative backbench MP, has called on the government to use its influence to ensure that the main parliamentary select committees are re-established quickly. There have been reports at Westminster that bargaining between the Conservatives and Labour over the composition of the committees could delay their formation until the autumn. Sir Terence is pressing for a commitment that they will be set up within 30 working days of the Queen's Speech.</p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Seeking gain beyond venture - Richard Gourlay witnesses the fanfare as 3i steps into the spotlight Unperturbed by the sharp fall in the equity markets, 3i, the UK's largest investor in unquoted companies, yesterday launched with great fanfare its long-awaited pathfinder prospectus ahead of flotation next month. With an anticipated market capitalisation of about Pounds 1.6bn, 3i will be the largest new issue this year, unless the government acts quickly on the sale of part of the Post Office. The 45-year old institution will also emerge abruptly from the relative seclusion of the venture capital world, where it is very well known, and into the glare of publicity reserved for companies in, or on the fringes of, the FT-SE 100 Index. The attractions of 3i as an investment will depend to some extent on the pricing of the issue on June 22, and the state of the decidedly edgy stock market. But 3i, which has helped float over 800 companies, is likely to attract more interest in the venture capital industry from institutional and private investors than it has ever seen before. For the seven high-street banks and the Bank of England, which set up 3i to provide equity to smaller companies, there are a number of benefits. After an embarrassing about-turn 14 months ago when 3i's last attempt to float was pulled, the banks will be able to realise some of their investment and hold the balance in a more liquid form. And by turning the group into an investment trust, the shareholders will be able to shelter the capital gains 3i is confident will continue to flow as the small companies in its portfolio continue to benefit from economic recovery. For investors, 3i offers an entirely new way of investing in European economic recovery. Until now, private investors have had relatively few opportunities to invest in small and medium sized companies. Shares in some of the listed venture capital investment trusts are relatively illiquid and high-risk, because their funds are invested in a small number of companies. 3i is wholly different. Since it was set up to provide long-term finance to private companies, it has grown to dominate the British venture and investment capital scene. By the end of 1993, it had investments in 3,400 smaller companies with a valuation of Pounds 3bn. It does about 500 smallish deals a year, where many of its competitors would typically do 10 larger deals; it has 18 regional offices, double the number of its nearest competitor and is rolling out the formula to the continent though five offices focused on providing management buy-out and buy-in finance. 'Most fund managers know the small cap venture capital funds,' says Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive. 'But most find it difficult to grasp our size. It is a different game to the venture capital boutiques.' Mr Macpherson says 3i, which is not raising any money through the float, will not alter how it positions itself in the market. It focuses on companies with sales of Pounds 1m to Pounds 100m employing typically 15 to 500 people. Nor will 3i change its approach to customers. It says it gains a strong competitive advantage by leaving the decision when to float or sell the companies in which it invests entirely to their managements. Many venture capital funds with limited lives are more interventionist. 3i argues this approach has born fruit in terms of investment returns. More recently, there have also been developments that suggest 3i may be casting off its reputation of being a slow and old-fashioned institution. Early this year, in a departure from tradition, 3i began raising funds from other institutions which it will invest and manage. The first was a Ecu300m fund for co-investment in continental European management buy-outs and buy-ins. The second was a Pounds 150m fund for co-investment in UK buy-outs larger than Pounds 10m - the latter allowing it to reduce the number of deals it has had to syndicate to competitor venture capital groups. 3i will generate fees from the management of the first fund. 3i's move into raising funds will increase the pressure on other venture capital groups raising funds. But 3i has also ruffled feathers by undertaking not to take management fees from institutions investing in the UK fund. Instead it will take a 'share in the performance' of the investments when they float or are sold. Another sign of a slicker operation is 3i's cost-cutting. Since 1989, it has withdrawn from areas in which it had no distinctive competence - like the US, consultancy and property investment - cutting staff numbers from 944 to 566. The listing of such a large investor as 3i might have been greeted as unwelcome news to the existing venture capital trusts and independent funds. Mr Hugh Mumford, chief executive of Electra, the investment trust that looks most similar to 3i, welcomes the move as an opportunity for more investors to learn about investing in private companies. Ironically, too, 3i can gain some comfort from the fall in equities - so long as it does not continue too long. After yesterday's fall, 3i is more likely to go straight into the FT-SE 100, immediately increasing the demand for its shares from institutions that try to match the index.</p>

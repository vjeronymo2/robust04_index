			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Trading warning hits Merrydown shares Shares of Merrydown Wine, the USM-quoted cider, wine and health foods company, yesterday fell 43p to 255p after Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, warned of stiff competition in the premium cider market, writes Peter Franklin. Speaking at the annual meeting, Mr Purdey said the company was operating in difficult market conditions. The premium market continued to endure competition from new, cheaper brands. Despite a strong April to June quarter, Merrydown believed the cider market would show only slight growth over the year as a whole, he added. Pub trade continued to be tough and this affected sales of all the company's products. However, in the take-home market, sales of canned cider were growing fast. The statement accompanied news that Merrydown has acquired Sorelle - a sparkling herbal fruit drink - from Premier Teas, part of Hillsdown Holdings. No purchase price was revealed but Mr Purdey said the acquisition was in line with the strategy of acquiring brands compatible with the company's product range and balancing its alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks ratio. The acquisition follows the purchase in May of Piermont, which Mr Purdey said was performing well.</p>

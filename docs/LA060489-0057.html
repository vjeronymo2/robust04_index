			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUEEN ANNE: ECLECTIC, ORNATE  </P> <P> How many well-known and prominent men are there who can in no small measure  attribute their success to their architects, for designing and producing for  them, homes or buildings striking and commanding and holding one's attention?  </P> <P>  -- Architect J. Cather Newsom  </P> <P> The "striking and commanding" homes of Newsom's ringing phrases were designed  -- many by Newsom himself -- in the flamboyant, late-Victorian style known as  Queen Anne.  </P> <P> At the height of its fashion during the 1880s and '90s, the Queen Anne, and its  companion style, known as Eastlake, graced California's most elegant suburbs.  The homes were distinguished by their steep slate roofs, fretworked timber  gables, bonneted turrets and painted spindle-work porches.  </P> <P> Superseded by the rage for Craftsman architecture at the turn of the century,  Queen Anne-Eastlake homes stand as reminders of the frantic Los Angeles land  boom of the late-1800s, which converted districts such as Bunker Hill and  Angelino Heights into gracious neighborhoods.  </P> <P> The name Queen Anne is historically ambiguous. Originated in Britain in the  1860s by architect Richard Norman Shaw, the late-Victorian Queen Anne-style  bears no relation to the style of the period of the real English Queen Anne,  who reigned briefly in the early 18th Century.  </P> <P> Queen Anne-style had become even more eclectic by the time it arrived on the  West Coast, following its popularization in the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial  Exhibition.  </P> <P> In its passage across the continent, it collected a variety of extra details  and mannerisms, derived from the East Coast Eastlake-style, plus elements of  Victorian Romanesque, Rococo and Renaissance Revival, with added exotic bits  and pieces copied from Moorish and Oriental architecture.  </P> <P> "Where does Newsom get his ideas?" Queen Anne popularizer Newsom asked  rhetorically in his 1895 book "Artistic City Buildings, Flats and Residences."  </P> <P> Revealing that the source of his inspiration was a large library of books and  photographs, he said: "It is from these I take new features, taking a feature  here and there, and making a happy result."  </P> <P> Queen Anne's elaborate details and construction were made both possible and  affordable by the modern technology of the Industrial Revolution.  </P> <P> At its heart was the innovative lightweight "balloon" frame that allowed whole  sections of timber framing to be prefabricated and assembled on site.  </P> <P> The balloon frame, now standard in all timber house construction, replaced the  traditional mortise-and-tenon post-and-beam framing that was heavier and more  labor intensive.  </P> <P> Historically nostalgic Queen Anne details such as fretwork and friezes became  cheap to make through the use of new inventions, such as the iron steam press  and the scroll jigsaw, which could economically sculpt wood into decorative  designs.  </P> <P> Queen Anne was a typically Victorian mixture of stylistic nostalgia and  technological innovation, said architectural historian David Gebhard.  </P> <P> "It was an age marked by a passionate, evangelistic belief in progress,  countered by a clinging to the cultural reassurance of the architecture of the  past," Gebhard said. "The idea of the modern was fused with a longing for the  ancient."  </P> <P> The Victorians tried to look backward and forward at the same time, Gebhard  explained, toward a brave new world of technical miracles and a mythologized  history of social stability and moral order.  </P> <P> "They reacted ambiguously to the speed of change," he said, "mixing a rejection  with an embrace."  </P> <P> Being "modern" was very much the rage among the late-Victorians, despite the  eclectic nostalgia of their architecture. It was a prime concern for Newsom and  his brother, Samuel, who led the fashion for Queen Anne in California from  their offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In their pattern books and periodicals, which were copied by many other  architects and builders, the Newsoms warned the public to "Avoid the old fogy  architects, who have had their day . . . on account of their not keeping up and  being posted on all that is new and latest."  </P> <P> And Southern California in the 1880s was the Promised Land of "all that is new  and latest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rapid Transformation  </P> <P> Recently made accessible by railroad connections, the Southland "awaited  transformation into a Real Eden," Gebhard said, "with a touch of the wand --  water, capital and the Puritanical ethic of hard work."  </P> <P> The Southland's paradisal transformation was rapid. In the final decades of the  19th Century the trinity of water, capital and hard work, fertilized by rampant  boosterism, changed a semi-desert into a flourishing city set among orange  groves.  </P> <P> The Queen Anne-style best symbolized the endless energy and cheerful  flamboyance of this newly created Californian Eden.  </P> <P> From San Diego to Santa Monica, Queen Anne and Eastlake homes raised their  fretworked gables and perky turrets to the sky in a bold toast to progress and  culture.  </P> <P> The heady atmosphere of the period may be savored in the Angelino Heights  section of Echo Park, which boasts the finest surviving concentration of Queen  Anne homes in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Loving Restoration  </P> <P> Carroll Avenue in Angelino Heights is host to an array of Queen Anne and  Eastlake homes that have been lovingly restored by young professionals in  search of affordable housing with character.  </P> <P> Barbara and Andrew Thornburg bought 1316 Carroll Ave. in 1973. At the cost of  much personal labor and considerable expense, they have restored the  once-derelict 1887 Eastlake-style house, with its ship's wheel staircase  design, Lincrusta paper friezes, hand-carved fireplace surrounds and molded  plaster cornices into a delightfully authentic Victorian memento.  </P> <P> "The house was a junkyard when we discovered it," Barbara Thornburg recalled.  "The redwood frame was riddled with dry rot. Many window frames were eaten away  by termites. The place was a sad sight, like a Victorian grand dame fallen upon  ruin."  </P> <P> Over the next decade the Thornburgs themselves stripped every surface of old  lead paint, caulked each nail and had new window frames milled to the old  pattern. The house took four years to paint in the dark-green-and-white-trim  color scheme the owners carefully researched for its authenticity to the  original Eastlake decor.  </P> <P> "Talk about sweat equity," Barbara Thornburg said ruefully. "This place is  Perspiration Palace."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Ornamental  </P> <P> The Eastlake style, named for English furniture designer Charles Lockewood  Eastlake, was less ornate than the Queen Anne, and in some ways its opposite in  inspiration.  </P> <P> Eastlake yearned for a return to "plain ornament" in reaction to late-Victorian  architectural extravagance.  </P> <P> But in Los Angeles, the Eastlake style -- with its ornately detailed and  steeply gabled roofs and "stickwork" boarding laid in a variety of patterns --  was usually elaborated way beyond plainness in a fusion with Queen Anne  exuberance.  </P> <P> A superb marriage of Queen Anne and Eastlake is found at 824 E. Kensington Road  in Echo Park. The design of this 1880 mansion, probably copied by its anonymous  builder from one of the popular pattern books of the period, is Queen Anne in  its spritely turrets and generous porches, its multiple gables, thrusting  dormers and Moorish arches. But the curlicued clarity of its white-painted  fretwork is pure Eastlake.  </P> <P> The 1886 cottage built by Elias Jackson (Lucky) Baldwin in Arcadia is another  splendid fusion of Queen Anne and Eastlake mannerisms.  </P> <P> Now on the grounds of the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum, the lovingly  restored and furnished cottage designed by A. A. Bennett, one of the architects  for the State Capitol in Sacramento, features a three-tiered turret topped by a  viewing platform. Here, it is said, the eccentric millionaire would stand  mournful watch for his fourth wife, who left him before the house was finished.  </P> <P> Late-Victorian interiors were stuffed with a mixture of furnishings as eclectic  as their exteriors. Every inch of surface in the walls, doors, windows and  ceilings pulsated with opulent detail and decoration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beds Big as Boats  </P> <P> Patterned parquet floors and molded redwood door frames competed for attention  in the subdued light with vigorously textured wallpapers featuring busy  medallions or lush floral designs. Front parlors were crowded with overstuffed  deep-buttoned red-velvet armchairs and settees.  </P> <P> Bedrooms boasted carved and canopied beds big as boats. Richly carved, solidly  crafted Rococo and Renaissance Revival rosewood sideboards were miniature  architectures in their own right.  </P> <P> Several of the biggest and most flamboyant Queen Anne mansions designed by the  Newsoms in Los Angeles -- such as the magnificent 1887 Bradbury House, built by  the owner of downtown's famous Bradbury Building -- vanished when Bunker Hill  was flattened by bulldozers during the brutal "urban renewal" programs of the  1960s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Popularized Style  </P> <P> The 1889 house built by J. Cather Newsom for dairyman Charles Sessions at 1330  Carroll Ave. is a reminder of the architect's playful skill.  </P> <P> A pair of fierce stone Chinese dogs guards the steps that lead to a tier of  porches with round Oriental archways mixed with Moorish spindle woodwork and a  turret topped by a spiky finial bearing a weathercock.  </P> <P> The last word on Queen Anne must belong to Newsom, whose buildings and writings  did the most to popularize the style in Southern California. Referring to the  inspiration of the style, he declared:  </P> <P> "Architecture is an art primarily, and hardly anything else."  </P> <P> </P> <P> RECOGNIZING QUEEN ANNE-EASTLAKE HOMES  </P> <P> Two to three stories tall, often with a basement.  </P> <P> First-floor front porches, raised above ground and reached by a short flight of  steps, feature spindle-work friezes and balustrades.  </P> <P> Steep, multicolored slate roofs, punctuated by dormers and bonneted turrets,  with high fretworked gable ends.  </P> <P> Lower floors finished in brick or stone; upper levels have fish-scale shingles  or clapboarding.  </P> <P> A variety of bay windows, patterned brick chimneys, oriels, stained glass and  plaster swags, sometimes set off by Moorish arches, onion domes or Oriental  woodwork.  </P> <P> Elaborately paneled entry halls, with fancy carved wooden staircases, filled  with the rainbow tones of rich stained glass.  </P> <P> Dark main rooms, also paneled, with parquet flooring, ceilings decorated with  medallions and crown moldings, wallpapered walls with friezes and wainscotting,  and fireplaces of patterned tile or carved hardwood.  </P></p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Taiwan shares rise 5% Taipei share prices rose 5 per cent yesterday to post the highest index close since June 1991, after a call from economics minister PK Chiang for the state to open limited direct shipping links with China. Led by the financial sector, which gained 6.6 per cent, the weighted index rose 275.48 points to close at 5,813.55. The surge continued early today, with the weighted index rising a further 200 points in the first minutes of trading. Taiwan's private sector has lobbied for an end to the ban on cross-strait transportation, which forces most trade with China through Hong Kong. Mr Chiang's remarks marked the first time a senior official has publicly broken ranks with the government over its opposition to direct links with China. But analysts cautioned it was unlikely direct links will be opened for several years. See World Stock Markets</p>

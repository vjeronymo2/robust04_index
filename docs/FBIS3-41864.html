			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The scheduled third trial of the medium-range  surface-to-surface missile, Agni, has been postponed. The  test-firing of the country's most sophisticated missile was to  be carried out today at the interim test range at Chandipur in  Orissa. Our correspondent, quoting official sources in  Balasore, reports that the trial was postponed at the last stage  of the countdown this morning because of some technical snag.  The exact date of the launching will be notified later.</p>

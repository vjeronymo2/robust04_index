			<p><P> August 28, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> COMPUTER-AIDED TEACHING PRAISED  </P> <P> The Hueneme Elementary School District's program of delivering computer-aided  instruction to students in various disciplines was given high praise Monday by  an outside evaluation prepared during the 1989-90 school year.  </P> <P> The evaluation of the district's Model Technology School Program focused on the  three science classrooms, which use everything from computers to video laser  disks to satellite dishes.  </P> <P> The evaluation was conducted through USC.  </P> <P> "Hueneme has one of the most advanced technological programs I have ever seen,"  said Patrick Rooney, who directed the evaluation. "It's an overwhelming benefit  to the students. Everyone involved should be congratulated for their  achievement."  </P> <P> Rooney is a retired superintendent of Ventura schools and current professor of  education at USC.  </P> <P> The report evaluated the program's computer hardware, its teachers, its budget  management and 12 areas ranging from class environment to the program's  applicability at the national and international levels.  </P> <P> About 2,100 people, 30 of them from other countries, have visited the program  since it began seven years ago.  </P> <P> The report found that student interest in science has jumped dramatically since  1983 and the technological instruction helped improve attendance of last year's  139 eighth-graders by 15% over the previous year, Rooney said.  </P> <P> The report also found a gradual improvement in California Assessment Program  achievement test scores since the early 1980s to be a result of the "smart"  classes.  </P> <P> Rooney said the program has helped students' problem-solving abilities and has  reduced the number of disciplinary actions by teachers.

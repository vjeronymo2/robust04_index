			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: RAISING THE FERTILE FRUIT FLY  </P> <P> I am indebted to the editor who passed me in the hall one day and said, "How do  you raise a fertile fruit fly?"  </P> <P> I have been in this business many years and am not unaccustomed to editors  growling non sequiturs as they pass, trapped as they often are in their own  improbable worlds.  </P> <P> But I have learned that one never completely ignores an editor.  </P> <P> Years ago in Oakland a passing editor who wasn't even looking at me asked, "How  do you train a dog to dance?" and kept going.  </P> <P> I ignored the question and was chewed out later for being beaten by the San  Francisco Chronicle on the famous Berkeley Dancing Dog story.  </P> <P> Editors, I learned from that experience, often assign stories in an offhand  manner and expect at least a stick of type to result from their suggestions.  </P> <P> We don't have sticks of type anymore, I don't think, but an editor's question,  in whatever manner delivered, is still not to be taken lightly.  </P> <P> To the fertile fruit fly comment, therefore, I asked the man what he meant.  </P> <P> He said, well, if you wanted to be a Medfly terrorist and release flies capable  of bearing young and waging war, where would you get them and how would you  raise them?  </P> <P> Then he shrugged and went about his business, leaving the question, as we used  to write, hanging in the winter air.  </P> <P> The man was alluding to a letter received by the mayor's office from a group  that calls itself the Breeders, claiming responsibility for the current  infestation of the Mediterranean fruit fly in L.A.  </P> <P> The Breeders, according to the letter, want the aerial spraying of malathion to  cease or they will spread fertile fruit flies throughout the state, thus  placing California's crops in jeopardy.  </P> <P> Fruit fly experts are unwilling to dismiss the letter as a joke because they  can't explain certain elements of the infestation. Meanwhile, they keep on  spraying and hope for the best.  </P> <P> A good many non-terrorist citizens also object to the use of malathion, despite  assurances that the chemical is harmless.  </P> <P> If it's harmless, they ask quite reasonably, why are those living in the attack  area cautioned to cover their cars and keep their children indoors during the  spraying?  </P> <P> A spokesman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture assured me once  that health concerns over malathion were blown out of proportion.  </P> <P> "We use 2.4 ounces of malathion mixed with 9.6 ounces of corn syrup per acre,"  he said. "Think of it as a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola. It's nothing. In Europe,  they use malathion to control head lice."  </P> <P> I asked Don Henry, deputy director of Project Medfly, if it were even possible  for someone to raise Medflies for the purpose of waging guerrilla warfare  against malathion spraying.  </P> <P> He said, reluctantly, it was.  </P> <P> Henry indicated that anyone capable of raising orchids or African violets could  raise a fruit fly, though not for the same purpose, of course.  </P> <P> "I don't want to go into detail," he said, "but you could raise a fruit fly in  your garage."  </P> <P> You have a fellow terrorist mail a larvae-infested mango from Hawaii and take  it from there.  </P> <P> "In the Islands," Henry said, "they raise 70 million sterile flies a week in an  assembly-line lab. You couldn't raise that many fertile ones, but you could  raise enough to cause headaches."  </P> <P> It is my understanding that sterile male fruit flies are encouraged to mate  with fertile female fruit flies. I don't know how they do that, but they do.  </P> <P> The sexual act, though no doubt personally satisfying to the fly, produces no  offspring, a situation that, one hopes, will eventually eliminate the strain.  </P> <P> Henry says there are plenty of books available on raising insects that could be  applied to Medflies.  </P> <P> "You don't have to be an entomologist to raise Medflies any more than you have  to be an ichthyologist to raise tropical fish," he said.  </P> <P> He declined to go into specifics, fearing, I suppose, that the publication of  details could serve as a kind of Handbook on Fruit Fly Terrorism. I wouldn't  want that.  </P> <P> If there actually is a group called the Breeders, their tactics in the end will  serve us poorly.  </P> <P> For every fertile fruit fly the experts find, another Coke-sized can of  malathion and corn syrup will be sprayed on us. While that might help with head  lice, I'm worried about what it's doing to our heads.  </P> <P> It's just a question here of whether the fruit fly terrorists or the malathion  lords prevail. Either way, we lose.  </P></p>

			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Cambodian Elections: Khmer Rouge allows guerrillas and civilians to vote THE KHMER ROUGE surprised UN officials in Cambodia yesterday by allowing some of its own guerrillas and civilians living in its territory to vote in this week's election, only days after warning Cambodians not to go to the polls on pain of death, reports Victor Mallet from Phnom Penh. About 200 Khmer Rouge cadres emerged from the wilderness to vote at Poipet on the Thai border on Sunday, UN officials said yesterday. In some districts the Khmer Rouge instructed its supporters to vote for Funcinpec, the royalist party and the main electoral rival to the Phnom Penh government. The Khmer Rouge pulled out of a peace accord signed by the four main Cambodian factions in 1991 and threatened to disrupt the UN-organised elections, but it may have decided to renew ties with its old allies in the royalist camp in the hope of a Funcinpec victory. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the Funcinpec leader, and his father Prince Sihanouk, the former 'god-king', have called for reconciliation with the Khmer Rouge, whereas the government says it will treat the guerrillas as bandits if it wins the election. According to the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, between 60 and 70 per cent of those registered have already voted; the voting ends on Friday.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENDOWMENT CAMPAIGN TAKES CENTER STAGE;  </P> <P> CASH-POOR ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER KICKS OFF A DRIVE TO QUADRUPLE  ITS ASSETS AND CLOSE UP ITS GAPING 'INCOME GAP'  </P> <P> With familiar fanfare, the Orange County Performing Arts Center has launched a  drive to nearly quadruple the cash assets of its Endowment Fund, an investment  fund intended largely to help bridge the inevitable gap between ticket sales  and annual expenses.  </P> <P> Center officials say they already can count on more than $50 million in pledges  to the endowment -- but that's money that may not come in for a long, long  time. The pledges, most in the form of such deferred gifts as will bequests,  are essentially IOUs, expected (though most are not legally binding) to be paid  over the next 30 to 40 years.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the endowment sits at only $3.2 million in actual cash, on hand and  earning income in interest and dividends. In hard dollars, the endowment makes  up less than 20% of the $17 million it takes to run the Center for one year.  </P> <P> Does that spell trouble? Compared with other major American performing arts  centers, does Orange County's endowment fall precipitously short?  </P> <P> The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts has an endowment -- all of it in  cash -- of $5 million, the same size as its annual operating budget.  </P> <P> The Tennessee Performing Arts Center, which also has a budget of $5 million,  has a cash endowment of nearly twice that, $9 million.  </P> <P> On the other hand, ask Lawrence J. Wilker, head of Cleveland's Playhouse Square  Center, about that organization's endowment and he delivers a Yiddish lesson:  "You know what eppes means? Eppes means zero. We have zero endowment."  </P> <P> The situation is the same at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which nonetheless  has managed to stay in business for 128 years, longer than any other performing  arts center in the country.  </P> <P> Endowments, it seems, vary from place to place just as surely as programs and  playbills, expenses and revenues. "There are no norms, no rules of thumb that I  know of," said David Eiteman, who teaches financial management of nonprofit  organizations for UCLA's graduate arts management program.  </P> <P> Just about everyone wants an endowment, though. No performing arts center can  pay the bills on box office alone. Every year, charitable contributions or some  other form of revenue must be used to meet expenses, which means that an  enormous effort often must be spent on fund raising -- an especially  challenging task in an increasingly competitive market.  </P> <P> The Orange County Center had to come up with more than $4 million to cover its  1989 operating shortfall, to bridge the "income gap," as officials there say,  between between costs and revenues.  </P> <P> Endowment income is generated from principal assets that are set aside  permanently. It is, therefore, impervious to the vagaries of annual fund  raising and thus lends financial stability. Endowments can avert insolvency in  worst-case scenarios, Eiteman said.  </P> <P> Furthermore, he added, by lessening reliance on ticket revenue, endowments can  allow greater freedom to present more experimental or adventurous programming  -- which, according to some observers, has been in short supply at the Center.  </P> <P> The variance in endowments' size -- and whether they exist at all -- has to do  with several factors, experts say. Among them are a community's financial  resources, an organization's age, whether it must raise money to construct  facilities, and the length of time that's been spent building the endowment  fund.  </P> <P> How come the three-theater Tennessee Performing Arts Center has an endowment  twice the size of its budget? Largely because officials there never had to ask  the private sector for money to construct facilities, or cash to cover annual  operating expenses, according to chief financial officer Gary Gossett.  </P> <P> The center, Gossett said, was founded in an established building and its  officials don't rely on private donations to bolster operating revenue, but on  funds from such alternative sources as concession sales and theater rental. So,  when Nashville community leaders trudged the fund-raising trail, they were  asking only for endowment contributions. By the time their center opened in  1979, they'd already amassed $5 million for the endowment. "It would almost be  suicide" to have simultaneously requested funds for an endowment and for  construction and operation of three theaters, Gossett said.  </P> <P> Sure enough, officials at Playhouse Square, who had to raise capital to build  and renovate their theaters, opted against an endowment drive. "You've got to  give (donors) a break," said Wilker, a former chairman of the Assn. of  Performing Arts Centers, a nationwide service organization. Only now, he said,  is development of an endowment under consideration.  </P> <P> Officials at the Orange County Center, though, wanted to have it both ways:  They solicited building funds and started building an endowment, too. (Indeed,  the endowment drive preceded the construction campaign. More than $73 million,  about 30% of that in pledges, had been raised to build a single theater by the  time the Center opened in 1986; the endowment began in 1982.)  </P> <P> However, as Center Chairman Henry T. Segerstrom explained recently, while the  building campaign went after cash, "the thrust of the (initial) endowment  campaign was in deferred gifts." The upside was that the various fund-raisers  didn't find themselves competing with each other. But the downside is an  endowment that today is mostly promises, not money in the bank.  </P> <P> Still, Eiteman and others gave the Center's current total endowment a good  rating. While cautioning that comparisons are tenuous, since community wealth  and other factors can vary so widely, Eiteman noted that the Center "is a new  organization and, in addition to start-up costs, it has been able to raise  certainly a fair amount of money. It's a good start, it's a good endowment."  </P> <P> So why, then, do Center officials want to raise more endowment cash? If the  endowment doesn't seem to be ailing, why not solicit money for other needs,  such as education programs or outreach to the under-served, for instance?  </P> <P> A larger cash endowment is a priority basically because it would relieve some  of that "never-ceasing" pressure of annual fund raising, Segerstrom said. He  added, though, that the Center's endowment is unrestricted; endowment funds may  be allocated for education or outreach, as the endowment grows.  </P> <P> The goal of the new campaign is to increase the endowment's cash assets to $12  million by the end of 1993. Segerstrom said that that would increase annual  endowment interest to at least $1 million a year by the end of 1993. Endowment  interest last year totaled $140,000, Center figures show.  </P> <P> Segerstrom said that in the long run -- three to five years from now -- a  larger cash endowment could also mean more "daring" programming, and could  allow the Center to produce more programming instead of importing events.  </P> <P> "The time to build your financial security is during those periods when your  operating results are good," Segerstrom said. "That's what we're trying to do."  Center officials say 1989 was a record year for attendance, that box office  revenue covered 83% of operating costs. Typically, about two-thirds of a  performing arts center's budget is covered by ticket sales, according to  officials.  </P> <P> Still, fund raising to support annual operations certainly won't halt just  because an endowment-cash campaign is under way. Is there potential now for  competition between the two funding drives -- the very thing the Center tried  to avoid during its construction phase? And construction may not be over. The  Center has announced tentative plans to build two new theaters by 1998.  Couldn't the new campaign mean competition when it comes time to seek new  building funds?  </P> <P> Segerstrom acknowledged that there are no easy answers. "That's a whole other  area and we simply haven't come to that," he said. "We would obviously precede  any further facility commitment by a very thorough analysis, a fund-raising  study, so we would have some assurance before anything was started that there  was a satisfactory donor base."  </P> <P> MAJOR AMERICAN PERFORMING ARTS CENTERS OPERATING ENDOWMENT COMPARISONS  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING ARTS CENTER  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $3.2 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $17 million  </P> <P> LINCOLN CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS, NEW YORK CITY  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $70 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $40 million  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $49 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $76 million  </P> <P> KENNEDY CENTER, WASHINGTON D.C.  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $24 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $54.6 million  </P> <P> TENNESSEE PERFORMING ARTS CENTER, NASHVILLE  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $9 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $5 million  </P> <P> KENTUCKY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS, LOUISVILLE  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $5 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: $5 million  </P> <P> BROOKLYN ACADEMY OF MUSIC  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $11 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: (No endowment)  </P> <P> PLAYHOUSE SQUARE CENTER, CLEVELAND  </P> <P> Endowments (Cash assets only): $9 million  </P> <P> Annual operating budget: (No endowment)  </P></p>

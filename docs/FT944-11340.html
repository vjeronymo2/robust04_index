			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / People (Names in the News): Dejouany lines up successor When French companies skip a generation, they often do it in style, writes Andrew Jack. Jean-Marie Messier, the heir apparent at Generale des Eaux, is almost exactly half the age of the incumbent. Guy Dejouany, chairman of the enormous French utilities and communications group which reported first half profits last month of FFr 1.26bn, is now 73 and has finally decided it is time to make plans for succession. Messier, a partner at Lazard Freres, the merchant bank, at 37 has considerable experience in his portfolio already. It seems that Dejouany has made the selection personally, although it has yet to be ratified. If all goes to plan, Messier will join the board soon after, probably in a role such as director general. Company sources suggest that Dejouany is not expected to retire for some time - perhaps not until 1996 - and will retain considerable power as 'president'. Dejouany's reputation is of an extraordinarily hard worker. He recently said to a friend: 'I must be getting old. I sometimes find that after 11 pm I get tired reading documents.' Born in Grenoble, Messier graduated from two of the most important schools - the Ecole Polytechniqe and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration - before becoming a member of the highly respected Inspecteurs des Finances. He was an adviser on prime minister Edouard Balladur's privatisation programme, became a partner at Lazard Freres aged 32, and in the past few months has built up a strong link with Generale des Eaux as its investment banker.</p>

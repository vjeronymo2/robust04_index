			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS GIFT TO THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> WHY THE FED SHOULD LOWER INTEREST RATES ANOTHER NOTCH  </P> <P> The economy is beginning to resemble a patient with many more ailments than any  one doctor can keep track of. The question seems not to be whether there will  be a recession but whether it will be a deep one and a long one. Predictions of  a severe economic winter are so commonplace that the rare economic optimist is  wisely staying indoors and keeping his curtains closed to avoid ridicule.  </P> <P> What must be kept in plain view through all the doom and gloom, however, is the  nation's ability to control its fate. To a greater extent than in the past, the  nation possesses the tools to try to direct the economy out of its current  malaise. One such tool involves lowering either the discount rate or the  federal funds rate. The latter was lowered a quarter point late last month.  </P> <P> Lowering either one would help.  </P> <P> It would help stimulate a lethargic economy, make new funds available to  investors and consumers and provide a welcome psychological boost. The argument  against a lowering is that it would contribute to inflationary pressures.  Indeed, the fear of fueling inflation is always one of the reasons, if not the  main reason, the Federal Reserve in recent years has held back and resisted  calls to lower interest rates.  </P> <P> That's the responsible posture, but in the current economic climate soaring  fuel costs are contributing to inflation, yet little else is. Alan Greenspan,  chairman of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, must understand that it  would be prudent to lower rates a quarter point. That won't cure the economy's  many ills, but it won't worsen the fever by denying needed and readily  available medication. Another quarter point downward would hardly be a euphoric  drop, but along with the previous quarter-point drop, it would suggest a trend  line of confidence and conviction.  </P></p>

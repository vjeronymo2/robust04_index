			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar weakens in late trading BOTH the dollar and sterling lost ground against the D-Mark in late European trading yesterday after a comparatively calm day on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. The US currency was steadier on Wednesday, rallying 65 basis points from the DM1.4000 level, and yesterday ventured as high as DM1.4173 in Europe. It was boosted by surprisingly good US employment data, with weekly jobless claims dropping 93,000 to 382,000, the lowest since October 1990. Forecasters had been expecting a figure of 405,000. The dollar later slipped, partly because investors had gone long of dollars in the morning in the hope of seeing it break through DM1.42 on the upside. Analysts said the US currency continued to be weakened by the lack of any chance of the dollar/D-Mark yield gap narrowing, and uncertainties over the US presidential election. It ended in London up nearly  1/2 pfennig at DM1.4105. In New York the dollar closed at DM1.4085. According to Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the market is showing signs that DM1.40 could be a firm bottom for the dollar. 'There has been no intervention today, but the market pushed the dollar up of its own accord,' he said. Some dealers said the dollar still looked wobbly. According to Mr Richard Crosby, head of forex trading at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, the market should have pushed the dollar up further following a comment from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that the Bundesbank should cut interest rates in the medium term. A slight rise in German inflation in August, to an annualised 3.5 per cent, may make it difficult for the German central bank to lower interest rates. The Bank of England did not intervene to support sterling yesterday but the currency showed signs of weakening late in the European afternoon. After reaching a high of DM2.7989 in the morning, it fell in the afternoon. At one stage it was at DM2.7880, only a pfennig from its permitted ERM floor. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International, said the DM2.79 support level may well crumble in the next few trading days. The pound finished  1/2 pfennig down on the day at DM2.7900. The Italian lira hit a record low of L764.70 against the D-Mark, compared to its ERM floor of L765.40. Some dealers have the habit of selling lire on Fridays because of fears that an Italian devaluation is most likely to come on a weekend. Italy continues to come under pressure to reverse its recent interest rate cut. The D-Mark's strength was clear from the EMS grid: it has jumped three places in three weeks to second position.</p>

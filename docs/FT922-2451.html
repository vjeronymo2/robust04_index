			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dutch cockle restrictions leave Hazlewood Foods flat PRE-TAX profits at Hazlewood Foods were flat at Pounds 51.3m, against Pounds 51.2m, in the year to end March, as restrictions on Dutch cockle fishing and a decision to sacrifice margins to boost sales volume offset gains from the acquisition of Sutherland last summer. The shares rose 3p to close at 150p. Mr Peter Barr, chairman, described the year as one of consolidation and predicted that the group was 'now poised for a period of steady earnings growth'. The 30 UK businesses had been grouped into seven trading areas, and a similar plan had been written for the continental European subsidiaries. Group sales rose 17 per cent to Pounds 632.4m, although Mr John Simons, finance director, said the underlying gain was 8 per cent, of which 2-3 percentage points were from price increases and the rest volume growth. Operating profits rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 60.2m, with margins down from 10.6 to 9.5 per cent. Sutherland, acquired for Pounds 36.7m in shares, was included for seven months and contributed profits of Pounds 3.5m, after financing costs. Its Pounds 16.8m of debt meant group borrowings rose to Pounds 109.7m (Pounds 81.9m), adding 10 percentage points to gearing at 69 per cent. The group more than covered its capital investment of Pounds 27.9m from internal cash flow. Interest charges rose from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 8.9m, with cover down from 9.1 to 6.7 times. A reduced tax rate of 27.7 per cent (28.5 per cent) but higher minorities of Pounds 577,000 (Pounds 447,000) left earnings per share down 4 per cent to 16.42p (17.13p). A final dividend of 3.9p is proposed to give a total of 6.1p (5.8p). Mr Simons said the restriction on cockle fishing in Dutch waters cost the group about Pounds 3m, of which Pounds 2.3m fell in the second half. The impact of lower margins in the meat, produce and fish businesses knocked Pounds 3.4m from profits. Operating profits from grocery fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 10.9m, but ready meals profits were up to Pounds 11.8m (Pounds 10.1m) and convenience foods, which includes most of Sutherland, from Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 5.8m. Profits from fish fell to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5.4m) and from shellfish to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 10.6m). Produce profits rose to Pounds 4.8m (Pounds 3.2m) and non-food profits were up from Pounds 3m to Pounds 4.6m. COMMENT Hazlewood was one of the highly acquisitive companies of the 1980s and has long needed the more coherent structure which is now beginning to take shape. That said, the group must prove itself as a quality growth stock, which will take rather longer. It is some 4 to 5 years behind Northern Foods, the company it considered bidding for in 1988. Not surprising, then, that its rating is well below its erstwhile target. However, a prospective p/e, on forecasts of Pounds 55m or so, of under 9 is discounting too much.</p>

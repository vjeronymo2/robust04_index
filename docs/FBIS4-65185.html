			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea report: "PSOE Executive Committee </F> Selects Almunia as New Parliamentary Group Spokesman"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- Joaquin Almunia, PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party] Secretary for Studies and Programs, was  selected yesterday as Socialist parliamentary group chairman and  spokesman, replacing Carlos Solchaga. His candidacy, supported  by Felipe Gonzalez, won the assent of the Socialist Federal  Executive Committee, which met at 1700 at the party's central  headquarters in Ferraz Street (Madrid). The Socialist group  will vote on the Executive Committee's proposal in plenary  session today. During yesterday's meeting, Extremadura Junta  [autonomous government] Premier Juan Carlos Rodriguez Ibarra  unsuccessfully championed Alfonso Guerra's alternative.    Gonzalez' aim in proposing Joaquin Almunia as Socialist  parliamentary group chairman was to have at his disposal a man  with considerable political influence in order to tackle the  difficult times experienced by the party. Solchaga's  replacement will have to contend with a very difficult  parliament for the Socialists, with a People's Party in the  middle of a political offensive, which has made the house the  center of its activity to oust the PSOE from power.    Almunia's debut will be tomorrow, Wednesday [11 May], in the  Congress plenary session at which Gonzalez will have to explain  the escape of former Civil Guard Director General Luis Roldan.  On that day, Almunia will already have the difficult task of  weathering the storm, which will undoubtedly worsen with the  speech by People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar.    The new Socialist group chairman will also have to bear the  brunt of the parliamentary negotiations with the Catalan and  Basque nationalists, very complex negotiations which will be  even more so following the 6 June [date as published] European  and Andalusian autonomous community elections.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Arts: 'Contrasts' on the South Bank For this week, the pianist Andras Schiff and the oboist Heinz Holliger devised a chamber music series - not, for once, billed as a 'festival' which is enjoying a brave success. Brave, because as the title 'Contrasts' delicately suggests, each programme offered a very mixed bag: not only a variety of pieces for different players, but ranging from slight (piano-duet marches by Beethoven) to substantial (Mozart's piano-and-wind quintet), and from Bach to brand-new music that would normally attract far smaller audiences. For the second concert, the premiere of a new wind quintet by Harrison Birtwistle was cancelled, in circumstances which remain obscure; but the first boasted two recent works by Elliott Carter. Inner Song, an oboe monody in memory of the composer Stefan Wolpe, was exquisitely played by Holliger. Meditative, lyrical and limpid, it sounded almost diatonic (a 'white-note' piece, so to speak), and served as a deceptive appetiser for the much tougher 1991 Quintet which ended the concert. This latter employs the same instruments as Mozart's transparent masterpiece, to which Carter professes a certain debt. That might go unremarked, for Carter's single, unbroken movement (some 24 minutes long) is darkly dramatic. Like other recent Carter, it explores a highly individual harmonic palette, more striking than the promised 'dialectic interplay' - until a late section in its sequence of high-profile contrasts, when the dialogue becomes furious and the clarinettist takes his E-flat instrument up to a shrieking climax. At the start, over sustained wind-chords, Schiff delivered the piano-rhetoric with stinging force. He stayed in that mode for most of the piece; I suspect that there is more to be discovered in his part, gentler tones and intimations. Still, the fierce lucidity of the Quintet was gripping. It will repay acquaintance, with dividends. The winds' contribution, here and everywhere, was exemplary. It was a particular pleasure to hear more of Radovan Vlatkovic, a rare visitor but one of the most musical horn players in the world. They all shone in Gyorgy Kurtag's early Wind Quintet, brilliantly economical, witty and passionate; and in a less remarkable but appealing Diptych by the late Sandor Veress. An unexpectedly fascinating piece came from Isang Yun, an ex-Korean composer who has found safe haven in Germany, where his music is more often heard than here. It was his trio Rondell (Holliger, Elmar Schmid's suave clarinet and Klaus Thunemann's ripe bassoon): seven coolly intense sections, only a couple of them quick, which develop inexorably and at last, with portamento slides, go into ritual Oriental keening. Quite haunting: I long to hear it again. Queen Elizabeth Hall. Sponsorship by Mrs Jackie Rosenfeld, London City Airport and Pro Helvetia; last concert September 19</p>

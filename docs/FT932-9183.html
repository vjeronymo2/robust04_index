			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Nokia to place preference shares abroad NOKIA, the Finnish electronics group, is planning to raise Dollars 100m in new capital through a placement of preference shares with international investors. The group said the funds would be used to strengthen its balance sheet and help it finance the rapid growth of its telecommunications and cellular phone businesses. This is the first international issue to be made by a leading Finnish company for several years and reflects a growing sense of confidence among the country's main exporters following the sharp depreciation of the markka. The issue is being made amid strong interest in Nokia's preferred shares, which have risen from FM82 to FM152 this year. It also comes as the group's core telecommunications and mobile phones businesses are performing strongly. Last year telecommunications increased sales by 73 per cent to FM3.21bn and mobile phones by 45 per cent to FM3.64bn as the group cut pre-tax losses to FM158m from FM324m. Mr Olli-Pekka Kalasvuo, Nokia's chief financial officer, said a new issue, priced in line with Nokia's current share price, would lead to a 6-7 per cent dilution. Shareholder approval for the issue will be sought at an extraordinary general meeting on June 10. Credit Suisse First Boston and Enskilda Securities are acting as advisers. Around 20 per cent of Nokia's shares are in international hands, following the relaxation of restrictions on foreign share ownership at the start of this year.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Fallacy of common-market exchange rates Sir, Professors Eichengreen and Wyplosz emphasise that 'if Europe fails to restore exchange rate stability it will fail to complete the single market' (Personal View, September 17). I do not know whether the common market will ever be 'completed', but it is perfectly clear that exchange rate stability, whatever that means, is not even a necessary, let alone sufficient, condition for a common market. From 1601 to 1844 England and Scotland enjoyed a common market, even economic union, yet the exchange rate of the various Scottish currencies fluctuated freely against the pound sterling. And today in North America, between Canada and the US, there is a close approximation to the ideal of a common market, soon to be 'completed', yet there is no fixed or pegged Canadian dollar to the greenback, nor has anyone suggested that the North American Free Trade Agreement requires pegged rates or a Namu (North American Monetary Union). Nor does the lack of stability of the Canadian dollar seem to have inhibited economic integration within North America. Canadian-US trade flows are the largest in the world. It is odd that Eichengreen and Wyplosz, in pursuit of a common market, propose to put taxes on capital movements within that market in order to defend pegged nominal exchange rates. Is the common market to be 'completed' by tariffs on capital? Alan Walters, AIG Trading Corporation, 1200 19th Street, NW, Suite 605, Washington DC20036, US</p>

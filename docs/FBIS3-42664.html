			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Kazakov: "Enterprises in China and Russia </F> Prefer to Trade Directly"; first paragraph MOSCOW NEWS comment]    [Text] In 1992 trade turnover between the two countries  reached a record high of 5,862 million dollars, exceeding by  50.2 percent the corresponding indicator of 1991, and by  one-third the maximum volume of Soviet-Chinese trade in 1990.    A vigorous dash was made by Russian exporters who increased  by 69.4 percent the sale to the PRC of different goods; 53.8  percent of which consisted of raw materials and semifinished  items and 46.2 percent--machines and equipment. During a year  Russian import from China increased by 28.1 percent, the share  of industrial consumer goods comprising 55.5 percent. Russia's  favourable balance of trade stood at 1.2 billion dollars.    In the framework of direct trade contacts about 60 percent  of  the deals are in the nature of barter operations of the "Russian  raw materials, plant and equipment for Chinese foodstuffs and  consumer goods" type. Quite often the latter are dear in price  and low in quality whereas in the stucture of Russia's  "barterized" export there has been an increase in the share of  "hard currency" goods which are sold on prices below world  prices. This has produced a certain price inequivalence in  favour of the Chinese partners.    The Russian side is represented by a large variety of  enterprises and firms (about 1,300 juridical persons) whereas  the Chinese side (to the extent of 80 percent) by a mere three  large-scale enterprises--the Heilongjiang Foreign Trade Company  and the border trade companies of the "open" cities of Heihe and  Suifunhe. In fact border trade boils down to the barter exchange  of rolled metal and mineral fertilizers from Russia (65 percent  of export) for ready-made products of the light and textile  industry (62 percent of import) from China.    It is through border channels that Chinese firms "try the  keys" to Russian raw materials, buying them on low prices and  often bypassing quota-licenced state regulation.    Beijing's official governmental quarters have voiced an  opinion that the export of Russian raw materials has been  considerably facilitated through the CIS countries. This is  assisted by customs benefits when taking goods out of Russia  into the CIS states, as well as by the actual absence of real  customs control on Russia's borders with new neighbouring  countries. Quite often two sets of commodity-accompanying  documents are registered for the same commodity: at Russia's  custom house the commodity passes as a mutual delivery of the  enterprises of Russia and CIS countries, and on the border of  CIS states, with China--as Russia's transit export cargo. In  1992, even as assessed by Chinese experts, 100 million dollars'  worth of duly undeclared cargoes was taken out of Russia to  China.    As far as state-to-state trade relations are concerned, at  present they are regulated by the trade agreement of May 5,  1992, and the technical inter-bank agreement of November 27,  1992. In keeping with the latter, every form of payment, being  determined in contracts by the buyer and seller, is permitted.  Moreover, all settlements with the PRC are carried out solely in  freely convertible currency (with the exception of credit  operation). Specifically, China has granted Russia two commodity  credits, while Russia has extended to China a credit for the  construction with Russian participation of a nuclear power plant  and a uranium-enrichment installation. State-to-state agreements  and clearing settlements are used as the basis for exporting  complete sets of equipment (mainly power industry equipment) and  special facilities to China and to import consumer goods and  foodstuffs (on applications from Russian plants supplying  complete sets of equipment and special facilities). Moreover,  the Chinese have cancelled all taxes on Russia's export and  import.    Russia's Trade With China in the First Half-year of 1993 (min dollars)   TRADE TURNOVER                             1,994.2   Export                                     1,240.6   Chemical goods                             48.3   Mineral fertilizers                        100.5   Metals and metalware                       371.6   Transport facilities                       207.4   Aviation equipment                         44.8   Motor transport                            148.8   Import                                     753.6   Clothes                                    158   Footwear                                   37.3   Sugar and confectionery                    94.5   Cereals                                    14.5   Alcoholic beverages and soft drinks        2.5   Source: State Committee of the RF for  Statistics      In the foreseeable future a major aspect of Russian-Chinese  cooperation will evidently consist in the organization of border  checkpoints, the construction of railroads, highways and bridge  overpasses on the basis of Russian road-building equipment and  Chinese manpower; the establishment of JVs in the sphere of  river, sea and automobile transportations; shipbuilding and ship  repair; the creation of a Russian-Chinese nonstate-owned air  company, as well as the construction of the Metro planned in  Harbin. In the PRC's north-eastern provinces, where many  enterprises were built in the 1950s with assistance from the  USSR, there is a need to renew plant and equipment and the  machine-tool fleet by 7-8 percent annually. The enterprises are  interested in importing machines and equipment and assembly from  the CIS even for hard cash because this is much cheaper than  their import from Japan and other developed countries.    To accelerate the development of North-East China, it is  vitally important to have electric power the deficit of which is  estimated at 20 percent. Therefore along with increasing the  export of electricity from Buryatia, the Urkutsk and Chita  regions, it is advisable to continue expanding cooperation in  the construction of thermal power stations and nuclear power  plants, and the corresponding infrastructure.    The talks held in August 1993 between G. Fadeyev, Russia's  Minister of Railways, and his Chinese counterpart, Han Zhubin,  demonstrated the sides' mutual concern for the solution of one  of the most pressing problems of Russian-Chinese  cooperation--that of transport. The Russian side suggested using  our country's fleet of railway cars on China's roads and  expanding the use of large-capacity containers. According to  available estimates, up to 7,000 cars become accumulated from  the Russian side in the areas of Manchuria-Zabaikalsk and  Suifanhe-Grodekovo alone due to their shortage in China. But in  1993 alone the volume of shipments needed to ensure mutual trade  comprised six million tons. In China up to 70 percent of all  cargoes are delivered by rail, and therefore closer coordination  in this sphere amounts to an exceedingly important factor of  economic cooperation between the two countries.</p>

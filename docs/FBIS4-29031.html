			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government is devising a strong punitive and retaliatory  strategy against possible military provocation by North Korea in  case the UN Security Council slaps economic sanctions on  Pyongyang, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae said Wednesday.    Speaking at a meeting of Democratic Liberal Party lawmakers  and local chapter chairmen, Yi said North Korea had completed  war preparations by July 27, 1993, stockpiling military supplies  and expanding and strengthening underground facilities after  forming a separate war preparation command.    Yi said, however, there were no particular signs of North  Korean military movements related to possible provocation at  present.    The government is strengthening the country's military  preparedness in stages while drawing up joint defense strategy  with the U.S. Forces, Yi said.    He also said that North Korea is believed to have extracted  enough plutonium to make one or two nuclear weapons. Although  it is not certain if the North has a complete nuclear bomb, he  said he could not rule out the possibility of Pyongyang having  developed a primitive explosive device.    With regard to military cooperation between the United  States  and South Korea in case of North Korean provocation, Yi said he  and his U.S. counterpart are in constant contact through a hot  line. Moreover, he said the two countries are ready to hold  urgent security and military conferences in times of emergency.</p>

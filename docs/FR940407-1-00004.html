			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> An exemption application for persons who produce or import less than 200,000 pounds annually for fresh market to be exempt from assessments and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of respondents completing this application would be 600, each submitting one response per year, with an estimated average burden of 15 minutes per response. The changes in exemption level and character of the lime industry would reduce the number of respondents filing this application from 680 to 600;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A referendum ballot to be used not later than 30 months after assessments begin under the amended Order and periodically thereafter to indicate whether producers and importers favor continuance of the Order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of respondents completing this ballot would be 85, each submitting one response approximately every five years, or an annual average of 10 respondents, with an estimated average reporting burden of 15 minutes per response. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of respondents completing this ballot from 325 to 85;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A nominee background statement form for Board member and alternate positions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two nominees would be nominated for each open position on the Board. The estimated number of respondents completing this form would be 28 during the first year of Order operations, and approximately eight per year thereafter, with an estimated average reporting burden of 30 minutes per response. The change in the composition of the Board would reduce the number of respondents completing this form from 44 to 28; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A requirement to maintain records sufficient to verify reports submitted under the Order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The estimated number of persons required to comply with this requirement would be 70, each of whom will have an estimated annual burden of seven minutes. The change in exemption level would reduce the number of recordkeepers from 350 to 70.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1990 Act was enacted on November 28, 1990, for the purpose of establishing an orderly procedure for the development and financing of an effective and coordinated program of research, promotion, and consumer information to strengthen the domestic and foreign markets for limes. The Order required by the 1990 Act became effective on January 27, 1992 (57 FR 2985), after notice and comment rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In March 1992 the Department of Agriculture (Department) conducted nomination meetings to nominate lime producers and importers for appointment to the Board. The Board members were appointed by the Secretary in September 1992, and the Board conducted its first meeting at the Department in Washington, DC in October 1992. During the course of this meeting, the Board and the Department concluded that a technical amendment was needed to cover seedless rather than seeded limes. Consequently, full implementation of the Order was delayed until the enactment of such technical amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1993 Act contained the necessary technical amendment to cover seedless limes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus latifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) rather than seeded limes ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus aurantifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) under the Order. The 1993 Act also provided for (1) increasing the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; (2) terminating the initial Board; (3) changing the size and composition of the Board; and (4) delaying the initial referendum date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This proposed rule invites comments on amending the Order to reflect the provisions of the 1993 Act. The Act, as amended, will (1) revise the definition of the term ``lime'' from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus aurantifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus latifolia <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ; (2) increase the exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000; (3) alter the size, composition, and term of office of the Board; and (4) make conforming changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule would change the definition of the ``lime'' from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus aurantifolia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (seeded lime) to  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> citrus latifolia  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (seedless lime) in &sect;1212.5 of the Order. Although the intent of the Act was to cover seedless limes, the definition of ``lime'' in &sect;1953(6) of the 1990 applied only to seeded limes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule would increase the producer and importer exemption level from less than 35,000 pounds annually to less than 200,000 pounds annually. This revised exemption level was reached through industry consensus. Therefore, this rule would change references to 35,000 pounds in &sect;&sect;1212.65, 1212.68, and 1212.69 of the Order to 200,000 pounds. In addition, a new paragraph (d) has been added to &sect;1212.68 of the Order whereby exempt importers may obtain a refund of assessments collected by the U.S. Customs Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, this rule would change the size of the Board from 11 members to seven. The Board is currently composed of seven producer members, three importer members, and their alternates. The public member position is currently vacant. This action would decrease the number of producer members from seven to three, which would more fairly reflect the current structure of the lime industry. Therefore, &sect;&sect;1212.30, 1212.32, and 1212.34 of the Order would be revised to make these changes in the Board's composition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule would also change the Board's composition in &sect;1212.30(b) relative to representation of producer and importer members within the two districts established under the Order. District 1 includes the States east of the Mississippi River, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. District 2 includes the States west of the Mississippi River. Currently, the Order provides for six producer members and one importer member and their alternates from District 1, and one producer member and two importer members and their alternates from District 2. This action would reduce the number of producer members from District 1 from six to two by revising section 1212.30 of the Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Company News: Frontier Airlines in plan to fly again Frontier Airlines looks like becoming the first of three defunct US airlines to start flying again under plans drawn up by its former managers. It is seeking to raise Dollars 6.9m net through a public share offering with the aim of relaunching air services from its former base in Denver, Colorado, this summer. Last week, another defunct carrier, Eastern Airlines, outlined a plan to emerge from bankruptcy and restart services using 14 airliners from bases in Atlanta, Indianapolis and Philadelphia, but it has yet to raise the necessary funds. Meanwhile, a group of investors has bought the rights to the Pan Am trademarks with the aim of resurrecting Pan American World Airways. The group plans to operate the company as an umbrella organisation for other carriers wanting to use the Pan Am name. The plans, however, are still at an early stage. Frontier ran into financial troubles in the mid-1980s and went bankrupt in 1986 after an unsuccessful attempt at a rescue by People Express, the no-frills carrier. Shortly afterwards, People Express succumbed to a takeover by Texas Air. The new Frontier Airlines has been formed by the president and other key executives of the old company. The company is offering 1.8m ordinary shares at Dollars 4.25 each and 1.8m redeemable warrants at Dollars 0.25 each. Net proceeds of the offer will pay for the airline's launch and for working capital after the start-up.</p>

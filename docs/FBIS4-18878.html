			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Germany and Ukraine intend to extend  and intensify their military cooperation further. This was  agreed by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU], and his Ukrainian counterpart, Vitaliy  Radetski in Bonn on Monday [11 April]. They signed a joint  declaration to this effect: The Bundeswehr and the Ukrainian  Army intend to cooperate intensively mainly on restructuring the  armed forces, training of recruits, guiding personnel, and arms  control.    The declaration notes that the "successfully initiated  cooperation at different levels" should continue. Ruehe started  the security policy dialogue with Kiev during his visit last  August. With his Ukrainian guest he discussed the design of the  European security structure, the hot spots of the world, and  cooperation between Kiev and NATO. Ukraine is one of the 14  East European countries that have meanwhile opted for close  military and political cooperation with the Western alliance in  connection with NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative.    In their declaration, the ministers emphasize that "their  joint objective is the consolidation of peace, stability, and  security in the Euro-Atlantic area within the framework of the  all-European process." Both sides concur "that under the  current conditions creating and maintaining good relations  between their countries is an essential factor for strengthening  peace, stability, and security in Europe." Bonn and Kiev  express their readiness "to contribute to this process through  intensifying comprehensive relations in the military sphere and  through making them transparent and predictable."    Radetski is due to visit the 31st Fighter Bomber Air Wing  "Boelcke" at Noervenich, and the 19th Armored Infantry Brigade  and the 203d Tank Battalion at Hemer.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OUSTED SCHOOL CHIEF MAY GET $120,000;  </P> <P> BUENA PARK BOARD AGREES TO PAYMENTS IF EX-SUPERINTENDENT FINDS NO JOB IN 1 YEAR  </P> <P> The Buena Park School District Board of Trustees has agreed to pay ousted Supt.  Richard F. Cochran up to $120,000, but only if he fails to find another job in  the next year.  </P> <P> The unusual terms of the buyout of Cochran's contract followed disclosure that  he collected one year of severance pay from a prior job during his first year  on the job in Buena Park, according to a lawyer for the district.  </P> <P> The reason for Cochran's dismissal was not disclosed. He had been placed on  paid leave in May, when his three-year contract came up for a regularly  scheduled review.  </P> <P> "If he had received a satisfactory evaluation then, the contract would have  been extended," said Spencer Covert, a Santa Ana attorney who is representing  the board. "I'm not at liberty to discuss the underlying reasons for this  agreement," he said.  </P> <P> The board agreed to pay Cochran, 50, superintendent since July, 1987, his  regular $70,000 through July, 1990, plus another $50,000 if he fails to find  another job by that time. Cochran's contract with the district guaranteed him  his job through July, 1991.  </P> <P> Covert said it was "not atypical" to buy out the last year of a  superintendent's contract.  </P> <P> Board members declined to explain the termination, except to say that it was a  confidential "personnel matter" between employer and employee.  </P> <P> "Everyone has been very closemouthed about the situation," said Joyce Wills,  president of the Buena Park Teachers Assn. "None of the employees knew what was  going on."  </P> <P> Board member Lloyd G. Davis said the agreement requires board members to refer  questions about the reasons for Cochran's dismissal to Covert, the board  attorney.  </P> <P> This is the second time that a school district has paid Cochran not to work.  </P> <P> The first time was in June, 1987, when the board of the Murray School District  in Alameda County bought out the final year of Cochran's contract for $65,000,  only to see him begin work the next week for Buena Park at a salary of $66,000  a year.  </P> <P> Covert said the new agreement is carefully worded to end payments to Cochran if  he gets another job or fails to report that he is a finalist for another  position in the 1989-90 school year.  </P> <P> Of the overlapping salaries that Cochran drew in 1987-88, Patricia Ferreira, a  board member of the Murray School District, said he "used innocence at both  ends to his advantage to draw a double salary. . . . The usual situation is  that one job is resigned."  </P> <P> Neither Cochran nor his attorney, Charles Field of Riverside, could be reached  for comment Thursday.  </P> <P> Jack Townsend, formerly an assistant superintendent, has served as acting  superintendent of the district, which has almost 4,000 students in kindergarten  through eighth grade.  </P></p>

N. Antonyuk, K. A. Bronnikov, V. N.

No group  of researchers in the past decade has been able to go beyond the  CODATA error of 10[.sup]-4[/], and three of the four  determinations made of the absolute value of G are  not in agreement in terms of measurement error. Sanders and  Deeds's method, which achieved a level of 10[.sup]-6[/] in  1992, was based on observation of the motion of two bodies of  different mass within a blow-free satellite, with use of a  horseshoe trajectory, i.e., the lighter object (the particle),  lower than the heavier object, catches up with it, interacts,  goes to a higher orbit, and then falls behind in orbital motion.  The researchers here propose a method that salvages the  advantages of Sanders and Deeds's and adds another: it relies on  a precise solution for the points of equilibrium points of the  particle in the overall field of the Earth and the libration  points. Accuracy of measurement of G can be increased  by two orders of magnitude. Figures 2, references 6 (Russian).</p>

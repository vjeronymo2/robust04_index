			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Loan protection needed Sir, The news of Bridget O'Brien's important victory in the House of Lords on Thursday is heartening. More than seven years ago Mrs O'Brien was asked to sign a charge over her home so her husband could obtain a business loan from Barclays Bank. Her husband told her that he was applying for Pounds 60,000 when in fact he borrowed Pounds 154,000, and she was never seen by any bank employee nor were the legal implications explained to her. When the bank called in the overdraft which would have led to the loss of her home, Mrs O'Brien took her case to court and lost. When she won on appeal, Barclays took the case to the Lords. The Law Lords decided today that creditors should not be able to call in loans where they have not taken reasonable steps to ensure that spouses have had independent legal advice. There are many other women in similar situations. This scenario is a clear example of the need for a new Banking Act stating clearly customers' and borrowers' rights, and instituting an independent regulatory body for the banks. Whether the government brings forward such a bill in next month's Queen's Speech will be a test of their true commitment to citizens' rights.

			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo Increasing bearishness on the Tokyo stock market supported government bond prices last week, and the yield on the 10-year benchmark bond fell 21 basis points to close the week at 4.495 per cent. Traders were also encouraged by comments from the Bank of Japan following the release of the Tankan - the quarterly survey of business sentiment - and statements by the Economic Planning Agency emphasising the fragile nature of the recovery. Although concern over profit-taking and over-supply persists, traders expect the continued weakness of the stock market and low inflation data to prompt bond buying by institutional investors. Another likely support for bonds is the currency. Worries in the US over rising inflation is likely to prompt selling of the dollar, in turn lifting the yen. A high yen, which leads to lower corporate profits and lower import inflation, is likely to give the bond market a brief boost. However, traders say fluctuations in the futures market do not provide evidence of a rally in the near term. 'A move above Y109 would be required before the chart would look bullish, and such a move over the next week may not be forthcoming, given that there could still be some selling ahead of half-end book closings,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo.</p>

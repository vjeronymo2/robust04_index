			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The German bond market is faced by a double uncertainty at home and abroad which should keep yields high in coming weeks. The main concern is over the timing and extent of rises in US interest rates, with anxiety heightened by Friday's lower unemployment figures. 'The Fed's hesitation in lifting interest rates in a period of dynamic economic growth stirs inflation fears,' said Mr Jurgen Bokr of BHF Trust. Once US rates do go up, he added, and the spread between US and German 10-year government bond yields widens a little further, 'the yield on German long-dated bonds may well fall below the 7 per cent mark again in the first quarter of 1995'. Last week, they were around 7.6 per cent. Before they can start drifting down again, the market will also have to be more relaxed about German fiscal and thus monetary policy. The re-elected Bonn government's slim majority has unsettled capital market confidence in its commitment to rein back spending growth. The Bundesbank - whose council meets this week, but is expected to leave interest rates unchanged - also wants to see inflation fall further and M3 growth to ease substantially. 'We need a better overview before we can decide whether our central bank interest rates remain appropriate,' Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's president, said on Friday.</p>

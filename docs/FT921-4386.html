			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): By-election defeat brings Nikkei closer to 20,000 Tokyo THE RULING Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) defeat in an upper-house by-election in northern Japan led to political uncertainty yesterday, and share prices declined on selling by corporations and investment trusts, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index closed 195.31 lower at 20,797.68 after opening at the day's high of 20,989.78 and reaching a low of 20,696.06. Volume shrank to 180m shares from Friday's 250m. Declines outnumbered advances by 772 to 191, with 145 issues unchanged. The Topix index fell 18.02 to 1,502.43, the lowest level since November 1986, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.63 to 1,141.94. Investor confidence deteriorated following the loss of the LDP candidate in the House of Councillors' by-election in the Miyagi prefecture over the weekend. The result led to pessimism about additional by-elections scheduled for this month and for April, and about the upper house elections to be held in July. Last Friday's decline on Wall Street and a weaker yen were other factors discouraging market participants. Institutions also refrained from trading ahead of this Friday's March future contract settlement. Traders said investors were unsettled by the possibility of the Nikkei falling below the critical 20,000 level. 'Investors are more cautious as the index approaches 20,000, since it is an important technical point,' commented Mr Chris Newton at James Capel. A total of 182 issues hit their lows since the beginning of 1991, including Nippon Steel, off Y10 at Y321. Corporate investors, which had been leading buyers of large-capital blue chips, continued to liquidate holdings ahead of the March year-end book closing. Foreign investors, reducing exposure to high-technology issues on earnings concern, were seen selling Matsushita Electric Industrial, which fell Y40 to Y1,270. Bio-technology related stocks, active last week on trading by short-term investors, lost ground on profit-taking. Okamoto Industries, the leading prophylactic maker, which had been in favour because of its link with the Aids prevention theme, retreated Y40 to Y1,240, and Mochida Pharmaceutical shed Y70 to Y3,930. Fujisawa Pharmaceutical ended Y70 up at Y1,360 after a day's high of Y1,440, rising on rumours that the company's immuno-supressant drug was effective in combating the HIV virus. In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 311.19 to 22,319.18 in volume of 84.2m shares. The index fell on small-lot selling, while activity centred on cross-trading by investors looking to lock in profits ahead of the year-end book closing. Roundup RELIEVING the gloom in the region yesterday were Bombay and, to a lesser extent, Seoul. BOMBAY resumed trading after a five-day break, and the BSE index set yet another record high as it jumped 74.83 or 2.2 per cent to 3,547.61. The market had closed to enable brokers to complete pending settlements amid rumours of payment defaults, following a three-day gain of 22 per cent after the budget on February 29. Brokers said volume was low, but that buying pressure focused on shares whose weighting in the index is relatively high. SEOUL saw gains in large manufacturing stocks as the composite index put on 3.53 to 628.02 in turnover of Won264.8bn. The rally was led by Hyundai subsidiaries, many of which soared to their daily limit highs, as the political initiative by Chung Ju-yung, Hyundai's founder, seemed to be gaining public acceptance. HONG KONG fell again in thin trading, dragged down by persistent rumours that HSBC Holdings, parent company of Hongkong Bank, will announce a rights issue with its results today. The Hang Seng index closed 60.27 or 1.3 per cent lower at 4,848.63 following Friday's 55-point decline, and turnover contracted from HKDollars 2.29bn to HKDollars 1.83bn. HSBC topped the active list and finished HKDollars 1.25 down at HKDollars 41.25. SINGAPORE saw negative sentiment spill over from last week as the Straits Times Industrial index fell 16.10 to 1,429.65 in turnover up from SDollars 77.4m to SDollars 86.0m. Profit-taking, mixed corporate results and concern over Singapore's economic growth prospects were all said to have affected sentiment. NEW ZEALAND was depressed by Carter Holt plans to raise about NZDollars 400m through a rights issue, in addition to spinning off its seafood unit to strengthen its financial position. Carter Holt dropped 18 cents to NZDollars 2.22 and the NZSE-40 index fell 14.59 to 1,445.89. AUSTRALIA suffered its fifth consecutive fall, the All Ordinaries index closing 6.5 lower at 1,598.2. A holiday in Melbourne diminished interest, and turnover thinned from ADollars 181m to ADollars 117m. TAIWAN reported dumping of bank shares as the weighted index sank 63.50 to 4,923.03, after a decline of only 1.55 on Saturday. Investors were afraid that banks would be depressed by hectic sales in upcoming sessions as investors raised cash for the government's public offering of 160m shares in the International Commercial Bank of China. BANGKOK was led down by real estate issues and blue chips as the SET index fell 10.03 to 797.62. Turnover was Bt3.98bn, its lowest in a month.</p>

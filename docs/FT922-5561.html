			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Property woes hurt Barclays STORM CLOUDS continued to gather over Barclays, the high street clearer most heavily exposed to the enormous debts facing the property industry. The anticipated effect on the bank's annual profits prompted securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew to cut its 1992 profits forecast by a third yesterday. Barclays shares, which had already fallen by 25p over the past week, ended 5 lower at 369p after 3.9m traded. UBS pared its pre-tax figure to Pounds 400m from Pounds 600m, moving from around the top of the range of analysts' estimates to the bottom, below even bearish County NatWest, which is on Pounds 475m. However, it maintained its hold recommendation and forecast a flat 21.2p dividend. Steel retreats Worries that British Steel might pass its final dividend depressed the shares in heavy turnover of 14m. Citing the poor demand for steel, continued price weakness, and the consequent effect on revenue, Mr Ian Lowe at Smith New Court said: 'The market has a 50-50 chance of getting no final dividend in our view.' With the company due to report full-year results next month, there was also talk in the market that a serious discussion about the presentation of the figures was taking place at British Steel. Smith is predicting a loss of around Pounds 100m for the year to March 1992. Nomura is on a similar amount, but expects a final dividend of about 1.5p. The shares finished 5 cheaper at 77 1/2 p. Vodafone sold Sellers were active in Vodafone, which recorded the second biggest turnover of the day among the FT-SE constituents, as some investors reflected on the implications for cellular valuations following the merger of two big US telecoms groups on Wednesday. The Dollars 2.85bn deal between Centel and Sprint values the former's cellular per population at Dollars 40 - compared with a rating of around Dollars 105 for Vodafone. This had caused some US investors to re-evaluate Vodafone, according to market talk, and prompted a bout of selling in the shares, which declined 10 to 384p in turnover of 13m. Figures from Cable and Wireless subsidiary Hong Kong Telecom were in line with expectations but failed to stop the shares sliding, which left many commentators perplexed and blaming erroneous rumours. HK Telecom provides C and W with some 60 per cent of its profits. A story that Kleinwort Benson, a strong bull of C and W, had downgraded the group filtered into the market early on and immediately depressed the shares. The story was dismissed by Kleinwort as rubbish, analyst Mr Tim Hurst reiterating the broker's positive stance on the stock. There was also some talk of worries over the regulatory situation in Hong Kong, but little evidence to sustain it. Turnover in C and W was a poor 2.6m. The shares, down to 569p at one stage, finished a net 13 off at 575p. Conglomerate BAT Industries rose sharply after a confident statement about expected 1992 profits and dividend payout at the company's annual meeting. The shares are never very heavily traded and a shortage of stock among some dealers ensured that the price was squeezed up 22 to 807p. Warnings of a lowered rating prompted British Gas to fall 5 to 259p on turnover of 9.1m shares. Credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service said it may lower the AAA long-term ratings of British Gas, and subsidiary debt guaranteed by the parent. Oils were down again after profit-takers moved in following the recent sharp gains that reflected the rise in the price of Brent crude. Lasmo was additionally hurt by a profits forecast cut from BZW. The investment bank also argued that Lasmo would reduce its dividend and, although the revision follows a sharp downgrade last week by SG Warburg, the shares fell 6 to 207p. Exploration Co of Louisiana was firm at 85p on the back of an in-depth buy recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite, the company's broker. Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome retreated in early trading after news of competition in Canada for its Aids drug Retrovir. The rival version is to be sold at a big discount to Retrovir. Although analysts said there could be pricing implications outside Canada, they pointed out that Retrovir's Canadian market is miniscule. The shares were off 16 at one point but volume was small and the stock was later marked up. The announcement of a co-promotion agreement for a Zovirax brand to treat chicken pox also helped sentiment. .Wellcome closed 3 off at 985p. An upbeat meeting on satisfactory results failed to stop Thorn EMI sliding 10 to 835p. South West, one of the first water companies to report son, declined 9 to 437p as investors took the slightly higher than expected dividend growth of 8.5 per cent and then sold the shares. Analysts said the price drop represented a special ex-dividend situation and did not indicate disappointment with the company's results, as profits rose to Pounds 90m from Pounds 88.2m. Laporte rose 9 to 632p, dealers focusing on the Pounds 2m a year saving from job cuts. The first day's full trading in Industrial Control Services saw the shares placed at 110p and leap to 149p. Turnover was 6.2m shares. The market was pleased at the lack of a seasonal price campaign from leading supermarket groups, and also suggested that profits should improve during the summer on higher margin products, such as meat, fruit and vegetables. Tesco rose 9 1/2 to 273p ahead of today's annual meeting, which analysts generally believe will be upbeat, while J. Sainsbury climbed 7 1/2 to 465p. Oil manufacturer Acatos &amp; Hutcheson was the main mover in the food manufacturing sector, surging 23 to 120p after reporting an unexpected 29 per cent rise in half-year profits and higher interim divided. Guinness gained 13 to 589p, recovering all of the loss suffered on Wednesday on a gloomy annual statement, as marketmakers remained generally optimistic about the company's prospects. Increasing concern about rising oil prices, and negative sentiment after Goldman Sachs turned bearish on international airlines, left British Airways 6 lighter at 294p.

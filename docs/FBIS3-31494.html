Under the proposal submitted by seven deputies from the  Assembly for the Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party  (SPR-RSC) the Czech Parliament should remain one-chamber. The  Constitution provides for a two-chamber parliament consisting of  the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate which has not yet been  filled. It is expected that senatorial elections would be held  this autumn.    SPR-RSC Deputy Miroslav Kasparek, who gave the reasons for  the proposal, said his party had proceeded from the conviction  that the Senate could not fulfill its function envisaged by the  Constitution. Already during the first Czechoslovak Republic of  President Tomas Garrigue Masaryk the Senate was criticized as a  "layer" for elderly politicians who were already incapable of  fulfilling their duties in parliament. He said the  establishment of the Senate was not aimed at dividing power but  at its ever more concentration "in the hands of one party."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Hanya (1728 3352 0068) from the State Planning </F> Commission Institute of Investment Research: "Analysis and  Forecast of the 1994 Investment Trend in Fixed Assets"]    [Text] I. Estimation and Calculation of a Rational  Scale for China's 1994 Investment in Fixed Assets    Investment in fixed assets is a major aspect of the use of  national income. During a certain economic development period,  in order to guarantee the sustained and steady development of  the national economy, investment in fixed assets should be kept  within a certain scale, namely within a rational scale.  <H5>  1. The lower limit of the rational scale. </H5>   There are mainly two factors deciding the minimum scale of  fixed assets investment. First is the investment used to  compensate for the depreciation of fixed assets to maintain the  scale of simple reproduction. According to State Statistics  Bureau data, and taking into consideration the effect of prices  on the replenishment of fixed assets, we estimate the 1994 fixed  assets investment needed to compensate for depreciation to be  approximately 290 billion yuan. The second factor is the capital  input to be put in place in 1994 so that projects which began  construction during the past few years can be successfully  completed and put into production. This is estimated at  approximately 790 billion yuan. The sum of the two, 1.08  trillion yuan, is the rational lower limit of 1994 fixed assets  investment volume.  <H5>  2. The upper limit of the rational scale. </H5>   The principle for deciding the maximum rational scale is to  not cause too much pressure on the national economy and people's  living standards. The upper limit to the investment scale is  resources which come from national production and income.  Because of the large scale increase in China's fixed assets  investment during the past two years, the productive fixed  assets which can be inputted for use in 1994 has increased 14.3  percent over 1993. Theoretically, one might infer that if all  these fixed assets could be used efficiently, the 1994 GDP would  increase by 14.3 percent. However, due to various reasons, the  GDP increase will be slightly lower. According to our  estimates, if efficiency is high, it is possible to reach 13  percent, as in 1993. Since 1981, the average growth of China's  GDP has been 9.5 percent and the average investment growth,  according to comparable prices, has been 14.7 percent, or  1.55-times the former. If one extrapolates according to this  ratio, the investment growth in 1994 could reach 20 percent,  that is, the investment increase in terms of physical quantity  could reach 1.42 trillion yuan. According to forecasts, the  1994 investment price index will be around 10 percent. That  being the case, the currency investment volume, according to the  current year's prices, will reach 1.56 trillion yuan. This,  then, is the rational upper limit of the 1994 investment scale.  <H5>  3. The appropriate scale for 1994. </H5>   According to the above analysis, it can be seen that China's  1994 fixed assets investment scale should be controlled between  1.08 and 1.56 trillion yuan to guarantee the smooth development  of the economy and avoid major problems. However, this does not  mean that every point within the rational range is suitable for  the economic development of China at the current stage. From an  optimizing perspective, within this rational range there should  be an optimal point. The closer we are to this point, the  closer we are to an investment scale most suitable to China's  economic development. This optimal point has to be decided  according to the concrete situation in China's current  development.    Seen from the growing trend of fixed assets investment  during  recent years, because of improvement and rectification, in 1989  and 1990 the investment growth was actually negative and the  1988 level was only regained in 1991. The rapid growth in 1992  still showed certain features of a recovery. People did not  feel any economic tension until close to the end of the year  because of the substantial accumulation of both material and  manpower resources during the previous few years of low-speed  growth. The continued growth in 1993, on the other hand,  belonged to real high-speed growth, especially since, after the  high-speed growth of 1992, material resource accumulation had  become low and almost everything relied on the current year's  production and imports. This led to rapid price raises for  capital goods and triggered price raises in some consumer goods,  causing a rather tight situation in the whole national economy.    The year 1994 came after the rapid growth of 1992 and 1993.  The 1993 investment growth, in particular, made China's  investment rate (fixed assets investment of the whole  society/GNP) reach as high as 37.8 percent in 1994. This is the  highest investment rate since China's reform and opening to the  outside world began (see Table 1) and is also very rare abroad.  Only Japan, during its high-speed growth of the 1970's,  exceeded this rate for one year (1973) (see Table 2).

In terms of economic power it is comparable to Japan  in the early 1960's. According to China's situation, and taking  foreign experience as a reference, the investment rate is most  suitable between 33 and 35 percent. After the high-speed growth  of fixed assets investment during 1992 and 1993, China's  national economy was already over-stretched, and it was  necessary to slightly relax it in 1994. At the same time,  taking into consideration the fact that China's economy is still  of the investment-propelled type, without a certain amount of  investment growth, stagflation will occur and affect the  continuous steady development of the entire economy. Therefore,  the 1994 investment rate must not drop too much from 1993.  After making some calculations, we believe that the most  suitable investment rate for 1994 would be if we took the mean  of 1992 and 1993, namely, to be controlled at around 35 percent.  Based on national economic development plans, China's 1994 GNP  at the current year's prices will reach 3.76 trillion yuan.  According to a 35 percent investment rate, the scale of fixed  assets investment should be controlled at around 1.316 trillion  yuan, which is close to the middle point (1.32 trillion yuan) of  the above defined rational range, with an increase of 10 percent  over last year.  <H5>  II. Forecast of Investment Scale Which May Actually Be </H5> Reached in 1994    In 1994, the scale which China's fixed assets investment may  actually reach will be mainly determined by three factors: One  is the objective need, two is the resource supply capability,  and three is the state macroeconomic regulation and control.    In terms of objective need, after Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  speeches on his southern trip were published, local governments  made grand economic development plans during the later half of  1992 or the first half of 1993. Among these, quite a few  provinces and municipalities set the goal of catching up with or  surpassing the "four small dragons." In order to realize these  plans, increased construction projects and investment were  unavoidable. The year 1994 is the second or third year for the  provinces to implement their plans; it is a stage of ascendancy.  Because the central government has delegated quite a bit of the  investment power, the local investment based on self-raised  funds has became difficult to control. In many places, all the  funds raised last year and the year before have been used in  construction, thereupon getting into a position of no turning  back. Last year the state said that the investment scale was  too large and the economy was overheated. However, not a single  region considered its own investment scale to be too large or  its own economy to be overheated. Therefore, it has been very  difficult to ask the local governments to slow down investment.  The central government, too, has a need to expand investment.  First, given that all localities are launching large projects,  it is necessary to expand investment in basic industries to  guarantee the coordinated development of the future economy so  that the supply capacity of "bottlenecks" can be expanded.  Second, in order to guarantee the coordinated development of  the whole society while the economy is developing, investment  needs to be increased simultaneously in national defense,  science and technology, culture, education, health, and sports,  as well as environmental protection and other public welfare  establishments. Third, in order to reduce regional gaps,  investment needs to be increased in poverty-stricken areas.  Fourth, investment needs to be made in the reform of the old  industrial bases, the construction of commodity grain production  bases, the treatment of large rivers, and so on according to  national development plans.    In terms of the power to supply resources, it has been  forecast that China's industrial growth for 1994 will still be  above 15 percent. In recent years, China has entered a stage  whereby growth in heavy industry has exceeded growth in light  industry. The heavy industry, to a large extent, relies on  investment and construction to realize its output value.  Especially since the demand for investment growth in the past  two years has caused a large scale investment increase in some  industries producing materials for investment, such as  metallurgy, construction materials, and so on, a growth in  production capacity for these industries in 1994 can support a  rather large increase in investment. Therefore, seen from the  demand and ability to supply resources, we are still equipped  with the conditions for high-speed growth in fixed assets  investment in 1994. If not controlled, there will be no problem  in achieving a 15 percent growth in physical quantity. And if  we consider the 10 percent investment price coefficient, then  the increase in the volume of currency will exceed 26.5 percent,  reaching 1.5 trillion yuan or even higher.    Although this scale is within the rational range defined  above, it exceeds the most suitable figure by nearly 200 billion  yuan and will raise the investment rate to 39.9 percent. This  will certainly put pressure on the national economy.    In order to reduce pressure on the national economy caused  by  the investment growth, the state, beginning in early 1994, has  taken a series of soft-landing regulation and control measures.  For instance, the state leaders have repeatedly talked about  the danger of over-investment at National People's Congress  meetings and on other occasions; the central authorities have  issued circulars to control the scale of investment, demanding  the tightening of the examination and approval of projects, the  screening of development zones, the control of loan scale, the  prohibition of chaotic fundraising, etc. Seen from the fact  that, in the first quarter of this year the investment material  market is basically balanced as to supply and demand and that  prices are stable, and seen from other information relevant to  investment growth, the abovementioned measures have achieved  some results. If this trend develops, then it is possible to  control the total amount of 1994 fixed assets investment at  around 1.4 trillion yuan and lower the price index of investment  material to under 7 percent.  <H5>  III. Analysis of the 1994 Investment Structure and </H5> Efficiency    Because the market mechanism's guidance over investment has  gradually become stronger, and the governments at various levels  have gained a better understanding of the importance of  infrastructure, such as transportation and post and  telecommunications, the percentage of investment in tertiary  industries in 1992 and 1993 grew continuously, especially in  transportation and post and telecommunications. This is both  suitable to the adjustment of the industrial orientation in  China and beneficial to alleviating "bottleneck" industries.  One can say that the investment structure is changing in a  rational direction. Seen from the current situation, this change  will be maintained during 1994. Because the state will raise  the prices of some energy products systematically during 1994,  the percentage drop in investment in the energy industry during  the past two years will be alleviated or stopped. However, some  problems will still occur in the investment structure during  1994. First, the investment decisionmakers in some regions lack  a holistic concept. They choose where to invest with only local  and current markets in mind, so that they over-invest in some  industries the products of which are currently in great demand  and which yield huge profits--for instance the real estate  industry--while investing little or not at all in industries  whose products currently do not seem be in great demand or which  are more difficult to build, such as high-tech products or  industries in which China is still comparatively backward and  which produce upgraded mechanical equipment and special raw  materials. Second, some places have begun too many new  infrastructure projects which, due to insufficient financial  ability, may lead to delays in completion or cause them to lie  idle after construction. For example, almost all coastal cities  are now launching port projects. The occurrence of these  situations is hard to avoid.    The establishment of a socialist market economic system and  the intensive competition of many products in the market in  recent years have already caused the majority of investment  decisionmakers to begin to pay attention to the efficiency of  investment. Seen from the actual situation of the past two  years, efficiency still remains an important problem to be  resolved energetically in China's investment field. Currently,  there are still many investment decisionmakers who lack  scientific decisionmaking concepts. In order to launch projects  quickly, they neglect feasibility analyses, which are vital to  guaranteeing the efficiency of construction projects, or only  perfunctorily put up a show for others to see. Such careless  decisionmaking cannot guarantee the efficiency of investment.    Scale, structure, and efficiency are the three major  problems  in the field of investment. Of the three, efficiency plays a  decisive role. If an investment has good efficiency, the larger  its scale, the larger its contribution to future economic  development. This should be encouraged. To pay attention to  efficiency, it is necessary to conduct good feasibility analyses  when deciding on a project and to forecast future markets, the  supply of productive resources, and the efficiency of  production. If one makes decisions only after one is convinced  that satisfactory results can be obtained, then one will not  blindly launch projects and expand the investment scale but will  reduce industrial imbalances and propel the investment structure  towards a rational industrial structure. Therefore, to pay  attention to investment efficiency is the key to solving all  three problems in the field of investment at the same time.    To sum up, we believe that in 1994, apart from adopting  methods such as tightening control on the tap of capital to  avoid excessive inflation of the investment scale, we should  raise the level of project decisionmaking and add investment  efficiency as one of the major goals of macroeconomic regulation  and control. By implementing the investment restructuring plan  raised in the "Decision by the CPC Central Committee Concerning  Several Issues in the Socialist Market Economic System," we  should "gradually establish risk responsibility for corporate  investment and bank credit and loans." We should form, as fast  as possible, a system unifying responsibility, authority, and  benefits, which will restrict the actions of investors. We  should further perfect supporting institutions, such as the  publication of information, consultancy, examination and  approval of feasibility reports, etc., and thus create  conditions for scientific decisionmaking on projects.</p>

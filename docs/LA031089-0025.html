			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> An extremely rare drawing of Mickey Mouse by Walt Disney has been bought for  $110,000 by a private Canadian collector, making it the third most expensive  animation artwork ever sold, according to Christie's East auction gallery. Only  six drawings of Mickey by his creator are known to exist, and all the others  are postage-stamp size. The sketch sold to the anonymous collector is 13 3/4  inches by 14 1/2 inches. Disney drew the work in 1935 on the guest book of an  unidentified film director and his wife and signed his signature. Joshua Arfer,  Christie's animation art specialist, said that "a genuine Walt Disney signature  is pure gold for an animation collector, but his Mickey is platinum."  Christie's handled the private sale between the director's widow and the  collector, who is said to own more than 100 pieces of original animation art  work material valued at more than $1 million. The price was eight times that  paid recently for a Walt Disney Studio artist's pencil drawing sketch from "The  Mail Pilot," a 1933 film. In November, two rare black and white cells from Walt  Disney's 1934 "The Orphan's Benefit," captured record prices of $148,500 and  $121,000. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

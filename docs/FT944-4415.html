			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Time and Security helps Blick to 30% expansion Shares in Blick rose 12p to 430p yesterday as the communications and time products company announced a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to September 30. Included in the results is a 10 1/2 -month contribution from Time and Security, bought in October 1993 from Cable &amp; Wireless for Pounds 55.8m. Group profits expanded to a record Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 9.41m) pre-tax on turnover up 56 per cent to Pounds 51.3m (Pounds 32.8m). The turnover included Pounds 12m from the acquisition, which also added Pounds 65.4m of gross-contracted rental to make the total Pounds 161.4m (Pounds 87.8m). Mr Ian Scott-Gall, group managing director, said he was 'delighted with the organic growth' and said that three years of the expanded group's cashflow would pay off the acquisition costs, which included about Pounds 20m in new equity. He had maintained that when the recovery came, the group's profits would rise as demand increased and companies started to spend more freely. 'It was as if a dam burst about a year ago,' Mr Scott-Gail said. Blick capitalised on this as the salesforce was divided into 'hunters', to seek out customers and sell new contracts, and 'farmers', who service them. Having paid Pounds 3.2m earlier this month for TR Services, a company with similar interests in South Africa, Mr Scott-Gall said the group would look towards Europe for expansion. Mr Alan Elliot, chairman and holder of 30.25 per cent of the group's shares, said he expected to announce an acquisition in 1995. Group operating profits expanded 47 per cent to Pounds 13m (Pounds 8.89m) after which there was a net interest charge of Pounds 782,000 (credit Pounds 517,000). At the acquisition gearing was 167 per cent. That fell to 77 per cent at the year-end. Profits in the time division rose 74 per cent to Pounds 6.16m on turnover of Pounds 20m (Pounds 13.3m). The communications side lifted profits 29 per cent to Pounds 6.88m on turnover up 61 per cent at Pounds 31.3m. Earnings emerged at 29.7p (26.28p) and a final dividend of 8p makes a total of 11.5p, up 13 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: STAR CABBY THINKS HIS PEERS STILL HAVE A  LONG WAY TO GO  </P> <P> The way I see it, Bob Alexander has managed to elude the three scourges that  afflict San Diego cabdrivers: bankruptcy, robbery and hemorrhoids.  </P> <P> For that alone, Alexander might merit an award.  </P> <P> But it's for other things -- like fetching lost luggage, keeping a spotless cab  and a sunny attitude, and making hospital and Blood Bank trips -- that  Alexander, 42, has been named Cab Driver of the Year by the Convention &amp;  Visitors Bureau.  </P> <P> He's as San Diego as a sunburn.  </P> <P> He looks like the lost Beach Boy. He has a 35-foot sailboat and spent five  years skippering sailboats for delivery.  </P> <P> He sees himself as part of the travel industry, not just a hack driver. He  dreams of latching on the America's Cup competition in 1992, maybe as  coordinator of ground transportation.  </P> <P> He'll be feted today at Fat City restaurant as part of the 12th Annual Cab  Driver Appreciation Day. He'll get a plaque, $200, 500 business cards and a  trip to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> The runners-up and other drivers will be there for an afternoon of cabbie  bonhomie, complete with zoo animals and television personalities.  </P> <P> There is the tiniest of problems, however.  </P> <P> The Cab Driver of the Year thinks many San Diego cabdrivers deserve a boot in  the butt, not a pat on the back.  </P> <P> "Many of them lack a professional, businesslike attitude," said Alexander, who  leases from Yellow Cab.  </P> <P> "I see so many drivers just preying on the traveling tourists by taking  advantage whenever possible: by not taking people directly from point A to  point B, by not offering information about the city."  </P> <P> He thinks cabbies should go to etiquette school.  </P> <P> For himself, Alexander is always looking for ways to attract a high-tipping  clientele. He's got a cellular phone in his cab.  </P> <P> He's also thinking of installing a fax machine. As I said, he's very San Diego.  </P> <P> </P> <P> In Case of Offending, Keep Trap Shut  </P> <P> Doesn't it seem that suddenly the San Diego woods are full of people bawling  moral instruction to their neighbors?  </P> <P> Some days the din from these secular preachers using the public prints and  airwaves to improve the public's morals/eco-consciousness/sensitivity is near  ear-splitting:  </P> <P> The community is becoming more diverse, and we -- that means you, brother --  need to respect that. There are diverse reasons for this diversity, and we  should respect those, too.  </P> <P> We should save water and recycle glass, plastic and newspapers. Next time you  flush, think of the guy next door.  </P> <P> Government at all levels is going to hell in a handbasket. I can't remember  when it's been this bad before, although admittedly (also arguably) I have a  bad memory.  </P> <P> We need to set the agenda. There's nothing worse than an unset agenda.  </P> <P> Maybe we should have a meeting. Throw out the press and let everybody in the  city say what he/she feels.  </P> <P> The sportswriters say such a meeting helped the Padres. For a day or two.  </P> <P> Some people in San Diego care only about their own statistics. I told that to a  New York writer.  </P> <P> There are things you had better not do, and things you better not say.  </P> <P> Conservatives worry that someone might burn the flag. Liberals worry that  someone might use "fighting words" and offend this group or that at the  University of California.  </P> <P> The only safe thing is to stay in your room: wrapped in the flag, mouth shut.  </P> <P> And, of course, restrict the flow in your shower.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Once More, With Humor  </P> <P> Everybody's a comic.  </P> <P> * License plate on a La Jolla-bound BMW: "CPA TAXY."  </P> <P> * Spotted in Encinitas: migrant on a street corner wearing a Border Patrol hat.  </P> <P> * Come-on line by undercover FBI agent to Richard T. Silberman: "I'm a  different breed of businessman."  </P> <P> I'll say. The breed that can put you in the slammer for 75 years.  </P></p>

			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Investors push markets to peaks INCREASING hopes of a bull market in global equities pushed stock markets in the UK, Germany, Hong Kong, Spain, Singapore and Malaysia to new peaks yesterday and produced a strong performance on Wall Street. Markets in continental Europe continued to respond to expectations of lower interest rates as UK and German markets strengthened at suggestions that funds are being pulled out of Japanese equities. The markets appeared to feed on each others' strength as the day progressed. As Tuesday's all-time high for the Dow Jones Industrial Average spurred early price rises in London, so big gains overseas and heavy buying of drug stocks pushed US equity markets further into record territory yesterday. The Dow Jones average broke through 3,600 for the first time in yesterday's US morning trading. UK equities attracted foreign demand, particularly from the US, as global investment strategists recommended the London market on hopes of falling interest rates, a firm currency, and growing confidence in the recovery of the economy and corporate earnings. Statistics on domestic retail prices and sales, released yesterday, were in line with expectations. The FT-SE 100 Index registered its best daily gain since late January, rising 48.6 points to a new closing peak of 3,073.6. The renewed advance in share prices was backed up by near record trading in both traded options and stock index futures. Stock markets in Pacific Rim countries chalked up five new 1993, or all-time closing highs. New Zealand equities rose 3.4 per cent to a three-year peak. Australia shrugged off a tax-laden federal budget to close at its best since 1987. Hong Kong chalked up its third consecutive peak and Singapore its fourth on overseas demand for blue chips. Malaysia completed the field as institutional funds continued to mop up quality stocks. Germany and Spain also hit new highs for the year. Frankfurt's Dax index hit 1,935.75, up 25.55. Mr Eckhard Frahm, an institutional adviser with Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, estimated that the 29 per cent appreciation of the yen this year meant Japanese investors were buying the Dax at an effective level of under 1,400.

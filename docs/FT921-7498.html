			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Company News: Navistar reports deficit of Dollars 32m NAVISTAR, the leading North American manufacturer of medium and heavy trucks, yesterday reported a first-quarter net loss of Dollars 32m and said it also expected to be in the red in the second quarter. The group, which has been hit hard by weak demand for trucks due to the US recession, said its loss worked through at 16 cents a share. This compared with a net loss of Dollars 38m, or 18 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. Sales and revenues totalled Dollars 902m, up 7 per cent. Truck shipments totalled 17,100 units, up 3 per cent, mainly because of higher shipments of school-bus chassis to customers who normally took delivery later in the year. Shipments of medium-range diesel engines to original equipment manufacturers increased 11 per cent, reflecting higher retail demand for diesel powered trucks and vans. Navistar said it had increased its share of the North American retail market for medium and heavy trucks to 28.1 per cent, from 26.5 per cent in the first quarter of last year. The industry sales of medium and heavy trucks fell 9 per cent from a year earlier to 52,800 units. Mr James Cotting, chairman, said Navistar's margins had improved slightly from the 1991 first quarter because of the additional sales volume and the impact of a cost reduction programme. He expected a moderate strengthening of the US economy as the year progressed, but at current demand levels expected a second-quarter loss.</p>

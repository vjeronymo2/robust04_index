			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 18 Apr -- Wang Xingyi, spokesman for the  Finance Ministry, recently reported on the smooth execution of  the state budget in the first quarter of this year. He also  described the operation of the new financial and taxation system  in the same period as "basically normal."    In the first three months of this year, Wang Xingyi said,  the  nation witnessed revenue fulfill 18.7 percent of the budget, up  21.4 percent from the same period last year; and expenditure  fulfill 14.9 percent of the budget, an increase of 23.8 percent  over the corresponding period last year. Although expenditure  growth outstripped revenue, the growth rate was still normal.  After balancing the nation's revenue and expenditures, it  showed that revenue exceeded expenditure by 7.765 billion yuan,  which was better than the same period last year.    He said the operation of the new financial and taxation  system was also normal. Most regions in the nation have  implemented and put into operation the tax-sharing sysem, which  is the framework for the financial system, down to the  prefectural and county levels. The operation of the new  financial and taxation system in the last three months has  ensured growth in revenue; it did not cause big commodity price  fluctuations; and it did not adversely affect commodity  production and distribution.    Although the overall situation in the execution of the state  budget and the operation of the new financial and taxation  system far has so far been good, he said some contradictions and  budding signs of future problems were exposed in the course of  executing the state budget. Among them are: low production  output and poor efficiency at industrial enterprises under the  budget; financial difficulties at county-level governments; and  administrative units in some regions fail to pay employees'  wages on time.    Wang Xingyu called on all levels of financial departments to  pay close attention to executing the state budget, to the  operation of the new financial and taxation system, and to doing  a solid job in all spheres of work. First, it is necessary to  continuously attach importance to improving the performance of  state-owned enterprises, to promptly study and work out ways to  solve problems which emerge during production and operation, and  to raise enterprises' economic efficiency. Second, we should  strive to maintain the good momentum in the sale of treasury  bonds and help ensure the successful fulfilment of the task of  selling treasury bonds. Third, there is a need to impose strict  control on the growth of expenditures, to refrain from spending  money unless it is absolute necessary, to postone starting up  projects if it is possible, and to exercise strict control over  supplementary expenditures. Fourth, proper measures should be  worked out to help counties solve financial difficulties.</p>

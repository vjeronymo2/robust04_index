			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SECRETARY OF STATE;  </P> <P> EU WANTS CHARGES FILED AGAINST FLORES  </P> <P> In an unusually harsh attack on her Republican rival, Democratic Secretary of  State March Fong Eu demanded Monday that the attorney general file criminal or  civil charges against challenger Joan Milke Flores for missing a filing  deadline for financial disclosure statements.  </P> <P> In letters to the state Department of Justice and the Fair Political Practices  Commission, Eu's campaign accused Flores of filing her most recent statement  several days late "in a ploy obviously calculated to conceal for as long as  possible" the $418,000 in contributions she collected in October.  </P> <P> Spokeswomen for both government agencies said they would review the request,  but had no comment on the allegations.  </P> <P> During the three-week reporting period ending Oct. 20, Flores raised $139,000  in cash, $4,400 in other gifts and $275,000 in a loan from wealthy San Pedro  businessman Tom Papadakis. Eu, by contrast, raised just $46,000 -- all in cash  -- during the same period.  </P> <P> Anthony L. Miller, Eu's top deputy, said Flores' campaign statement arrived at  the secretary of state's office in Sacramento on Monday by first-class mail.  Under state law, the statement had to be hand-delivered by last Thursday or  sent that day by guaranteed overnight delivery.  </P> <P> "This delay was particularly significant given the court's stay of the  Proposition 73 contribution limits and the public's interest in knowing the  extent to which candidates are once again relying on huge contributions from  special interest groups to fund campaigns," wrote Leo McElroy, Eu's campaign  consultant.  </P> <P> Flores was campaigning and was unavailable for comment, but an aide denied that  the three-term Los Angeles councilwoman attempted to hide her contributions.  Deputy campaign manager Dora B. Kingsley said the late filing was a mailing  error and she accused Eu of overreacting.  </P> <P> "We put the wrong stamp on it," Kinglsey said. "Their campaign is going down  the toilet, and they are panicking."  </P> <P> Flores' ability to raise funds has become a sore point for Eu, who finds  herself in the peculiar position of being outspent by a virtual unknown in her  first bid for statewide office. Since the end of June, Flores has spent  $775,000, while Eu, a four-term incumbent, has spent $528,000.  </P> <P> Eu's inability to compete with Flores financially was clearly illustrated last  week when Eu launched her television advertising campaign. The vast majority of  voters will never see the commercials because Eu cannot afford to broadcast  them in Southern California or in the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Flores, by contrast, has been airing television ads statewide for more than  three weeks, spending about $440,000 on an advertising campaign that is  expected to continue through Election Day. Flores borrowed $275,000 from  Papadakis, who heads her campaign committee, to pay for the television spots,  which she views as crucial to any hopes for an upset.  </P> <P> Recent polls show Flores a distant second to Eu, but the gap has been  narrowing. The Los Angeles Times Poll last week showed Eu leading Flores by a  2-1 margin, compared to an almost 4-1 margin in August. Kinglsey said internal  polling shows Flores trailing Eu by 10 percentage points, although she would  not release data substantiating the claim.  </P> <P> Eu's campaign officials denied that they are panicking, but acknowledged that  they are concerned about Flores' ability to broadcast television ads during the  final week of the campaign.  </P> <P> "I don't know that I would perceive any serious danger in this race," McElroy  said last week in unveiling Eu's television ads. "But it would be silly for us  to put this campaign to bed with unspent campaign money. I just don't believe  in taking chances."  </P> <P> Eu began airing 30-second television commercials Wednesday on stations in  Fresno, Bakersfield, Sacramento, Monterey and San Luis Obispo. The ads are  expected to run through Nov. 5 at a cost of $89,000. She has also launched a  $180,000 statewide radio campaign, which is intended to make up for the lack of  television ads in the state's two largest media markets.  </P> <P> None of the ads mention Flores, focusing instead on Eu's distaste for negative  campaigning.  </P></p>

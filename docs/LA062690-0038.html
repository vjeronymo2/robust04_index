			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: LAKESIDE  </P> <P> Jury selection will resume today in the trial of an El Cajon man accused of  killing his ex-wife, her 5-month-old fetus, a 16-year-old boy and his brother  at a Lakeside house in 1988.  </P> <P> The case of Aristeo Hernandez, 28, was assigned last week to San Diego Superior  Court Judge J. Perry Langford, and jury selection began Monday.  </P> <P> Hernandez is also charged with special-circumstances counts on grounds that  multiple murders were committed. The district attorney's office has decided not  to seek the death penalty against Hernandez, but instead opt for a life  sentence without possibility of parole.  </P> <P> The victims were Theresa Ann Hernandez, 24; Jose Mireles-Rodriguez, 16; Jose  Luis Mireles-Rodriguez, 20, and the fetus, which was male. All were shot to  death.  </P> <P> The day before the Nov. 16, 1988, killings, Hernandez received a court notice  that his wages as a cabinetmaker would be garnished for failure to pay child  support.  </P> <P> Hernandez is in County Jail on $1-million bail.  </P></p>

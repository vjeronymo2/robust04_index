			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Construction of toll bridge across River Severn underway CONSTRUCTION of the privately financed Pounds 300m toll bridge across the River Severn is under way. The bridge is three miles from the existing bridge, which was built 23 years ago and cannot now handle the traffic expected to be generated by an improved economy in south Wales. Construction is being managed by an Anglo-French joint venture of John Laing and GTM Entrepose, part of a private-sector consortium which is to finance, build and operate the toll bridge. Other members of the consortium include Bank of America and Barclays de Zoete Wedd. One thousand workers are expected to be employed during construction of the bridge, which is due to be completed in 1996.</p>

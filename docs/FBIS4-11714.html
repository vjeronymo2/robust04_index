			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unidentified commentary] </F>   [Text] Iranian Foreign Minister Dr. 'Ali Akbar Velayati,  leading a key political delegation, yesterday left on an  official tour of six African states. During his African tour,  Dr. Velayati will visit Guinea-Conakry, Burkina Faso, Namibia,  Zimbabwe, Uganda, and Kenya.    At present, the Islamic Republic of Iran has diplomatic  relations with more than 20 African states, enjoying cordial and  friendly ties with nearly most of the African countries.  Subsequent to such ties, political and cultural teams have been  exchanging visits, embarking on development of economic  relations.    It must be recalled that during the previous regime, on  account of the posturings of the then ruling cliques, Iran did  not enjoy good relations with most of the African states. As a  result, the former regime had set up political and economic  relations at a limited level with only a few African countries  and in particular with the racist regime of South Africa. In  the wake of the victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the  Islamic republic's foreign policy gave priority to establishing  relations with the Third World states, especially with the  African countries. In this same connection, Iran has endeavored  to increase its economic and cultural relations with them.    Undoubtedly, continuation of this trend and regular meetings  between the officials of Iran and these states confirm the  reality that, due to common bonds existing between Iran and  these countries in various political and commercial spheres,  there is available considerable potential for enhancing and  bolstering mutual ties. For instance, the six African states  referred to earlier possess huge mineral reserves, such as gold,  diamonds, silver, and iron ore, and also farm products like  coffee, cocoa, tea, rice, sugar cane, and cotton. Therefore,  they can forge good cooperation with the Islamic Republic of  Iran in various economic fields. Reciprocally, there are useful  experiences enjoyed by Iran in exploiting industrial and mineral  raw material, and also in education, technical, and vocational  training. These are some cases which provide suitable ground  for expansion of cooperation and also cementing of ties by these  states with Iran.    In view of these points, political observers attach  significance to Dr. Velayati's tour of these six countries.  They assess the tour as beneficial to bilateral interests and  also to further bolstering of political, economic, and cultural  relations, besides a sustained cooperation with international  circles.</p>

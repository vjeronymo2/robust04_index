			<p>BFN     [Text] The Egle Party has urged opposition parties in Ghana  to show political maturity even if they differ politically so  that they may be accorded respect. This is contained in a  statement issued in Accra and signed by the co-chairman of the  party, Dr. Ako-Brew, congratulating President Nelson Mandela of  South Africa and the leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, for ensuring successful elections in their  country.    The Egle Party also congratulates the outgoing president of  Malawi, Dr. Kamuzu Banda, for conceding defeat in his country's  presidential elections. According to the statement, the  examples of South Africa and Malawi should be a light to other  African countries where opposition parties, unable to accept  defeat in a free and fair election, have resorted to verbal and  physical violence to achieve political power.    The statement said whilst the NPP [New Patriotic Party] sent  congratulatory messages to political party leaders in South  Africa, who have made true dialogue a cornerstone of their  politics, the same party has backed out of dialogue here at  home. The statement said having failed to participate in  elections which would have given it a presence in parliament,  the NPP is doing everything it can to obstruct and discourage  investments, undermine and discredit the government, and sow  seeds of discord in the country. Whilst reminding the NPP of  the proverb that charity begins at home, the statement urges all  political parties to prevent the events in Liberia, Burundi,  Rwanda, Somalia, and Angola from happening in Ghana.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Arts: The Rules of the Game - Theatre Pirandello's The Rules of the Game is such an elusive play that you must catch it wherever and whenever you can, including the new production at the Almeida. The rules are pretty flexible, Basically they come down to observation and survival. Leone Gala, the husband who has generously moved out of his own house in order to allow his wife to spend more time with her lover, explains: 'If I gave in to any of my feelings, I wouldn't be around to see how the game develops.' On the other hand, Leone does have feelings which are not too deeply submerged. He admits to being hurt by his wife casting eyes elsewhere, and when he applies the rules of the game, he does so quite ruthlessly. He allows himself to be drawn into a duel, for which he has no direct responsibility, then arranges for the lover rather than himself to be killed. There are several ways of playing The Rules. It can be a social comedy with a touch of Wilde and Coward, but also a psychological drama about a neurotic wife whose selfish husband fails even to try to understand her. Pirandello's skill lies in repeatedly moving the goal posts, for this is a continental game where there are no level playing fields. There is some Wilde, some Ibsen. Only Pirandello can put the whole lot together. Jonathan Kent's direction of this new, but not significantly different, version of the play by David Hare, adds an English gloss by setting the first act in Pinterland. Instead of a small town in Italy, the initial action takes place in what looks like a smart flat in Islington: tall white walls, drinks in the background and not much else in the way of furniture - in other words, what is becoming a familiar Almeida set. There is an unnecessary degree of intensity in the opening exchanges. Silia, the wife, shouts at her lover, Guido, when softer distress signals would be more appropriate. Guido, who is meant to be elegantly dressed, pads about barefoot, shirtsleeves rolled up, braces and no tie. There are quite a lot of pauses. One fears the worst. Pirandello, however, cannot be put down like that. From the entry of Richard Griffiths as the husband, the action perks up. He is a very thoughtful fellow, very fat, enjoys eating his own cooking and prides himself on his intellect. He scores points off the lover and still casts a spell over his wife. In the bachelor flat to which he has removed himself there are a couple of splendid characters: Filippo, his servant, and Dr Spiga, his flat-mate. One of the best scenes in this production comes when Leone and Filippon continue to beat eggs in full chef's dress while talking about philosophy and entertaining the lover. The play is full of symbolism, of which egg-beating is only a part. It requires a light touch which the the Almeida performance does not always have. Nicola Pagett remains too rigidly intense as the wife. David Yelland as the lover is not the languid afternoon man that he ought to be. But there is compensation in the master-servant relationship between the egg-beaters. John Normington is a superb Filippo. The production could be improved overnight by speeding it up and going for a souffle, not a dumpling. Almeida Theatre until June 27. (071) 359 4404.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has evaluated information contained in CMA's petition and is now reconsidering the leak repair provisions. Moreover, EPA believes that this information warrants review and response pursuant to section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Clean Air Act. In order to review and evaluate the ability of the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration equipment to comply with the leak repair provisions when extenuating circumstances exist, EPA will reconsider the regulatory requirements applicable to repairing leaks in accordance with section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Issuance of a Three-Month Stay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 17, 1994, EPA issued a three-month administrative stay effective September 16, 1994, of provisions of &sect;82.156(i) as they apply to industrial process refrigeration equipment, including all applicable compliance dates. These provisions had been promulgated as final federal rules requiring the reduction of emissions of ozone-depleting substances during the servicing and disposal of air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment (August 17, 1994, 59  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FR  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42169). EPA is reconsidering these rules, as discussed above and, following the notice and comment procedures of section 307(d) of the Clean Air Act, will take appropriate action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If, after reconsideration of these provisions, EPA determines that it is appropriate to impose leak repair requirements that are stricter than the existing rules, EPA will propose an adequate compliance period from the date of final action on reconsideration. EPA will seek to ensure that the affected parties are not unduly prejudiced by the Agency's reconsideration. Any EPA proposal regarding changes to the leak repair requirements and the appropriate compliance period would be subject to the notice and comment procedures of Clean Air Act section 307(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Proposed Additional Temporary Stay  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will not be able to complete the reconsideration (including any appropriate regulatory action) of the rules stayed by the Administrator within the three-month period expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). That stay will expire on December 16, 1994. Therefore, EPA believes it is appropriate to extend temporarily the stay of the effectiveness of the leak repair requirements for industrial process refrigeration and applicable compliance dates from December 16, 1994, until EPA completes final rulemaking action upon reconsideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the settlement agreement between EPA and CMA set a tight deadline for the completion of the rulemaking, EPA is reconsidering the rules in question as expeditiously as practicable. However, EPA will not be able to complete the reconsideration process during the three-month administrative stay of these regulations. EPA will not be able to issue proposed action, seek public comment, and take final action before the temporary stay expires on December 16, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed, this action will only remain effective to the extent necessary to complete reconsideration of the rules in question. The settlement agreement between EPA and CMA expressly requires that final action regarding reconsideration be signed by June 1, 1994. Therefore, the stay would expire when the final action regarding the reconsideration of the leak repair requirements become effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Comments Received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA received five comments concerning the proposal to extend the administrative stay beyond the three months expressly provided in section 307(d)(7)(B). All the commenters agreed with the need for such an extension. Two comments discussed some of the specific reasons why it is not practical for the owners and operators of industrial process refrigeration equipment to comply with the requirements originally promulgated under &sect;82.156(i). The reasons included, but were not limited to:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _the need for a process shutdown in order to complete certain repairs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _delays stemming from compliance with other applicable federal, state, or local regulations; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the inability to receive the necessary parts and/or appropriate replacement refrigerant within the specified times.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, one commenter addressed the need for a stay to ensure that no enforcement action was initiated by EPA or undertaken in response to citizen suits, during the reconsideration of the leak repair requirements. The commenter was particularly concerned with the potential for unfair imposition of penalties during the pendency of the reconsideration. The commenter stated that while compliance personnel may have been advised of the settlement agreement, they are not legally required to refrain from imposing penalties. Penalties stemming from actions undertaken during reconsideration could be substantial.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA agrees with the five commenters concerning the need for a stay. EPA believes that it is essential to continue staying the effectiveness of &sect;82.156(i) and the applicable compliance dates, as these provisions relate to industrial process refrigeration equipment only. Therefore, through this action, EPA is extending the stay of &sect;82.156(i) and the applicable compliance dates, for industrial process refrigerant only, until EPA completes reconsideration of these regulations in accordance with the settlement agreement reached between EPA and CMA. This stay will expire when the final action regarding &sect;82.156(i) and compliance dates, with respect to industrial process refrigeration equipment are completed and effective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on internal Agency review, the regulatory language of this stay has been slightly modified for purposes of clarification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII.

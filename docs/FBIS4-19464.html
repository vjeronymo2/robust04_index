			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that if the United  States had treated the sides in the Cyprus issue equally, the  problem would have been solved long ago. Denktas made a  statement after meeting with members of the Turkish Cypriot  Journalists Union Administrative Council.    Commenting on U.S. President Bill Clinton's report to the  U.S. Congress, Denktas remarked that this report has the same  shortcomings as the UN secretary general's report. Denktas  noted that Clinton's report concerns itself more with the  contacts conducted on the Cyprus problem and underlines the  importance the United States attaches to this subject, pointing  out that the report does not mention the provocative armament  efforts of the Greek Cypriots.    The report refers to opportunities but does not outline the  obstacles before these opportunities, Denktas said, adding that  the report does not give any messages to the Greek Cypriots to  the effect that they are on the wrong path. Denktas explained  that he does not resent that the report refers to Kliridhis as  president and to himself as honorable, while adding that this  attitude spoils the Greek Cypriots by granting them the title of  legitimate government and fails to assist in the solution of the  Cyprus problem.</p>

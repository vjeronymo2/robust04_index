			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / German building sector in downturn INVESTMENT in the western German construction industry has fallen for the first time in six years, figures from the industry's chief trade association showed yesterday. According to the Hauptverband der Deutschen Bauindustrie, investment fell by a real 0.2 per cent in the first six months of the year compared with the same period last year. The last fall was in 1987, the association said. Although the drop is small, it shows the construction sector - typically viewed as the most robust industrial sector in Germany amid the country's worst recession since the second world war - is not immune to the downturn afflicting the manufacturing sector. The small drop in total investment conceals a pronounced fall in construction for the industrial sector - orders were down by nearly 10 per cent. Public sector construction also fell. This was as a result of the pressure on central and local government to curb expenditure.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (15): Undaunted ABB aims high in spite of delays - Martin Wolf finds the multinational power giant bullish on India ASEA Brown Boveri is bullish on India. Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive officer of the Swiss-Swedish multinational, said last year, for example, that he expected India to become one of ABB's seven or eight most important markets. Mr K. Narasim Shenoy, ABB's managing director in India, even regards India as having the 'number one' potential in Asia, ahead of China. Mr Shenoy has elaborated ABB's ambitions. He hopes that by 1996 ABB will have invested an additional Dollars 300m, apart from Dollars 1bn earmarked for a thermal power generation project near Delhi, and achieved an annual turnover of Dollars 1bn. ABB even plans to be the largest private sector industrial group in India by the end of the century. ABB has far to go. In 1992 the revenues of the group were only Rs5.1bn (Dollars 165m). But the company is already entrenched in the Indian market. By 1992 its total employment in India, at around 7,500, was ninth highest in ABB worldwide. Soon it may be fifth or sixth. ABB is no neophyte in India. The group's current market presence consists of ABB, a 1989 merger of Asea and Hindustan Brown Boveri, along with SAE - a maker of power transmission towers - and Flakt, which makes pollution control equipment and is a leader in air and gas handling technology. Both of the latter are shortly to merge into ABB India, in which ABB, the parent group, has raised its stake to 51 per cent, following changes to the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act. Members of the group commenced manufacturing in India in the 1960s and are now mainly concentrated in turnkey power generation projects, along with equipment for power generation, transmission and distribution. ABB's ambitions for India reflect its appreciation of the country's potential and enthusiasm for the liberalisation of the last two years. Mr Yogesh Desai, communications manager, notes that the environment has been transformed in two respects: large companies used to have to wait for one and a half to two years to gain permission to introduce a new product, but that delay has now disappeared for most products; companies also used to be told by the government of India to produce components in line with a 'phased manufacturing programme', but now industrialists have the flexibility to import the components they need. The fundamental change, in short, is that entry has become far easier. It may be easier, but as ABB knows full well, it is not that easy. The problem, notes Mr Shenoy, is still one of agonising delays. Problems become particularly severe when projects are politically controversial, as they often are when, as is the case for ABB, the client is either a government or a public sector enterprise. A technology transfer project for high powered electric locomotives, financed by the Asian Development Bank, has dogged ABB since 1987. Since winning the initial tender, ABB has had to undergo two rebids and a parliamentary inquiry. Although the contract has at last been signed by the government of India, it is unclear whether Indian Railways has the money to go ahead, its particular problem being finance ministry insistence that this public sector entity pay the government 100 per cent duty on the imported locomotives. Already delays have been so great that the ADB has threatened to cancel the Dollars 190m loan. What has caused the delays? It is not doubt about ABB's technology, since it is the unquestioned global leader in energy and maintenance-saving 3-phase AC locomotives. Nor is it lack of indigenisation, since the contract envisages that import of 16 fully assembled locomotives and 14 more in kit form will be followed by transfer of the production technology to Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. Nor is it the capital cost, which seems likely to work out at about the same level as any relevant alternative. The delay has been caused by lobbying by powerful losers, including the public sector competitor, Bharat Heavy Electrical, concern about dependence on foreign technology and suspicion of foreign multinationals. The lesson, says Mr Desai, is that 'being good is not good enough. You must talk about it, even to unrelated constituencies and convince them.' ABB now has a far more favourable press, claims Mr Desai. Yet great damage has still been done, more to India, which has lost six valuable years to fruitless politicking, than to ABB. Delays are also arising with ABB's planned involvement in power generation. In line with its 'multi-domestic' policy, ABB decided to support the government's policy of securing private sector power generation. It has signed a memorandum of understanding with the National Thermal Power Corporation to participate in a combined cycle 800MW power plant at Bawana, expected to cost some Dollars 1bn. But this proposal has already been delayed about 18 months for evaluation of tenders, which should be completed by next month. Even then, the power purchase agreement must be finalised, to which must be attached adequate financial guarantees, a vital matter in view of the parlous financial state of the electricity boards. ABB is undaunted. While categorically denying all interest in purchase of any part of BHEL, it is interested in joint ventures. It is also negotiating with the state government of Karnataka to purchase a stake in the New Government Electrical Factory, a manufacturer of transformers. But ABB will be limited to a minority stake, since the state intends to keep 51 per cent. The ambitions of ABB are vast. Whether it can fulfil them will be a test not only of its own abilities, but still more of the political environment in India. Much has changed. But much has still to change.</p>

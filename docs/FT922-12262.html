			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (6): Isle of Man scores a first - Clerical Medical International THE AWARD for Clerical Medical International is a recognition not only for the company, but also for the Isle of Man, where it is based. No company on the island has won an award before, even though its financial services industry is almost wholly export-led. This may have been due to the dubious reputation it had built up, mainly thanks to the collapse of the Savings and Investment Bank in 1982. Regulation has been much tightened since then, and the Isle of Man now has a deposit protection scheme in place. It was also the first offshore jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's Financial Services Act of 1988, which in effect recognised the island as offering the same degree of investor protection as on the mainland. The island's new clean-cut image has led to an influx of financial services companies. CMI, a subsidiary of Clerical Medical Investment, the Bristol-based life assurance group, was established in March 1987, and has perhaps been the most successful of the island's financial groups. It now has about 300 staff, including 170 based on the island, and sold a total of Pounds 149.5m in new product business in 1991. This accounted for 18 per cent of Clerical Medical's new premium income last year, down slightly from 20 per cent the year before. CMI's total funds under management are now around Pounds 450m. Dr Bill Hastings, chief executive of the island's insurance regulatory authority, is delighted by the news: 'What better accolade could our sector have? This is a real first: a first for the island and a first for any life insurance company. It is a winning day for the Isle of Man, and an event for which the whole island may be proud.' It is not surprising that life insurers have failed to win exports awards in the past, as differing national tax regimes form a barrier against marketing pensions or endowment savings plans in the same way in different countries. Linguistic barriers are also a problem, given the personal contact from salesmen which is usually necessary before consumers can be persuaded to buy life insurance. But these arguments do not apply to offshore life companies such as CMI. Their tax position on the island is such that they would lose several privileges if their products were available to Manx consumers. Traditionally, the prime market for such companies has come from UK expatriates - people working abroad who want a favourably-taxed resting place for their savings. However, CMI and several other life groups have broadened their sights in recent years to aim for 'international investors'. For residents of any country, life funds held on the Isle of Man can roll up gross of tax. Neither income nor capital gains tax is payable. For UK citizens, tax will be only payable once these funds are brought back into the UK by someone who has worked abroad - the tax-free roll-up ensures that the tax bill will have been lessened. This advantage also applies to foreigners working in the UK - 'inpats' in the jargon. And several countries, such as Sweden, have tax regimes which allow their citizens to shelter money offshore, even going to work abroad. The recent decisions by both Hafnia of Denmark and Skandia of Sweden to set up life operations on the island show the potential of this market. CMI has been one of the most adroit in capturing the new market of 'high net worth investors'. It now has representatives in more than 60 locations in Europe, Asia and the US. Although UK expatriates still make up the bulk of the business, about 25 per cent comes from south-east Asia - a slightly smaller proportion than for some Manx life companies, such as Royal International - while about 10 per cent comes from Africa, and 10 per cent from South America, with around 4 per cent from Sweden, and 5 per cent from central Europe. The company's product range has also helped it to attract more sophisticated investors. Apart from the usual straightforward single premium life 'bonds', and pension contracts, CMI has taken advantage of the opportunities Isle of Man regulators have allowed for innovative fund management without a life assurance element. Thus there is a choice from straightforward deposit administration accounts denominated in US dollars or Deutschmarks, through to 24 individual equity funds investing in specific countries. CMI also offers umbrella funds, and investments which 'track' the FT-All Share, S&amp;P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices. There is also a range of trusts. More product launches are planned for the near future. But for the time being, the satisfaction of Mr Mike Richardson, CMI's chief executive, seems justified: 'Today's announcement is a tribute to the hard work and dedication of CMI's staff and to the support we have received since we established operations on the Isle of Man.'</p>

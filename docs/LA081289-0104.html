			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT OF L.A. CONVENTION BUREAU FORCED OUT BY BOARD  </P> <P> The top staff member of the Los Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau has  been forced out by the board of the nonprofit booster organization, it was  announced Friday.  </P> <P> The contract of Bill F. Miller, the 46-year-old president of the bureau, has  not been renewed, said Lloyd Axelrod, vice president of public relations for  the bureau. Miller joined the bureau in June, 1988.  </P> <P> Axelrod said the board's executive committee did not reveal the reasons for its  decision, which was made Thursday. Miller, whose contract expired June 30, was  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Day-to-day operations will be handled by Philip H. Westernoff, vice president  of marketing. A committee is being formed to conduct a nationwide search to  replace Miller, who was brought in to reorganize the bureau and help increase  the area's tourism and convention business.  </P> <P> Two other top officials resigned this week for "personal reasons," Axelrod  said. They are Roger Gilmore, senior vice president of travel industry sales,  and Frank Santos, director of convention marketing.  </P> <P> The bureau's name was recently changed from the Greater Los Angeles Visitors  &amp; Convention Bureau. The organization receives about two-thirds of its  funds from the City of Los Angeles.  </P></p>

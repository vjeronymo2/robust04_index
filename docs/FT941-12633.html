			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Faith and charity overcome 'guilt' - Serious riches / Elizabeth Breton saw her inheritance as family money, rather than her own, and knew that it needed to be managed Greed is good' epitomised the attitude towards making money of a whole generation of young City dealers. 'Rich is responsible' would more aptly describe Elizabeth Breton's way of thinking. A landowner and philanthropist, investment runs in her veins. Her maternal grandfather, William Mackenzie, a stockbroker, was one of the founders of the Dundee Stock Exchange. He was also the architect of the Alliance Trust, the investment trust which today is one of the UK's largest. The Alliance Trust was formed in 1888 through a series of amalgamations of Scottish and American mortgage companies. Dundee had always had strong business connections with the US, but in the 1870s when Americans found it difficult to pay for goods with cash, Scottish merchants took mortgages over land in the US as security for goods they sold. The high interest rates available in parts of the US attracted Scottish entrepreneurs into establishing trust companies to invest directly in mortgages. To lessen risk, the entrepreneurs held firmly to the importance of diversification, spreading their risks geographically and across a variety of crops and types of land. This diversification was a guiding principle of the investment trust movement. The Dundee Mortgage and Trust Investment company and the Oregan and Washington Trust company were among those which joined forces to become the Alliance Trust. Mackenzie, who had been secretary of the Oregan &amp; Washington Trust, in due course became managing director of Alliance trust. 'My mother was very proud of him; I am proud that the company is still run from the same offices in Dundee and that he made his money honestly,' says Mrs Breton, who has a substantial holding in the investment trust company which her grandfather played an instrumental role in founding. Her father's family were Lincolnshire farmers, and although he left a 700-acre farm, the principal inheritance was from grandfather Mackenzie. 'I did not regard the money as my own - I was fairly socialist in those days, and felt guilty about inherited wealth.' When her husband was invalided out of the Royal Air Force in 1955, the two formed a farming partnership and bought 500 acres of arable land in Gloucestershire; a further 300 acres was added in 1964. Mrs Breton also ran a holiday cottage business to make use of the unoccupied cottages on the land. 'Since 1978, I have been involved in a lot of wheeling and dealing. We were keen to expand into a second farm, and one was bought in Suffolk, financed by a sale-and-leaseback of part of the home farm. When Suffolk proved too far away, we relocated to Sussex. In 1987, most of the home farm was sold, followed by various barns, cottages and land, to maximise assets, with a view to relocating on better-quality land.' Land and houses account for almost 40 per cent of her wealth. Because Mrs Breton wants to buy more farm land, some 35 per cent of her liquid assets are in the building society. Apart from a tax-exempt special savings account (Tessa), National Savings products and life assurance, the rest is invested in the stock market. 'I have always thought of money as something you must be careful with, and, because I regarded my inheritance as family money and not mine, I felt responsible for looking after it. In the early 1960s, I realised that my investments needed to be managed.' She has relied on the advice of her accountant, Gerry Camamile, and Brian Tora of Greig Middleton, the City stockbrokers. Tora has managed her stock market portfolio for the past 20 years on a discretionary basis. He first took it over after the 1974 stock market crash, until when it had been invested predominantly in smaller companies, and switched the emphasis to large blue chips. The portfolio is still dominated by large companies, with a smattering of smaller companies. The exposure to overseas markets is obtained through Fidelity European and the large holding in the Alliance Trust. This is 55 per cent invested in the UK, 25 per cent in North America, 9 per cent in Europe and 7 per cent in the Far East (nearly all outside Japan), with cash making up the balance. Each year, Pounds 6,000 of her Alliance Trust holding is transferred into a general personal equity plan, to roll up free of income and capital gains tax. Another Pounds 3,000 is put into a single-company Pep managed by Greig Middleton, so that the full annual Pep allowance is used up. Despite her wealth, Mrs Breton lives in a modest stone house in a small village in Gloucestershire. 'My mother was very much against any kind of ostentation; she was also very generous.' One room of the house has been converted into an office, with fax machine and secretary. Apart from dealing with the paperwork for the farming and cottage rental business, Mrs Breton uses it to administer her charitable trust and to deal with other charity work. She discovered 'a firm faith in Christianity' in the 1960s, and gives away about 10 to 12 per cent of her income, mainly to Christian organisations. 'I found being a Christian fun; it also helped me stop feeling guilty about money and to thank God for it.'</p>

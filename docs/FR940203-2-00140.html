In this context also, in suggesting that funds awarded under this competition be utilized for preparing and making available important program information for parents and students in after school centers or in publication, the commenter has suggested an activity that the Secretaries would consider to be an allowable activity for local partnerships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships_Youth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter felt that the notice's references to youth for example, in paragraph (h) of Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships in the context of providing opportunities for dropout students were unclear. The commenter suggested defining the term ``youth'' so as to include, at a minimum, young persons up to, and including, age 25, to allow for the inclusion of young men and women who have dropped out, become parents, and face multiple obstacles to achieving a self-sufficient wage. Another commenter believed that defining the term ``youth'' to include students in the elementary grades would enhance the opportunities of children to develop early career awareness, thereby increasing School-to-Work Opportunities program participation rates in the high schools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Since the focus of the School-to-Work initiative and of this notice is on system building and institutional change, there are no detailed provisions for individual eligibility. The Secretaries believe that States should have the flexibility to determine the age range of the student population for their School-to-Work Opportunities programs. However, States are expected to develop systems that coordinate other education and training programs funded from sources that do set parameters for the youth to be served. For example, the Job Training Partnership Act limits the age of the youth to be served to 16 through 21 years of age. In addition, the required school-based learning component must include career awareness and career exploration and counseling. These activities may be carried out in the elementary and middle school years to better prepare students for School-to-Work Opportunities programs, as States and localities retain the flexibility to begin career awareness and counseling programs at as early a grade level as appears to be appropriate and useful.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter felt that a student's eligibility to participate in a School-to-Work Opportunities program should not be determined by student population based on age, such as age 16 through 21, but rather should be geared to grade level. The commenter believed that a student's eligibility to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities program should begin in ninth grade, since, in this way, all students would have an equal opportunity to qualify for the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As is discussed above, the Secretaries believe that States should retain the flexibility to design School-to-Work Opportunities systems, within the parameters of the program as contained in this notice, that best meet the needs of their students.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Safeguards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested that the Secretaries establish additional safeguards, beyond those provided for in the notice, so as to ensure student access, services, information, and assistance to students and parents. Another commenter suggested adding a new safeguard to provide that nothing in this notice should be construed as modifying or affecting the Fair Labor Standards Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Regarding the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Secretaries note that, as a matter of law, this notice does not and cannot in any way modify or affect either the Fair Labor Standards Act or its applicability. However, the Secretaries agree with the commenter's suggestion that a reference to applicable fair labor standards would be helpful in the context of the ``Safeguards'' section of the notice. Regarding the commenter's suggestion that additional safeguards be added to the list, the Secretaries do not believe that this is necessary, since relevant Federal and State law will continue to apply to this program, regardless of whether these are specifically mentioned or listed in the notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The notice has been modified to include the word ``labor'' in paragraph (d) of the ``Safeguards'' section of the notice. Paragraph (d) now reads: ``Students shall be provided with adequate and safe equipment and a safe and healthful workplace in conformity with all health, safety, and labor standards of Federal, State, and local law.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

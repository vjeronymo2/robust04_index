			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Moscow set to play key role in Middle East peace talks THE SOVIET UNION is poised to play a key role in the search for a Middle East peace settlement, Mr Alexander Bessmertnykh, the country's foreign minister said yesterday. After four hours of talks with Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, in the Caucasian town of Kislovodsk, Mr Bessmertnykh said Moscow would give a 'positive response' to the US proposal that it co-sponsor a Middle East peace conference. 'The Soviet Union and the US intend to assist in the convening and holding of a peace conference . . . We intend to act as sponsors,' he said at a news conference. His announcement came as the official news agency Tass reported that he planned to visit Israel in May - a move which could lead to the renewal of full diplomatic relations. Links were cut by Moscow during the 1967 Six Day War. Mr Bessmertnykh said the itinerary and exact date of his visit were being worked out. 'Our relations with Israel are developing, and if this tendency continues, there will be no difficulties in establishing full diplomatic relations.' Israeli officials, who have said that Moscow cannot take part in the proposed conference without the restoration of full relations, said they had received no prior notice of Mr Bessmertnykh's visit. But they said it would be a welcome step towards restoring ties. Moscow is understood to be ready to renew full links. On regional peace, the Soviet minister laid out a three-stage negotiating process: The holding of a regional peace conference. Separate discussions with the Palestinians - although it is not clear which other countries would be at the talks. A 'representative international peace conference' in which both regional and world powers would participate. Mr Baker, who arrived in Israel last night for his second round of talks there in a week, said after the meeting with Mr Bessmertnykh that there was a better chance than before of achieving a settlement in the region, although he said that there were still 'considerable obstacles'. Israel has made it clear from the start it does not oppose Soviet co-sponsorship of a proposed regional peace conference. However, officials said the government would continue to resist other features sought by Mr Baker, who is scheduled to hold talks in Jerusalem today. The two sides are at loggerheads over continued expansion of Jewish settlement in the occupied territories. Mr Bessmertnykh also predicted that a compromise on the conventional forces in Europe treaty, signed last November but not ratified, was emerging.</p>

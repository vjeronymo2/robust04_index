			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Guillermo Morales Cata] </F>   [Text] Havana, 10 May (PL) -- People profiteering from  medicine that is scarce in Cuban pharmacies had the rug pulled  out from under them today when the Public Health Ministry  announced a new strategy for the distribution and control of  medicine.    Uncertainly has prevailed for months among the Cuban people  regarding the fate of medical supplies, and Public Health  Minister Julio Teja today outlined goals for this sector by  proposing ways to turn back the difficult situation concerning  the availability of medicine.    In addition to controls, the Cuban authorities intend to  raise the national production of medical products and to give  more support to herbal medicine, which, as is well-known,  represents an international tendency to use medicinal plants and  natural products.    Until recently, "transient dealers" were frequently seen on  the island demanding exorbitant prices for medical products that  are in high demand and, in fact, do not exist in state-owned  facilities.    Although the country's situation is critical, the health  minister explicitly referred to the allocation of convertible  currency that will enhance imports in a much more efficient and  independent way.    The government faces a dilemma concerning the possibility of  purchasing approximately 352 medical products that are  considered "essential" for people's health, but the creation of  a new budget for this purpose seems to clear any doubts.    According to Teja, the pharmaceutical industry's production  plan already has a sizable part of the raw materials, with an  estimated value of 84 million pesos (on a par with the dollar at  the official exchange rate), which represents an increase for  this sector over last year. The goal is to match production  levels reached in 1992, when the scarcity of medicine was not so  critical.    Since 1959, the situation in Cuba's medical-pharmaceutical  industry has always been a state priority. Before then, the  national market contained more than 40,000 registered  pharmaceutical products. More than 80 percent of these were  manufactured by foreign firms, mainly U.S. firms.    The country's laboratories continued to purchase raw  materials primarily from the United States, but, given that  nation's dispute with the island, U.S. companies began to cut  their supplies until they were completely suspended.    Despite the restrictions, Cuba's pharmaceutical sector has  managed to manufacture, from start to finish and by using  genetic engineering, medical products such as recombinant  streptoquinate [estreptoquinasa recombinante], which prevents  heart attacks; the first vaccine against type-B meningitis; and  the epidermic growth factor.    The Patents and Licenses Office in the United States, the  country which has obstructed Cuba's medical and biotechnological  development for more than 35 years, registered three Cuban  patents in 1993 alone.    The office recognized the originality of these products, and  Cuba is the only country in the world that has the methodology  and technology to manufacture them.    Regarding five future technologies, the Cubans are world  leaders in the most important ones, biotechnology and genetic  engineering, with an estimated market of $200 billion within six  years.    Although the Cuban state places no restrictions on the  protection of health assets, it does intend to grant priority to  the distribution and control of medicine.</p>

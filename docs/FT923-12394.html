			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Clinton sees a surge in his popularity GOVERNOR Bill Clinton was yesterday buoyed by a surge in his popularity as early polls suggested that a sizeable proportion of Mr Ross Perot's supporters favoured Mr Clinton as their second choice. Fresh from his coronation on Thursday night as the Democratic party's presidential candidate, Governor Clinton set out with Senator Al Gore, his vice-presidential running mate, in search of Mr Ross Perot's supporters, who have been left disgruntled by the Texas billionaire's sudden withdrawal from the presidential race. The bus tour will take the campaign through eight states, from New Jersey to Missouri. 'This is going to be a real grassroots campaign,' Mr Clinton told a rally before leaving. While Clinton campaign officials had expected a 10 to 15 percentage point boost from this week's Democratic party convention in New York, they have been surprised by the apparent rush of support from the Perot camp. Early polls suggested that around half of Mr Perot's supporters favoured Mr Clinton, with only one-third preferring President George Bush. This would put Governor Clinton ahead with 56 per cent of the votes to President Bush's 33 per cent, according to a poll conducted on Thursday by Gallup for CNN and USA Today. Some overnight polls put the gap between Mr Clinton and Mr Bush even wider. Mr Clinton yesterday said he did not take polls seriously, either way, and planned to fight all the way to November. Few Democrats have forgotten the 17-point lead that Governor Michael Dukakis held at the same point of his 1988 campaign, before he faded to an ignominious defeat. 'Dukakis made a mistake in taking a break,' said Congressman Les Aspin. 'Bill Clinton and Al Gore are not going to make that mistake.' In a closer regional analysis, many pundits said the return to a two-party race would benefit Mr Bush in the south, and especially in Mr Perot's home state of Texas. Mr Clinton, however, could now be better placed in western states, especially California, where Senator Gore's impeccable record as an environmentalist should help his campaign. Many Perot supporters, however, feel so bitterly deceived by their candidate's withdrawal that they might return to the non-voting majority. Only 13 per cent of those questioned by Gallup believed Mr Perot had withdrawn from the election for the country's good, as he claimed, and 51 per cent of his supporters said they felt betrayed. 'What a wimp,' proclaimed the New York Post on its front page. 'All over America there are ordinary, decent people who believed in this gutless bum,' added Mr Pete Hamill, the New York tabloid's columnist. Given this new distaste for Mr Perot, his oblique endorsement of the 'revitalised' Democratic party may not count for much. But in the face of Mr Perot's pull-out, the reaction to Mr Clinton's repetitive and ill-structured acceptance speech on Thursday was charitable. Joking that he had returned to finish the long-winded monologue he began at the 1988 Democratic convention - so long that the crowd cheered when he said: 'In closing . . . ' - Mr Clinton took 53 minutes to conclude. This time, however, his audience was in more forgiving mood, and viewers elsewhere appeared more inclined to contrast the grit with which he withstood the assault on his character during the primaries with Mr Perot's apparent collapse under pressure.

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS;  </P> <P> PLEA FOR ORGANIC FARMING IN 'A TOWN'S REVENGE'  </P> <P> "A Town's Revenge" combines a history lesson in McCarthyism with an argument  for organic farming. It's an ambitious if unlikely attempt to illustrate the  importance of standing up for one's belief.  </P> <P> The "ABC Afterschool Special," written by Bruce Harmon, directed by Helen  Whitney and airing at 3 p.m. today on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42, focuses on a  rural town in turmoil. Teen-aged Eric (Keith Coogan) is antagonizing local  farmers with his desire to experiment with natural ways to keep crops free of  bugs. The farmers, fearing financial losses, prefer their tried and true  pesticides.  </P> <P> They're further antagonized when Eric's elderly great aunt, Cecile (Elizabeth  Franz), returns to town after 35 years to take over her deceased brother's farm  and gives Eric a chance to put his experiment into action.  </P> <P> Cecile has a double strike against her. She had been driven out of town after  being targeted by the FBI as a Communist sympathizer during the McCarthy era.  The town has neither forgiven nor forgotten her.  </P> <P> As is often the case in television's short dramas aimed at teens, the  characters here are one dimensional. The farmers are bully boys, Eric is wise  beyond his years, Cecile is a noble martyr and Eric's frightened father needs a  lesson in bravery.  </P> <P> Still, there are effective moments. When Cecile tells Eric who Sen. Joe  McCarthy was, the words have an "I was there" passion that almost transcend the  proselytizing. LYNNE HEFFLEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TRADING PLACES WITH MADONNA  </P> <P> If Madonna could trade places with someone, living or dead, who would it be?  </P> <P> Marilyn Monroe? Nah. "She'd probably have an exercise video," the sultry  singer-actress said.  </P> <P> John F. Kennedy Jr.? Nope. But she'd like to be stranded with him if they were  the only two people left on the planet.  </P> <P> Forget it. You'll never guess. Try Malcolm X.  </P> <P> Actually, Madonna first chose the late Frida Kahlo to trade places with, but  remembered that the painter was in a streetcar accident and was in a lot of  pain. So the assassinated black Muslim leader was her next choice.  </P> <P> Madonna answered these and other questions submitted by readers of the teen  magazine YM. Her answers are in the August issue, which hit newsstands  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Other gems: The best present she ever received was "a handful of sweaty  diamonds and emeralds." She didn't say from whom.  </P> <P> If she had only two days to live she'd spend them "eating potato chips,  watching 'The Little Rascals.' "  </P> <P> And if Madonna could change herself in any way, what would she change?  </P> <P> "Just my hairdresser," she says.  </P></p>

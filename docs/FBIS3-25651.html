The woman was killed when shooting broke out between  NP and African National Congress [ANC] supporters at an NP rally.    Police said Isghak Adams, son-in-law of Howard Isaacs, an NP  deputy for the diamand district of the Northern Cape, was  formally charged before a magistrate at midnight on Wednesday.  He was granted bail and released. [passage omitted]    Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel said that unless the  ANC took immediate and credible steps to control its supporters,  South Africa's first democratic elections were in danger of  degenerating into bloody chaos. In a statement, Mr Kriel said  the intimidation and violence of especially ANC supporters was  already extensively hindering free political activity.    "The ANC's persistent refusal to discipline its violent  supporters has created the potential for widespread violence  wherever other political parties seek to exercise their right to  free political activity," Mr Kriel said.</p>

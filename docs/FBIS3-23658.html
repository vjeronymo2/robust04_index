			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with PVO Troops Main Staff Chief Colonel-General </F> Viktor Pavlovich Sinitsyn by VESTNIK PVO editor-in-chief Colonel  Mikhail Zakharchuk under the rubric "The Second Year of the Army  of Russia": "The Computer As Assistant in Battle"]    [Text] Staff officers must also be trained in  heuristic activity, and the intellectual support of staff  operations must be provided for, in order for the Air-Defense  Troops [PVO] to be able to fulfill their tasks in a quality  fashion at the necessary contemporary level. These and other  questions were touched on in the discussion of the  editor-in-chief of the journal VESTNIK PVO, Colonel Mikhail  Zakharchuk, with PVO Troops Main Staff Chief Colonel-General  Viktor Sinitsyn.    [M. Zakharchuk] Viktor Pavlovich, the problems that we will  touch on today are not new ones for our Air-Defense Troops. The  incorporation of electronic gear, automated systems and means of  command and control into combat and training processes has been  underway for years now, if not decades. I will nonetheless be so  bold as to assert that they have taken on particular urgency  lately, literally during the period of emergence of the army of  Russia.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] That is indeed so. Recent events in the  country and the armed forces, in which you and I are living  participants, have become so dynamic that we will not be able to  handle them, to master them, based only on our past experience.  We need a qualitatively new augmentation of our knowledge and  skills. Whence the necessity of increasing the role of  intellectual support for the work of the staff, on which I, by  the way, would like to place the principal focus of our  discussion.    [M. Zakharchuk] I understand that your terminology is clear  to specialists. But they are not the only ones who read your  journal. So let us first orient ourselves with respect to  definitions, at least those that are advanced during our  conversation.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] I have no objection. And I will start with  the fact, for example, that the term "intellectual support for  staff operations" is currently becoming more and more  widespread, as is the modern interpretation of the existing  concept of "automating staff processes based on the use of  computer technology (EVT)." This is evidently conditioned by the  fact that the processes into which computer gear is being  incorporated are of an intellectual nature as a whole, since  they permit a quantitative evaluation of logically substantiated  variations of enemy actions, alternative variations for the  operations of one's own troops and a determination of the  optimal ones, and the receipt of unexpected results according to  the results of multivariable modeling. The phrase "intellectual  support" signifies that the main role in the process of making  (or clarifying) decisions remains with the person, while the  information and computational systems (IRS) -- the intellectual  basis of which are mathematical models (MM) and information and  computational tasks (IZ and RZ)--are just a tool for staff  officers.    As for the heuristic activity of officers in the process of  operational and combat training, here we have in mind the  aggregate of logical techniques and methodological rules for  theoretical research and seeking out the truth or the simplest  method of training that facilitates resourcefulness and  activeness in the person. The term, in other words, is not  imbued with any outside connotation.    [M. Zakharchuk] So let us please return to where we started  -- raising the role of intellectual support for staff operations.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] It is conditioned by the sharp increase in  the number of uncertainties that most be dealt with in order to  make the necessary decisions, the acute lack of time assigned to  substantiating the plans for combat operations, and the optimal  variations for the combat application of various types of  manpower and equipment.    The experience of wars and conflicts of recent years  testifies convincingly that modern combat operations are  characterized by great rapidity, intensity and dynamism, and  consequently an acute shortage of time to make or clarify  decisions. The process of decision-making is becoming more and  more difficult, crucial and collective under those conditions.    More crucial because losses, both human and of material  resources, could prove to be catastrophic and lead to the  complete loss of the fighting ability of troops in the face of  the increased firepower of modern weapons systems and equipment,  as occurred in the Persian Gulf.    More collective because under conditions of an acute  shortage  of time, commanding officers at all levels encounter a host of  uncertainties that it is becoming impossible for one person to  deal with, even with a high level of professional training and  intellectual potentialities, without the aid of professional  experts and advisors, a large portion of whom are concentrated  on the staffs. It must be understood in this regard, when  speaking of decision-making, that it (the decision) is a result  of the activity of a system created for that purpose, in which  some evaluate the alternative variations of the actions of the  opposing sides (the staffs), while others (the commanding  officers at all levels), agreeing with a proposed variation and  approving it, assume responsibility for the consequences of  decision-making, relying on collective reason.    More difficult because the scarcity of time allotted for  obtaining, processing, analyzing and evaluating an enormous  quantity of information, on the one hand, and the enormous  responsibility -- which in some cases becomes nationwide or  universal in nature -- on the other, condition the necessity of  the mandatory performance of multivariable modeling of the  confrontation of SVN [offensive air weapons] and PVO, with the  aim of increasing reliability and reducing erroneous decisions  to a minimum. It is also more difficult because staff officers,  in a collective search for the optimal solution to a specific  task (heuristic activity), run up against a shortage of initial  information and a host of uncertainties.    A scarcity of information and a number of uncertainties  exist, in particular, at the stage of evaluating the enemy,  making it more difficult to deal with the possible intent of his  actions (targets, amount and sequence of missions being carried  out, sectors of the main and other thrusts, composition of  forces and equipment employed, and determination of the force of  the strike by sectors, as well as in the accomplishment of  specific tasks -- the operational disposition of forces in  echelon or a massed strike, the expected duration of SVN  operations and the like).    At the same time, without having determined with a certain  degree of reliability the intentions of enemy actions, it is  impossible to evaluate the potential capabilities of the  existing PVO system (subsystems for reconnaissance, command and  control, fighter, aircraft and surface-to-air missile cover, and  all types of operational, rear and technical support). The  presence of uncertainties in evaluating the enemy obviously  engenders uncertainty in the evaluation of one's own troops and  the choice of variations for combat operations, and ultimately  has an effect on the reliability and objectivity (quality) of  the decisions being made (or clarified).    [M. Zakharchuk] The conclusion could be drawn from what you  have said that an objective necessity has appeared on the agenda  today of having a unified system of mathematical models and  computational tasks, allowing officers not only to deal with the  uncertainties you have mentioned in a short period of time, but  also to suggest to them the optimal variations of solutions for  combat operations, for the restoration of a destroyed PVO  system, and for the resolution of other issues that arise in the  dynamic combat environment. But how should a system of  mathematical models (MM) and computational tasks (RZ) look? Or  rather, to what requirements must they conform?    [V.P. Sinitsyn] The functional essence of the system can be  summarized according to the following parameters, without going  into the details of it.    First, optimized models and computational tasks  "suggesting" the best variation for a solution out of some  quantity of possible ones should constitute the foundation of  the system. A large portion of the existing MMs and RZs do not  conform to this requirement, since they are in essence  informational-computational.    Second, the MMs and RZs in the system should  reflect more accurately the physical sense and specific nature  of the confrontation of PVO Troops with the forces of an  airborne attack.    One shortcoming of the existing MMs and RZs is the fact that  unilateral combat operations, in which the enemy is relegated to  the role of an abstractly standardized target, is inherent in  them. The specific nature of the confrontation of PVO Troops  with the forces of an airborne attack assigned to suppress them  is not reflected in the models. The actions of echelons and  groups for PVO suppression are not modeled as a consequence of  this, and the outcome of the confrontation is not always taken  into account in the evaluation.    Third, the results of a decision issued for  display should reflect the situation in dynamic mode, the  position of the opposing sides in space, in real time, using  three-dimensional graphics. Most of the existing MMs and RZs do  not meet this requirement, since they issue for display the  results of decisions in the form of tables, graphs and contour  lines.    Thus, the scientists of the PVO Troops, in order to meet the  needs of practice, must develop a system of mathematical models  and computational tasks using a uniform methodological  foundation; possessing hierarchical coordinability and  systems-engineering coordinability of the indicators and  criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of combat operations,  allowing staff officers to uncover the possible intentions of an  airborne enemy, evaluate his potential capabilities, predict the  outcome of a confrontation of the sides, optimize variations for  the actions of the enemy and his troops and depict the  three-dimensional position of the opposing sides in dynamic  fashion.    [M. Zakharchuk] The requirements for the level of training  of  staff officers are growing. No one today doubts the necessity of  improving the methods of instilling skills in modeling a  confrontation of SVN and PVO, analyzing the results and  preparing proposals substantiated by computations. But what  about this question -- how will all this be achieved? The more  so as the forms and methods of training today contradict the  requirements of progress in the military arts.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] That same scientific and technical progress,  on the other hand, gives us the opportunity to increase the  efficiency of staff officer training through the incorporation  into operational and combat training of computer games and  automated systems for modeling the combat situation. The tasks  of gaming combat operations must be resolved with the use of  modern computer hardware united into local networks. This will  make it possible to perform an evaluation of the conceptual  framework of the operational application of PVO formations  according to the results of multivariable modeling, and to  determine the optimal variations for the combat application of  PVO formations and large units of the PVO Troops and special  troops, as well as to obtain objective evaluations of the level  of professional training of the officers of directorates and  staffs at all levels.    [M. Zakharchuk] How do matters stand in this regard with the  use of automated systems for modeling the combat situation in  the United States and the other NATO countries?    [V.P. Sinitsyn] You can have no doubt that they are  proceeding apace with scientific and technical progress there. A  center for modeling the combat environment, for example, has  been created at the Ramstein Air Base (Germany). A practical  verification of the capabilities of the center was performed  during the comprehensive Ex-91 and Cactus Juggler-92 command and  staff exercises, as well as the Caravanguard-91 and Reforger-92  exercises.    The spending for the actual performance of exercises on the  scale of Cactus Juggler-92, in the estimation of the NATO  combined forces command in Europe, would be 100-150 million  dollars, while the cost of the computer version did not exceed  one million dollars.    The partial utilization of the combat-environment modeling  center during the Reforger-92 exercises made it possible to  reduce the cost of conducting them by 25-30 percent compared to  prior years. Need one be persuaded that the adoption of computer  games into the process of training, under conditions of cutbacks  in appropriations for the maintenance of the armed forces,  including spending on military training, is a promising  direction for improving the operational and combat training of  the PVO Troops?    This direction is also a promising one because it makes  possible, along with a reduction in spending, a rise in the  quality of training via the repeated processing of different  variations for the start and waging of combat operations.    [M. Zakharchuk] I was telling you something at the beginning  of our discussion, Viktor Pavlovich, that you undoubtedly know  perfectly well yourself -- questions of the automation of combat  training have long been under study in the armed forces. The  development of MMs and RZs, in particular, have been underway in  the interests of the staffs for more than 25 years now. An  extensive store -- or better yet, a base of MMs and RZs -- has  been created over that time. You will agree, however, that the  effectiveness of their application for the preparation of  operational-tactical computations and the study of the processes  of operations (combat operations) remains low as before. What is  going on here?    [V.P. Sinitsyn] There is a host of reasons here. One of the  main ones consists of the absence of uniform methodological,  operational-tactical, informational and mathematical foundations  for the structuring and application of models. Various models  for one and the same purpose thus meet varying requirements, and  various approaches were applied to their development. These have  not been included, and cannot be combined into a unified system  of software support for the command and control of troops  without the corresponding refinement and development.    The available models, as a rule, do not take into account  all  of the principal factors that have an effect on the course and  outcome of operations (combat operations). There are still too  few efficient models that would provide for the issue of the  necessary data in real time for staff activity, answer the main  questions in the preparation of operations (combat operations)  and be of practical assistance to the commanding officers or  commanders and staffs in devising solutions and planning  operations of higher quality and in more operative fashion.    This situation makes urgently necessary the devising of  uniform requirements for staff models. The work that has been  started at the PVO Military Academy imeni G.K. Zhukov for the  creation of imitative models of bilateral combat operations for  units in the branches of our forces and the comprehensive  modeling of combat operations by large PVO units and formations  is deserving of attention in this regard. The initiatives of  scholars at the academy to create simulation and imitative  systems are also deserving of attention and support; dynamic  models of the confrontation of SVN and PVO are inherent in those  systems, making it possible to reveal uncertainties in the  actions of the enemy, predict the outcome of the confrontation,  optimize the variations of the actions of the enemy and his  troops and depict the results of the computations in dynamic  form, and the actions of the sides in space and time using a  three-dimensional graph.    I am convinced of the expediency of continuing the work to  create mathematical models, computational tasks, and dynamic  scenarios of the confrontation of SVN and PVO, with their  subsequent incorporation into the practice of operational and  combat training. This would make it possible to increase  markedly the effectiveness of training for staff officers at all  levels, through the more detailed study of various aspects of  logical-analysis and logical-synthesis activity.    [M. Zakharchuk] So if the task of providing a uniform  methodological approach in the creation of the foundations for  the computerization of the training and combat processes (and  there should be no doubt of this) faces us once again, what  requirements should those foundations meet?    [V.P. Sinitsyn] I will list the principal ones as a start.  They are a uniformity of the operational-tactical fundamentals  for structuring it; the trustworthiness of the results of  modeling; operativeness in the receipt of results; conformity to  the level of command; a systemic approach; standardization of  the indicators and standards used; and, uniformity of the  information base.    The requirement for uniformity of the  operational-tactical fundamentals of structuring the models  envisages the necessity of the complete realization of the basic  principles of the military arts, and first and foremost those  such as a determined concentration of efforts in the most  important areas, the uninterrupted nature of combat operations,  the comprehensive and coordinated application of all manpower  and resources, and uninterrupted command and control, support  and combat operations. This requirement, moreover, assumes the  observance of a uniform substance of the specific operation  (combat operations) and structure of the conceptual model, and a  formalized description of the processes using the corresponding  mathematical methods.    The trustworthiness of the results of modeling is  understood to mean a sufficiently precise reflection of the most  material aspects of the processes being modeled and the general  laws characteristic of them. Trustworthiness of the results can  be achieved not only through the modeling of the most  substantial aspects of the operation or combat operations, but  also through a correct regard for the connections between them  and a suitable regard for the various factors, conditions of the  situation and methods of combat and supporting operations.    The PVO formations, in my opinion, should take into account  the following basic factors and conditions of the situation in  order to fulfill the requirement of the trustworthiness of the  results in the model of an operation or combat operations.    Regarding the enemy:     -  the composition, basing, TTKh [tactical-performance  characteristics] and operating methods of enemy SVKN [air and  space offensive weaponry];    -  the combat readiness of SVKN;    -  the  employment of conventional and nuclear weapons, cruise missiles  launched from various platforms, long-range radar-detection and  reconnaissance-strike aircraft systems;    -  the fire and electronic  suppression of PVO Troops and assets;    -  the maneuvering  capabilities of SVN;    -  the capabilities of command-and-control and  navigational systems;    -  the capabilities for repeat operations by  SVN;    -  enemy losses in the course of repelling his strikes and  capabilities for reinforcing forces in various sectors;    -  and, the  level of enemy knowledge on the PVO system.       Regarding one's own forces:     -  composition, stationing, TTKh and operational methods;    -  the  combat readiness of units and large formations;    -  the employment  of conventional weaponry and missiles with special charges;    -  the  fire and electronic suppression of the enemy;    -  the maneuvering  capabilities of PVO Troops and assets;    -  the capabilities of  reconnaissance, command-and-control, guidance and support  systems;    -  the capabilities for repeat operations by PVO Troops  and assets;    -  interaction;    -  the stability of elements of the PVO  system;    -  troop losses;    -  restoration of the fighting ability of  units and large formations;    -  the availability of false positions  and forces;    -  and the utilization of reserves.       Regarding targets, conditions and the area of combat  operations:     -  targets in the defense and their characteristics;    -  the  state of the airfield network;    -  the radar environment;    -  the  electronic environment;    -  and the specific military-geographical  features of the area of combat operations.       Operativeness is understood to mean the  possibility of obtaining and making practical use of the results  for the necessary quantity of variations of modeling in the  rhythm of staff work. Evaluations of operativeness must take  into account the total time expended for the preparation of  data, the entry of that data into the computers, the machine  computations and issue of results to the display devices or  documentation, and for the operational-tactical analysis of the  results obtained.    Conformity to the level of command is understood  to mean the use, in a model, of information with a level of  detail and precision that is characteristic of this level of  command and control, and the depiction of the results of  modeling in a visual form that corresponds to the form and  content of the documents that are developed by the staff at the  given level. The requirement for conformity to the level of  command conditions the necessity, on the one hand, of  maintaining an equal degree of detail for each partial process,  and on the other of aggregating the indicators used to the  extent of ascension from the tactical to the strategic scale.  Higher-level models should thus make use of data obtained in  models from lower levels, in the form of summarized indicators  and standards. The horizontal links between models at lower  levels should be taken into account therein.    Important to ensure meeting the requirement for the  model to conform to the level of command is the selection  of the primary object (element) of the modeling. This question  remains unresolved up to the present. As a result, the  individual PVO asset is taken as the primary object in certain  models, for example, the subunit in others, and the unit or  larger formation etc. in still others, even though the model was  developed for one and the same level of command and control.    The selection of the primary object of modeling should be  made according to the following criteria:    First, the object should be the foundation of the structural  entity for a given level of command and control, through which  the composition of the field formation of the given level is  defined. The force composition of a fighter air regiment [IAP],  for example, is typified by the quantity of fighters, and a  surface-to-air missile brigade [ZRBR] or regiment by the  quantity of systems. The primary object of modeling for the  former is consequently the fighter, and for the latter the  system.    The composition of the PVO formation, as a rule, is  determined by the quantity of units and formations of the  branches of service, and the unit or formation could  consequently be considered the primary object for a model of the  operation.    Second, the object should have a significant influence on  the  results of the modeling. The results of the battle of an  individual system and fighter, for example, will be significant  for the ZRBR and IAP and insignificant for the large PVO  formation. The battalion and fighter are thus primary for a  model of battle, and the IAP and ZRBR for a model of the  operation.    Third, the elements of the object should be located on the  terrain in compact fashion. The IAP or ZRBR, say, could be  considered the primary object for the model of an operation,  since the elements of that object are located on the terrain in  relatively compact fashion, while the large formation or EW unit  could not be considered a primary object for the same model,  since it does not possess the trait of compactness, not to  mention the fact that the capabilities of individual EW  subunits, especially forward ones, could prove to have a  substantial influence on the results of modeling the operation.    The requirement for a systemic approach signifies  that the model should be a constituent element of a unified  system of software support for the command and control of troops  that is coordinated with others by aim, purpose, operational  allocation, composition of factors taken into account,  limitations and allowances, indicators and standards, system of  classifying and coding data, principles for the protection of  information, etc. Any RZ or model, in accordance with this  requirement, should be developed as a constituent element of the  whole and be characterized by a functional completeness, and  have the possibility of realization both autonomously and as  part of a definite system.    The requirement for the standardization of indicators  and standards consists of performing calculations and  modeling of combat operations using indicators and standards  that are coordinated among each other.    The uniformity of the information base assumes the  use of databases in the machine as the object of collective and  multipurpose use, and assurance of the uniformity of one and the  same data for various models and computational tasks.    [M. Zakharchuk] There are probably other special technical  requirements that support the reliable operational and thematic  substance of the mathematical models and computational tasks.  Could we dwell on those you listed? It will be no less  important, in my opinion, to clarify what properties a unified  system of software support for the command and control of troops  (SMOUV) should possess.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] First, the software support should reflect  the actual physical and information processes. If the staffs are  fed a flow of data being processed by computer, then the  officers preparing the proposals and making the decision must  combine the creative principle with the results of modeling and  computations. The SMOUV must consequently have an immediate  influence on command and control.    Second, the software support (models, RZs etc.) is, as it  were, the collective reasoning of people put into material form,  and should naturally provide intellectual support for the work  of staffs and other command elements.    Third, the SMOUV is inseparably linked with the theory of  command, since its structure and content depend on the structure  and content of the processes of command and control of the  troops. A direct and reciprocal link thus exists between the  theory of command and the SMOUV. The use of the SMOUV thus  stimulates the development of command theory, and the theory the  development of the SMOUV. The SMOUV acts as a uniting link  between the theory and practice of command.    Thus, there is the conclusion that the SMOUV is becoming an  organic constituent element of command and control, and should  have a substantial influence on the substance and methods of  staff work.    The properties cited provide grounds to consider it  expedient  to recognize software support for command and control as a new  category of the military arts, and the operational arts in  particular. This recognition provides a correct orientation for  theory, will make possible a more complete regard for the  requirements of practice and will lead to more energetic efforts  not only by the commanding officers and staffs, but also  military scholars on questions of improving command and control  of the troops at a qualitatively new level.    [M. Zakharchuk] In concluding our discussion I would ask  you,  Viktor Pavlovich, to provide at least a general outline of  promising directions in the development and improvement of  systems of software support for the troops.    [V.P. Sinitsyn] These would be, first and foremost, the  development of the methodological, operational-tactical,  mathematical and information foundations for constructing and  employing software support within the framework of a unified  system. The creation of scientific-methodological means and a  methodology of constructing the system and its elements, along  with the evaluation of the suitability of the models and the  effectiveness of their application, is an important area of this  work. General organizational-methodological foundations for the  development and incorporation of models and RZs are needed.    The creation of fundamentally newer and more suitable models  is a topical task. The problem of the optimal nature of the  decisions made is a central one in the command and control of  troops, and is directly linked with the quality of the models  and the computational tasks. The adoption of a model for use is  of an evaluative nature today. The use of such models  predetermines the necessity of ascertaining several variations  of the actions of the sides, with a quantitative evaluation of  each of them according to an accepted criterion. The method of  running through variations reduces the operativeness of command  and control, and forces a limitation on the number of  variations. The selection of the best from among variations  being considered does not give full confidence that it is the  optimal one, or meets the conditions of the situation to the  full extent. The creation of optimized models that make it  possible to devise the most acceptable variation for troop  operations under the set conditions of a situation is thus an  important task.    The development of techniques for the application of models  and computational tasks, the operational-tactical analysis of  the results obtained and the devising of new methods of staff  work with the use of software support should be considered a no  less important area.    In connection with the fact that the use of formalized  methods in the practical activity of commanding officers and  staffs to resolve many intellectual tasks is difficult, the  creation of expert systems is an exceedingly important and, at  the same time, extraordinarily complex task.    Particular attention should be devoted to researching the  problem of constructing expert systems. It would be expedient to  perform special, comprehensive scientific-research work, with  the aim of gradually creating such systems. Only the  availability and application of expert systems will provide  effective intellectual support for the work of staffs and other  command and control elements.    [M. Zakharchuk] Thank you for the discussion.    COPYRIGHT: "Vestnik PVO" 1993.</p>

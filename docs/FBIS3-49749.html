			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial commentary: "Test of Nerves"] </F>   [Text] Zhan Videnov has shown that he already knows how to  take risks. He went to 134 Rakovski Street [Union of Democratic  Forces-SDS headquarters] to hear with his own ears, face to  face, what the blue [SDS] leader thinks, and of course, in order  to be heard himself. In a state with democratic traditions  dialogue is the most direct way to the truth. Videnov was not  confused and he selected that way. Regardless of how arrogantly  Mr. Filip Dimitrov behaves, the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  has shown that it is a party of clear words. After all it was  the BSP and no one else that initiated the famous roundtable  four years ago. It was precisely this roundtable that confirmed  that the BSP is not afraid of dialogue. In this context the  visit to 134 Rakovski Street was not an incident or a casual  whim. It is a part of a deliberate course of behavior that has  already helped up with our hesitant steps in democracy.    The reaction to Videnov's appearance at the SDS headquarters  was not only stormy but also varied. Every interested  politician is trying to view it, interpret it, and use it in  accordance with his own interests. If you read DEMOKRATSIYA you  can see how much speculation can be squeezed in one article, the  irresponsible nature of which is evident not only regarding  relations with the political opponent, but also regarding the  SDS's own interest. If you read the declaration of the Civic  Alliance for the Republic you will understand what certain  political forces fear. It appears that the Bulgarian political  arena is still not prepared for normal, albeit unexpected,  meetings. Torn by suspicion, our society constantly seeks  something sensational or secret, and that confuses it. Certain  irresponsible journalists, who prefer fantasy to truth,  contribute to this situation.    Unfortunately, Videnov's visit to the SDS headquarters,  which  lasted 90 minutes, created confusion in certain BSP circles.  Responsible figures in the BSP regarded the visit as  irresponsible. They tend to see the visit as a compromise  serving the interests of the other side. This is wrong and it  must worry us not only because it breeds suspicion, but also  because it evokes alarm as a position. Already at the 14th  Congress, which created the BSP, it was loftily declared that  the BSP will be a party of dialogue, political contacts,  pluralism, and cooperation in all issues of democratic  development. Zhan Videnov was simply putting this statement  into effect. He went to Filip Dimitrov not in order to make  compromises or create intrigues, but to study the other side's  position and express the BSP position on certain issues. Those  issues are of national interest, and this relieves Videnov of  any hesitation he might have had about the meeting. It is  precisely in this element that those who were confused by the  meeting could not grasp the scope of the political task, and  they therefore became confused. What is amazing is that some of  those who became confused have never declared their opposition  to dialogue as the essence of socialist policy. On the  contrary, they often themselves participated in contacts with  different political forces.    Rejecting or not understanding Zhan Videnov's initiative is  one of the many typical mistakes that certain people allow in  their thinking. They often place their own political ambitions  above the political interest, or what is worse, in principle  they prefer confrontation to the complex but purposeful gambit.  We have often been able to convince ourselves that  confrontation builds up self- esteem, but it does not trace a  new road. It might improve our self-esteem in our own eyes at a  given moment, but it can never ensure our success. Indeed, the  great drama of the SDS lies in its unwillingness to understand  this simple truth. Why should we be the victims of the same  mistake? The dialogue Zhan Videnov proposed to our political  opponent does not undermine the BSP's prestige in any way. It  only shows that the BSP is the calmer and wiser political force  and that in the name of the great public interest it is prepared  to talk with everyone, even those who deliberately refuse to  take our real name into consideration.    It is time for all those who formulate the BSP's policy to  understand that a bold and unconventional move in relations with  others is better than the traditional fear of surprises.  Surprises are a part of the political "theater," and those who  create or welcome them win points in the political game. Zhan  Videnov's visit must be assessed on merit from this point of  view. He did not go to the SDS headquarters to seek prestige,  as DEMOKRATSIYA wrongly alleges, but to demonstrate prestige and  to show our society that the BSP has no fear of expressing its  opinion to anyone. This is more than useful at the beginning of  the 1994 political season. Tomorrow Filip Dimitrov will find it  much more difficult to cheat and maneuver, because he already  knows what the Socialists think not only about the situation  within the SDS itself, but also about the Presidency, the  cabinet, the work of parliament, the budget, the Election Law,  the future elections, the Supreme Judicial council, and many  other issues that should be resolved soon. Things were  expressed in a clear and open manner without any maneuvering.  Speculating with the issue is harmful. If speculations  nevertheless emerge, they will not change anything.    The BSP can be calm about the outcome of the meeting. It  will not complicate its position in society in any way. On the  contrary, it will only confirm its sober attitude toward all  issues discussed. I will again stress that a policy of dialogue  is better than a policy of covered cards. The purpose of the  meeting was not to demand sacrifices from anyone, pressurize  individual political forces, or preserve the status quo. It was  a meeting for a typical exchange of information. Therefore, no  one need imagine that there will be unexpected changes in the  political landscape. The poles remain. Nevertheless, it is  better for everyone that the poles hear each other before they  engage in their regular parliamentary and extraparliamentary  snowballs fights. After all, sometimes such fights can be  avoided for the sake of the common national tranquility.    This article could end here if the Presidency had not  expressed its opinion. Like certain political leaders, Dr.  Zhelev hastened to say that he did not like the meeting between  Zhan Videnov and Filip Dimitrov, and that the meeting was  prompted by some "severe crisis" in the BSP and the SDS. We  cannot speak for the SDS, but on behalf of the BSP we must say  that the president is alarmingly wrong, or is simply not aware  of the realities, or is a victim of his own imagination. There  are many things in the BSP, but no trace of a crisis. There are  different opinions and assessments of issues, even ideological  disputes, but for the time being at least there is nothing  serious that could jeopardize the monolithic character of the  party. It is and will certainly continue to be the biggest and  strongest Bulgarian political party. As a former member of our  party (and may the president forgive us for reminding him of  this), Zhelyu Zhelev knows very well that we, Socialists, have a  sense of responsibility and duty even when we quarrel. We were  not born yesterday and will not disappear tomorrow. Unlike his  blue ideas, our ideas have roots and a future. Therefore, if he  wants to be just, let him not confuse his wishful thinking with  reality. Otherwise he will err, and his post is such that the  smallest error could place him in a very uncomfortable  situation. The BSP is a sufficiently mature party and knows  precisely how to overcome its own weaknesses. Therefore, the  crisis the president invokes is not in the BSP, but somewhere  else. Perhaps somewhere near him, but let us not pursue this.  The gentleman is smart enough to answer this for himself.    And so an absolutely normal dialogue between two political  forces is causing serious excitement in Bulgaria. This is at  once wonderful and alarming. It shows that society has great  expectations, but its nerves are rather weak. We still have not  achieved the psychological balance we need. Suspicion still is  stronger than confidence. However, let us not despair. We need  time. Many more meetings and talks are necessary for us to  realize that it is better to talk to each other than pass each  other like deaf people. In this sense Zhan Videnov has DUMA's  support, as well as the support of all those who regard his  political initiative as positive.</p>

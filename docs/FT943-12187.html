			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Move to extend Israeli deals Mr Richard Gephardt, the US House majority leader, and 28 other House members are proposing an expansion of the US-Israel free trade agreement to include countries which sign comprehensive peace accords with Israel, Nancy Dunne writes from Washington. The proposal is supported by many Democrats who have been prominent on both sides of trade debates. The US and Israel signed a free trade pact in 1985, spurring an increase in trade between the two countries. 'Expanding this agreement will require the US and Israel to negotiate with each new party for reciprocal elimination of trade barriers,' Mr Gephardt said.</p>

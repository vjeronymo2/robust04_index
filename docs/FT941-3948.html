			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / People: Calvin Klein takes strides to Europe Calvin Klein, the American designer so beloved by the well heeled, has just woken up to the fact that Europe is big and rich and he can't think why he neglected it for so long. 'I just had no idea my ranges would be so successful,' he says. 'I've lived most of my life in New York and I design for the women I know. I thought this sort of modern, working, liberated woman was mainly found on my side of the Atlantic. What I have discovered to my great surprise is that women all over the world now want to dress that way.' Calvin Klein's life has clearly been full of lovely surprises. Underwear was another. He had no idea it would be so big. In the first year (November 1983-1984) that his underwear designs hit the stores, women bought some Dollars 70m worth of fly-front boxer shorts, briefs with white elastic bands, and assorted T-shirts. Nobody, not even Calvin predicted that. 'I just tried to take it beyond the classic and the predictable, to give it more meaning. So now people lounge in it, swim in it, go out in it.' And, he might have added, leave the tops of their jeans undone so that their excellent taste in underwear can be more widely noted. The other day he sold the underwear company to Warnaco for nearly Dollars 70m. Fragrance was another of his happy surprises. His fragrance business, owned by Unilever, does 'half a billion dollars a year in the US &amp; Europe.' That is nothing like as large as the fragrance businesses of cosmetic houses such as Estee Lauder or Revlon but it is big business for a single American designer. A less happy surprise was the financial difficulty in which he found himself in 1993 when David Geffen, the Hollywood producer and a long-time fan, rescued him by buying up some long-term debt 'because Calvin was having trouble with repayment of the principal.' The sticky moment seems past. Expansion is on Klein's mind. He plans to open his Calvin Klein shops in almost all major cities (St. Moritz, Barcelona and Zurich have got them - Geneva, Hong Kong, Singapore are on the drawing-board, London, Paris and Milan are being considered). In addition he wants to manufacture in Europe, which could bring his prices down by some 25 per cent. Given that a suit from his top range, The Collection, costs about Pounds 1,200, and a sweater some Pounds 350, this would seem a good move. As he puts it, 'if they are selling now at those prices, imagine the business we could do if we can get them down.' The financial dimensions of Klein's business are hard to establish. The holding company is privately owned; figures are a matter of guesswork. Calvin Klein himself professes not to keep track of these details. Fortune magazine estimated in 1981 that his personal annual income before tax was some Dollars 8.5m. The Calvin Klein organisation says its worldwide sales at wholesale prices are more than Dollars 1bn a year, including licensed products. Klein is 51-years-old, tall and thin with the air of a slightly rumpled, world-weary Yves Montand. Then he starts to talk and he couldn't be anything but a New Yorker. He has considerable charm and knows it. Born in the Bronx he was fascinated by clothes from an early age and started to sketch them at five. In 1969 he produced a small collection of six coats and three dresses which by accident were seen by a Bonwit Teller buyer. From that moment his career took off. Like all the most commercially successful designers he has a business partner, Barry Schwartz, a childhood friend who gave him the Pounds 2,000 he needed to launch himself and who is credited with much of the business acumen. Klein has a clear idea of his ultimate customer. 'I don't design for trophy wives or the woman who likes to decorate herself for her man. I dress the woman who is very busy. She has a job and children and boardroom meetings and lunches. She goes out to the theatre or to see friends. For this she needs clothes but clothes that are soft, easy, comfortable.' In common with Armani, with whom his clothes are often compared, he carries the cult of simplicity to almost oppressive lengths. The girls in their entourages are almost interchangeable - open-faced, bare of make-up, simply cut shining hair, no nail-polish and sober colours (navy-blue, charcoal grey, black) comprise the prevailing aesthetic. His work exemplifies certain truths about fashion. While fashion may be about change, truly beautiful clothes need no adornment. Where there is fine cut no tricks are needed. To the charge that he is not a genuinely creative designer Calvin Klein suggests that what he offers may be subtle but is not without innovation. 'I give women a reason to buy something new by using a new fabric, a new shape, a new combination, new colours - but the philosophy behind the clothing never changes.' All through the eighties when many were producing what he called 'frankly trashy clothes' he went on doing his own thing. 'I don't know how to do anything else,' he says. When it comes to menswear he designs the sort of clothes he likes to wear himself. 'They should, above all, be comfortable.' In the week after the fashion industry has been short of inspiration, beauty and glamour, it might give the international catwalk kings and queens, cause to reflect that while their models are strutting about in furry G-strings and lycra-stretch mini-skirts, Calvin Klein is doing great business by offering cool, sober, classic clothes that speak of class and that fit effortlessly into the lives of women the world over.</p>

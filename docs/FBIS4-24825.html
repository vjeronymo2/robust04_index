			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff reporter Ho Sui-i (0149 4482 </F> 1837): "Guangzhou Adopts Strong Measures To Ban Illegal Land  Use and Construction"]    [Text] Guangzhou, 31 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- At a special  meeting today, Guangzhou Construction Committee Director Ou  Guangquan said: In view of illegal land use and illegal  construction in Guangzhou, which continue to spread despite  consistent efforts to ban them, Guangzhou will adopt strong  measures to exert pressure on the enterprises in relevant  quarters.    The measures provide that all documents on land and  construction projects approved ultra vires or through the abuse  of power are invalid, that all approved documents and blueprints  for such projects which have yet to begin must be withdrawn for  cancellation, that all such projects under development must be  immediately stopped and given the maximum fine by the relevant  departments in accordance with laws and regulations, and that  all units which have undertaken to design or develop such  illegal projects will be ordered to stop designing and  development and will have their professional grade lowered or  their professional licenses canceled.    If a unit stubbornly develops an illegal project to make it  an accomplished fact, the authorities in charge of the land will  not recognize its property rights and must not allow it to be  bought or sold, inherited, given as a present, rented out,  transferred, or mortgaged; the notary office will not notarize  it; the water supply company will not supply water to it; the  electricity supply company will not supply electricity to it;  the police station will not allow it to be occupied; post and  telecommunications departments will not offer postal services or  telecommunications service to it; the industrial and commercial  department will not issue a business license to it; and the fire  service, environmental protection, and public health and  quarantine departments will not grant it professional  recognition.    Relevant persons said: According to earlier surveys, it was  discovered that in the districts of Baiyun, Huangpu, and Fangcun  in the suburbs of Guangzhou, foreign businessmen have been  deceived. They had invested hastily in projects and built  standard plants or apartments without obtaining valid documents.  Their projects were eventually found to be illegal through  inspection, and they were fined and ordered to cancel  development and planning for their projects.    Moreover, relevant persons reminded people that they should  be cautious about exaggerated advertisements in newspapers and  on the radio and said that if the property had no legal  documentation or documents were lacking, consumers would always  fall victim.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 9 KYODO -- Japanese and U.S.  semiconductor industry leaders agreed Thursday [9 June] to  cooperate in promoting the use of personal computers in Japan as  a means of increasing the U.S. share of Japan's chip market.    The accord was reached at an annual meeting held in Tokyo  between the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ)  and the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA).    Japanese and U.S. industry leaders, however, remain apart  over whether to include a 20 percent foreign market share goal  in a new bilateral chip accord.    Hidehiko Yoshida, chairman of the EIAJ's Users' Committee of  Foreign Semiconductors, told a news conference that the Japanese  chip industry will disseminate the usefulness of personal  computers by citing examples of popular use in the United States.    Both parties also agreed to a design-in promotion campaign,  a  mutual dispatch of trade missions and publicity of success  stories in Japan involving U.S. chipmakers, said Yoshida, senior  executive vice president of Toshiba Corp.    "Japanese semiconductor users continue to look forward to  working with businessmen and engineers of foreign-owned  companies in charting future cooperation between our highly  competitive industries," Yoshida said.    Other Japanese chip industry officials said Japan and the  U.S. have also agreed to cooperate in solving environmental  issues involved in chip use and standardizing  semiconductor-manufacturing equipment.    The U.S. demanded that the 20 percent foreign share goal in  Japan's chip market be continued in a pact to replace the  current one that expires in 1996.    The U.S. industry claimed such a goal can be a useful  benchmark for measuring the openness of the Japanese market, the  officials said.    But the EIAJ's Yoshida countered the argument, saying  figures  are not necessary if the Japanese side makes efforts to expand  use of foreign chips.</p>

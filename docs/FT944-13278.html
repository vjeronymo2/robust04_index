			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Rumbold quits lobbying directorship Dame Angela Rumbold, the deputy chairman of the Tory party, last night resigned as executive director of a political lobbying company, amid allegations that it had been involved in negotiations over the channel tunnel rail link. Dame Angela, one of the party's most respected figures, surprised MPs by standing down from Decision Makers, a prominent lobbying group. The Tory MP gave no reason for her decision to resign, and no specific allegations of impropriety have been raised against her by Labour MPs. But earlier this week a newspaper drew attention to a successful campaign by the lobbying company to put the Channel tunnel rail link station at Ebbsfleet in Kent rather than Stratford in east London. The article in the Evening Standard claimed that cement company Blue Circle, which owns the land chosen for the site of the station, employed Decision Makers to press its case with the govern-ment. According to the Standard members of the lobbying company met government ministers, including Mr John MacGregor, the former transport secretary. Dame Angela, who has regularly declared her position with Decision Makers in the Commons register of members interests, said yesterday that she had done nothing wrong, but had decided to step down following the newspaper report. She told the paper earlier this week: 'I'm very open about it. I've absolutely nothing to hide at all. Everyone knows perfectly well where I was coming from. I wasn't going in to meetings as deputy chairman of the party. I was going in as a representative of Decision Makers.' Earlier this week Mr Bryan Wilson, Labour industry spokesman, referred the reports about Ebbsfleet to the Commons committee on members' interests. However, Labour MPs expressed surprise yesterday that Dame Angela had decided to step down when no specific allegations had been levelled against her. Mr Wilson said: 'Coming on the heels of the Ebbsfleet story, Dame Angela's resignation appears to represent an admission that a conflict of interest has existed.' Mr Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West, demanded a statement by Dr Brian Mawhinney, the transport secretary, over whether he had been influenced by Dame Angela in the choice of station. Dame Angela, 61, is a former minister at the Department of Education and more recently served as minister of state at the Home Office. She first entered parliament 12 years ago. After the 1992 general election she was given the deputy chairmanship of the Tory Party and was put in charge of recruiting new parliamentary candidates.</p>

			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Business Travel: High-cost connections - The price of using cards to make phone calls from hotels Business travellers once had to accept extortionate hotel telephone charges as a fact of life. Then came the calling card, enabling them to avoid hotel rates by using freephone or special connection numbers, which credit the charge to a phone or credit card account. Not to be outwitted, many hotels have reacted by barring the access numbers and placing a hefty levy - euphemistically called a 'connection fee' - on those wanting to dial access numbers via hotel operators. Travellers intending to spend much time on the phone should check on hotel policy. One call could save a large part of the final bill. In the US, where more than 100m citizens now have calling cards, most hotels long ago caved into consumer demand and allowed calling card holders to dial direct. The standard access charge is 75 cents. Access codes for AT&amp;T and the other carriers are often advertised in bedrooms. By contrast, London hotels generally still try to hold on to their extra income from phone charges. The Dorchester was the worst offender in a random survey of six central London hotels, levying a Pounds 2.50 premium on any call via an 0800 freephone number. The Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch charges a Pounds 2 connection fee for all access numbers for charge cards, including 0500, 0800 and 144 for BT. The Regent's Park Hilton charges Pounds 1.50, and the Holiday Inn at King's Cross Pounds 1. Two of the six levy no charge. The Grosvenor House Hotel in Park Lane does not bar any numbers. Better still, the Beaufort Hotel in Knightsbridge neither bars numbers nor charges any mark-up from standard BT tariffs for direct-dialled calls. 'We believe we are the only hotel in London to charge guests straight BT prices, nothing extra,' it says. BT and Mercury say there is little they can do except 'try to persuade' hotels to charge lower fees. Holders of American Express cards in the UK will be able to use them as phone calling cards under a deal signed by Amex and Mercury, the UK phone company, last week. After applying for a personal number, card holders can charge calls to their Amex account at Mercury calling card rates - which are generally lower than BT's but higher than US cards for transatlantic calls. Corporate card holders are eligible immediately; all 1m Amex card holders in the UK can apply later this year. Do you have any tales of extortionate hotel telephone charges or restrictive  practises?

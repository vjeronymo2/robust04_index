			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Trinity Holdings shows 38% rise RAPIDLY expanding exports helped Trinity Holdings, the maker of Dennis and other specialist vehicles which came to the market a year ago, lift interim pre-tax profits by 38 per cent from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 4.7m. The figure, achieved on sales 27 per cent higher at Pounds 62.7m, maintains an improving trend first set in train by a management buy-out led by current chairman and chief executive Mr Geoff Hollyhead in 1989. Earnings per share were 12.4p, against 10.8p last time. Mr Hollyhead, reporting first-half export sales 71 per cent higher at Pounds 26.3m, yes-terday held out the prospect of further increased sales in the second half as a Pounds 38m contract for its Duple (Metsec) subsidiary to supply 2,500 bus bodies to Sri Lanka gains momentum. Yesterday's declaration of a first post-flotation interim dividend of 2p, against nil last year, also comes just a few days after the return of senior Trinity executives from Malaysia, where they signed agreements for a bus-making joint venture during Mr John Major's trade-boosting visit to the Asian state. The venture is with UMW, a Malaysian industrial group which has an annual turnover of some Pounds 500m and produces a variety of road, rail and heavy equipment vehicles. Mr Hollyhead said yesterday it would result in exports of about 100 UK-supplied bus kits next year, with a poten-tial of about 1,000 units a year towards the end of the decade. Initially the buses will be assembled from kits produced by Trinity's UK operating companies - chassis manufacturer Dennis Specialist Vehicles, and Duple (Metsec), which makes bus bodies. However, local component content will be increased over the next few years as Malaysia's emerging motor components industry establishes itself more firmly. In this year's first half Trinity's operating companies produced 1,533 bodies and chassis, compared with 1,229 in the same period last year. This was in spite of continuing depressed conditions in the UK bus and specialist vehicle market. The number of employees rose by 14 per cent in the first half, to about 1,300. By the end of this year another 10 per cent rise is expected to cope with lengthening order books. Mr Hollyhead said the current Pounds 75m is double that of the year-ago period. A Pounds 1.57m tax bill (Pounds 1.19m) left net profit at Pounds 3.18m, compared with Pounds 2.23m last year. Trinity envisages using the Malaysian operation as a manufacturing base to seek wider markets in the Asia Pacific region. It is taking a maximum-allowed 35 per cent equity stake in the venture, which is being capitalised initially at Pounds 20m, half in equity with the remainder in loans. Trinity is based at Warwick and has plants at Worcester, Halifax, Tipton and Guildford.</p>

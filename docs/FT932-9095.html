			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Motoring costs 'outstrip inflation' THE cost of motoring in Britain is rising faster than the rate of inflation, the Automobile Association claimed yesterday. The average motorist driving 10,000 miles a year will pay between Pounds 130 and Pounds 375 more in 1993 than last year depending on the size of car. Increases in insurance premiums, road tax and fuel duty are the main factors in raising motoring costs along with increases in new car list prices. According to the AA the average cost of running a 1.4 to 2 litre car is about Pounds 4,559 a year or 45.6p a mile based on 10,000 miles of driving. This includes total standing charges of Pounds 2,909 - car licence (Pounds 125), insurance (Pounds 968), depreciation (Pounds 1,752), road organisation membership (Pounds 64) - or 29.1p per mile. On average, motoring costs for a car with a 1.4 to 2 litre petrol engine are expected to rise by 5.5 per cent this year. The Department of Transport yesterday published data on accident rates for different makes and models of cars. Its information, based on 70,000 accident statistics from 1989-1991, lists 90 models. It says newer private cars have lower casualty rates than older cars and that the driver of a small car is about 50 per cent more likely to be injured when involved in an accident than the driver of a large car. The Consumers Association said it was concerned that the information on car safety in a department leaflet was difficult for consumers to use and potentially misleading. Cars: Make and Model. HMSO, Pounds 6.30.</p>

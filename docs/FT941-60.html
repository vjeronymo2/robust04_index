			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: BLP A buoyant performance from its North American Woodtape edgebanding division helped BLP Group, the USM-quoted wood laminates and veneer company, to swing round from a pre-tax loss of Pounds 605,000 to a Pounds 2.38m profit in 1993. The profit included exceptional credits of Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 202,000 debits) of which Pounds 1.54m related to a write-back of a provision against a loan to the ESOP trust. A further Pounds 368,000 profit related to the sale of the London site and subsequent rationalisation and reorganisation of the UK business. In view of the improvement, BLP is restoring the dividend with a small final payment of 1p. Mr Malcolm Cohen, chairman, said this was 'intended to be a reflection of our cautious optimism for the future prospects of the group.' Turnover in 1993 increased by 21 per cent to Pounds 27.9m. Earnings per share including exceptional items were 28.2p (15.3p losses), while excluding these, losses were 0.6p (12.3p).</p>

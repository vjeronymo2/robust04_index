W. de  Klerk has accused the African National Congress [ANC] of  deliberately sidelining the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and its  leader, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] radio news reports.    Addressing businessmen in Sandton near Johannesburg on  Monday, President de Klerk said this was one of the reasons why  the violence in the country could not be halted. The violence,  he said, had been largely attributed by the Goldstone Commission  to hostility between the ANC and the IFP. He castigated both  organisations, saying their leaders could do more to end the  violence.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Dark clouds obscure Disney's star - A difficult year could get even tougher This year is rapidly shaping up to be Walt Disney's 'annus horribilus'. In the past eight months, the US entertainment group has endured a string of setbacks. They have included: the loss of the company's highly-regarded president, Mr Frank Wells, in a helicopter accident in April; the temporary incapacitation, following emergency heart bypass surgery, of its chairman, Mr Michael Eisner; a politically embarrassing tussle with historians over plans to build a new Disney theme park near Civil War battlefields in Virginia; another costly financial reorganisation of Euro Disney and declining attendance at its US theme parks; and a series of disappointing performances from its live-action (as opposed to animated) movies. While the group has scored some successes at the box office, most notably the triumph of its animated film The Lion King, a cloud appears to have followed Disney around all year. Last week, the company suffered another serious blow when Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, the widely-respected film executive who helped turn Disney's moribund movie division into the most profitable studio in Hollywood, announced he would be leaving the company when his contract expires at the end of September. Mr Katzenberg is departing because Mr Eisner would not give him Mr Wells' old job as president. Although Mr Katzenberg had hankered after a bigger management role at Disney, and had his sights on succeeding his long-time mentor as chairman, Mr Eisner did not feel the studio chief had the right credentials to be the number two. Although Disney moved quickly to offset the impact of the loss - appointing a new studio chief from within and unveiling a restructuring of the film entertainment division - nagging questions remain. Can Mr Eisner, who relied so heavily upon the late Mr Wells' support and counsel, run Disney single-handed? Who, if anyone, is best-placed to succeed Mr Eisner as chairman? And will Disney's hugely profitable animated films unit prove as successful without Mr Katzenberg at the helm? Disney has been quick to rebuff suggestions that Mr Eisner needs help running the company. An experienced lawyer and negotiator, the 62-year old Mr Wells played a crucial management role at the company, overseeing Disney's day-to-day operations as well as helping to build its longer-term strategies. Yet Mr Eisner, who described Mr Wells as 'the glue that held the place together', has chosen not to replace him. Instead, the Disney chairman has taken on the additional post of president, and passed on many of the administrative duties to Mr Sanford Litvack, head of the company's legal and human resources departments, and now its chief of operations. Mr Wells' deal-making skills, however, are likely to be missed, especially as Disney faces some tough decisions, such as how to position itself on the information superhighway, and whether to move aggressively into the broadcast television business by acquiring a US network. If Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president raised only a few eyebrows in the first few months after Mr Wells' death, it is now being questioned widely following Mr Eisner's heart problems. Although his doctors say he will make a full recovery, speculation about the succession issue will not die down, and is likely to intensify now that Mr Katzenberg is leaving. The company, however, is sticking to its line that Disney's management team is deep enough to provide Mr Eisner with all the support he requires. Mr Raymond Watson, a Disney board member and former chairman of the company, says there is no need to anoint a successor to Mr Eisner just yet. 'You don't decide who is going to replace a 52-year old CEO when that person's contract has another five years to go.' Mr Watson also insists Mr Eisner's decision not to appoint a new president should not be second-guessed. 'Who is the right person, or persons, who can do the kind of things that Frank Wells did? That's a call Michael Eisner has to make. 'This has a lot to do with the situation with Jeffrey Katzenberg. Jeffrey Katzenberg was an outstanding executive in his field. But the question was: would he be as effective in a role that is essentially complementary to Michael Eisner? Michael decided he wouldn't. And I agreed with him on that.' Another who agrees with that decision is Mr Christopher Dixon, an entertainment industry analyst with the Wall Street firm PaineWebber. He believes the restructuring of Disney's film entertainment division announced last week will make Mr Eisner's job easier. The restructuring involved splitting the film entertainment division in two. Disney's highly-successful television business and its nascent telecommunications operations will now be run as a separate unit by Mr Richard Frank, who had been head of television at Disney's studio arm. The remainder - the motion pictures production and distribution business - will be run by Mr Joe Roth, formerly head of Disney's Caravan Pictures offshoot, whose chief task will be to revitalise the lacklustre live-action films unit. These changes, say Mr Dixon, are part of a process of turning Disney into a more decentralised company. Its individual businesses - theme parks, films, television, music, merchandising, and now telecommunications - have grown so fast it now makes sense to split them up, and to have each run by their own specialist managements. These are changes that other large, diversified entertainment groups, such as Time Warner and Viacom, have gone through, says Mr Dixon. For Disney, the PaineWebber analyst says, 'the restructuring goes a long way to helping push management down into the divisions.' While the changes in the film division should give Mr Eisner more time to concentrate on Disney's longer-term strategies, he will have to keep a close eye on the company's most profitable unit - the animated film operation - when Mr Katzenberg leaves. Although the outgoing studio chief earned much of the credit for reviving the animated films business, company insiders now say Mr Roy Disney, the founder's nephew, played as crucial a role as anyone in producing blockbusters like Aladdin and The Lion King. Analysts believe that with Mr Disney at the helm of animation, Disney's long run of successes should continue. Breathing new life into the theme parks, sustaining the success of the animation films and reviving the live-action pictures, plotting Disney's course on the information-superhighway: these are some of the biggest tasks now facing Mr Eisner and his top lieutenants. If 1994 has been a difficult year so far, the next 12 months could prove even tougher.</p>

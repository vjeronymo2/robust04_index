			<p>CSO     [Text] The Environment Agency will launch a three-year  program beginning in this fiscal year to survey a variety of  methods for rendering harmless substances that destroy the ozone  layer such as special and substitute freons. The agency intends  to survey existing methods of disposing of industrial waste as  well as newly developing methods of disposal, pursue the  commercialization of the latter methods and link the study to  the construction of a social infrastructure for disposal of  substances that destroy the ozone layer.    To be targeted in the survey will be the rotary kiln method  currently used in the disposal of industrial waste, the cement  kiln method used in conjunction with the manufacture of cement,  and the plasma decomposition method being developed by the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry's Institute of  Industrial Technology. The survey will include a review of  issues that should be handled by the government in the future  and will involve the effects of disposal methods in terms of  whether they are able to dispose of hazardous waste without  adversely affecting the ozone layer and an inventory of the  number of disposal sites with specialized equipment using the  best possible existing technology. Sources at the Comprehensive  Air Control Section say, "We hope to clarify the advantages and  disadvantages of various methods and expeditiously establish  systems for disposal of substances that destroy the ozone layer."</p>

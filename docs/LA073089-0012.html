			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILLY AND ROB  </P> <P> The superficiality of Hollywood continually amazes me. Gregg Kilday writes at  length about the close friendship between Billy Crystal and Rob Reiner, about  their special bond, in his July 16 article, "When Billy Met Rob."  </P> <P> The article then discusses why it took director Reiner so long to cast Crystal  in his new picture, "When Harry Met Sally. . . ." After balking at script  changes requested by Richard Dreyfuss, whom Reiner wanted for the role, and  "after considering a long list of actors, (Reiner) finally made the call to  Crystal."  </P> <P> Crystal is quoted as saying that Reiner told him: "I had to see everybody, I  had to go through the process just to make sure you're the perfect guy."  </P> <P> Good friends don't snowjob each other like that. Hollywood is a place for  business, but for special friendships . . . I don't think so.  </P> <P> DANIEL ENRIGHT  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P></p>

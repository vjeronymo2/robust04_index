			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BLACK DEMOCRATS TAKE CAPITOL VICTORY TOUR  </P> <P> Victorious black Democrats toured the Capitol today, and L. Douglas Wilder said  his triumph in the Virginia governor's race proved that "Americans have come of  age."  </P> <P> During a meeting with Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), Wilder  joked about the narrowness of his margin -- a majority his Republican opponent  still questions.  </P> <P> Turning to David N. Dinkins, mayor-elect of New York City, Wilder congratulated  him and other Democrats, "some of whom had landslide victories like I did."  </P> <P> Wilder was asked if racism was the reason he ran behind other Democratic  candidates for statewide office, and he replied, "It says I had a very negative  campaign being waged against me and my ticket-mates didn't."  </P> <P> Democrats were jubilant as they tallied gains that included the governor's  mansion in New Jersey as well as the State Assembly and the election of blacks  as governor of Virginia and mayor of New York City.  </P> <P> Analysts of political trends among blacks hailed the results not only in  Virginia and New York but also in such cities as Seattle; New Haven, Conn.;  Cleveland and Durham, N.C., as "a new direction."  </P> <P> Democratic Party Chairman Ron Brown, appearing with Wilder and Dinkins, said he  believes that the election demonstrated that the Republican Party's stance on  abortion is "an untenable position." He said he believes that President Bush  has "painted himself into a corner" by taking a strong anti-abortion position.  </P> <P> Brown said Tuesday's election results show the Democratic Party "is not only  alive and well, but strong and getting stronger."  </P></p>

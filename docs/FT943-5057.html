			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / People: Crawford relocates to Scottish Enterprise Scottish Enterprise, the development organisation for Scotland outside the Highlands, has put most of its key operations into a single unit and made Robert Crawford, below, its managing director. Crawford, 43, is currently director of Locate in Scotland, Scotland's inward investment agency. The new unit, called the national operations group, will incorporate Locate in Scotland, as well as Scottish Enterprise's Scottish and international operations division, run by Bob Downes, and its business development division under Russel Griggs. A new director will be sought for Locate in Scotland. The new group is being created by Crawford Beveridge, Scottish Enterprise's chief executive, to integrate different parts of the organisation dealing with businesses.

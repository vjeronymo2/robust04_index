			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHANGE ON DIAMOND BILL WASN'T TIED TO DONATION, DYMALLY SAYS  </P> <P> Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) acknowledged Thursday that he altered his  support for sanctions against South Africa diamonds after meeting with a  diamond importer who later gave $34,200 to an educational foundation at the  suggestion of a Dymally aide.  </P> <P> Dymally, however, vehemently denied that he changed his position in response to  a request from the diamond merchant, Maurice Tempelsman, or that he was even  aware of the contribution, which was earmarked for a scholarship fund bearing  the congressman's name.  </P> <P> While he later received a $2,000 speaking fee from the foundation, Dymally said  in an interview, he donated the same amount to the scholarship fund for high  school students in his congressional district.  </P> <P> "Nobody influences Dymally with any contribution, and I don't (care) how much  money he has," Dymally said.  </P> <P> Tempelsman, chairman of Lazare Kaplan International of New York, said in a  written statement that he met Dymally on April 19, 1988, and expressed his fear  that a law barring South African diamond imports would be impossible to enforce  because diamonds from many countries are commingled by suppliers and later  cannot be distinguished from each other. Tempelsman said Dymally asked his firm  to draft a proposed amendment in sanctions legislation.  </P> <P> As a buyer of uncut South African diamonds, the firm could have been crippled  by strong sanctions, Tempelsman said.  </P> <P> An amendment authorizing a study on distinguishing South African diamonds from  gems mined elsewhere was offered on Dymally's behalf and approved the next day  by a House subcommittee. The bill was approved by the House but died when the  Senate failed to act on it that year.  </P> <P> Dymally, however, said he introduced the amendment at the request of Botswana,  a major diamond-producing country, and of black groups that felt that the  original broad language on diamond imports might have the effect of killing the  bill.  </P> <P> Asked about a report in the Washington Post that Lazare Kaplan's Washington  lobbyist, Howard Marlowe, provided the draft amendment to his office, Dymally  replied: "I don't recall details of those meetings. . . . I don't recall  getting any language or anything like that. The staff handled it."  </P></p>

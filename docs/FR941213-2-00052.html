			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1. Region V: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Region X: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be selected through a competitive process. This notice solicits applications from organizations interested in participating in the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants selected to participate as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will be expected to present six courses: four general industry OSHA courses: Course 204A, Machinery and Machine Guarding Standards; Course 501, A Guide to Voluntary Compliance in Safety and Health; Course 521, OSHA Guide to Voluntary Compliance in the Industrial Hygiene Area; and Course 600, Collateral Duty Course for Other Federal Agencies; and two constructions industry course: Course 500, Instructor Course in Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry and Course 510, Occupational Safety and Health Standards for the Construction Industry. Additional information about each of these courses is in the appendix to this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants will be selected based upon their occupational safety and health experience, their nonacademic training background, the availability of classroom and lodging facilities, and access to transportation. OSHA will support the program by providing curriculum outlines, masters of student handouts, and orientation to OSHA course presentation. OSHA also will provide assistance in presenting and/or answering questions on OSHA policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project will be fifteen months in duration. OSHA will monitor each of the new OSHA Training Institute Education Centers to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs. If performance is satisfactory at the end of the fifteen-month period, OSHA will enter into a new agreement for a two-year period. Continuation of this agreement will be dependent on continued satisfactory performance and mutual interest of the parties in continuing the OSHA Training Institute Education Center program. OSHA may initiate modifications to agreements to increase or decrease the number of different OSHA courses offered by the OSHA Training Institute Education Centers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Eligibility <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Any nonprofit public or private college or university is eligible to apply. Any other nonprofit organization that can demonstrate that training or education is part of its mission and that more than 50 percent of its staff and dollar resources is devoted to training or education is also eligible to apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to meeting the eligibility criteria, applicants must have a physical presence in the Region for which they are applying. For example, an eligible national organization based in San Francisco that has a training facility in Chicago would have a physical presence in Region V. On the other hand, a national organization based in New York City that rents hotel space to provide training at multiple sites around the county would be considered to have a physical presence only in New York and would not be qualified to apply. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A training or educational institution may elect to apply for this program in partnership with a safety and health organization that is not primarily a training organization. For example, a university could enter into an agreement with a labor union that provides for the use of university classrooms and faculty supplemented by union safety and health professionals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If two or more organizations wish to apply as a consortium, a training or educational member of the consortium must be designated as the lead organization. OSHA will only enter into a nonfinancial agreement with the lead organization. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Financial Considerations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Organizations selected as OSHA Training Institute Education Centers will not be provided funding by OSHA to support this effort. The Centers will be expected to support their OSHA training through their normal tuition and fee structures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Length of Project <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The project will start July 1, 1995, and will run for fifteen months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> OSHA Training Institute Education Center Responsibilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Each OSHA Training Institute Education Center will be responsible for the following. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

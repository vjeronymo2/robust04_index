			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Philip McClellan] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, May 18 (AFP) -- Cambodian co-premiers  Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen said Wednesday they had  agreed to hold peace talks in Pyongyang with the Khmer Rouge  without preconditions, in response to an appeal by King Norodom  Sihanouk.    The co-premiers had sent an official letter to the king  "saying that we are ready to go to Pyongyang without ceasefire,  without preconditions," Prince Ranariddh told journalists at  Phnom Penh airport. "Let talks begin," he added.    He said a ceasefire that had been a precondition for holding  the talks -- which are also to be attended by National Assembly  chairman Chea Sim -- had blocked the peace process.    "We have to do something to overcome the deadlock and my  father (King Sihanouk) said the only one thing to do is to have  talks without a ceasefire," he added.    "We are going to Pyongyang because we believe that we will  have peace and national reconciliation, otherwise we would not  go," he said when asked if he felt optimistic.    Hun Sen said the talks, beginning on May 27, would be based  on a peace plan put forward by King Sihanouk, but added that the  government had yet to get a response from Khmer Rouge nominal  leader Khieu Samphan regarding the proposal.    King Sihanouk has proposed that certain "acceptable" members  of the Khmer Rouge be given senior cabinet posts in the  government in exchange for giving up their zones, ceasing all  guerrilla activities and merging their fighters with the royal  armed forces.    Prince Ranariddh has downplayed Khmer Rouge guerrilla  activities as "hit and run," but said that the rebel "threat"  had to be stopped for the sake of the country, adding that King  Sihanouk's proposal was the best chance for peace.    Asked whether he thought foreign military aid would escalate  the Cambodian civil war, the prince said that "insecurity" was  rife in Cambodia, and that action had to be taken against the  Khmer Rouge.    But he added that weapons would not be enough and that  Cambodia was in dire need of development and civil programs, as  well as a restructuring of its armed forces.    King Sihanouk last week appealed for military aid from the  United States, France and Australia "to save Cambodia from the  yoke of the Khmer Rouge."    Prince Ranariddh confirmed Monday that the government had  requested military support from western powers to fight the  Khmer Rouge, a move the rebel faction has condemned as meddling  in Cambodia's internal affairs.    The co-premiers were seeing off King Sihanouk who left for  Beijing for medical treatment two weeks earlier than originally  scheduled, citing his frustration at the failure of Cambodia's  politicians to accept his peace plan.    The king Tuesday called on Khmer Rouge nominal leader Khieu  Samphan and Hun Sen to bury the hatchet and proposed holding  peace talks on May 27 at his residence in North Korea. But in  an interview published Wednesday in the Cambodia Daily, the king  had expressed pessimism at seeing the peace plan get off the  ground, partly because he said Hun Sen was strongly opposed to  "any flexibility vis a vis the Khmer Rouge."    The Khmer Rouge were responsible for the deaths of more than  a million Cambodians during a four-year reign of terror that  ended when Vietnamese troops ousted them from power in late  1978. The Khmer Rouge signed the 1991 Paris peace accords but  refused to participate in the UN-sponsored general elections in  1991, and have continued to wage guerrilla warfare.</p>

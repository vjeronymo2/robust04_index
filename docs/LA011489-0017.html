			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMBASSADOR HOTEL CLOSES  </P> <P> The site of the closed Ambassador Hotel -- favorably situated on the main  street of Los Angeles and not far from the heart of downtown Los Angeles --  should remain an urban oasis. The setback of the hotel building and the garden  areas provides agreeable relief.  </P> <P> It has been said that, unlike some cities, such as London, Los Angeles has a  paucity of green spaces. The suggestion for mixed use -- residential,  commercial, and hotel -- sounds bad. Los Angeles already is built up just about  to the hilt.  </P> <P> I hope that the hotel can be preserved. If not, something else very special and  equally meritorious, which retains the open space, should occupy the site.  </P> <P> LEON J. RICKS  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

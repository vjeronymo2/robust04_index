			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries fail to give lead to European market EUROPEAN markets continued to wait nervously yesterday on the US government bond market - and the US dollar - to set a new direction for bond prices. In the event, no new lead was forthcoming from across the Atlantic, and prices moved closely in ranges seen at the end of last week. US Treasury prices weakened later yesterday as dealers and investors traded cautiously ahead of this week's big auctions of new securities. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  9/32 at 100 1/4 , yielding 8.008 per cent. It was the first time the yield had risen above 8 per cent since last autumn. The two-year note was down  1/32 at 98 31/32 , yielding 5.425 per cent. Concern about the effect of today's sale of a record Dollars 14.25bn of two-year notes and tomorrow's sale of another record Dollars 9.75bn of five-year notes stems from the problems the market had in digesting the last round of new supply. Retail investors were notably shy of the new securities then, and the market is worried that if dealers are again left holding large inventories prices could take a big tumble. Adding to the market's unease yesterday was the feeling that today's consumer confidence and auto sales figures will show improvement, further reducing the likelihood of another interest rate cut. EUROPE, meanwhile, continued to watch and wait for further signs of US recovery. The most significant piece of news of the day - gross domestic product figures from France - failed to move longer-dated bonds, although it gave some support to shorter-dated paper. The French GDP figures showed a flat picture, contrary to market expectations of a 0.6 per cent increase. That put GDP growth for the year as a whole at 1 per cent, well short of the 1.4 per cent predicted by the French government as recently as last September. However, hopes of a French interest rate cut were kept in check by the memories, still fresh, of last autumn. Then, an interest rate cut had to be reversed when the Bundesbank raised rates just before Christmas, and market-watchers do not expect the French authorities to make the same mistake again. A QUIET day in both Germany and the UK was reflected in little trading on the London International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe): 28,000 and 16,000 contracts each in the bund and gilt futures contracts respectively. Domestic investors are not expected to buy bunds in the short term, at least not as long as wage rise and strike fears continue to haunt the market. In the UK, meanwhile, longer-dated gilts remained firm after market weakness at the end of last week. The benchmark 2003/2007 bond closed up  1/32 point on the day at 115 29/32 . According to one observer, traders had left themselves short at the end of last week and helped to keep prices up yesterday by buying in the face of general market weakness. JAPANESE government bonds weakened as hopes of an imminent cut in interest rates seemed to recede. Having opened in Tokyo slightly ahead of Friday, when the yield on benchmark No 129 closed at 5.345 per cent. During the day, however, prices slid as hoped-for intervention in the currency market to support the yen failed to materialise. Also, a move by the Bank of Japan to keep conditions in the money market tight raised doubts about whether interest rates will be cut after the next Tankan survey of industrial confidence, expected at the end of next week. The No 129, having closed in Tokyo on a yield of 5.385 per cent, slid further in London trading to close at 5.4 per cent.</p>

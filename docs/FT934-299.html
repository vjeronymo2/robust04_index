			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese chemical groups to merge next year Two Japanese chemical companies that belong to the Mitsubishi group of companies plan to merge their operations and create Japan's largest chemical company. Mitsubishi Petrochemical, the largest domestic petrochemical company in which Shell Petroleum has a 12.6 per cent stake and Shell Japan a 5.7 per cent stake, and Mitsubishi Kasei, the country's biggest all-round chemical manufacturer, plan to merge next October on an equal basis. The new company, Mitsubishi Chemical, will have consolidated profits of more than Y1,000bn (Dollars 9.35bn) and a combined share of more than 15 per cent of the domestic ethylene market. The decision, aimed at increasing international competitiveness, comes in the midst of one of the most difficult times for Japan's petrochemical sector and is expected to encourage further consolidation in the industry. The country's chemical industry has not only suffered a prolonged business slump in the domestic market, but is also facing growing competition overseas. Overcapacity has plagued the industry since the early 1980s and there have been rumours of consolidation for the past 10 years, according to Mr John Chanoki, analyst at James Capel. After the first oil shock, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry encouraged companies to join forces in sales co-operatives that were able to control prices. Nevertheless, Japan's 14 chemical companies remained fiercely independent and have, until now, managed to avoid full-scale mergers. Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei are expected to report pre-tax losses in the year to March, 1994. Furthermore, the increasing reluctance of the Japanese authorities to protect the chemical industry from outside competition makes their future look grim as well. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the Gatt, Japanese chemical makers will face tariff reductions on imported chemicals of, on average, more than 50 per cent in five years' time. Against this background, Japanese chemical companies are being forced to accept the necessity of consolidation to create larger, more efficient and internationally competitive businesses.</p>

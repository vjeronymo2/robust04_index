			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Unjust to Tokyo car hire firms Sir, Foul] Observer is being less than fair and less than clever ('Ah so', June 12) when he ascribes the curious English to a Tokyo car-hire company. Old Japan hands will recognise the piece as an extract from a wonderful spoof published in 1879 and re-printed in 1953. It was called 'Revised and Enlarged Edition of Exercises in the Yokohama Dialect' and purports to have been compiled at the request of the Bishop of Homoco. What makes it funny (at least to those of us who speak Japanese) is not the peculiar English (which is itself a send-up) but the wonderful way in which the Japanese is transcribed and then translated. It demonstrates the authors' good understanding of the language and their ability to send themselves up. Observer is being unfair to this slim publication and unjust to Tokyo car hire firms, whose service in general is far more efficient than any I have found in London. And to suggest that Japanese corporate communications are still at that level is to demonstrate either ignorance or a vicious streak. I D Scott, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 156</p>

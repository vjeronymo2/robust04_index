			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Avoiding a will A WIDOW owns her home valued at Pounds 80,000 which is registered in her sole name. She also has about Pounds 30,000 in bank and building society accounts also in her sole name. She has made a will leaving the house and contents to her unmarried son who has is a life-long resident in the house and leaving the other assets to her married daughter. However, the widow has been advised that, as there is no inheritance tax liability, she could simplify the on-death position by re-registering the house into a joint tenancy with her son and transferring the bank and building society accounts into joint accounts on a survivor basis with her daughter. This, she has been told, would mean that on her death the house would automatically and immediately become the sole property of the son, and the bank and building society accounts would similarly become the property of the daughter, thereby avoiding any need for proving the will or of any probate necessity. Is this sound and legally permissible? The course which has been suggested is permissible and would render probate unnecessary without altering the position of there being no liability of Inheritance Tax, always assuming that the valuation of the house is more or less correct and that there is no marked increase in its value before the death of the mother. It would be wise to ensure that there is a record of there being a gift to the daughter of a beneficial interest in the bank and building society accounts. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

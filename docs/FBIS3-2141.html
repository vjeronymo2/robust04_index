A Chinese  Government source has said, "Although China has not made public  specifically how it has conducted its diplomacy toward North  Korea, China has been working for the solution of North Korea's  suspected nuclear development issue." The source is believed to  have suggested the role China has played in North Korea's recent  acceptance of nuclear checks by the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA).    The persisting view in China is that "North Korea has no  nuclear weapons, but it intends to use its nuclear card to  normalize relations with the United States at a stroke and to  use the normalization of relations a means to keep its system in  place." In other words, North Korea has so far taken an  ambivalent attitude toward the nuclear inspections based on the  judgment that if it simply relents on the nuclear inspections,  the United States may continue to press it, raising the issue of  democratization.    Another Chinese Government source pointed out that the  Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea adopted late  last year the realistic policy of placing importance on the  development of agriculture, light industry, and trade. Secretary  Hwang Chang-yop of North Korea visited China in January and  during his stay in China, he got a first-hand look at China's  economic reform by touring Guangzhou city and the Zhuhai Special  Economic Zone which have a reputation for the economic  development. The same Chinese Government source indicated that  "changes are seen for reforms in North Korea," citing the visit  by the North Korean official to the city and economic zone.    China feared that if North Korea takes unexpected actions  after being driven into a corner, it send many North Koreans  fleeing into China, bringing instability to China's northeastern  region where many ethnic Koreans reside and affecting China  greatly. Out of this fear, China persistently asserted that the  issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear development be resolved  through dialogue.    If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions  against North Korea and they are imposed, this would be  undesirable for China because it would be sandwiched between  North Korea and international opinion. China would have been  placed in a difficult situation if negotiations between North  Korea and the IAEA fail to hammer out an agreement.    China knows the United States is highly praising it's role  in  North Korea's acceptance of nuclear checks by the IAEA. China  appears to be aware of the advantage it can gain from a U.S.  awareness that the United States needs help from China to  resolve major Asian issues.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Earnings at Molson held within range of record MOLSON, the Canadian brewing, special chemicals and retailing group, suffered from sluggish economic recovery in north America and weak consumer confidence during the first half of 1992. 'However, our earnings held within the range of last year's record levels and the future looks positive,' said Mr Marshall Cohen, president. Revenues rose 5 per cent to CDollars 1.6bn, while net profit slipped to CDollars 74.8m (USDollars 59.7m), or CDollars 1.26 a share, from CDollars 77m, or CDollars 1.38, a year earlier. Operating profit was up sharply at Diversey, the special chemicals unit. Second quarter results, showing the same trend at the operating level, were CDollars 36.4m, or 60 cents a share, against CDollars 37.7m, or 67 cents, on revenues of CDollars 812m, against CDollars 767m. Following a CDollars 120m equity financing, part of which was used to reduce debt, interest expense for the six months was down sharply. The recession and a poor summer in eastern Canada depressed brewing in the first half. Industry volume fell 3.8 per cent while Molson's domestic market share fell slightly to 49.5 per cent. Molson has reduced costs and an industry price increase earlier this year helped. US sales rose slightly. Diversey sales rose 8 per cent and operating profit 20 per cent with strong performance in Asia Pacific, Europe and Latin America, but margins contracted in north America. Retailing revenues rose 10 per cent but the big Ontario market was weak and operating profit dipped 14 per cent. CAE Industries is maintaining its world leadership in commercial flight simulators, but its first half results highlight the decline in this market due to the airline industry's financial problems. Second quarter profit was CDollars 6.9m, or 6 cents a share, against CDollars 7m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 260m, down 7.8 per cent. Results were helped by lower interest rates and taxes and exchange gains. First half profit was CDollars 12.7m, or 12 cents a share, against CDollars 13.7m, or 13 cents, a year earlier.</p>

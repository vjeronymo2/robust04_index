			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Ripple effect of Tokyo's Big Bang: Gerard Baker examines the implications of allowing Japan's leading banks to open securities companies This morning, Japan's stockbrokers will be bracing themselves. As they wait to see how the plunging Tokyo market reacts to the latest collapses in world stock markets, a serious threat to the brokers' viability is being launched. Japan's leading banks are to open the doors of their own securities companies for the first time, ushering in the most radical upheaval yet in the country's financial system. While banks such as Sumitomo and Mitsubishi have been running securities operations in foreign markets for years, they have been forbidden to sell stocks or bonds in Japan. But today subsidiaries of the six big retail banks will join those of a few smaller banks which were admitted to the securities market last year. This big step towards universal banking was made possible by changes last year to Article 65 of the Securities Exchange Law, Japan's equivalent of the US Glass-Steagall act, which prevented banks from undertaking brokerage activity. The catalyst for the change was the move by companies towards issuing bonds, rather than borrowing from banks, as a way of raising finance. As a result, banks began pushing the Ministry of Finance to allow them a slice of the bond-issuance business. Aware of the damage that this would cause to existing brokers, the ministry decided to limit the banks' subsidiaries, initially, to bond underwriting and sales. Though the banks are not yet permitted to compete with the brokers in their core business of equity trading, the competition for bond business will hurt their rivals. So far this year, the subsidiaries of the smaller long-term credit banks have taken nearly 10 per cent of the bond issuance market, and the larger banks are certain to grab a much larger share. For a while, the finance ministry placated the brokers by arguing that the relaxation would result in a larger market for everyone. The banks, too, maintained the fiction, saying they posed no threat to their new rivals. But in the last few weeks, the pretence has been dropped. 'This is going to be very competitive. Brokers are very concerned about what will happen to their business as the banks enter the market,' said Mr Kaname Seki, managing director of the Japan Securities Dealers Association. A slump in Tokyo's securities business has already devastated stockbrokers. Securities companies went from a combined pre-tax profit of Y2,200bn in 1989 to a loss of Y470bn in 1992. A slight recovery last year looks likely to be wiped out in 1994. At first sight, Japan's four broking behemoths, Nomura, Nikko, Yamaichi and Daiwa, look like the biggest losers: 15 per cent of their earnings came from underwriting commissions last year, compared with an average of 6 per cent for smaller and medium-sized brokers. But they are large enough to withstand even a sizeable loss of business. And, as a result of a piece of reciprocal deregulation, they have established trust banking subsidiaries which are expected to provide significant compensation. The real threat is to the smaller stockbrokers. Bonds represent a smaller proportion of their business, but the arrival of the banks comes just as their core equities business is hitting new lows. The finance ministry has reduced new equity issues to a trickle in the past two years, to avoid flooding the market. Worse still, in recent months trading levels have fallen sharply. Trading volumes on the stock market have declined from a peak of more than 1bn shares a day in 1988, to a recent low of an average 300m a day for this year. The collapse of trading has put brokers' margins under severe pressure. For an average broker to make a profit, total trading needs to be in excess of 400m shares a day. Despite radical cost-cutting measures, including staff reductions of nearly 30,000, or 20 per cent, in three years, brokers are still losing money. In the past six months only 29 securities companies out of 215 made a profit. Losing out to the banks in bond issuance will turn these difficulties into a crisis. One senior executive at a medium-sized broker said: 'We are now in a race for customers, and I cannot see any other outcome than one in which the banks win the race easily. Because our profits are so weak, banks can always beat us on price, despite their size and higher costs.' What most upsets brokers is what they see as the unfair advantages enjoyed by the banks' subsidiaries. As well as having the world's largest financial institutions backing them, they will have access to an enviable client base, in that the banks' clients are expected to transfer their broking business to the banks' subsidiaries. The new companies are supposed to be divided from their parents by 'fire walls', preventing the transfer of information from bank to broker. They will not be allowed to tout for customers together, for example. But the aggrieved brokers feel that most of the divisions are cosmetic - with one rule preventing the subsidiaries' staff from wearing the same coloured uniforms as those of the banks - and will not prevent subsidiaries from exploiting their links with their parent banks. 'Though we are not allowed to exchange information, I should point out that, of the 126 employees of DKB Securities, 124 came from DKB the bank,' said Mr Yasuo Noda, president of DKB Securities, with a wry smile. In two years the authorities are committed to reviewing the new framework, but few in the industry think the outcome will be anything other than a further extension of the banks' role. That leads most analysts to conclude that the industry is in for a significant shakeout. One medium-sized stockbroker, Cosmo, has already had to be rescued by a bank. More are likely to follow. Even the banks seem prepared for it. Many of the smaller companies are partly owned by banks and larger companies, and many analysts expect these stakes to be expanded. 'Since the current difficulties for the smaller brokers are certain to get worse,' said Mr Noda, 'further mergers and consolidation are bound to happen.' One opportunity for brokers could lie in the further deregulation of the securities market, which might expand the volume of business by enough to save most of them. They have been reluctant to press for wider deregulation until now, since it would be likely to lead to a cut in the fixed commissions they charge. But they may have little choice now. A wide range of securities business is currently denied to the broking sector. With deregulation, there are some relatively new markets that brokers could tap, such as asset-backed securities and derivatives, both of which are heavily restricted in Japan. There would also be opportunities in a domestic secondary bond market, almost non-existent at present due to the rules governing the registration of bonds, which make it almost impossible to sell a bond once it has been bought. 'If the arrival of the banks is accompanied by a genuine opening of the whole securities market, then we have nothing to fear, and the real winner will be the corporate customer,' said Mr Akira Ogino, a managing director of Nomura Securities. This suggests the intriguing possibility that financial deregulation, up to now carefully controlled by the Ministry of Finance, might be developing a momentum of its own. Tokyo's markets are still hidebound by restrictions that deter domestic and foreign investors and limit the scope for raising capital. 'The right thing to do now,' says Mr Seki, 'would be to press ahead with wider deregulation quickly to enlarge the market and create genuinely open competition.' It is a happy coincidence of interest that the action that will probably be necessary to save the skins of the country's brokers will be the same as that needed to develop a capital market commensurate with the needs of the world's second largest economy. The Ministry of Finance may find that it has at last created a self-propelling liberalising machine.</p>

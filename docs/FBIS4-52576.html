			<p>CSO     [Text] Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's [Functional Groups  Organization] Development Board, has asked for an increase in  coordination, integration and communication among the three  tracks, A, B and C, within the Greater GOLKAR Community.  Coordination among these three tracks must be carried out  periodically, or if possible constantly, using the principles of  mutual respect and openness by creating close relationships  among the tracks so that joint social and GOLKAR problems can be  solved quickly.    Suharto, chairman of GOLKAR's Development Board and  president  of the Republic of Indonesia, expressed these thoughts in his  written recommendations delivered by Azwar Anas, the coordinator  of GOLKAR's Development Board's Duty Presidium, at the opening  of the 1994 National Working Meeting (RAKERNAS) of GOLKAR's DPP  [Executive Board], which took place in the auditorium of the DPP  offices in Slipi, Jakarta, yesterday morning. The top leader of  track A, General of the Army Feisal Tandjung, and of track B,  Minister of the Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, also attended  the opening ceremonies.    Besides stressing the importance of unity among the three  tracks, the Chairman of the Development Board also advised all  of GOLKAR's cadres on the proper attitude to take towards  various political issues which are now critical to our society.  One of them is the issue of the undercurrent.  <H5>  The Undercurrent </H5>   Mr Suharto said that the issue of the undercurrent, which  has  continued to develop recently and which has become a tough  problem for the Greater GOLKAR Community, must be overcome  immediately because it will eventually damage GOLKAR. The  Development Board believes that basically no undercurrent is  developing. "A small number of people have misused the name of  the many and have called themselves the undercurrent," he said.  What is actually happening is a kind of manipulation because in  fact those politics are no different from various kinds of  manipulation.    Speaking about the issues of collusion and other  defalcations  which have surfaced recently, the chairman of the Development  Board asked GOLKAR to be capable of anticipating and overcoming  them in accordance with the constitution and the laws based on  PANCASILA [Five Principles of the Nation]. At the same time,  GOLKAR must continue to push for the creation of a professional,  honest, clear and authoritative government apparatus as the  servant of the state and of the people, ready to protect, serve  as a model for, serve and value the rights and obligations of  every citizen without exception. This apparatus must avoid  provocative actions which have no basis in facts or figures but  must be based on the rule of law.    Speaking of the problem of succession, which the mass media  has discussed a lot recently, Mr Soeharto reminded the audience  that we should always be guided by the constitution which was  approved by the people through the MPR [People's Consultative  Council]. The Development Board believes that a lot of fuss  should not be made over this issue because there already is a  mechanism for succession, i.e., the five-year leadership  mechanism. "Through this forum GOLKAR's cadres should be able to  explain this to the broader public in the provinces," he  affirmed.    The Chairman of the Development Board also reminded the  audience that the excellent record already achieved at each  general election must be maintained and this can at the same  time be a counter to the issue of the single majority developed  by the other side. The issue of the majority and the possibility  that a dictatorship of the majority will arise are false.  "Because after five victories we have not become dictators; in  fact, we have always valued the opinions of the masses and have  accommodated their aspirations," he said.  <H5>  General Election Laws </H5>   Another matter about which we must be cautious, said the  Chairman of the Development Board, is the other side's desire to  reconsider and change the present general-election laws. The  Development Board believes that the existing general-election  laws are still sufficiently relevant to current conditions and  therefore should be maintained.    GOLKAR's victories in five general elections are proof that  the people trust GOLKAR so much that they channel their  aspirations to GOLKAR. The people's trust cannot be ignored. "It  is the task of GOLKAR's cadres to continue to build up GOLKAR  support so that in the upcoming 1997 general elections  supporters will continue to put their support and confidence in  GOLKAR again," said Mr Suharto.    In facing these problems, said Mr Suharto, we must really  develop GOLKAR cadres, those in the legislative ranks, in the  administration and in the social and professional/functional  organizations; organizational discipline must continually be  increased. "Long before making a decision, the coordination of  the three tracks must be increased," he warned. Instructions  about decisions already agreed to in the capital must be given  to and implanted in the provinces so that the same consensus is  reached in both the capital and the provinces.    As part of the effort to win the upcoming 1997 general  elections, according to the directives issued by GOLKAR's  Development Board, the provinces in which there was a decline in  GOLKAR votes in the 1992 general elections must be evaluated as  soon as possible. GOLKAR must pay the most attention to the  cultivation of those provinces. Preparations must be made to  cultivate public issues in the form of real actions which GOLKAR  raises and realizes.    Mr Suharto said that cultivating supporters person by person  must be based on principle of no day is to pass without  cultivating supporters through the following approach: each  GOLKAR cadre is obliged to develop GOLKAR supporters, at the  very least those who live "on the same mattress," "in the same  kitchen" and "use the same well". In addition, efforts must be  made to cultivate new voters, of whom there will be 21 million  at the upcoming 1997 general elections. One way to cultivate  them is for every DPD II [Provincial Parliament] to hold a  yearly hiking contest for Junior High School and Senior High  School students and for vocational schools at the same level,  the prize being a one-year scholarship. Mr Suharto also reminded  the audience that capable, well-known campaigners capable of  attracting public support must be gotten ready as soon as  possible.  <H5>  GOLKAR Cadres </H5>   In carrying out provincial duties, the Chairman of GOLKAR's  Development Board urged that each and every task be carried out  with an attitude of unity, harmony and permanent communication  among the members of the Greater GOLKAR Community. Besides that,  GOLKAR cadres in the ranks of the legislature and in the  professions and functional groups must also increase their  sensitivity so as to be able to grasp and realize the  aspirations developing within society.    "Because an inability to grasp and fight for the aspirations  living and developing within society might harm GOLKAR in the  future," affirmed Mr Suharto. At the same time, any policy  considered harmful to society or the actions of any tainted  figure must be prevented as soon as possible.    GOLKAR's caderization, said Mr Suharto, must produce the  following vision and ideal: GOLKAR is always prepared to respond  to challenges and is always responsive to the needs of the  people. Without that condition, caderization is merely  ceremonial action and only follows the words of the constitution  but neglects its spirit. In this respect, GOLKAR is being  tested. Can it regain the trust not only its traditional  supporters but also of the 21 million new voters in the 1997  general elections?    Speaking of cadre management, the Chairman of GOLKAR's  Development Board suggested that data on membership and cadres  be updated immediately and accurately, emphasizing the  recruitment of quality cadres. Putting the education and  training of cadres on a firm footing must be implemented in an  integrated, planned, guided, graduated and uninterrupted way.  These initiatives include tools for evaluating the achievements  of cadres and the compilation of criteria for that purpose, as  well as assigning tasks to cadres in a conceptional way.  <H5>  A National Viewpoint </H5>   Mr Suharto reminded the audience that GOLKAR must continue  to  strengthen its commitment to PANCASILA, which is to be  implemented by its being in the forefront of instilling and  implementing PANCASILA. The purpose of this is to heighten  vigilance and to make an effort to counter various ways of  thinking, concepts and ideologies which are in conflict with or  not in accordance with PANCASILA, and which are being practiced  by certain parties, in particular the intensive efforts being  made in various ways by certain parties to inject ways of  thinking, concepts and ideologies which are not in accordance  with PANCASILA.    For that reason, GOLKAR must also strengthen its commitment  to instilling a national viewpoint which is reflected in the  patterns of thought, action, work and works which have a  national viewpoint. Efforts to strengthen this national  viewpoint continue to show their relevance because of the two  contradictory trends which have affected the world in our times.  First, the trend towards globalization marked by a trend towards  a uniformity of value systems, patterns of thought, work, and  production. The second trend is an atavistic attitude and a  narrow concept of nation. Such a concept is now affecting  certain regions and nations so that tendencies in that direction  have succeeded in splitting apart a nation and state and  eventually that nation and state disappears from the world  political map. "We have had a lot of experience with that and we  don't want to undergo that again," he said.    Efforts to put that national viewpoint on a firm footing  show  the relevance of government programs to eradicate poverty. That  is why the Development Board invites all parties to foster and  develop feelings of social solidarity with those who live below  the poverty line, with those who always suffer catastrophes and  natural disasters and with the less fortunate.    The National Working Meeting which opened yesterday will end  on 31 March. Except for the opening and closing ceremonies, all  activities are closed to the mass media. Harmoko, General  Chairman of GOLKAR's DPP; Army General Feisal Tandjung, Chairman  of track A of the Greater GOLKAR Community; Minister of the  Interior Mohammad Yogie S. Memet, Chairman of track B of the  Greater GOLKAR Community; and Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Minister  of National Development Planning and Chairman of BAPPENAS  [National Planning Board] gave briefings at the National Working  Meeting.</p>

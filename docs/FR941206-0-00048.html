			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c) are less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.13(d)(2), 816.116(c), and 817.116(c). The Director does not approve Colorado's proposed Rules 3.02.3(2)(a), (b), and (c) to the extent that they would provide for release of bond liability on lands with an approved industrial, commercial, or residential land use  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> prior  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> to a demonstration that the land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved. The Director requires that Colorado revise proposed Rule 3.02.3(2)(c) to require that, prior to release of bond liability, the permittee must demonstrate that development of the land use has substantially commenced and is likely to be achieved, in addition to compliance with the revegetation requirement of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) or 4.15.10(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Rules 4.15.10(2) and (3), Revegetation Success Standards for Land With an Approved Industrial, Commercial, or Residential Postmining Land Use <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 4.15.10(2) to clarify, for areas reclaimed for industrial, commercial, or residential use, that (1) the living ground cover standard must be achieved for bond release and (2) the standard must be met within 2 years after completion of regrading or within 2 years after approval of such land use, whichever is later (i.e., Colorado acknowledges that there may be an approved change in land use after regrading). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado's revisions of proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) have no identical Federal counterpart. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.116(b)(4) and 817.116(b)(4) require, for industrial, commercial, or residential postmining land uses, that vegetative ground cover be sufficient to control erosion. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780.23(a)(3) require that changes in land use must be approved according to 30 CFR 816.133 and 817.133, which provide for designation of postmining and alternative postmining land uses. Thus, the only substantive differences between the requirements of Colorado's proposed Rule 4.15.10(2) and the requirements of the Federal regulations are (1) Colorado specifies that operator must use ``living plants'' to control erosion on areas to be developed for an industrial, commercial, or residential land use, and (2) Colorado allows for a change in the designation of postmining land use after final grading has taken place. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

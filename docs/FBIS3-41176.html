The operation also yielded 741 kg of processed ganja, valued  at over Rs 10 lakhs.    The illegal crop, regularly grown in these districts for  many  years, was spread over 205.63 acres in 31 villages.    A NCB official told TOINS [TIMES OF INDIA NEWS SERVICE] that  in many areas it was found that the ganja crop had substituted  cash crops like groundnut and turmeric. In other areas, the crop  was found interspersed with regular crops.    The official added that cultivators who had been growing  ganja over 1,000 acres about ten years ago had now spread out to  about 6,000 acres.    One acre of crop fetched a price of as much as Rs 2 lakhs,  thereby attracting more and more cultivators over the years. NCB  officials found that in many cases local government officials  were colluding with cultivators.    However, no arrests were made during the operations as all  the cultivators had fled.</p>

Among the draft bills that were examined and adopted  yesterday, we would like to mention the one referring to  Romania's adherence to the General Accord on the Immunities and  Privileges of the Council of Europe and the one proposing that  parliament ratify the European Convention on the Prevention of  Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Punishment or Handling of  Persons.

			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITE TO TOPPLE AFGHAN REGIME, LEADER OF COUP BID URGES REBELS  </P> <P> The leader of last week's coup attempt against the pro-Moscow regime in Kabul  says he is continuing the struggle and appealed to his supporters and to Afghan  guerrillas to unite and overthrow President Najibullah.  </P> <P> "My supporters are still fighting Najibullah," former Defense Minister  Shahnawaz Tanai told about 30 journalists Wednesday at a guerrilla base near  Dobanday, about 40 miles southeast of Kabul.  </P> <P> Tanai repeated charges that the initial coup attempt March 6 failed because  Soviet planes bombed his headquarters at Bagram air base, 30 miles north of  Kabul.  </P> <P> The news conference was held in a huge cave in a snow-capped mountainside. The  base of the Hezb-i-Islami resistance group of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was guarded  by about 50 guerrillas armed with anti-aircraft guns and U.S.-supplied Stinger  missiles.  </P> <P> Tanai addressed the journalists along with three other coup leaders, former air  force chief Abdul Qadir Aqa, former army communications chief Brig. Gen. Ghulam  Hazarat and former Politburo member Niaz Mohammed Mohmand. The three officers  wore their Afghan military uniforms.  </P> <P> In last week's coup attempt, rebel military units bombed Kabul, including the  presidential palace, and fought street battles with forces loyal to Najibullah.  It was the most serious threat to Najibullah's regime since the withdrawal 13  months ago of Soviet troops supporting the government.  </P> <P> Official and Western diplomatic sources in Islamabad, Pakistan, said Tanai and  about 20 other generals fled to Pakistan on March 7 as the coup failed.  </P> <P> Tanai, a short man in his 40s with a thick mustache, conceded that he had lost  contact with some of his supporters, but said, "I am trying to re-establish  communications and mobilize my people against the regime."  </P> <P> "I appeal to all the moujahedeen (guerrillas), my soldiers and all my  supporters to join hands and defeat Najibullah," he said.  </P> <P> He reiterated his assertion that he and his fellow coup leaders were not  seeking political power but had hoped to end the war and hold elections within  six months.  </P></p>

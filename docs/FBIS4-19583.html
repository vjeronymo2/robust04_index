			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over still of President Suleyman </F> Demirel]    [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has approved the law on  the establishment and broadcasting procedures of radio and  television stations. A statement issued by the President's  Press Center on the subject noted that Demirel first asked  experts to study the law, which was passed by the Turkish Grand  National Assembly [TGNA], and then personally studied it himself.    The statement stressed that although a long time has passed  since private radio and television stations began broadcasting  in Turkey, there were no legal arrangements as in all other  countries. The statement recalled, however, that the number of  private broadcasting companies in Turkey has reached 525. Under  these circumstances, the statement pointed out, it has become  socially necessary and essential to provide a legal framework  for private radio and television stations as soon as possible  and prevent these communications organs, which wield great  influence, from operating in a vacuum.    Pointing out that the president approached the broadcasting  law based on the view that it meets this basic need, the  statement remarked that Demirel determined that some of  provisions included in the final form of the bill are open to  criticism. According to the statement, in approving the law,  Demirel took into account the current sensitive circumstances in  the country. Demirel also noted the national need to take  special care to protect the country's indivisible integrity and  the nation's unity and solidarity and not to violate the  society's traditions, norms, and general morals.    Expressing his conviction that the TGNA will quickly  eliminate the possible dangers and shortcomings to ensue from  the implementation of the law, the president also said that he  trusts that the councils to be established within this framework  and the responsible persons will fulfill their duties with total  impartiality and maximum goodwill.    The statement continued: Our honorable president, who  sincerely favors a congruence between the needs of the society  and the output of the media in our country -- which has caught  up with the era of private radio stations and television  broadcasting beginning with black-and-white broadcasting in the  60's and going on to multi channel and colored broadcasting --  has approved the new broadcasting law on the basis of these  beliefs.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Legal challenge to state aid can be easily launched Sir, In an otherwise excellent comment upon the European Commission and state aids ('Controlling state aids', October 19) you fail to recognise that some progress has already been made. Despite the Commission's approval of the staggering sum of FFr20bn in aid to Air France, it is now easier than in the past to pursue a legal challenge to the decision. For its part, the Commission has moved from acting as a 'rubber stamp' for aid schemes, to much more thorough investigation. It is indicative of this that the published decision on the state cash injection into Air France in 1992 was less than four paragraphs long, whereas the more recent decision runs to 17 pages and provides detailed commentary. It is true that most of the conditions imposed by the Commission upon Air France were, in fact, proposed by the airline itself. Nevertheless, the aid will be granted in three phases and will be dependent upon Air France meeting these conditions. In addition the Commission has gone as close as is legally possible to secure the privatisation of Air France by making eventual privatisation a condition of approval. The weakness in the policing of state aids does not appear to be in the Commission, which has worked hard to make liberalisation a reality. Following the decision to allow the Air France aid, Sir Leon Brittan told reporters that the French had threatened the Commission with an 'empty chair policy', and the French government said that it would stop at nothing to ensure that the aid was approved. We can only hope that successful legal challenges to decisions on state aids and further market liberalisation will give the Commission stronger grounds to resist political menaces in future.

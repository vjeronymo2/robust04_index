			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Sanyo Securities resists creditors' restructure plan Emiko Terazono in Tokyo Sanyo Securities, a second-tier Japanese securities firm, is seeking an alternative to a restructuring plan recommended by its three main creditor banks and Nomura Securities, a leading shareholder, without losing their support. The banks are Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank and Nippon Credit Bank. The four institutions sent officials into Sanyo to help with a comprehensive restructuring plan last August. However, the brokerage house has resisted strong recommendations by the banks to implement drastic rationalisation, and has not been able to win approval from its creditors. Sanyo - like other members of the industry - is the victim of the three-year stock market slump after the large capital investments of the late-1980s asset 'bubble'. It built a large trading room in a warehouse-like building, investing heavily in computers and other electronic equipment. Another source of its problems is Sanyo Sogo Capital, a non-bank financial affiliate burdened by mounting bad loans. Sanyo Sogo is reported to have lent Y145bn (Dollars 1.3bn) in real estate-linked deals, of which some Y50bn have turned sour. According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a daily business newspaper, the three banks have extended some Y150bn in loans to Sanyo Sogo, and are also supplying the cash needed for its daily operations. 'The company is virtually brain-dead,' says Mr David Threadgold, financial analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. He expects the three creditors eventually to bail out Sanyo and its affiliates by agreeing to cut rates on the loans. Sanyo Securities expects a pre-tax loss of Y5.7bn for the year to March this year, but some analysts predict the figure will could be larger due to financial problems stemming from Sanyo Sogo.</p>

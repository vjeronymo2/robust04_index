			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Dr. Nabil Sha'th and General Amnon Shahaq, the  heads of the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating delegations,  have both agreed that progress has been made in the round of  talks which was concluded in Cairo yesterday. Dr. Sha'th said  that this round has achieved considerable progress despite the  difficulty it faced in the beginning. Meanwhile Shahaq said  that the round was positive and fruitful and that the two sides  were very close to signing an agreement on the implementation of  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.    At their news conferences, they said that the new round  which  is to start next Sunday will be that last. While Nabil Sha'th  expects a final agreement to be signed between 2 and 5 May by  the Palestinian president, brother Abu Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat],  and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, General Shahaq was  more reserved and did not give a date for the signing. [passage  omitted]    Shahaq said that the two sides are awaiting the results of  the meetings of the economic committee in Paris to include them  in the resolutions which have been finalized in order to reach a  general agreement. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile the heads of the Palestinian and Israeli  delegations to the economic talks in Paris have decided to hold  consultations with their presidents because of the obstacles  which they cannot overcome through negotiations. Sources in the  two delegations said that Avraham Shohat, Israeli finance  minister and head of the Israeli delegation to the economic  talks, has indeed left Paris this morning for Israel. The  official spokesman of the Israeli delegation, Eric Gordan, said  that Shohat will attend next Sunday's Israeli cabinet meeting.    Meanwhile, Samir Hulaylah, member of the Israeli delegation,  said that brother Abu-al-'Ala', director of the PLO's Economic  Department, will also leave Paris for Tunis where he is to brief  the PLO leadership on the progress of the economic talks.    Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' are expected to return to Paris on  Monday afternoon.    The two delegations could not reach an agreement on customs  policy and on matters regarding Palestinian manpower.</p>

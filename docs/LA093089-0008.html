			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISRESPECT FOR LAWYERS AND THE COURTS  </P> <P> Hay's column eulogizes lawyers without revealing the ways they are now  burdening society.  </P> <P> Along with their brothers in the legislatures, lawyers and judges have been  subtle co-conspirators in guaranteeing that the legal role shall be a larger  than necessary one, with benefits shared greedily.  </P> <P> Lawyers, having virtual control of government (where laws and regulations are  written en masse) and the courts, have created both a self-serving maze and an  operational monopoly so costly and time-consuming that they deserve the  disrespect we show them.  </P> <P> Everyone should visit the courts and see the travesty that exists:  inefficiency, delays and postponements, callousness as to costs and time  imposed on litigants, and built-in procedures beneficial to lawyers' incomes at  others' expense.  </P> <P> If they were as good for society as Hay claims, why don't lawyers streamline  the entire legal process and relinquish minor procedures that can easily be  handled by anyone or, in more complicated matters, by paralegals? The answer,  of course, is that they would sacrifice income.  </P> <P> RUSSELL T. CONNORS  </P> <P> Pismo Beach  </P></p>

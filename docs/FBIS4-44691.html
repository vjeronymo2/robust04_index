			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by LUK: "Small Leap, Great Hope"] </F>   [Text] The 12.6-meter tall model rocket took off, climbed  up to 90 meters, shifted sideways 105 meters, and 66 seconds  later made a soft landing in an upright position. The  manufacturer, McDonnell Douglas, was enthusiastic: the principle  of a single-stage, fully reusable booster system had proven its  practicability. The first flight into the stratosphere of the  Delta Clipper-Experimental [DC-X] is supposed to follow with two  years. If all goes well, commercially usable rockets measuring  39 meters in height and having an 11.5-ton payload could then be  developed.    The idea of a "single-stage-to-orbit vehicle" [SSTO] reaches  back to the sixties. Douglas Aircraft's Phil Bono wanted to  build a rocket that could dispatch U.S. troops to crisis areas  around the world in an hour. At the time there were no prospects  for the project. NASA had its hands full with the space shuttle.    Only after it became fully evident that over the long run  the  principle of lavish space travel was too costly did people in  the U.S. space sector recall the SSTO that had been shelved. Max  Hunter, one of McDonnell Douglas' leading design engineers in  Huntington Beach (California), also saw in it an opportunity to  recoup at least something from the loss of contracts concomitant  upon the cessation of the Space Defense Initiative [SDI]  program. Other lobbyists kept pressuring until then U.S.  vice-president Dan Quayle diverted $80 million from the SDI  program to McDonnell Douglas' SSTO project in 1991.    In the words of project director William Gaubitz: "The aim  in  developing the Delta Clipper is a space-travel system that can  fly both with and without a human crew, does not eject any part  in flight, lands upright and is fully reusable." Average cost of  a "Space Shuttle Light" launch will supposedly cost $10 million.  NASA currently projects $409 million for each launch of a space  shot.    It takes only 18 months to build the DC-X. In the period  following the first trial flight in August 1993 at the U.S.  White Sands test site in New Mexico additional launches  entailing flights as high as several hundred meters have been  carried out.    German engineers have likewise contributed to the current  success. The landing system with each of its 160 kilogram [kg]  light-weight telescoping legs and landing feet was developed and  built in the record time of nine months at Deutsche Aerospace AG  [DASA] in Munich. It also entailed the largest subcontract that  U.S. aerospace firms have awarded so far outside the U.S. for  the Ottobrunner design engineering firm.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: French developer forced into FFr3bn bank deal PIERRE Premier, a French property developer, has been forced to cede FFr3.2bn (Dollars 581m) of its property holdings to its banks in order to retain its independence. The Pierre Premier initiative comes as a number of France's most prominent property companies are struggling. Earlier this week, Mr Michel Pelee resigned from his eponymous property company and was replaced by Mr Henri Caro. Until yesterday's deal, Mr Christian Garrel, chairman and main shareholder in Pierre Premier, faced the threat of losing control of his company. Pierre Premier, which has been involved with restoring residential and office buildings in French city centres, has been badly affected by the property crisis and needed to find new capital. Instead of a conventional recapitalisation deal, Pierre Premier has transfered 19 properties, worth a total of FFr3.2bn and representing 80 per cent of its portfolio, to its banks. The problems of the French property sector, particularly in the Paris region, have worsened in recent months. Average rentals in Paris have fallen by 20 per cent in the past three years and there is a surplus of available office space in the city.</p>

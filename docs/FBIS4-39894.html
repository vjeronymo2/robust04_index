			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- Duma factions of communists,  agrarians and liberal democrats lead by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  took a joint stand once again. They issued a joint statement  "on the situation in the Korean peninsula" which was circulated  in the lower house of parliament on Friday.    These factons noted a sharp aggravation of the situation on  the Korean peninsula, close to Russian borders. Deputies  pointed out that "certain circles in the United States want to  compel the DPRK to accept humiliating terms of the settlement of  the so-called nuclear problem". In this connection  representatives of the three above-mentioned Duma factions  expressed "perplexity" at the statement of the Russian  leadership which, in the opinion of deputies, "actually sided  with one party in the conflict, South Korea".    The deputies expressed disapproval of Russia's decision to  join in the economic sanction against the DPRK. "Our national  interests would be suited by giving up power methods, creating  conditions for a dialogue between the north and south of Korea  and implementing the concept of a non-nuclear zone in the Korean  peninsula", the statement says.</p>

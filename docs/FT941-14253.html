			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / WDA to be sued for unfair dismissal A former senior executive of the Welsh Development Agency, who was sacked in the wake of scathing criticisms of the agency by a Commons committee, is claiming unfair dismissal. Mr Michael Henry, executive director of corporate services, was dismissed in October after a report by an independent inquiry set up by Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, the WDA's newly-appointed chairman, in response to condemnation by the public accounts committee. 'I've been made a scapegoat by the WDA,' Mr Henry said yesterday. 'I would like an opportunity to state my case and I am determined to clear my name.' Mr Henry, who managed the agency's Pounds 165m annual budget, is to bring his case to an industrial tribunal supported by Unison, the public services union. The union said a separate action for alleged defamation was 'under active consideration'. The WDA said it had referred the matter to its lawyers. Mr Henry, now a self-employed accountant, had been with the agency since 1978 and was an executive director for six years. He was not a board member. Together with Dr Gwyn Jones, the WDA's then chairman, and Mr Philip Head, the chief executive, he was questioned by the Commons committee which subsequently said the 'top echelons' of the agency had 'presided over a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and accountability'.</p>

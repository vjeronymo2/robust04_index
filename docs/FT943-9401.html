			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Soap wars may affect Hickson Hickson International, the speciality chemicals group, yesterday warned it could be dragged into the 'soap war' between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble. The group said the controversy had 'reduced the upside potential' of PharmaChem, its detergent and chemicals subsidiary that supplies the manganese bleach used in Unilever's new soap powder. Procter &amp; Gamble has mounted a high-profile campaign against the so-called accelerator, claiming it leaves some clothes holed and faded. While admitting a possible short-term impact on PharmaChem, Sir Gordon Jones, Hickson's chairman, said: 'It is not yet possible to evaluate the extent to which this will constrain profit recovery in 1995.' The group has a contract to supply Lever Brothers, the UK detergents subsidiary of Unilever, until mid-1995. But analysts warned that the row could hit orders. Lever Brothers, however, said the ingredient would be used in its restyled Surf and Radion brands, although no mention of the accelerator would be made in adverts. Shares in Hickson, meanwhile, fell 9p to 168p yesterday as the group announced pre-tax profits in the six months to June 30 virtually unchanged at Pounds 12.1m on turnover ahead 5 per cent at Pounds 208.6m (Pounds 198.5m). Profits at performance products, a core division which manufactures agrochemicals, sulphur-based products and personal care ingredients, fell 20 per cent to Pounds 4.7m despite increased sales of Pounds 76.3m (Pounds 69m). The decline was due largely to difficulties at Kerley, the division's US subsidiary, which was hit by low sulphur prices and over-capacity. Pricing pressure in North America also affected the protection and coatings business. It reported operating profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.6m) on sales of Pounds 81.8m (Pounds 82.1m). Group operating profits, however, rose 9 per cent to Pounds 16.7m following an improved performance at Fine Chemicals, including a full-year contribution from PharmaChem. It helped lift divisional profits to Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 3.9m). Earnings per share rose to 5.6p (4.8p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.85p. COMMENT Hickson has prepared for the possibility of Unilever pulling the plug on its acclerator product. Its PharmaChem plant can be used for other products, and the group has devoted increased resources to improving coatings sales in Europe and reducing its overcapacity at Kerley. Better divisional management and reduced operating costs are also expected to help full-year profits reach Pounds 23m. On a forward multiple of 16 the shares look demanding enough given the uncertainty over PharmaChem.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 22, BNS -- The Estonian Cabinet at its  meeting today issued a permission to bring a group of Russian  military to the former base town of Paldiski for the dismantling  of the two nuclear training reactors at the Paldiski base.    Prime Minister Mart Laar at a press conference after the  Cabinet meeting said the permit had been issued for "a small  group of military."    Laar said "no problems or obstacles" had emerged over the  issue of the nuclear reactors' pulldown with Russia.    Estonia and Russia have also held talks over the possibility  to bring into the country additional equipment necessary for the  dismantling of the reactors. The Estonian leader added that  also the Nordic countries had promised to extend help in the  process if necessary.    The government's special representative in Paldiski, Juri  Tikk, told BNS on Friday [18 March] that both Estonia and Russia  were ready to start taking out nuclear fuel from the reactors.  The two countries' officials in joint staff and command  maneuvers on March 16 trained coordination of activity for the  case of emergencies. Tikk said the countries are ready to act  effectively also if the worst happened and an explosion  involving radioactive materials took place.    "The Russian side has asked that in case if the `black  scenario' really starts to happen, which the Russian military in  Estonia would be unable to manage with, 200 Russian military  experts together with the necessary equipment be brought into  Estonia via the Amari airfield. The Estonian side has not  objected to this plan in principle, but demands that an exact  list of the military and their equipment be presented before the  dismantling work begins," Tikk said.    Tikk declined to confirm or dismiss the reports that work on  taking radioactive fuel out from the reactors was going to start  on Apr. 6. He said the date was still open.</p>

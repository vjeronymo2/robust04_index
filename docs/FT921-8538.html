			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (16): Graphics from the Winter Olympics - Notebook computers: Application case study LANCE BELL, pictured here, a London graphics journalist with Reuters' international wire service, is using a portable computer at the 1992 Winter Olympics to create on-the-spot illustrations to complement news stories this week from the Alpine mountain slopes of France. He is using a notebook-sized Apple Macintosh PowerBook 170* with modem, based at a studio in the main press centre at Albertville during the 16 days of the Winter Olympics. He is able to rapidly prepare diagrams and maps not only at Albertville - the flagship town on the games - but also at any of the ten mountain locations where the games are taking place. Lance Bell's graphics for newspapers and TV programmes in many parts of the world help to illustrate such events as cross country and speed skiing, cross country, freestyle and bobsleigh contests - spread over the 750 square miles of mountainous terrain which is hosting the Olympic programme. In bad weather, there could be delays of perhaps four hours before graphic details could normally be brought by road and transmitted from the main press centre. But now, with the powerful notebook computer, Mr Bell can transmit graphics via modem from any of the centres where events are taking place. 'The newly-created graphics are transmitted to a Reuters' database in Toronto, Canada,' explains Mr Corrie Parsonson, editor of the graphics news service. 'Subscribers to the service can then access the graphics and download them to their own Macintosh systems at newspapers, magazines and TV studios around the world.' Reuters graphics service, which was set up in May 1990, issues between four and six graphics a day, in colour and black and white, to complement news stories news, financial articles and other features. *The PowerBook 170 is the highest-performance member of the Macintosh Powerbook notebook-sized computer range. It weighs 6.8 lbs; the system is priced from Pounds 2,975.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Ifma attacks long-term contracts for directors THE INSTITUTIONAL Fund Managers Association said yesterday that three years was far too long for any board director's service contract under most circumstances. The trade body said the Postel pension fund's announcement that it would vote against any director's rolling three-year contract 'does not go far enough'. Mr Richard Weir, group's director-general, said: 'It is Ifma's concerted view that we do not approve of long-term contracts.' Ifma believes directors' contracts should be no longer than one year except in unusual circumstances, such as where a newly recruited chief executive is required to relocate or has been recruited with great difficulty. Ifma's view is that in those circumstances a three-year contract is appropriate only at the initial appointment, with future terms limited to rolling one-year contracts. Mr Alastair Ross-Goobey, chief executive of Postel, last week sent a strongly worded letter to companies in which Postel has a significant holding, telling them it opposes three-year rolling contracts. The contracts are effectively renewed every year so that firing a director costs the company the equivalent of three years' pay and benefits. But while Postel said it intended to vote against the re-election of directors on rolling contracts of more than a year, Ifma said it was up to each of its individual board members to decide how to vote.</p>

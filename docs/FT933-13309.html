			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Observer: Harpooned Tarnished halo for Gro Harlem Brundtland. The winner of the 12 Environmental Star Award in 1989 for her efforts as chairman of the UN World Commission on Environment and Development has been asked to give it back. In May, Norway - prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland - resumed commercial whaling in defiance of an eight-year ban by the International Whaling Commission. Not surprisingly, the European Environmental Bureau does not consider whaling to be 'compatible with sustainable development nor does it represent responsible management of marine resources'.</p>

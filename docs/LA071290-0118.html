			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY-USC HOSPITAL PUT ON ACCREDITATION PROBATION  </P> <P> Citing a wide range of deficiencies in fire safety and the ability to monitor  the quality of medical care, the nation's major hospital review organization  has placed Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center on conditional accreditation.  </P> <P> This is the second major county hospital to be placed on conditional  accreditation. Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center was placed on the  same probationary status earlier this year.  </P> <P> "Among public hospitals, it is not uncommon to see this degree of difficulty in  meeting the accreditation standards," said Dr. William Jessee, the  organization's vice president for accreditation surveys. "It is a sad  commentary on the decaying infrastructure of public medical care in large  cities."  </P> <P> In a related action, the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare  Organizations also put Queen of Angels-Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, a  private, nonprofit hospital, on conditional accreditation.  </P> <P> Conditional accreditation is reserved for hospitals with significant problems  in meeting the commission's quality of care and safety standards. Such  facilities typically have problems with their quality assurance programs and  medical staff monitoring systems, which are designed to minimize the risk that  patients will be harmed in the hospital or cared for by unqualified  individuals.  </P> <P> A hospital that loses its accreditation jeopardizes its participation in the  Medicare and Medi-Cal programs. In addition, a teaching hospital jeopardizes  the status of its residency programs.  </P> <P> During a weeklong inspection last September, Joint Commission officials found  the behemoth County-USC deficient in 19 of the 54 key areas it rates. The  medical center has 2,045 licensed beds but only 1,398 are in use.  </P> <P> The actions were taken last month by the Oakwood Terrace, Ill.-based  organization. Both County-USC and Queen of Angels have been asked to submit  plans of correction.  </P> <P> Queen of Angels officials have submitted their plan and County-USC officials  expect to submit theirs in about a week. Each hospital will undergo another  inspection in about six months.  </P> <P> Harvey Kern, a special assistant to County-USC's executive director,  acknowledged serious fire hazards, particularly in the main General Hospital  building which dates to 1932. There is no sprinkler system.  </P> <P> Kern said the hospital, under pressure from federal health officials and city  and county fire officials, is spending $500,000 a year for a 24-hour fire watch  in which employees walk the halls of the 19-story main building looking for  fires and potentially hazardous conditions.  </P> <P> Stopgap repairs may be overtaken by other actions. In mid-September, county  health officials expect to submit a master plan to the Board of Supervisors for  replacing County-USC entirely, Kern said. Independent of the Joint Commission  report, replacement is being seriously considered as an alternative to bringing  the aging facility into full compliance with modern fire safety standards.  Retrofitting the four hospitals that make up the County-USC medical complex  with fire alarms and sprinklers could cost up to $100 million.  </P> <P> Kern said County-USC would also request $2.6 million from the county to correct  deficiencies in other areas, including physician evaluation, the organization  of the medical staff, surgical case review and medical records.  </P> <P> During an inspection of Queen of Angels last November, the Joint Commission  found problems with medical records and maintenance procedures, according to  Ron Dahlgren, the hospital's president.  </P> <P> The 433-bed Queen of Angels facility has had financial difficulties since it  merged with Hollywood Presbyterian in January, 1989. The hospital serves a  disproportionate number of poor and minority patients, many of whom lack health  insurance.  </P> <P> County officials are exploring the purchase of the the merged facility as a  part of a plan for replacing County-USC Medical Center. But Dahlgren said the  hospital's financial condition had improved in recent months and there was no  interest in selling.  </P> <P> "We had the impression that (the joint commission) wanted more months of  experience as a merged institution before they gave us a non-conditional  accreditation," Dahlgren said. "Everything we were told indicated that they  were happy with the progress we had made since the merger."  </P> <P> Since the Joint Commission began releasing the names of conditionally  accredited facilities last year, 15 California facilities have been so  designated. The other California hospitals conditionally accredited in June are  the Veterans Affairs medical centers in Fresno, Livermore and Palo Alto, and  Pacific Coast Hospital in San Francisco.  </P> <P> There are now 10 VA hospitals in the West on conditional accreditation,  including the VA medical centers in Long Beach and Sepulveda.  </P> <P> Of the 1,800 hospitals inspected by the organization each year, only 5% to 8%  are conditionally accredited, according to commission officials. Between 1% and  2% of hospitals are not accredited and the others are fully accredited for a  three-year period. County-USC was last fully accredited in 1986.  </P></p>

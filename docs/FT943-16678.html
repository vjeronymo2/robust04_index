			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead This week sees full-year figures from two brewers, one national, one regional. Monday's results from Scottish &amp; Newcastle will be scrutinised closely for evidence of early progress from Chef &amp; Brewer, which S&amp;N bought from Grand Metropolitan late last year. The Pounds 703m deal was of strategic importance to S&amp;N, since it greatly increased its pub estate in the south of England and gave it an important new outlet for its beer. On the other hand, GrandMet has the reputation of extracting top prices for businesses it sells. Forecasts are for S&amp;N to have profits of about Pounds 230m pre-tax against Pounds 201m. Full-year results from Greene King, the East Anglian regional brewer, are due on Thursday. The market is unsure of its ground, since Greene King's interim results were particularly disappointing with profits almost unchanged. Since then, the shares have been among the weakest in the sector, underperforming the market by around 15 per cent. Last year's pre-tax profits were Pounds 20.1m, down from Pounds 20.3m the year before. Any improvement in the headline figure this time will be regarded as progress. MFI, the furniture group, is expected on Monday to announce a big increase in full-year, pre-tax profits from Pounds 40.2m to about Pounds 70m. Analysts raised their forecasts from about Pounds 60m after MFI's interim results in January, when it disclosed a much stronger performance in the January sales than in 1993. They are keen to hear from MFI whether the improvement has been sustained. Exceptional charges of Pounds 214m connected with the sale of its Silo chain in the US will obscure a small fall in underlying profits at Dixons, the UK's largest electrical retailer, on Wednesday. Before the charges - which include trading and disposal losses, and a Pounds 191m goodwill write-off - pre-tax profits are forecast at about Pounds 75m. Last year's figure, after provisions for losses at Silo and other charges, was Pounds 33.5m, but before exceptionals was Pounds 76.7m. This year's fall is due largely to a poor performance at Christmas, when Dixons was hit by a price war in computer games. Reported profits are also expected to be depressed by exceptional costs of up to Pounds 20m to cover the closure of 100 Currys high street stores this year as the latter's move into out-of-town superstores accelerates. Increased profits from Cellnet, the cellular telephone network operator co-owned with BT, should help Securicor push interim profits beyond last time's Pounds 29m when it reveals its interim results on Tuesday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Wang Nan: "Fresh Tint on World Auto Industry"] </F>   [Text] Washington, May 25 (XINHUA) -- India has Maruti.  Malaysia has Proton. Suzuki can be found in Hungary. Fiat is  in Poland. China has joint ventures with Volkswagen, Peugeot,  Chrysler and General Motors.    It was the good old days when the world's industrial nations  accounted for nearly all vehicle production and the bulk of  their sales. The time has come for the developing world to cry  for attention.    In 1993, the emerging markets, mainly central and eastern  Europe, Southeast Asia, India, China, and Latin America,  produced approximately 19 percent of the world's vehicles, twice  that in 1985.    Next year, the World Bank said in a forecast, the emerging  markets will absorb one-tenth of the world's car sales. Vehicle  sales in these countries have been growing at least 30 percent  annually.    "Many developing countries that aim to grow through  industrialization regard the automotive sector as a suitable way  to achieve this objective," said Yannis Karmokolias, author of  several studies on automotive industry.    It is true that the automotive industry can be crucial in a  nation's economy, as in the U.S., where auto accounts for five  percent of gross national product and 17 percent of industrial  employment.    Now, nine percent of manufacturing output and 10 percent of  manufacturing employment in Mexico relates to car industry,  while in Brazil, six percent of manufacturing output comes from  auto making.    While absorbing aluminum and zinc alloys, iron and steel  products, auto industry links extensively with marketing, repair  and maintenance, fuel and lubricants, insurance, shipping and  accessories.    Still, the industrial nations constituted three-fourths of  the world car market. The big three of the U.S. are gaining  market share. Some developing countries are hovering around  self- sufficient level.    But opportunity is there: there is huge surge in car sales  in leading Asian nations, sales rose by close to 50 percent in  Hungary, and the registrations for cars in Mexico and Turkey  have doubled in five years.    In recent discussions sponsored by the International Finance  Corporation (IFC), emerging auto markets were ranked by current  and potential size: Latin America leads India, China, ASEAN and  Eastern Europe.    According to IFC estimates, in 1995, 77.5 percent of the  world auto sales will go to the industrial nations, although  Latin America and South Korea will account for 3.3 percent and  2.5 percent respectively.    Developing countries should know, observers said, that their  automotive industries do not need to start with assembly, as has  been the case, but could be based on component manufacturing  that might lead to assembly.    While developing countries regard Western countries as major  markets for their vehicles, these countries appeared less  interested in developing and sustaining their domestic markets,  observers said.    "To encourage domestic sales yet avoid being swamped by  imports requires a careful mix of policies related not only to  domestic production, but also to trade, pricing and credit," the  IFC said in a recent policy paper.    In some developing countries, governments are withdrawing  from the sphere of auto production, especially in Latin America,  where not a single share of auto component firms are held by  public authorities.    But in Asia, the governments' role in shaping trade  policies,  exchange rates, regulations, price structures, access to credit,  privatization and the handling of the labor force remains  extensive.    On policy, some governments are advised not to change gear  in  jerky fashion, or set auto industry policy too rigidly, which,  observers said, might lead to the industry's weakening and  turmoil.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Orders soon for attack helicopters If anyone expected more windfalls from the end of the cold war, those hopes were dashed yesterday by a defence policy statement that committed Britain to unflagging engagement in the defence of a fast-changing Europe. It described the armed forces as a 'valuable and prestigious national asset' which could not be surrendered without grave damage to the 'security and reputation' of Britain. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is now firmly insisting that all future savings in expenditure will neither eat into the country's fighting strength nor rest on any over-hasty assumptions about diminishing risks. Far from running down Britain's fighting strength, Mr Rifkind 'hoped for some enhancement' in front-line capacity as a spin-off from the efficiency drive now in progress. He emphasised the 'broad range of capabilities' Britain could deploy. The statement reaffirms Britain's commitment to a wide-ranging renewal of its aircraft, helicopters and tanks. It also vigorously defends the performance of the armed forces in Northern Ireland, noting that the frequency of terrorist attacks is now only a fraction of the peak reached in 1972. The paper's robust tone makes plain that the defence ministry has fought off veiled suggestions from the Treasury that a major land war is now so unlikely that Britain could dispense with much of its heavy armour. It describes developments in Russia as 'perhaps the key factor' for British security, and acknowledges that the evolution of that country is almost impossible to predict. 'We will not know for many years to come whether it will develop into an economically successful and stable democracy, and a permanent friend,' it says. Apart from endorsing the Partnership for Peace programme, which invites the former Warsaw Pact nations to engage in military co-operation with Nato, the document also lays stress on bilateral co-operation with eastern Europe. It says Britain has plans for a joint exercise with Poland this year and may hold one with Russia next year. Ironically, the statement's release yesterday coincided with an announcement from President Boris Yeltsin that he was turning against the idea of joint military exercises with the US. On arms control issues, the paper commits Britain to playing a 'positive and constructive role' in negotiations on a test ban treaty though it had 'not been an entirely easy decision' to make. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, criticised the government's lack of enthusiasm on this issue and said Britain should take the lead. He said it made little sense for Britain to drag its feet over nuclear tests when it could conduct them only with the goodwill of the US, which now favoured a moratorium. The main procurement plans the document reaffirms are: The purchase of 259 more Challenger 2 tanks, the details of which are being negotiated with Vickers. Plans to purchase a fleet of up to 100 attack helicopters, for which six tenders have been received; the Apache, produced by McDonnell Douglas, is widely seen as a front-runner. An order for about 45 support helicopters, to be divided between Boeing's Chinook and the EH-101 made by Westland. Plans to order more of the 'Trafalgar' class of nuclear submarine, which will replace nuclear hunter-killers near the end of their operational life. A tender for this is to be announced shortly. Participation in the four-nation Eurofighter project, now in development; Britain has repeatedly pledged to buy 250 of the new aircraft.</p>

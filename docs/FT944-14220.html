			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo While the strength in the yen is expected to support the bond market, prices are likely to fluctuate in a narrow range this week due to continued cautiousness over prospects for a sustained economic recovery. Investors will be focused on the Bank of Japan branch managers' meeting this week, which is likely to confirm a pick-up in northern and western Japan where the effects of the collapse of the asset 'bubble' have been mild. While the bank is expected to keep short-term rates low to curb a further rise in the yen, confirmation that the economy is experiencing steady recovery may add upward pressure on interest rates. Industrial production figures for September to be released at the end of the week are also likely to be negative for the bond markets. Although output is likely to have declined by about 1 per cent from August, it is expected to have risen by more than 2 per cent from September 1993. 'We expect production gains on a year-on-year basis to accelerate in coming months,' says Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo. Inventory adjustment has largely been concluded as shown by the drop in the ratio of inventories to shipments to its lowest level since September 1991, and growing domestic demand together with export increases will support industrial output growth this year and next, it says.</p>

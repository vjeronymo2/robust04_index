			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / House of Fraser sells Sears stake for Pounds 60m loss HOUSE of Fraser, the department stores group owned by the Fayed brothers, yesterday sold its 10.6 per cent stake in the Sears retailing group for a book loss of about Pounds 60m. The sale came less than two weeks before Sears was expected to reveal an improvement in pre-tax profits, and amid reports - firmly denied by House of Fraser - that the Fayeds have recently been considering a Pounds 300m management buy-out offer for the House of Fraser stores, excluding the flagship, Harrods. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, placed the 156m shares at 101p with a broad range of international institutional investors, having bought them for 100p - a 4p discount to Tuesday's closing price of 104p. The Fayed brothers have retained a small personal shareholding in Sears. Mr Michael Cole, a House of Fraser director, said suggestions from City analysts that the sale indicated the group was in financial difficulties were 'entirely untrue'. 'Our financial arrangements are entirely satisfactory,' he said. Mr Cole confirmed that the Fayeds paid an average of 140p for the Sears shares in December 1987, making a total of Pounds 218m. Yesterday's sale represented a book loss of more than Pounds 60m, but Mr Cole insisted the investment had been 'worthwhile', and had fostered a close relationship with Sears, including opening concessions within each other's stores. He said the decision to sell the Sears stake was taken only late on Tuesday night. The Fayed brothers wanted to realise assets through the sale 'to give them the flexibility to further their own business plans in the future', although Mr Cole admitted that some of the money may be used to reduce gearing. House of Fraser Holdings' last published accounts, for the year to January 1992, show gross debt of Pounds 776m, with the group due to repay unsecured bank loans of Pounds 100m and secured loans of Pounds 50m in 1993-4, and a further Pounds 50m of secured loans in 1994-95. Mr Cole said yesterday group debt was currently just under Pounds 650m. Analysts said they were surprised by the timing of the sale. 'I would have thought they would allow themselves the luxury of letting Sears get their results away before selling the shares,' said Mr Nick Bubb, retailing analyst at Morgan Stanley. 'The obvious implication is that they are under financial pressure.' Lex, Page 24</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> TOUGH SMOG AMENDMENT KILLED  </P> <P> Despite warnings it was weakening existing law, the Senate refused today to  require the Environmental Protection Agency to impose smog cleanup plans on  cities that do not adopt tough enough anti-pollution measures.  </P> <P> In another important victory for Senate leaders determined to protect their  compromise clean air bill with the Bush Administration, senators voted 53-46  against a plan by Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) to preserve the mandatory EPA  enforcement provisions in the current Clean Air Act.  </P> <P> Kerry's amendment also would have wiped out controversial sections of the  compromise bill that would allow states to obtain emission reduction waivers  from the EPA if necessary pollution control measures cost more than $5,000 per  ton of pollutants eliminated.  </P> <P> Environmental groups and more than a dozen governors lobbied senators to  support Kerry's amendment, saying the compromise bill was too weak to ensure  speedy cleanup of urban smog.  </P></p>

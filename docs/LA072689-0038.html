			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Florida Gov. Bob Martinez called a special legislative session for October to  consider new restrictions on abortions. In a letter to state House and Senate  leaders, the governor called for legislation to block the use of tax money,  public facilities and public employees for abortions, and for tougher licensing  standards for abortion clinics. He also urged that the period of pregnancy in  which the state does not restrict abortion be shortened, to five months from  six months. The call for a special session to begin Oct. 10 was a reaction to a  recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that allows states greater leeway in  regulating abortion. Martinez said he does not want to stop rape or incest  victims from getting abortions, or women whose lives are threatened by a  pregnancy.  </P></p>

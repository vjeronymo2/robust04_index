			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The insurance working-level conference of the  Japan-U.S. General Economic Council met for two days on 12-13  October in Tokyo following the first meeting on 19 September in  Hawaii. At the meeting on the 12th, the U.S. side demanded  correction of "keiretsu" trading which impedes entry by foreign  companies into Japan. The Japan side also demanded a  reexamination of the regulations in the United States that vary  according to states. However, the two views appeared to run  along divergent lines. At the meeting on the 13th, the U.S. side  indicated the shares held by foreign companies in the seven  advanced nations. It pointed out that, compared to the share of  2 percent in Japan, the shares in the other G-7 nations is on a  double-digit level, and that the reason was the closed nature of  the Japan market. The discussions were concluded without  reaching any conclusion and were carried over into the third  meeting scheduled in November. Later, a senior U.S. Government  official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and  explained the basic U.S. posture of unilaterally setting  numerical targets, unless agreement is reached on share  expansion.    Following the two-day discussion, a senior U.S. Government  official held a press conference at the U.S. Embassy and  clarified the intentions of the U.S. Government. According to  the official, the items requested of Japan by the United States  indicate the basic U.S. attitude of seeking share expansion for  U.S. insurers in the Japan market, and the U.S. Government  proposal is in line with the report by the Insurance Council,  but is more concrete in its content. The official also indicated  the key points of the U.S. demands and negotiations by item as  follows: 1) Clarification of the conditions for insurance  businesses to receive licenses. 2) Participation by foreign  companies in the Insurance Council and industry organizations.  3) While a certain amount of regulation is necessary for the  protection of the insurers, easing of measures is requested. 4)  A change from the licensing procedures to a registration system.  5) Induction of a broker system. 6) A step-by-step easing of  controls concerning the third sector. 7) Investigation of the  "keiretsu" problem by the Fair Trade Commission. 8) Deciding  quantitatively measureable shares for U.S. insurance companies.  9) The United States will not apply sanctions despite an  inability to achieve share expansion within the prescribed time  period. 10) The share of foreign companies in Japan is 2  percent, but the share of foreign companies in the other G-7  nations is at a double-digit level. 11) The reason for the  failure of Japan's insurance businesses in foreign nations is  their lack of competence.    Later, a reporter asked: "You stated that you do not intend  to present figures indicating what the proper shares are for  foreign companies, and that no sanctions would be applied in the  event of a failure to achieve the numerical targets. What will  you do if the Japan market fails to change? The official replied  in a flexible tone: "The United States intends to reserve  evoking Article 301 of the trade act (punitive measures against  unfair trade practices). The reason is that a new insurance  market will probably be created in line with the Insurance  Council's report, and such a situation will probably not arise  in view of the Hosokawa cabinet's priority emphasis on easing  controls."    However, questions were asked repeatedly by the reporters as  to whether the United States was optimistic about achieving a  double-digit share, and how many years it expected it would  require. In reply, the U.S. senior official said that "it would  probably require a medium to long term." Subsequently, however,  he revealed that he expected it to take three to four years. In  addition, despite his statement at the outset that sanctions  would not be applied against Japan, the nuance of his later  reply changed to suggest that, "if agreement on shares cannot be  reached, the U.S. side would unilaterally decide on numerical  targets, and evocation of the trade act is also possible."    At the meeting, the items directly related to policy were  limited to the induction of a broker system and "keiretsu"  trading.</p>

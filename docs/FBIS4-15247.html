			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Boris Sherman report under the "Warning" rubric: "Agrarian </F> Faction Leaders Threaten Peasants Strike and Ask Presidential  Administration Not To Distract Collective Farm Workers From  Applying Fertilizers"]    [Text] A group of leaders of the State Duma's Agrarian  Party of Russia [APR] faction held a press conference yesterday,  "On the Disastrous Consequences of the Administrative  De-Collectivization of Peasants' Farms." The agrarians made a  series of revealing statements and showed the audience (made up  primarily of their own faction's deputies, who obligingly  ensured a quorum at an event organized by their bosses)  presidential draft edicts "On the Reorganization of Agricultural  Enterprises..." and "On the Procedure for Reorganizing and  Downsizing Agricultural Enterprises and Privatizing Land and  Other Property," and also an analytical memo signed by Petr  Filippov "On the Urgent Need To Split Joint-Stock Companies and  Collective Farms into Small Collective Peasants' Farms Before  Spring Seeding Time."    "The Agrarian Party opposes any forcible actions against the  peasants by the state," APR leader Mikhail Lapshin said, warning  that "carrying out reform by old, administrative methods from  above, reform that leads to the fragmentation of collective  farms into small farms, is particularly dangerous precisely on  the eve of seeding time," because "it will keep collective farm  workers under strain" and distract them "from applying  fertilizers to cereals."    In the view of the faction leaders, this coercion was  spearheaded by the presidential administration and its chief,  Sergey Filatov, in person. Complaining against him also as the  mastermind behind the compilation of a "blacklist" of former  Russian Federation Supreme Soviet deputies who were reported to  be sympathizing with anti- presidential forces, Mr. Lapshin  wondered aloud, "Why is it that one and the same building sends  appeals for civil accord alongside with documents that may  literally blow up society."    Mikhail Lapshin acknowledged that under the circumstances he  "does not see a place for the peasantry's signature" under the  Kremlin-proposed accord on civil peace. Moreover, in his  opinion, "it cannot be ruled out that in mid- or late June the  Russian peasantry may rise with the sole demand that this  government should go."</p>

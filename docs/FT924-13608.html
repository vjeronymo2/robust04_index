			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: International Paper succumbs to weak economic growth INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday unveiled a 4.8 per cent decline in underlying third quarter earnings, reflecting the continuing pressure of weak economic growth on prices. Net income for the three months ended September 30 was Dollars 98m, or 81 cents a share, including an extraordinary loss of Dollars 2m, or 1 cent a share. A year earlier, International Paper earned Dollars 105m, or 95 cents. The number of shares outstanding increased to 122.2m at the end of the 1992 quarter from 110.7m last year, mainly as a result of an equity offering earlier this year. Sales in the latest quarter rose 6 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars 3.3bn. Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, blamed price deterioration in uncoated printing and writing papers in US and European markets for a decline in earnings between the second and third quarters this year. For the first nine months, International Paper had net income of Dollars 312m, or Dollars 2.58 a share, on sales of Dollars 10.2bn, against earnings of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 3.02, excluding an accounting change, on sales of Dollars 9.5bn. The results were largely in line with expectations and shares in International Paper gained Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 62 7/8 . Boise Cascade, another US forest products group, suffered a third-quarter deficit but said it had reduced its underlying losses. For the three months to September 30, the company recorded a net deficit of Dollars 35.2m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, compared with Dollars 14.3m, or 47 cents. Excluding extraordinary items, Boise lost Dollars 1.24 a share last year. Sales fell to Dollars 935m in the quarter from Dollars 1bn last time. Like International Paper, Idaho-based Boise is still being hit by weak paper prices. Boise said, however, that there were some signs of improvement. Mr John Fery, chairman and chief executive, said order backlogs in pulp and paper were relatively firm and the company had announced price increases in some key grades. Shares in Boise added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 yesterday.</p>

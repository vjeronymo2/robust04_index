			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDEAST HOSTAGES AND ISRAEL  </P> <P> Jerry Levin's assertion that the fate of the American hostages is entirely in  the hands of Israel ("Two Hostages Out, and Hundred to Go," Commentary, May 14)  is not only unfair, but also baseless.  </P> <P> Israel sympathizes with the pain of the American people and the families of the  hostages kidnaped and held by the Hezbollah organization and other Lebanese  terrorist organizations affiliated with it. Seven Israeli families feel the  same pain as the families of the American hostages. There are seven Israeli  prisoners of war, soldiers missing in action and hostages in Lebanon. Why  should the pain of their families be overlooked or ignored by Levin's article?  This type of pain knows no national boundaries.  </P> <P> Israel calls for the release of all hostages in Lebanon, Israeli and  non-Israeli alike. No distinction is made.  </P> <P> Some people, including Levin, try to portray those being held in Israeli  prisons as hostages, thereby equating Israel with the very terrorist  organizations which currently hold Israeli and Western hostages. This  comparison is absurd. Those being held in Israeli prisons are either terrorists  active in various terrorist organizations or people who assisted these  organizations' activities.  </P> <P> How can their serving prison terms for crimes in any way be compared to the  kidnaping of American and other Western innocent citizens by the Hezbollah  organization and its affiliates? They have been kidnaped under Iranian guidance  and inspiration in order to attempt to extort through them financial or  political advantages and to use them as political "bargaining chips."  </P> <P> Israel again declares its readiness to release Lebanese detainees it holds in  exchange for the return of all its prisoners and those missing in action.  Israel emphasizes that it will be ready to take part and make its contribution  to any move which will bring about the release of all the hostages, including  the Israeli hostages and soldiers missing in action.  </P> <P> To single out Israel as holding the key for the release of U.S. hostages and  pressuring Israel to act accordingly, as Levin suggested, is a simplistic  attempt for an easy solution. An easy solution simply cannot be found when it  comes to fighting terrorism. Israel is not the problem. Israel has been the  victim along with the United States and other Western countries.  </P> <P> ILAN MOR  </P> <P> Consul for Press and Information  </P> <P> Israel Consulate, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The centre of attraction The true dividing line in British politics runs through the Conservative party. There are the Bastards, and there are the rest. The hallowed centre ground lies between the two. The big Bs, so-named by the prime minister, preach minimalist government, unregulated free markets, and the erection of a huge stone wall, 50 miles high and 20 wide, along the length of the sea channel that divides continental Europe from its most troublesome offshore islands. Transferred to the United States, the Bastards would doubtless join the conservative wing of the Reaganite faction of the Republican party. Some of us would wish them luck as we waved them goodbye. Nearly everyone else would be comfortable as a European Christian Democrat or, in the US, a New Democrat. This includes the UK Liberal Democrats led by Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Labour party as it will be if and when Mr Tony Blair takes charge, and the bulk of Mr John Major's cabinet. Funny about that last lot. Several non-Bastard ministers have spent the last few days shuffling towards the centre. It is their customary nervous reaction to rightwing speeches. The effect could be alarming. It has been calculated that if we all breathe in and stand very still, the entire population of the world will fit on the Isle of Wight. That is the condition of the centre ground in contemporary Britain. Everyone is snuggling up to everyone else. Few dare to move, saving an occasional upwards jump by Mr John Prescott. Certainly nobody, the Bs aside, says anything truly controversial. Mr Ian Lang, secretary for Scotland, warned his Conservative colleagues in his Swinton Lecture on Sunday that 'ideology can become a substitute for thought, and an ideologically driven party ultimately becomes a pastiche of itself, entirely in the grip of ideologues applying uncritically yesterday's answers to today's problems'. That is no way to talk of Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Michael Howard, Mr Peter Lilley or Mr John Redwood. Mr Lang left no phrase-of-the-centre unuttered. Conservatives work for an 'enabling ' society, an 'opportunity' society. They 'empower' people. The 'community' matters to Tories. What is more, 'there is a balance between rights and responsibilities'. Some Labour leaders, not least Mr Gordon Brown, might feel that they had a patent on such pragmatism. These are the notions of the post-communist '90s, conceived after the heady triumphalism of Reagan-Thatcher liberalism had begun to fade. Mr Ashdown has written a book on the subject. All parties are groping for solutions in a fast-changing world in which, as you and I know, there are none. It has to be said for the shadow chancellor that his non-solutions are beginning to sound better than they used to, and perhaps better than others on offer. Put this down to political convergence. You can savour its effect by studying Mr Blair's recent speeches. Last Thursday he spoke on the economy, rephrasing Mr Brown's known ideas. On partnership between government and industry he sounded like Mr Michael Heseltine. As to dividend policy, he was the very model of the Treasury's Mr Stephen Dorrell. Training? Step forward Mr David Hunt, who will promote exactly that in a speech to the TUC today. Full employment? There is hardly a cigarette paper between the putative Labour leader and our very own cheerful chancellor and putative prime minister, Mr Kenneth Clarke. On education Mr Blair's speech yesterday was equally encouraging. It offered a sensible execution of the proposals on the national curriculum, standards, assessment and parent involvement implicit in Mr Kenneth Baker's Tory education act of 1988. This is not to deny the significant differences of detail between the parties. Labour backs the minimum wage and accepts European labour regulation; the Conservatives do not. One of Mr Brown's 'flagship proposals' is a 'university of industry', a contemporary form of worker education. It is so far unmatched by Mr Hunt. Labour would spend money on pre-school education. The prime minister has spoken in favour of the idea, but not the cost. The Tory education minister, whatsisname, has infuriated the teachers. Mr Blair offered an olive branch - a General Teaching Council to self-regulate the profession. The similarities in the broad direction of economic and social policy are, however, greater than the distinctions. In particular, Mr Blair has acknowledged the relative impotence of demand management. Mr Brown has disowned high taxation, devaluation, high spending and a quick dash for growth. The Labour modernisers have become the apostles of sound money. Can they do more? Yes. They might dare to criticise the railway signalmen, while castigating the Railtrack management and the government. 'Tough on strikes,' they might say, 'and tough on the causes of strikes.' Whether or not they take up this friendly suggestion, they have done enough to assure us that the creative aspects of Thatcherism would be safe in their hands. Now they need to show what they can add. The answer lies in Mr Blair's favourite word, renewal. This is where Britain's Labour centrists differentiate themselves from their Tory counterparts. The Conservatives, carefree dispensers of patronage, are deaf to evidence that their network of quangos is an open invitation to corruption in government. Their marketisation of health and education is a good idea badly implemented. They will not hear of administrative or constitutional reform. Mr Blair will shortly remind us of Labour's commitment to civic reconstruction in local government, the regions, the House of Lords and elsewhere. The theme of renewal of our democratic mechanisms should provide an attractive wrapping to his economic and social statements of values. No wonder thinking Conservative centrists are scrambling to catch up on Labour. The parties may not have starkly different ideologies to offer, but Mr Blair's has the advantage of freshness, something new, different where it counts, and safe. Above all, Labour is united. With Tories you get both centrists and Bastards. You never know which lot is on top. The prime minister appears to have been corralled by his predecessor's faction. At the next general election Labour will therefore have a cogent story to tell. It may even be believed.</p>

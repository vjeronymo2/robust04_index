			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / European plan to cut ethylene capacity fails Efforts to restructure Europe's petrochemicals industry were in disarray last night after plans to close as much as 2m tonnes of ethylene capacity collapsed. The sector is plagued by massive overcapacity of ethylene, the basic building block of plastics, and is losing hundreds of millions of dollars a month. The plan had involved creating a DM550m (Pounds 216m) fund based on a levy of DM30 per tonne of installed ethylene capacity. Groups wanting to close plants would then have to bid for part of the fund in return for shutting down capacity. The Association of the Petrochemical Producers in Europe said the plan had collapsed because not enough capacity had been put forward for closure and some of its 31 members were not prepared to put money into the fund. It said a substantial majority were in favour, but unanimity could not be reached. Mr Jean-Marie Devos, secretary general of Cefic, the European chemical industry's trade association, said: 'We would have gone ahead despite some companies refusing if there had been bids to shut substantial amounts of capacity.' An APPE survey asked ethylene producers how much they wanted to close permanently through the fund. 'The survey indicated we couldn't reach even the mimimum threshold,' said Mr Devos. This is thought to have been 1.5m tonnes. Operations that may have been available for closure include BP Chemicals' plant at Baglan Bay, BASF's 160,000-tonne-a-year plant at Ludwigshafen, a complex at Luena in eastern Germany, and two Enichem plants at Gela and Porto Torres. The APPE said that it would be continuing to develop other proposals to restructure the industry, which employs 600,000 people directly.</p>

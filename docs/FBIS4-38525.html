			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 31, RIA -- The proposed peace-keeping  operation in the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict may  become "unprecedented," says Boris Pastukhov, deputy foreign  minister of Russia. It will involve both CIS peace makers and  international observers. If all goes well, said Pastukhov in an  exclusive interview to the Russian Information Agency, it will  provide "experience projected into the future," because there  are other regrettable conflicts and hot spots. Pastukhov  granted the interview upon his return from the USA where he  represented Russia's Foreign Ministry in consultations with the  UN aimed to plan peace keeping operations.    He believes that the sides have harmonised the format of  such  an operation, and agreed to provide a broader mandate to  international observers and to involve more observers to ensure  the operation's success. The composition of the force was not  discussed, but Russian troops will naturally make the backbone,  and the total strength will reach 2,500-3,000 troops. The  deputy foreign minister thinks that the sides agree to begin the  operation as soon as possible.    The Russian delegation debated the question of setting up an  international foundation to ensure peace in the zone of the  conflict. Now that it is clear that the operation will be held  within UN standards and with close interaction of CIS peace  makers and international observers, "the very climate and the  public opinion have become more beneficial for the operation,"  said Pastukhov.    He said that the Russian mission has not been delegated by  the sides to the conflict, but the discussions in the UN were  held within the framework of the Georgian-Abkhazian accords on  ceasefire and disengagement of the troops.</p>

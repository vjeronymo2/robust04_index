			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / French groups give pledge on illegal pay-offs France's main public works companies - with the exception of one of the largest, Bouygues - have foresworn using illegal payments to win contracts or orders, in an attempt to restore public confidence in their sector. At the initiative of their trade association, the companies, which include subsidiaries of Lyonnaise des Eaux, Compagnie Generale des Eaux and the Schneider engineering group, have signed a pledge that they will obey the law on corporate contributions to political parties and candidates. Bouygues, which happens to have figured less in recent corruption allegations, yesterday questioned the need for such a pledge with its implication of possible past wrong-doing. Meanwhile, Alcatel CIT yesterday described as 'absurd' a reported estimate by an investigating magistrate that the telecommunications company had in fact overcharged France Telecom for equipment by up to FFr2bn, way in excess of the FFr62.6m which Alcatel recently paid the telephone utility in an agreed settlement.</p>

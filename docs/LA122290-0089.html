			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN APPOINTS HUFF TO CHOICE 5-YEAR POST  </P> <P> Retiring Gov. George Deukmejian on Friday appointed Jesse Huff, his state  director of finance since 1984, to a $90,852-a-year post on the newly created  Integrated Waste Management Board.  </P> <P> The job is one of the choicest plums in state government and carries a  five-year term for Huff, whose appointment is not subject to confirmation by  the Senate.  </P> <P> Huff, 47, was picked by Deukmejian from relative obscurity as a Republican  staffer in the Legislature and made chief deputy director of finance in 1983.  He was promoted to director the next year after the Senate refused to confirm  Michael Franchetti, a longtime Deukmejian associate.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's second term as governor, and Huff's job as finance director, end  on Jan. 7, when Gov.-elect Pete Wilson will be sworn in.  </P></p>

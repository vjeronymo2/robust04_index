			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Scrap employment ministry, say engineers The Engineering Employers Feder-ation, one of Britain's largest employers' organisations, is calling for the Department of Employment to be broken up and its functions shared between the Department of Trade and Industry and Department for Education. With the debate about its future gathering in intensity, the employment ministry appears to have surprisingly few friends. But it still has enough institutional clout to ensure that most of its critics advocate dismemberment in private. Mrs Anne Minto, director of policy at the federation, has no such inhibitions. She says the department's training functions should be transferred to the education department. Many other critics of the employment department  - which include the Commons trade and industry committee in a report to be published this week  - would prefer training to go to the DTI because the education department is seen as unsympathetic to vocational education. 'Experience with the Department for Education has not been that favourable from an employers' point of view,' said an official from a rival employers' body, who also thinks the Department of Employment looks more vulnerable than it has for many years. Some observers question the assumption that the merging of income support and unemployment benefit into the Jobseekers' Allowance will help the employment department even if the government decides that payment of the allowance should rest with that department rather than the Department of Social Security. Ms Pam Meadows, head of the Policy Studies Institute and a former chief economist in the Department of Employment, says: 'The Jobseekers' Allowance is certainly about moving benefit away from welfare and linking it more to the labour market, but that merely means that there is a strong case for the Employment Service agency to report to an economic department.' Critics say many functions which used to justify the existence of a separate Department of Employment have been subcontracted to agencies. Training is dealt with by the Tecs, industrial relations by Acas, health and safety by the Health and Safety Commission, and unemployment benefit and job placement by the Employment Service. Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, gives the employment department only two cheers even though its abolition would curb his chance of influence in Whitehall. 'The department in recent years has fallen far short of promoting full employment,' he said. 'But the DTI's poor record on promoting industrial development does not inspire confidence that it would promote training more effectively than the (employment department).'</p>

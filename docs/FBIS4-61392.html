			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vasiliy Kononenko report: "New Influential Forces Accede </F> to Accord Treaty"]    [Text] The widespread thesis that Russia is incapable of  living according to civilized norms can today be considered  repudiated. The Accord Treaty signed 28 April has given us  reason to talk about the first signs of political stabilization  in the country, and this process is continuing. A solemn  ceremony involving major, influential organizations --  associations of industrialists, entrepreneurs, and banks --  acceding to the treaty was held 5 May in the Kremlin's Vladimir  Hall. And although this time it was the premier rather than the  president who was chairing it, and only the deputy heads of both  chambers of parliament in the presidium, the significance of the  event should not be belittled.    As V. Volkov, deputy leader of the president's  administration, told your IZVESTIYA correspondent, the listed  associations represent a very considerable force today, not just  in the economic but also in the political sphere. They include  around 120 different structures, including the Union of  Entrepreneurs and Leaseholders, the association of commercial  banks, and industrial groups. Members of the Public Chamber,  representing economic structures, will also be signing.    Obviously, the question arises: Why have these associations  been categorized, so to speak, as second in importance, and who  determines who should be allowed to sign the treaty? According  to V. Volkov, no one has set up a waiting line. At first a  general decision was made to invite political parties and  movements and power structures in the regions and at the federal  level to sign. Political stability in society depends primarily  on them. The process of acceding will subsequently be conducted  as follows:    When a sufficient number of applicants to sign has been  collected for a ceremony to be held (applications are sent in to  the organizational section, the territorial administration of  the president's administration, and the Public Chamber), another  ceremony will be held in the Kremlin. Representatives of youth  and sports associations and certain veterans organizations will  most likely be next to sign the treaty following the current  ceremony. They have already submitted the relevant applications.  As for rumors of the Agrarian Party's possibly acceding to this  document, they are unconfirmed at present.    How long can this process go on? What level of numbers and  influence is acceptable for a particular organization to accede  to the treaty? The representative of the president's  administration was also asked these questions. He believes that  the process will not degenerate to the point of absurdity.  Furthermore, no one is involved in calculations about the  influence and numbers of particular organizations, since such  calculations would mean introducing a certain threshold of  participation, whereas the aim has been different from the  outset: to attract as many potential supporters of peace and  accord in Russia as possible to the Treaty.</p>

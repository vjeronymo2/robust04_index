			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, PLO </F> Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres with unidentified reporters at the Presidential Palace in  Heliopolis, Cairo, on 9 February -- recorded; in English]    [Text] [Mubarak] We welcome the initialing of another  Palestinian-Israeli peace document after several weeks of  intensive negotiations. A successful conclusion of these talks  reinforces our confidence and that all the peoples in the region  and the prospect of comprehensive peace and full development.  These documents initialed now eliminate several obstacles from  the road to peace and pave the way for the signing of the accord  agreement and the next protocol by Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, with our hope that this will take  place in the very near future in order to bolster the structure  of peace and stability throughout the region.    On the other hand, we are looking forward to the attainment  of meaningful progress on the other track conflict. We are  certain that this is the clear choice all parties to the  conflict which have caused much sufferings and tragedies for  people.    I would like to take this opportunity to commend both  parties  on their sincerity and dedication. They demonstrated their  unwavering commitment to peace, together with their courage and  willingness to assume the responsibility for achieving it.    We congratulate the Palestinian and Israeli people for their  devotion and conviction of the necessity to make peace and put  an end to conflict and tension. With this goodwill and mutual  confidence, we shall be able to transform the area to a region  of tranquility and creative initiative. Let us vow together to  make the Cairo agreement another significant step on the road to  peace. Thank you. [applause]    ['Arafat] From my heart, by the name of our people, by the  name of our leadership, by the name of the PLO, I have to thank  His Excellency President Mubarak for he pushed forward to  achieve what we have signed tonight we agreed today and also the  progress which we have already pushed even before signing our  agreement in Washington. What we have done we can't forget and  we will not forget in the future.    So again, thank you, Mr. President, from our hearts for what  you have done. I have also to thank his Foreign Minister  Brother 'Amr Musa for his great efforts and all the Egyptian  staff for helping us to achieve what we have achieved.    We consider what we have done during the last few days a  major step for the implementation of the DOP [Declaration of  Principles] which we have signed in Washington, so very soon  we'll be able to meet together in Jericho. Thank you. [applause]    [Peres] Mr President, Mr. Chairman, the Foreign Minister,  ladies and gentlemen. I would like to second the thanks of  Chairman 'Arafat to President Mubarak for the excellent support  he is providing all the people in the Middle East to go in the  direction of peace. Do not forget that 15 years ago, Egypt and  Israel were hostile, were enemies, were fighting and today we  are very proud to look up to Egypt. It is a major force in the  Middle East to bring peace to all nations and countries. I  thank you Mr. President for constant support and optimism in  bringing peace to the Middle East. I would also like to thank  Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa who played an extremely positive role  in bringing us together, his intervention is always helpful and  positive. I told the president jokingly that we came to Cairo  [word indistinct] like the Sphinx and we are leaving Cairo  [words indistinct] like pyramids. We did not know what will  happen. Now we feel lthat something important did happen.    I know that Chairman 'Arafat has had to take some very  difficult decisions as well as the Government of Israel and the  prime minister of Israel and I am very glad that the tow sides  did it. Let me say about the importance of this agreement. We  took five or six of the most complicated issues between two  peoples. We could go the Bosnian way: to shoot, to fight, to  kill. Instead, we went our way: to agree, to find common  grounds, to tell the Palestinian people and to tell the Israeli  people that we are serious, we are credible. We are not looking  for images and public relations. We are looking for real peace  for all children in the Middle East, Arabs and Jews,  Palestinians, Druze, Israelis, Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians.  And I hope that what we did here will be significant to many  other areas in the world.    As far as I put my concern, I know that the people of  Israel are seriously and deeply interested in making peace a  reality. I am convinced that historically and morally, they do  not want to be the dominating force of the Palestinian people.  They do not want that. And I know that the Palestinian people  went through a great deal of suffering. And I know that  Chairman 'Arafat is trying really to offer them a new future.  It proves simply that it is very difficult to depart from a  bitter past and offer a new horizon, to form the best  agreements, and questions and difficulties. May I say that what  I named the spirit of Cairo is posing itself with an encouraging  spirit. But our peoples are decided to go ahead and make full  peace, not just a piece of paper but a new reality for all of us.    We did not complete our work, but we overcame very, very  difficult issues. And by agreement, and by negotiations,  negotiations which were on occasions extremely difficult even  bitter to the two sides. [Words indistinct] I know that you  people from the press were a little bit interested in [word  indistinct] in order to have information ahead of time. We did  not provide you because we did not know. And for that reason,  this evening, in this beautiful palace, in this great city of  Cairo, is in my judgement a credible step, a new future for the  children of all of us. Thank you very much.    [Unidentified reporter] One question [words indistinct].    ['Arafat, in progress] ...And what has been done is a very  important step to implement the DOP, or the papers on the  ground. But still, we have something and we have agreed upon  with Mr. Peres to continue through the work of our committees  here in Cairo concerning other issues. And since that time  another meeting will take place for the economic committee also  to took place in Paris, to continue. And I hope, and I am sure  that what has been done is the most important first step. And I  have to say to all my people that we are starting this issue,  this step, so that we will be able to overjump all our troubles.  And we are sure that we can create now, new era for our people.  We can say that Palestine, the meaning of Palestine, has  returned to the map of the Middle East, since we and Mr. Rabin,  the Israeli prime minister, had signed the recognition between  PLO and the state of Israel, and in the same time Mr. Peres and  Abu-Mazin signed the agreement under the auspices of President  Clinton in the White House. We have to thank also Mr. Rabin,  the Israeli prime minister, for his strong support and active  support until we have the opportunity to achieve what we have  achieved today. Thank you.    [Reporter] Mr. Chairman, when do you plan to come to Jericho  and first to sign the agreement, the final agreement, with Prime  Minister Rabin of Israel?    ['Arafat] I hope, this will depend on the next committees,  and I hope that it will be very soon. And also under the  auspices of President Mubarak we will have it very soon here in  Cairo. I hope so.    [Reporter] What are the issues that are still in trouble. I  mean what are the points that are still in friction.    ['Arafat] Actions speak louder. Let actions speak.    [Reporter] Mr. Peres, could you speak [words indistinct].    [Peres] First of all, I would like to thank the team of the  Israelis and the team of the Palestinians. The chairman and  myself spoke that they were really working and I think I am  obliged and privileged to express [words indistinct] we went  over some of the most difficult [words indistinct]. We met with  the Austrian president in [word indistinct] in Austria and  Germany. The four cars take four persons, four policemen, and a  Jeep. And then I asked them who was your enemy. If you don't  have an enemy, you cannot put four persons on a Jeep. But when  you have enemies, they would shoot them to kill. It is a  different order. And I think that the chairman and us are  interested in putting an end to it.    We have agreed on Gaza. We have agreed on the distribution  of security and administration and dignity. I think both sides  made a supreme effort. I think we solved most of the problems.  Some of them will be dealt with in Taba because, you know the  documents we signed are two. One is new pages on principles  which is called the Cairo document and the old pages on the  passages and the management in Jericho and in Gaza. The other  of the two involving programs [words indistinct] the people of  Taba. Taba is not a name, Taba is a way of thinking and Gaza is  the same [words indistinct] all the problems which were before  us were solved either completely [word indistinct] or the  principles [words indistinct].    [Reporter] [Question indistinct].    [Peres] Yes. We dealt with these problems and I think most  of them were solved amicably.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct]    [Peres] I am sure that neither Chairman 'Arafat nor Prime  Minister Rabin will remain unemployed people. They still have  some jobs to do, you know.    [Reporter] President Mubarak, when do you think you might be  able to host a similar meeting between the Israeli prime  minister and the Syrian president?    [Mubarak] I hope that this could happen soon. But all what  I could tell you about this point I am very optimistic for  reaching a comprehensive settlement between Israel and Syria and  even Israel and Jordan. So, this is on our concern. Then after  that, whenever this process moves forward it will be easy for  anybody to do the other one. There's no problem. We should  concentrate our efforts on reaching an agreement with the other  parties so as peace prevails which is very important, very  vital, for the whole people all over the area.    [Reporter] Mr. Peres, Foreign Minister Peres, could you  please tell us how you have assured Israel's security by this  agreement? Some of the details by which you have assured the  security of Israel?    [Peres] I think that it all began in Cairo. Chairman  'Arafat said that he will respect the security needs of Israel  [words indistinct] and surely we cannot compromise on our  security. We insisted that we have security measures. In other  words, we have announced that we shall do whatever we can to  introduce an air of dignity and respect for the Palestinian  people. And from our side we tried to do it as much as we can.  Occasionally, it wasn't simple, because what we call security,  the Palestinians call dignity and what the Palestinians call  dignity, we call security. So in names it is easier to do than  problems to solve. But, I am very glad that we have solved all  things this way.    [Reporter] Mr. Peres. You have said that you've come very  close to actually solving it. Can you actually tell us what the  solution is on three of the issues: Gaza, Jericho, and the  third one. What is the actual solution that you have come to?  What have you signed tonight?    [Peres] We shall make known the agreement and you will have  to read many pages.    [Reporter] [Question indistinct].    [Peres] On what?    [Reporter] What is the size of Jericho?    [Peres] We have agreed on the passages as I have said. We  have agreed on the arrangements in Gaza, and there will be  actually three different zones. We have agreed on the size of  Jericho. The final size will be decided between Chairman  'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin when they meet. And, but, we  have agreed on the other components of it. We have agreed on  the security arrangements. We have agreed on the Palestinian  authority, how they can run their own affairs without any  intervention from outside. And we went over a very long list of  problems. The real problem before us, for the Palestinians and  the Israelis, is this is an unprecedented move. We cannot learn  from anybody else. We cannot go to the library and take a book  or a magazine and say here we are going to [word indistinct].  Every solution we have had to adopt was a precedented  solution. That would be a good [words indistinct].    The hopes I believe, of the Palestinians, of us, and our  children is that the reality is even better than the [words  indistinct]. We intend very seriously to give a very good  relations between the Palestinians and ourselves so that papers  will not be needed at all. In order to build relations we need  the papers. But if we shall have relations, we shall not need  the papers. Thank you.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel: "The Future of </F> the Baltic Lies in Europe"]    [Text] Declaring the three Baltic republics independent in  1991 was correcting a historic injustice that had begun with the  1939 Hitler-Stalin pact. The imperial way of thinking in  spheres of influence must not happen again. It would destroy  trust in the possibility of establishing a new type of  cooperation in Europe. The Baltic was and will be one of the  areas in Europe that are particularly sensitive to the major  shifts of our times.    Here lies a crucial test for the new principles of peaceful  coexistence, as laid down in the great CSCE documents of  Helsinki and Paris. The Baltic will be the touchstone of a  future European security structure.    Germany was among the first countries to resume diplomatic  relations with the independent Baltic republics. Since then,  there have been numerous meetings of ministers. Federal  President von Weizsaecker visited all three countries last year.  In continuation of this trustful dialogue, I have invited the  foreign ministers of the three Baltic states to come to Bonn on  9 March 1994.    Together with the Scandinavian countries, Germany has  various  historic and cultural links with the Baltic states. Many German  families have their roots there. Cultural lives in Germany and  the Baltic are closely related historically. This creates deep  emotional links.    The cities of Riga and Tallinn reflect the tradition,  cosmopolitan feel, and prosperity of the Hanseatic League.  Vilnius is characterized by the cultural wealth of the Middle  Ages. For three centuries, the Hanse linked the merchants in  the centers at the Baltic and the North Sea; it dominated the  trade routes and brought about a lively exchange of laws, ways  of life, and artistic styles. In the Hanse, freedom-seeking  towns came together under a loose trade alliance. It was an  early successful model of all-European economic cooperation.  For centuries international trade routes crossed in the Baltics.    Until 1940, economic relations between West Europe and  Russia  mainly went via the Baltics. This European region has always  had the role of mediator. And a number of things indicate that  this might again be the case in the future. Among all the  former Soviet Republics, the Baltic states have carried out the  most impressive reforms. Estonia will probably achieve the best  economic figures of all the Central and East European states  this year.    For a German, visiting the Baltic states brings on a feeling  of familiarity. For us Germans, bringing back to life  long-buried conditions is not only something that is demanded by  our common sense, but also something close to our hearts. The  warm reception the German cultural weeks were given in the  Baltic states last autumn indicates the lively interest we have  for each other. The Goethe Institute in Riga is a good  framework for the growing cultural dialogue. The local Euro  faculty for law, economics, and administration originated from a  German idea. Partnerships between towns and an intense  cooperation between the Baltic states and our north German  laender show that contacts are getting closer on all levels.    In the Baltic, traditions from West and East Europe, from  north and south, meet. The three Baltic republics are,  therefore, yardsticks for the growing together of our continent  to form a unity, following decades of forced separation. Every  political and economic success in the Baltic has effects going  far beyond the region as such. Without stability in the Baltic,  there will be no stability in Europe as a whole.    The Baltic region is predestined to prove that a  cosmopolitan  view and cooperation are far superior to thinking in terms of  hegemonic spheres of influence. A Baltic region that feels  secure and gains prosperity quickly will stimulate growth in the  entire Baltic Sea region. This will also promote a parallel  development in neighboring Russia.    By maintaining close relations with both the Baltic states  and Russia, Germany will help bring about good-neighborly  relations, respect, and mutual understanding in the entire  region.    One of the principal tasks is the quick withdrawal of the  remaining Russian troops that are still stationed in Latvia and  Estonia. There is no reason to delay this or make it subject to  other conditions. No package deal can justify leaving one's  troops on the territory of another sovereign state against its  express wish. We, therefore, welcome Russia withdrawing its  troops from Lithuania and indicating its willingness to pull out  its troops from Latvia and Estonia by 31 August 1994 -- leaving  only a small number of soldiers to continue operating the  Skrunda radar station under a special agreement and for a  strictly limited period of time. And these deadlines must be  kept!    Minorities should not be made a bone of contention but they  should be a starting point for a policy of constructive  neighborly relations and cooperation. Three years ago, the  majority of the Russian-speaking population in the Baltic states  supported independence. Russians, but also Ukrainians,  Belorussians, and others will have to integrate loyally into the  new state structures. On the other hand, those of them who want  to remain living in the Baltic states permanently, must be given  the opportunity to integrate and be protected against  discrimination. We welcome the willingness of the Baltic  republics to include CSCE standards and recommendations by the  Council of Europe in their laws!    The situation of minorities, the withdrawal of troops, and  the securing of the newly gained independence are particularly  sensitive points for all those concerned. This sensitivity  requires a high degree of caution and mutual understanding. It  includes a willingness not to get stuck with individual issues  but to make special efforts, if necessary.    The problems that arose after the collapse of the Soviet  Union demand an increase in regional, bilateral cooperation. In  West Europe we have developed the concept of Euro regions. This  makes use of the necessity of border areas to cooperate on the  basis of equality.    Germany expressly advocates full European Union [EU]  membership for the Baltic states, to be achieved via a period of  association. We want to help these states quickly and generously  to find their rightful place in Europe. As advocates of the  Baltic states, we would like to see European agreements  concluded with them before the end of this year. The EU would  remain incomplete without the three Baltic states becoming  members -- just like the other states in Central and East Europe  with which Europe agreements have been concluded.    At the same time, we are using the Baltic Sea Council as an  instrument of cooperation to keep the peace and create  prosperity. The Baltic Sea has always been a sea that connects  states instead of separating them. At the moment, Estonia  chairs the Baltic Sea Council. A high degree of flexibility, an  ambitious agenda, and northern pragmatism have led to enormous  successes for the Baltic Sea Council. Russia's participation in  this organization emphasizes the country's belonging to Europe.    The Partnership for Peace offered by the NATO summit in  early  January has been welcomed by all Baltic states. All three  states are already partners in the Western European Union's  consultation forum. This way, the security of the Baltic states  is increasingly linked with the security in the rest of Europe.  We consider this to be part of an interlocking strategy where  security will be increasingly based on cooperation. The Baltic  states in particular need comprehensive security structures that  are based on transparency and trust. This is why the CSCE has  an important role to play there. Through its minority envoy and  long-term missions of observers, it has helped defuse conflicts  on minority issues in the past. The forum for cooperation in  security issues offers all countries in that area a framework  for future security arrangements.    The Baltic region has had cultural relations with West  Europe  for centuries. These relations must be revived. This revival  will range from language courses, to students and teacher  exchange programs, and assistance with joint projects. We have  to make up for decades of neglect during the time of isolation  between the blocs. In 1992, German universities had 25 times  more students from Ethiopia than from the three Baltic states  together. We must make special efforts to achieve a greater  balance in the future. I referred to this problem back in early  February, when I proposed a European education initiative for  the eastern part of Europe, a "Marshall Plan for the Mind."  Europe is not just a geographic term, but also a cultural one!  The future of the Baltic states lies with Europe!</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Tumim calls for changes at Maze Improvements to Northern Ireland's top-security Maze jail complex were recommended yesterday by Judge Stephen Tumim, the chief inspector of prisons. He made 76 recommendations in a report on the jail. Five proposals, relating to security issues, were kept secret. The report called for better conditions for inmates including access to toilets at all times, more access to communal areas for education, craft and hobbies, and arrangements to end the two periods a day when prisoners are locked up in their cells. Judge Tumim also said overtime worked by prison officers should be reduced with a view to abolishing it.</p>

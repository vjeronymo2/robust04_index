			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Thai poll strengthens army's grip on power POLITICIANS sympathetic to the armed forces won about half the seats in the lower house of parliament in Thailand's general election yesterday, a qualified victory which suggests they could form a coalition government this week if they can agree on a prime minister. Thailand's return to democracy after its 18th coup d'etat in February last year has been characteristically hesitant, and the election campaign was marred by widespread vote-buying and the killings of several canvassers. Political parties often lack coherent policies and buy members of parliament from each other for lucrative transfer fees, and few Thais were surprised when unofficial results showed that the brand new Samakki Tham (Justice Unity) Party had come out on top with about 78 seats in the 360-seat elected chamber. Samakki Tham was created by senior military officers after last year's coup to ensure a continued role for the armed forces in politics, and its leaders were already negotiating with other pro-military parties last night in an attempt to form a coalition. Although the pro-military politicians did well in the poorer, northern parts of Thailand where vote-buying is routine, parties opposing military intervention in politics were successful in Bangkok and in the politically-aware southern half of the country. Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the former mayor of Bangkok and leader of the Phalang Dharma (Power of Buddhist Teaching) party who campaigned as 'Mr Clean', won an estimated 32 of the 35 seats in the capital and surprised even his supporters by winning about a dozen more seats elsewhere. After staging the coup, the military junta gave the pro-military parties a built-in advantage by devising a controversial new constitution which allows the 270-seat Senate to vote with the lower house in no confidence debates. Yesterday Gen Sunthorn Kongsompong, the junta's chairman, appointed a Senate of which more than half the members were officers of the armed forces and the police. Debate last night was focusing on the identity of the prime minister to replace the outgoing Mr Anand Panyarachun, the military appointee who won the support of the business community for a series of economic reforms during his one-year tenure. Political liberals and student activists are demanding that the new premier be an elected member of parliament, while the military commanders say they have the right to choose anyone they want. Officials of PollWatch, a new watchdog established by Mr Anand, agreed that vote-buying was still widespread in yesterday's election but claimed that PollWatch's existence and the presence of more than 31,000 volunteers at poll booths yesterday had to some extent deterred corrupt politicians. Independent observers said campaigners had been more subtle about the way they bribed and coerced voters, in some cases buying noodle shops and brothels for a week at a time and providing free meals and prostitutes to curry favour with local residents.</p>

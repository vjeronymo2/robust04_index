			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Francophone Socialist Party, PS, has decided  not to quit the governing coalition despite the resignation from  office of three of its senior members. [passage omitted]    Their party, the Parti Socialiste, held an emergency meeting  on Friday evening [21 January]. The party leadership decided  not to quit the government, though it did not name successors to  the three resigning ministers.    According to PS Chairman Philippe Busquin, his party is  outraged that the whole affair has been politicized. The party  also regrets that their Flemish coalition partners, the  Christian Democrat CVP and the Socialist SP, refused to confirm  their confidence in the deputy prime minister.    Mr. Busquin said the reason the PS is not quitting the  government is primarily due to concerns about the social  security system. The PS feels the system may be destroyed, and  it wants to protect it from within the government.    Meanwhile, it has emerged that the anonymous witness in the  Agusta corruption scandal is Mr. Philippe Moreau, who is also a  member of the Francophone Socialist Party. The witness was  identified yesterday by Mr. Coeme himself. Earlier, Philippe  Moreau had been heard by a magistrate of the Supreme Court.  His statements were damaging to both Guy Coeme and Guy  Spitaels, but less so than it was assumed at first. Mr. Moreau  did confirm that his two party colleagues told him personally  that Agusta was prepared to pay a bribe in order to win the  helicopter contract, but he denied that Mr. Spitaels and Mr.  Coeme sent a courier to Luxembourg to collect the money.

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Money Markets: Big sterling shortage CASH RATES in the sterling money market were slightly firmer yesterday after the Bank of England announced a large shortage at the start of its money market operations, writes James Blitz. The shortage of Pounds 2.05bn helped to quash any lingering expectations that the UK authorities might be planning a cut in base rates to coincide with the retail prices index for December. The large shortage led to a sharp jump in the cost of borrowing money overnight in the wholesale market, with the rate going as high as 9 per cent. According to one dealer, this left a few people scrambling desperately for funds. 'A few people had got used to easier money, were short of funds and found themselves having to borrow at higher rates than they had expected,' he said. As it happened, the RPI figures were generally in line with expectations, although there was some slight disappointment at the increase in the underlying rate to 3.7 per cent. This factor, and the tighter liquidity, helped to push 3 month money up by about  1/16 per cent to a close of 7 1/16 per cent. There was more bullishness about a rate cut in the March short sterling futures contract, which rose 2 basis points on the day to close at 93.48. At this level, it prices 3 month money in March at 6.52 per cent, a level which probably assumes a 50 basis point cut in interest rates over the next two months. In Europe, the main focus was on the French franc futures market, where the March contract rose by 25 basis points to close at 90.35. The French currency has performed strongly against the D-Mark all week, raising suggestions that the crisis of the French franc may be over. However, 3-month French cash remained high at around 11 1/2 per cent, a level which commercial banks may find unsustainable without passing on the higher rates to the retail sector. There were strong suggestions yesterday that the Bank of France might re-open the 5-10 day lending window on Monday to ease the banks position. The German government is due to make an announcement on progress on the solidarity pact talks next week. Growing expectations of a successful outcome helped to push the March Euromark contract up 2 basis points to close at 92.20.</p>

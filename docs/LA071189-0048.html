			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIN' ON UP  </P> <P> Hot on the heels of receiving an Emmy Award as outstanding talk/service show  host, Sally Jessy Raphael is moving her syndicated talk show into New York  City. Raphael started the program in St. Louis in 1983, moved to New Haven,  Conn., in 1987 and will be located in the Big Apple starting next month.  Executive producer Burt Dubrow said Monday from New Haven that "we're moving  for the betterment of the show. The kind of guests we need are in New York for  a limited amount of time, and they often can't make the two-hour commute to  Connecticut." However, he added, "We couldn't make the move if we didn't have a  little success under our belt." Raphael's show is now seen in 170 markets  representing 94% of the country. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

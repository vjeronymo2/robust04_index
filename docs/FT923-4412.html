			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities Using a price cap formula to regulate privatised utilities has brought significant benefits. Companies have exploited this incentive to cut costs, and in many cases shareholders have seen the results in dividend payments. However, the RPI-X system has thrown up some anomalies, where apparently similar businesses currently offer very different rates of return. British Gas's pipeline operation, the regional electricity companies and the National Grid are all reasonably comparable businesses with similar risks and growth prospects, yet on a current cost basis the RECs return around 10 per cent, the grid is said to earn around 6 per cent and the Ofgas regulator wants to pin British Gas to 4.5 per cent. True, there are some reasons for the difference. It is arguable that Gas's assets were privatised too cheaply, so the return on existing assets ought to be correspondingly lower. But the company is unlikely to invest in new pipelines at a return no better than that on index-linked gilts. British Gas clearly hopes that the monopolies inquiry will take the point, though it faces an uphill struggle because any improvement in pipeline returns will have to come out of gas marketing margins or customers' pockets. Part of Gas's problem is historical. The company was told to encourage competition after flotation, and so kept pipeline profits down and marketing margins up to attract a limited amount of competition. However, it has since been forced to give up far more of the gas market than it anticipated, cutting into profits. There is probably room for Gas to expand pipeline returns at the expense of the marketing competition, though unless and until the MMC sees things that way, the shares are in limbo. For the electricity companies, life is brighter. Although it is not formally targeted, their rate of return is bound to be cut in the Periodic Review in 1994. But by then dividend cover will be over three times, and the companies can maintain progressive dividends by simply cutting cover. Shareholders may not even notice the bump to profits.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Kuwait debtors register in repayment scheme About 6,000 Kuwaitis owing KD5.5bn (Dollars 18.5bn) in domestic debt, some more than a decade old, have met a March 31 deadline to register for repayment under a government-backed scheme to settle the Gulf state's 'difficult debts', according to Mr Nasser al-Rodhan, the finance minister. A further 3,500 debtors owing KD900m (Dollars 3bn) missed the deadline and could be excluded from the settlement programme entirely, under existing law. The 'difficult debts' were incurred by investors on Kuwait's unofficial stock exchange, known as the Souk al-Manakh, which collapsed in August 1982, leaving some KD7bn of net indebtedness. Since then, a few have repaid under an earlier and now defunct settlement programme. Under the latest settlement programme, which was passed by Kuwait's National Assembly last year and is designed to clear the debts once and for all, debtors who failed to register by March 31 could face government prosecution in the courts and be made to pay what they owe in full, plus interest. However, it is more likely that the law regulating settlement of the debt will be amended, according to a report in Kuwait's al-Watan newspaper quoting Mr al-Rodhan. The aggregate debt figure of Dollars 21.5bn given by the finance minister is Dollars 4.5bn more than the total Souk al-Manakh debt figure previously given. It is nearly Dollars 2bn more than the debt paid in July 1992 by the government when it bought all personal and corporate debt from the private sector from the country's banks in return for a record and one-off issue of government bonds. Mr al-Rodhan's figure is thought to represent gross indebtedness, including some debts which do not revert to the Souk al-Manakh disaster.</p>

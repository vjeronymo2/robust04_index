			<p>BFN     [Text] For a state like Ukraine, participation in the  sitting of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council promotes its  gradual integration into the processes and structures now  emerging in Europe. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Zlenko declared  this in an interview for Ukrainian journalists after the Council  had ended its sitting in Istanbul. Zlenko believes that such  gatherings facilitate an immediate and open dialogue with  partners, offering the chance to explain a position more  clearly, while at the same time allowing the state to win  supporters on an array of urgent issues.    Zlenko emphasized that this year's conference of heads of  foreign political departments from 38 countries was, to a  certain extent, a success with regard to greater understanding  of existing problems and defining approaches to solutions.  Zlenko expressed satisfaction with the fact that the statement  adopted at the sitting of the North Atlantic Cooperation  Council, which assesses the situation around Crimea, notes that  the Crimean issue should be solved in compliance with the UN  Charter and the Final Act of the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe and with respect to Ukraine's territorial  integrity.</p>

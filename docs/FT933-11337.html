			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Nigeria ails beyond the public eye: Economy suffers in political maelstrom WHILE Nigeria's government has been absorbed by the political chaos following the June presidential elections, the economy has been sliding deeper into crisis. The drop in the oil price last week, to around Dollars 16.50 a barrel, is a warning to President Ibrahim Babangida, or his successor, that Nigeria's oil exports cannot resolve a growing balance of payments deficit. 'What worries me most is the complete lack of direction in economic policy,' said the head of one Nigerian bank. The military regime hoped to find that direction in January by creating a civilian Transitional Council to inject life into a structural adjustment programme, which has failed to impress the international creditors and has earned the contempt of most Nigerians. Mr Ernest Shonekan, a leading industrialist who heads the Council, delivered a 1993 budget in January based on three expectations that have not been met: tight control on government spending; a debt relief agreement with Nigeria's official creditors; and a minimum oil price of Dollars 17.50 'The lack of fiscal discipline is the bane of our economy,' said Mr Shonekan in his budget speech. He proposed 'greater fiscal co-ordination and a total clampdown on extra-budgetary releases' to cut the budget deficit to N28bn (Pounds 746m) in 1993. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has yet to publish official figures, but bankers estimate that the budget deficit in the first quarter of the year alone reached N20bn, whilst the rate of inflation has accelerated well beyond the 46 per cent recorded for 1992. Mr Shonekan also set up two committees to make government finances more open. However, 'neither of these committees has made its findings public', said a western economist. The failure to report on accounts which keep the revenue from an estimated 200,000 barrels of oil a day outside budgetary control has been one of several stumbling blocks in Nigeria's negotiations with the International Monetary Fund. During formal talks in May, the Nigerian delegation and a combined IMF-World Bank team failed to reach agreement over the oil revenue figures, the exchange rate policy, and a method to phase out the domestic fuel price subsidy. The collapse of the IMF talks was a serious blow to the Transitional Council. An Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) would provide soft loans and unlock a debt relief package from the Paris Club of official creditors, which is owed about Dollars 16.5bn by Nigeria, over half its external debt. If Nigeria qualified for the Trinidad Terms, over half of that debt could be wiped out. But a Transitional Council plan to remove the oil subsidy was overruled by the ruling military council, and the supply of foreign exchange from the Central Bank to the private sector has been just 10 per cent of funds required, which has widened the gap between the official and parallel market rates to 70 per cent. 'The IMF is not interested in a standby agreement, they want a three-year programme and they do not want to negotiate with a regime which has no track record and no future after August 27' - the scheduled handover date - said one western diplomat. Arrears in debt service to the Paris Club topped Dollars 4bn this year and the budget does not provide for any interest payments on foreign debt, for which Dollars 2bn is due. Further evidence of Nigeria's insolvency came in March when the CBN suspended payments to foreign suppliers worth over Dollars 2bn, or nearly half this year's budget allocation of foreign exchange for imports. The CBN has still not announced how this backlog in payments is to be cleared, but there are inadequate foreign reserves to cover it. 'Whichever way they tackle it, these arrears are going to give a shock to the economy,' said a leading banker. 'If the bills are honoured, it will put heavy pressure on the exchange rate. If they default and issue promissory notes, it will damage Nigeria's credibility among foreign creditors.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          NIGERIA: DEBT SCENARIO  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1992 Est  1993   1994    1995    1996  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Per cent  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Current account balance/GDP        -2.0    -1.1   -1.1    -0.9    -0.8 Debt service ratio                 71.5    38.5   37.9    37.5    35.5 Debt/GDP                          113.2    98.7   85.5    81.1    76.2 Oil price (Dollars per barrel)    19.58   19.57  19.82   20.31   20.82  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMF scenario based on oil price assumptions in table  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

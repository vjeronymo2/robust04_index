			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Bank of Scotland set to expand in Italy BANK OF SCOTLAND is negotiating to take a stake in an Italian company which operates in the home loans market. It would be the first venture the Edinburgh-based institution has made in mortgage lending outside the UK. The bank confirmed yesterday that it was negotiating with Finanziaria Italiana Mutui (FIM), the mortgage lending arm of Sopaf, the Milan-based merchant bank run by Mr Jody Vender, which has branched into a variety of property-related activities. The size of Bank of Scotland's stake could be about 25 per cent or larger, but the bank is unwilling to give more details until a deal is concluded. According to Italian press reports, both Bank of Scotland and SAI, the Italian insurance company, would take sizeable stakes in FIM in order to expand it. SAI is controlled by Mr Salvatore Ligresti, a controversial property developer who also has a dominant interest in Grassetto, one of Italy's biggest building groups. Italy has a relatively large mortgage market, which has been buoyed by the high level of owner-occupancy and of second home ownership. About 65 per cent of Italians own their own homes, a figure similar to that in the UK. Mortgage lending has been dominated by local and regional savings banks, and by co-operative banking institutions. However, glaring inefficiencies among many of the domestic players, notably in the time taken to negotiate mortgages, have attracted foreign participants, many of them from the UK. Abbey National has opened eight branches since it arrived in 1989, while the Woolwich building society provides mortgage services for smaller regional and local banks. Both claim they can process a mortgage application within a week - whereas some Italian banks take up to six months. In the case of FIM, the alliance of a foreign bank and a domestic insurer, linked with a builder and property developer, could produce a formidable combination. Bank of Scotland last year took a 5 per cent stake in Sistemi di Monetica, an Italian credit card company. Its other foreign operations are a 30 per cent stake in Dorian Bank of Greece and a joint credit card venture with the Quelle mail order company in Germany.</p>

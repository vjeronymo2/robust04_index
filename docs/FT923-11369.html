			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Inflation slows in key German states THE EXPECTED sharp fall in west German inflation this month has been confirmed, with latest figures showing a one percentage point drop in the rate of price increases in three important states. Figures released yesterday showed year-on-year inflation was only 2.7 per cent in Hesse and 3.2 per cent in Baden-Wurttemberg. North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, reported a 3.2 per cent rise on Thursday. The news, while received calmly in the markets, prompted an extraordinary double-take in the finance ministry. A press release quoting Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, as saying that the fall below 4 per cent 'supports the possibility that the Bundesbank will relax monetary policy in the foreseeable future' was later withdrawn. The finance ministry blamed a 'technical mistake'; the statement had not been cleared by Mr Waigel, it said. 'The Bundesbank had nothing at all to do with it,' a spokesman claimed. Although welcome, the slowdown was almost wholly attributable to a technical adjustment as increases in petrol duties and telephone charges introduced in June last year dropped out of the year-on-year calculations. While aggregate inflation for west Germany will not be officially published for a week or more, the latest figures confirm the widely forecast cut. But underlying influences are still not easing. The federal statistics office said the rate of increase in producer prices was 2 per cent in July, compared with the same figure in June and 1.9 per cent in May. Above-average rises for heavy heating oil, up 5.7 per cent, and butter, up 6.9 per cent, cancelled out reduced costs for steel and plastics. The Bundesbank, which allows no interference from Bonn in its monetary policy-making, last week raised its discount rate from 8 per cent to 8.75 per cent in pursuit of its twin aims of lower inflation and tighter money supply. The move, unpopular with government ministers who are under pressure from their international colleagues because of high German interest rates, was made in the knowledge that inflation would fall this month. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's annual report on Germany had earlier said the Bundesbank should keep rates high for as long as necessary to squeeze inflation out of the economy. It suggested a target of 2 per cent a year or less. Although inflationary pressure is expected to remain muted for the rest of this year, there is some concern that a burst of consumer spending, prompted by cancellation of a 7.5 per cent income tax surcharge at the end of June, may tempt manufacturers and retailers to pass on pent-up cost increases. The results of this year's average 5.8 per cent wage awards are already showing through in above average inflation in service industries. The housing shortage is pushing up rents rapidly. A 0.5 per cent increase in inflation is already programmed for January as a result of an increase in value added tax from 14 per cent to 15 per cent.</p>

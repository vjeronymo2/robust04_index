			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Accountant Admits Involvement in Loan Fraud: A certified public accountant  pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to defraud the government in  connection with a $9.5-million "straw loan" between CB Financial Corp. in  Oklahoma and the now-defunct Orange County-based Consolidated Savings Bank.  Phil G. Gilbert was an executive vice president of Consolidated Savings Bank  when the loan was executed in 1985.  </P> <P> To circumvent a lending limitation to a Texas partnership in which the thrift's  sole shareholder had a financial interest, Consolidated transferred the money  through C. B. Financial to the partnership, falsifying loan records to conceal  the actual transfer from federal regulators. Gilbert faces a maximum sentence  of five years and a fine of $250,000. The collapse of Consolidated is  considered a top-priority investigation by federal authorities. (Case No.  90-808. Plea Entered Nov. 6)  </P></p>

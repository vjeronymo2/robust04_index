From January 1994 until now, they increased exports by 1.5  times over the same period of last year by carrying on a  vigorous struggle to thoroughly implement the great leader's New  Year's address and the decisions made at the 21st plenary  session of the Sixth party Central Committee.    Cities and counties in South Pyongan Province are  concentrating great efforts on developing local trade.  Normalization of production of export items at a high level has  been achieved at 50 production bases in the province. The  province has actively carried out a struggle to create new bases  and to increase exports to bring about the five-fold increase of  exports in February over the same period of last year.    In Nampo, prospective production bases of export items have  been prepared based on the city's geographic and economic  conditions and on a close estimation of overseas demand  [taeoejok suyo]. From the beginning of this year until now, the  city increased exports 2.9 times over the same period of last  year by diversifying and varying trade [muyogul tagakhwa  tayanghwa hamurosso].    In this city, Chollima district and Kangso district set  examples in exporting. These districts have prepared excellent  bases for producing various metal products, farming products,  and local specialities and properly carried on production  organization and technological guidance. They keep  overfulfilling monthly export plans at 120 percent or more.    South Hamgyong, North Hamgyong, Chagang, and North Hwanghae  Provinces also scored gains in exporting, with deep interest in  the development of local trade, upholding the party's  trade-first policy.    These provinces are operating well Kyongamsan Export Garment  Plant, Hamhung Silk Plant, and other plants and are increasing  exports in various ways -- such as processing trade [kagong  muyok], joint operation [habyong], and joint venture [hapchak].    Najin district, Huichon, Chonchon county, Hwangju county,  and  Yontan county take the lead in implementing monthly export plans  by developing mulberry fields and increasing the production of  straw goods, industrial art products, and other export items.    Enthusiastically implementing the party's trade-first  policy,  working people in Kaesong are well carrying on production  organization to achieve the goal of diversifying goods of Koryo  ceramics, industrial art products, Koryo ginseng, handicrafts,  and other specialities of the city and adding 30 more kinds of  export items this year.    They explored many export sources [suchul wonchon] by  displaying their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativeness so  they could fulfill the city's overall export plan for February  at 140 percent. Encouraged by this success, they continue to  effect innovations in producing export items.</p>

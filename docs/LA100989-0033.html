			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Wildlife specialists from more than 100 countries began meeting in Lausanne,  Switzerland, focusing on an effort to keep Africa's fast-dwindling elephant  population from disappearing forever. Delegates of the Convention on  International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as  CITES, must find common ground between the East Africa demand for an ivory ban,  supported by the United States and Western Europe, and the position that  controlled marketing of tusks can finance anti-poaching measures. CITES rulings  are non-binding and rely on international pressure for enforcement.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Gaidar vows to fight on for radical reform: The hard-pressed Russian premier sets out his market economy programme to John Lloyd MR YEGOR GAIDAR, the acting Russian prime minister, yesterday said his government would 'fight as long as we can' for radical reform. In an interview with the Financial Times, he said he would not compromise with the powerful centrist forces who are urging an end to the reform programme in favour of an 'anti-crisis' package to support industry. Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, warned yesterday that 'the government cannot carry out reform with the opposition of business - it's nonsense'. Mr Gaidar said: 'Yes, we will compromise on some things, such as on defence conversion. But we will not compromise on whether or not we will go forward to a market economy'. Mr Gaidar was speaking the day after challenging the parliament with a speech promising a return to the harsh monetary discipline of the first quarter of this year. The government would still face calls for its resignation, Mr Gaidar said, even though Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, and a bitter foe of government policy, on this occasion had deflected opposition calls for a vote of no confidence. This had not defused the struggle but only postponed it. 'We will see how the situation develops. We now face very tough opposition in parliament.' The prime minister acknowledged that tough limits on credits would cause bankruptcies - and he forecast a bitter struggle over the passing of a bankruptcy law. As evidence of the government's determination, Mr Gaidar said it 'might be possible' to bring inflation down to single monthly figures and to confine the budget deficit to 5 per cent of GDP by the end of the year, as he had pledged to the International Monetary Fund. Inflation is running at between 20 and 25 per cent a month and the budget deficit is estimated at between 14 and 17 per cent of GDP. In a strong plea to the west for debt rescheduling, Mr Gaidar said Russia could pay at most Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.5bn) of debt repayments totalling Dollars 12bn this year. 'We appreciate there are serious problems, particularly with the Germans who are owed the most. We are negotiating. It is absolutely crucial to our success.' He outlined the three main areas of work in restoring order to the chaotic finances. First, he would negotiate the exit from the rouble zone of those former Soviet republics - in particular Ukraine - who wished to create their own currency. In the past week, credits advanced to Ukraine of around Rbs100bn had 'pushed up inflation to new heights'. The government has frozen all monetary transactions between the two republics. Mr Gaidar said 'we had no choice. We are not in a position to grant unlimited credits to third parties'. He said he was working on the assumption Ukraine would create a new currency, as agreed, on October 1. Second, Mr Gaidar would 'work intensively' with Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank acting chairman, to reduce credits to enterprises. 'The actions taken by the central bank in this direction have been dangerous, but I do not think it wants to undermine the financial policy'. Third, privatisation of big state enterprises would be pushed ahead, and extra resources made available to the privatisation committee. 'We have terrible legal problems here, a lack of qualified staff. But so far we are on schedule'. Some 7m privatisation vouchers, each worth Rbs10,000, have been delivered. Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, said yesterday that success in this area would make the reforms irreversible.</p>

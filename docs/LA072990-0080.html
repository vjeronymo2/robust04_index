			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIVER OF GUNS IN L.A. NEVER STOPS FLOWING;  </P> <P> WEAPONS: ABOUT 25,000 FIREARMS A YEAR ARE DESTROYED. THE INVENTORY HAS GOTTEN  MORE POWERFUL, INCLUDING AN ANTITANK ROCKET LAUNCHER.  </P> <P> A river of blued steel and chrome flows from dozens of police evidence rooms  throughout Los Angeles County to a scrap metal shredder in Long Beach.  </P> <P> In the last two decades, Clean Steel Inc. has taken 450,000 guns out of  circulation -- enough weapons each year to arm every man, woman and child in a  city the size of South Pasadena.  </P> <P> The river never stops. This month, about 25,000 firearms -- from derringers to  antiaircraft guns -- were crunched, loaded on barges, and towed to Japan to  make rebars for homes and skyscrapers. It was the haul of a single year. Next  year, the shelves of these evidence rooms will brim anew with at least 25,000  guns.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department seize these guns as evidence in crimes ranging from gas station  stickups to long-planned murders. Many of the weapons were stolen from gun  collectors or homeowners who bought them for protection, authorities said.  </P> <P> "The more guns there are out there, the more guns there are to be stolen and  used in crimes," said Bill Moran, commanding officer for the LAPD's  30,000-square-foot central property room.  </P> <P> "Take this one, for instance," Moran said, holding up a flat-black Spas  12-gauge shotgun with a pistol grip and collapsible stock. "You don't shoot  quail with one of these."  </P> <P> He opened drawers stuffed with guns and ammunition, including a .45-caliber  Mac-10 equipped with a silencer, an antitank rocket launcher and Teflon-coated  bullets capable of penetrating concrete and cars. A Thompson submachine gun in  a violin case, an arresting echo of Prohibition days, rested on a nearby shelf.  </P> <P> "That thing could sure ruin your day," Moran said.  </P> <P> All the guns seized in crimes each year are tagged, trotted out for trials, and  returned to endless aisles of shelves. Unless the rightful owners claim them,  they will go to the scrap yard next July.  </P> <P> Only the composition of the river of steel changes from year to year, police  say. Sampling it shows a dark side of Southern California and, perhaps, the  nation.  </P> <P> "There's tons of guns out there," said Sheriff's Deputy Edward Nordskog. "Why?  Because everybody is afraid. Why? Because they read the papers and watch  television and believe they need protection."  </P> <P> Guns have evolved over the last 20 years. While police said that the bulk of  confiscated weapons are still handguns -- .22-caliber pistols and snub-nosed  "Saturday night specials" -- the evidence rooms are becoming crowded with more  imposing weapons, an arsenal that could outfit a modern guerrilla army. There  are automatic 12-gauge "street sweepers," machine pistols and assault rifles  capable of firing bursts of armor-piercing bullets in seconds.  </P> <P> Those who process this materiel find the work frightening.  </P> <P> "The guns scare me to death, to tell you the truth," said Officer Lillian  Woodfin, who has logged more than 15,000 guns in her three years in the Police  Department's heavily guarded central property room. "It's sad that these  weapons are destroying us."  </P> <P> About 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, Sheriff's Deputy Bob Schneider was  helping to catalogue and stack the 10 guns a day that come through the Lynwood  Sheriff's Station -- the busiest district in the county with 20 gang-related  murders reported so far this year.  </P> <P> Schneider, who was a reserve officer in Merced before joining the Sheriff's  Department in February, waved a hand over box loads of pistols and gun racks  stacked with assault rifles and sawed-off shotguns.  </P> <P> "In Merced, you could count the number of guns on one hand," he said. "When I  came here I asked, 'Where did all these guns come from?'  </P> <P> "I was told, 'From drive-bys, assaults, premeditated murders and rapes' --  stuff I only saw in the movies."  </P> <P> Around the corner from the Lynwood Station, a 17-year-old gang member talked  knowledgeably about the gun business.  </P> <P> "Nowadays, you can expect to get shot back in a drive-by -- so you better have  a good gun," he said, speaking only on the condition that his name not be used.  "You can let go a lot of shots, reload and do it again. It's safer."  </P> <P> Peering up and down Imperial Avenue for the ride that would take him to a job  interview at a hamburger joint, he went on:  </P> <P> "But you take a big risk when you buy a gun on the street, because they might  have put murders in it. Or you could shoot someone and sell it to someone else.  </P> <P> "It goes on and on."  </P> <P> Just like the river.  </P></p>

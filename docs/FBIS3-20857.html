Joint-stock corporations and  corporations with limited liability are the most active in this  area. For the most part, however, these investments are in the  tertiary sphere, the acquisition of production capacities is  sporadic. Two-thirds of the investments are of a material  character.    Property participation by Czech foreign exchange nationals  abroad--in other words, direct investments from the Czech  Republic--amounted to $45.2 million for 1993, according to  preliminary data, according to what the director of the Foreign  Exchange Department of the Czech National Bank, Jiri Zimola,  told our newspaper. According to him, Czech enterprises are  substantially more active in this regard in comparison to  previous years. In 1992, approximately $28 million was invested  abroad, and, in 1991, investments abroad amounted to only $3  million. The period 1992 and part of 1993 was a preparatory one  for privatization. This is also reflected in the lower degree of  interest on the part of state enterprises in activities abroad,  the director noted. In 1993, more than 90 percent of the  investments were accounted for by stock corporations and  corporations with limited liability. The share of state  enterprises in this endeavor was about 1 percent.    Last year, the largest investments abroad were made, for  example, by Skoda Mlada Boleslav (in Great Britain), the  Prachovice Cement and Lime Kilns (Netherlands), Invest Plzen  (Russia), Strojimport (Austria), CSKD Intrans (Slovakia), the  Maritime Navigation Enterprise (Malta), and the Stone Industry  of Brno (Croatia). Last year, the largest investments were made  in Malta, where a maritime freighter was purchased and, at the  same time, registered. Other than that, the top investments were  made in Russia, Slovakia, and Great Britain.    The absolute majority of investments are aimed at business  and services because enterprises are attempting to use them in  support of their exports, according to J. Zimola. Meanwhile, the  acquisition of production capacities is more isolated for the  time being. One of the few examples of this type of investment  can be the Vitkovice Ironworks investment in Algeria, the  realization of which is in the negotiation phase for the time  being. Because investments in the tertiary sphere are  financially relatively undemanding, the overall value of direct  investments is not overly great, the director added. In  relationship to the volume of foreign exchange flowing into the  Czech Republic, these investments represent substantially only a  negligible amount. However, the interest in production  investments, and, thus, the overall volume of direct  investments, should grow together with the progress made in the  privatization of large industrial enterprises, he added.    According to the foreign exchange law, all investment  activities abroad are subject to foreign exchange permission  issued by the Czech National Bank, following negotiations with  the Ministries of Finance, Industry, and Commerce. Primarily,  consideration is given to project investment returns that, when  dealing with investments in the tertiary sphere, are currently  running at about two to three years; in the case of production  investments, returns are running at four to five years. The  Czech National Bank is also interested in the form of the  investments. Last year, only a small portion (22.9 percent) was  realized financially. Some 63 percent of the investments were  material in character (primarily by providing mechanical  equipment). The remainder involves principally the  capitalization of accounts receivable.</p>

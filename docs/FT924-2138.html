			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Japan puts forward recipe for improved EC relations JAPAN and the European Community risk causing irreparable harm to their relations unless they quickly take an historic opportunity to fashion a political and economic partnership, according to a wide-ranging report from the Tokyo Foreign Ministry on Japan's relations with Europe. The report by a specially appointed group of advisers is Japan's most comprehensive attempt yet to lay out a foreign policy framework for its relations with the EC. The study, which makes 90 recommendations on measures to improve relations, is partly designed to respond to fears among some EC officials of growing trade friction in spite of last year's joint Hague declaration on political co-operation. The group which compiled the report for the ministry was chaired by Mr Teruhiko Mano, adviser to the president of the Bank of Tokyo, and included academics and business executives. Senior Foreign Ministry officials said the document would help to provide a framework for Japan's medium-term approach to the EC. It says the EC and Japan need to develop a closer relationship in part to balance the much stronger relationships each has with the US. It describes the EC's integration programme was an historical experiment which should create an economically dynamic and political stable power at the heart of Europe. It displays considerable confidence in the EC's ability to overcome delays in the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty, which it says should prove to be no more than temporary setbacks. However, it also warns that relations with the EC have traditionally been marked by trade frictions, which have been underpinned by misunderstandings on both sides. It says: 'In Europe there remains a deep rooted tendency to believe that Europe only can set universal standards and that what is universal ought to derive from Europe.' Japan would have to harmonise many of its economic practices with international standards, particularly by reducing working time. But Japan's growing trade surplus with the EC was largely a reflection of EC producers' relative lack of interest in penetrating Japan. The report's main recommendation is for a series of joint study groups on the prospects for free trade, corporate behaviour, science and the environment and financial assistance for developing countries.</p>

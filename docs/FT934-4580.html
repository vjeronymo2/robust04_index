			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Spanish telephone group to link with partners Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications operator, said yesterday it planned to enter into 'intensive co-operation' with Unisource, the joint venture linking the telecom companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. The move is widely regarded as a first step towards Telefonica's taking an equity stake in Unisource, which is aimed at providing one-stop telecommunications services to the world's multinationals. PTT Telecom, the Dutch shareholder in Unisource, said: 'We don't rule out the possibility that Telefonica will become a shareholder at a later stage.' Unisource is fighting to establish itself in the field of 'outsourcing' in direct competition with similar ventures by AT&amp;T, British Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. Its co-operation with Telefonica will be exclusive, meaning that the Spanish company will not be able to enter into deals with Unisource's competitors. In October, Unisource concluded a non-exclusive alliance with Kokusai Denshin Denwa, Japan's biggest telephone operator, which left the Japanese company free to continue its involvement in the 'Worldsource' venture launched by AT&amp;T in the spring. Under a co-operation agreement signed yesterday, Telefonica will provide customer support to Unisource's clients in Spain, while the Unisource partners will look after Telefonica's clients outside Spain. The agreement with Telefonica is important to Unisource because it opens up southern Europe and provides access to markets in Latin America. Telefonica has holdings in telecom operators in Chile, Argentina and Puerto Rico. 'The agreement marks a vital step in the internationalisation of Telefonica and the positioning of Unisource as a leading pan-European telecommunications supplier,' Unisource said. Unisource is continuing to look for a possible equity partner on the North American market. A commercial agreement with Sprint, the US carrier, on the use of telephone lines is set to expire at the end of this year.</p>

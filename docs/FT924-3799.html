			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Man in the News: Fighter who is his own man - Yegor Gaidar Yegor Gaidar was born as a politician at the last Congress of People's Deputies in April. The mild-mannered former academic and journalist came out fighting before a hall of deputies only a little less hostile than they are now. Then, he threatened his critics with his government's resignation - and won, when they agreed to his economic reforms. Now, as a vote on the continuation of his powers is expected daily at the current congress, he has refused to woo those who must confirm him. This seventh meeting of Russia's parliament sees a new role for the acting prime minister and the architect of radical economic reform: that of a more experienced statesman-of-principle who can still win a round or two of bare-knuckle combat. Many of his colleagues have undergone a similar transformation - particularly his deputies, Alexander Shokhin and Anatoly Chubais, and Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. But Gaidar must bear the largest burden of responsibility by far, a burden made heavier by the 'acting' which precedes his prime ministerial title, and gives him the aspect of always being on trial. Though Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is no longer untouchable, he is protected by his office and his mandate: Gaidar, by contrast, occupies a post which in the Soviet system was firmly controlled by the Politburo and which he now holds only because Yeltsin supports him. Yet he remains his own man. His speech on Wednesday was not calculated to win round the uncommitted deputies in the 'swamp' of the central ground: indeed, one deputy estimated after it was made that Gaidar had lost 20 per cent of his support. If so, it was not through a display of cowardice. To a hall more than half full of men and women chosen because they had been loyal upholders of communism, he mocked the Soviet period as one where 'discussions of reform plans went on for a year and a half and they privatised 107 shops, 57 canteens and restaurants, and 36 consumer service departments'. To those deputies who had spent much of the past year trying to whip up an apathetic populace to public protest, he observed that strikes were down to a sixth of the levels a year ago and 'even demonstrations are hard to organise'. And to the majority who had just put together a catch-all motion condemning the reform programme as 'contrary to the interests of most of the population', he said that there was no alternative to his way. His speech still bore the hallmarks of the academic - he observed that 'Ludwig Erhard (the progenitor of German economic reform after the last war) would be spinning in his grave' to observe what parliament had voted for in the name of a 'social market' - namely, inflationary wage and pension rises. But Gaidar also proved he is now a politician who thinks on his feet: responding to a speech by Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliament's speaker, who had talked of a choice between an American monetarist model and a Scandinavian social democratic model, he presented himself as the practical man. He wearily dismissed Khasbulatov's abstruse theorising - 'we're simply not at the stage where such a choice is realistic'. Darkly, he warned the deputies that the real choice was between cleaving to the hard path of reform, or descending to the status of the third world. In insisting that economic policy must again be tightened, in stressing his own government's mistakes in allowing credit to be loosened and inflation to climb towards hyperinflationary levels, he again showed his independence by contradicting much of what Yeltsin had earlier promised. But if he is to control the country's finances, and realise his efforts to stabilise the currency and force industry to reconstruct, then he and Russia face greater trials than he is presently undergoing in the overpoliticised arena of the congress. Gaidar has not yet done what he said he would do: he has not been able to change the economy to such an extent that companies and individuals now responded to market signals. He argued in his speech they were beginning to do so: that 'production is beginning to respond to changing demand, directors are beginning to be concerned first of all about sales': but he is, as he knows, plucking the first fruits - important as they are - not gathering in a harvest. Some of this is his own fault. He was too confident, at first, of the ability of the government to hold the line on public spending. He underestimated the power of the bureaucracy and the industrial lobbies, and may have been too sanguine about the readiness of the west to assist and of foreign companies to invest. He talked, as did others in his team, about a kamikaze raid on the command-administrative system - an attack which would sink the system, even as it destroyed the government which dared to launch it. But both the government and Gaidar survive, and both are fighting for their lives. In the course of the past year, he and others, including the foreign governments that hope anxiously for a continuation of reform, have learned there is no such thing in the former Soviet Union as short, sharp shocks - only long, complex movements through a society too inured to command and direction to react quickly to anything, even liberation. As he struggles, the environment in which he does so has changed. Mr Yeltsin, on Tuesday, unequivocally pointed to the state as the lodestar of reform, reminding his audiences in and outside the congress hall that Russians had always looked to the state to assist them, in a way the Americans and British had not - a reminder, it seemed, from the president to his acting prime minister that Anglo-Saxon laissez-faire has its limits. Many of his supporters in the west have asked recently whether or not Gaidar should resign, and lead his team out of government in order to preserve a market-reform alternative unsullied by too much compromise. He has thought of this: but has decided to fight, at least through this congress, for the acceptance of a reasonable budget for next year. After that? There may still be no alternative to his course of action.</p>

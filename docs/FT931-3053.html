			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Credit cut may hit scheme benefits - Occupational Pensions OCCUPATIONAL pension schemes, particularly 'mature' schemes with few contributing members and large numbers of existing pensioners, will be hard hit by the Chancellor's tax changes. From the new year, for pension schemes and other tax-exempt investors, the amount of tax credit that can be reclaimed in cash from the Inland Revenue on share dividends will fall from 25 per cent to 20 per cent. Mr Andrew Wilson, partner in charge of research at consulting actuaries R Watson and Co estimates that the move will deprive UK pension schemes of about Pounds 900m per year in income. 'That means either cuts in benefits or increases in contribution rates,' he said. The tax changes, he said, could force some of the companies currently using pension scheme surpluses to cut or omit their own corporate contributions to resume funding. The National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade association, found that 53 per cent of employers are making reduced or no contributions to their schemes. Those schemes are relying on the combination of employee contributions and investment income to pay benefits to current pensioners. Because many of these are in declining industries where employers' finances are already strained, they are ill-prepared to spend more on pensions. Mr Brian Matthews, finance director at ESN Management Group, the pension scheme of the electricty supply companies, estimated the tax changes will deprive his scheme of about Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m of income per year. However, there will be no need to adjust either benefits or contribution rates because of the large number of current contributing members, he said. 'A more mature scheme dependent on investment income is in a different situation,' he noted. The effects of the tax changes will become more pronounced for individual schemes after the next actuarial valuation - an event which occurs at triennial intervals. Because actuaries value equities not on market value but use a method known as 'discounted income value' - based on anticipated cash flow - pension schemes will show a smaller asset pool at their next valuation. Thus, even relatively young schemes may have to re-evaluate both contribution rates and benefits.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Bonds: GECC draws German interest with L200bn offering THERE was a lull in the international bond market yesterday as the International Monetary Fund meetings continued in Washington. However, the volume of new issues is expected to pick up markedly in the next few weeks. Belgium is likely to launch a five-year Eurobond issue of between Dollars 400m and Dollars 500m in the first half of October. Some syndicate managers said that the sovereign borrower could achieve a better execution through an offering of floating-rate notes (FRNs), as opposed to a fixed-rate deal. News that Finland had made a Dollars 2bn shelf registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday has fuelled speculation that a global offering will be launched soon, in spite of denials from the Finnish finance ministry. The European Community is reported to be considering a Eurobond issue of up to DM2bn, or the equivalent in Ecus, while the Spanish region of Andalucia is thought to be seeking to raise D-Marks or French francs. Megal, the Franco-German gas pipeline group which has been absent from the Euromarket since 1989, is looking to raise D-Marks. Among yesterday's offerings, GECC launched a L200bn offering of five-year Eurobonds, the proceeds of which were thought to have been swapped into fixed-rate dollars at an all-in cost of 15 basis points below the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Some syndicate managers said the bonds were tightly priced but an official at lead manager Paribas said the pricing was in line with secondary market levels. The bonds traded at 99.75 in the afternoon, comfortably within fees. The Paribas official said that there was particular demand for the bonds from Germany but that investors in Switzerland and the Benelux countries had expressed an interest. Continued investor demand for high-yielding paper ensured an enthusiastic reception for Philippine National Oil Company's (PNOC) first Eurobond issue. Demand was such that the five-year offering raised Dollars 90m, compared with a planned amount of Dollars 60m. The bonds were priced to yield 265 basis points over the 4 3/4 per cent US Treasury due 1998, well below the indicated yield spread of 270 to 290 basis points. Trading in the bonds opened at 100.50, well above the re-offer price of 99.63, and there were reports that the bonds traded briefly above 101. An official at the lead manager JP Morgan said that over half of the bonds were sold to investors in Asia Pacific while the remainder was divided equally between Europe and the US. Private clients and emerging market funds featured among the buyers. PNOC's issue is expected to be followed by a five-year deal of about Dollars 150m from Philippine National Power Company, via Morgan Stanley. The spread on the issue is expected to be tighter than PNOC's offering, because it will be guaranteed by the government. Continued demand for FRNs enabled Spintab, the Swedish domestic mortgage association owned by Swedbank, to raise a further Dollars 100m by re-opening its Dollars 250m FRN offering which was launched in late August. Nordic borrowers have enjoyed a significant improvement in the spreads they have to pay in the Eurobond market as investors take a more balanced view on the region's creditworthiness.</p>

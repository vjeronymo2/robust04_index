			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, 17 May (PANA) -- The archbishop of the Church  of Nigeria, Reverend Abiodun Adetiloye, has called on the  country's military ruler, Gen. Sani Abacha, to relinquish power  without delay.    In an open letter dated 11 May, released to the media in  Lagos late Monday [16 May], the Anglican cleric urged the  Nigerian leader to reverse immediately the annulment of  country's 12 June 1993 election results and install a  democratically elected government. "Now is the time for you to  bow out honourably" he said. "If you cannot see the handwriting  on the wall and bow out, the end may be inglorious." Rev.  Adetiloye told Abacha that refusal to [word indistinct] would  throw Nigeria into "a disastrous revolution" that could divide  the country.    In an apparent reference to former military ruler, Gen.  Ibrahim Babangida, who stepped down from after annulling the  elections in which millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola  claimed victory, the archbishop said: "De-annul the annulment,  install the democratically elected president and [word  indistinct] honour as a hero of the decade, otherwise your exit  would be equally inglorious."    The archbishop expressed surprise that the Nigerian leader  had gone to South Africa to witness the inauguration of  President Nelson Mandela after his (Abacha's) "active  participation in the annulment of a free, fair and peaceful  election" of Nigeria's own president.    The archbishop's letter comes in the wake of growing  pressure  from various organisations, groups and individuals on the  Nigerian leader to step down. [passage indistinct]</p>

We are generally informed of a State's decision to initiate a mass change when such information becomes a matter of public knowledge. In the past, prior to initiating a mass change, we have endeavored to discuss the impact with responsible State officials and expect to do this in the event of future mass changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Supplementary Information section of the proposed regulations is misleading because recent legislation requires States to pay fees for Federal administration of their State supplementary payments. This requirement is important because it may affect the State's ability to pay the cost of State supplementary payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree and have amended the discussion under Supplementary Information to reflect the fact that as of October 1, 1993, we charge States that have elected Federal administration of their State supplementary payments an administration fee for each supplementary payment made on behalf of the State, pursuant to section 13731 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;66). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  SSA should inform each State of the potential loss of medicaid payments that can accompany a reduction or termination of a State supplementary payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe that all States that supplement the Federal SSI benefit are aware that reduction of State supplementary payment levels below those levels established by section 1618 of the Act may result in the loss of their eligibility for payments pursuant to title XIX. Indeed, we periodically discuss with those States the impact of section 1618 of the Act on their payment levels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Allowing appeals in mass change cases only if the individual contests the computation of his or her revised State supplementary payments creates a threshold jurisdictional issue that will further complicate the appeals process and will not result in a significant cost savings to SSA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. By limiting appeals only to cases in which the recipient disputes the computation of his or her State supplementary payment resulting from a mass change, SSA will effect a significant cost savings. Furthermore, by prohibiting the pursuit of such claims through the administrative and judicial process, SSA will avoid the substantial administrative consequences that can result when large numbers of individuals who wish only to contest the propriety, fairness, or legality of a mass change request appeals of reductions, suspensions, or terminations resulting from that mass change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on our responses to the comments on the proposed rules, we have not changed the text of the proposed rules. In these final rules, we made only several nonsubstantive changes to the proposed rules. We are, therefore, publishing the proposed rules essentially unchanged as final rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order No. 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed these rules and determined they meet the criteria for a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

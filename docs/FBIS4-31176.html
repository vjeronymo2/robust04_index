			<p>BFN     [Text] The discussion on the new charter of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] has been going on for six hours now.  Thus, the forecast of many delegates -- that the basic party  document would be adopted without any problems -- has been  proven wrong. According to our correspondents at the congress,  the delegates have only adopted only one-third of the charter's  articles so far. However, according to circles in the BSP  Supreme Council, the basic work is still to come because the  disputed articles related to the BSP Supreme Council's rights  and prerogatives, its relations with the parliamentary factions,  and the elections of the DUMA chief editor have not yet been  discussed.    Our correspondents have predicted that because of the  prolonged discussion on the charter, the 41st BSP Congress will  begin the procedure to elect the new BSP leading organs and  party leader late tonight or possibly even tomorrow morning.  Different names of possible candidates for the post of party  leader are mentioned in the corridors -- among them Zhan  Videnov, Aleksandur Marinov, Yanaki Stoilov, Nikolay Kamov, and  Georgi Pirinski.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Servants of Aggressors"--KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam group  will send the South Korean puppet navy to the Rimpac joint  manoeuvres to be held under the baton of the United States.    NODONG SINMUN today views this as a scheme to prop up the  tottering regime and gratify its wild ambition for the  reunification of the country through Northward invasion by  serving the United States as its servant and shock brigade in  the execution of its policy of aggression and war.    The analyst says:    An official of the defence agency of Japan made it plain  that  the manoeuvres are a dangerous military action directed against  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea when he said the joint  operation in the Rimpac "will be a political message" to "North  Korea over its nuclear program."    The United States intends to facilitate the formation of the  U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance and, at the  same time, establish "a collective security system" involving  the whole of the Asian-Pacific region by inveigling South Korea  and Japan into the manoeuvres.    The Korean peninsula is the first target in the "new  military  strategy" of the United States seeking "a new world order" after  "the end of the Cold War." And it is the invariable goal pursued  by the United States in its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to  put the Korean people on the altar of a nuclear war. The Kim  Yong-sam group is zealously behaving as a shock brigade in the  execution of this criminal aggressive strategy, fully revealing  its true color as a faithful war servant of the United States  and a group of traitors trying to slay the fellow countrymen in  the North in league with outside forces.    The South Korean puppets must stop imprudently serving the  United States in its perilous policy of war, clearly mindful  that they have nothing to get from toeing outside forces' policy  of "strength."</p>

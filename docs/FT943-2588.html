			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Companies in shadow of gun: Squeezed by new laws curbing racketeering, Japanese gangsters may be stepping up violence against business The murder last week of a senior executive of one of Japan's largest companies has brought into alarmingly sharp relief the activities of the country's organised crime syndicates. Police suspect that the killing may be the latest episode in what they believe to be an escalation of the war between the racketeers and Japanese corporations. The body of Mr Kazufumi Hatanaka was discovered outside his apartment in Nagoya, Japan's fourth largest city, 120 miles west of Tokyo. He had been shot once through the head. Mr Hatanaka was the director of Sumitomo Bank's Nagoya branch. Police have traced no motive and identified no suspects, but the circumstances of the killing and the use of firearms, which are severely restricted in Japan, suggest the involvement of organised crime. Immediate speculation, that police did little to dispel, focused on the relationship between Sumitomo Bank and some of its less salubrious customers. In the 'bubble' years of the 1980s Sumitomo, like most other Japanese commercial banks, advanced vast sums in property-related loans as land prices soared. When the property market collapsed in the early 1990s, the bank was left with a mountain of bad debts, which reached a peak of more than Y1,100bn (Pounds 7.2bn) a year ago. At the large Nagoya branch, Mr Hatanaka was closely involved in the collection of bad loans, and police suspect it may have been this that cost him his life. The murder comes 18 months after the bank and related companies in the Sumitomo group, one of Japan's largest business conglomerates, were the victims of a remarkably concentrated series of attacks. Between February and May 1993 assaults on the companies ranged in seriousness from the practical joke - glue in keyholes - to the violent crime  - shootings and firebombings. But police indicate that they have found no connection between these incidents and the murder of Mr Hatanaka. There are important difference between last year's attacks and Wednesday's killing. The attackers last year stopped short of inflicting injuries on Sumitomo employees, and there had been no repeat of the incidents since May 1993. Police believe the Nagoya shooting fits a more recent and more alarming pattern of violent crime by organised gangs. In a little over a year, three senior executives of Japanese companies have been murdered. Mr Hatanaka's death was preceded in February by the murder of a manager of Fuji Photo Film, stabbed to death by samurai-sword-wielding assailants in front of his home in Tokyo, and in August 1993 by the shooting of a vice-president of Hanwa Bank. The common element in all three murders could be that the victims were all trying to resist demands from crime syndicates. In the last two years, police believe, criminal groups have been hit hard by the combined effects of tougher legislation and economic recession. For many syndicates the principal source of revenue is extortion. Racketeers, known as sokaiya, extort money from companies in return for agreeing not to disrupt annual shareholders' meetings with embarrassing questions about the behaviour of company executives. Such extortion inhabited a grey area of Japanese criminal law. But in 1992 legislation was passed that began to curb the activities of the gangs. The main effect was to define much more clearly the criminal activity of racketeering. As a result companies have grown less willing to acquiesce to the demands of the groups. At the same time, economic conditions have militated against the gangsters. Japan's longest recession since the second world war has left many companies simply unable to meet their demands, irrespective of their legality. Intimidation by the sokaiya has, in the past, rarely extended to the extremes of physical violence seen in the last year. If organised criminal gangs are ratcheting up the level of their intimidation of company executives to the ultimate penalty, the authorities' deepest fear is that few companies will prove determined or brave enough to resist.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Weiping (2621 4580 1627) and </F> XINHUA reporter Cheng Shi (2052 6108)]    [Text] Chongqing, 15 May (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, member  of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee  and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, inspected  Sichuan recently. He pointed out during the inspection:  Military industry enterprises and institutions should take full  advantage of their technological superiority to enter the main  battlefield of economic construction.    During his stay in Sichuan, Liu Huaqing inspected Chengdu  Aircraft Industry Company, China Southwest Electronics Research  Institute, Southwest Rolling Stock Plant, Construction Machine  Tool Plant, and Chongqing Shipyard. He fully affirmed the  achievements made by factories and scientific research  institutes in relying on their technological superiority to open  up civilian goods market. He said: The military industry in  Sichuan, having a tremendous strength and playing a very  important role, has made great contributions to China's national  defense construction. Some military industry enterprises have  found, through exploration, effective ways to turn themselves  into producers of goods for civilian use.    Liu Huaqing said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping, with great  strategic insight, proposed the conversion of military industry  enterprises into producers of civilian goods some 10 years ago.  With his guidance, China's military industry enterprises have  achieved a strategic shift and made great success. At present,  military industry enterprises should seize the opportunity to  further readjust their structure, take the initiative in  entering the market, and adapt themselves to the new situation  in which we are establishing a socialist market economic  structure. During the conversion, the enterprises must take  full advantage of their superiority and use high and new  technology to produce pillar products. It is necessary to carry  forward the military industry's tradition of "putting quality  above everything else." At the same time, it is necessary to  try in every possible way to reduce costs, enhance competitive  power, and constantly update products according to market demand.    Liu Huaqing was greatly concerned about the work and  livelihood of scientists, technicians, and enterprise workers.  Wherever he went, he familiarized himself with their income and  living conditions. He said: Military industry enterprises and  institutions have a very good work force. Quietly immersing  themselves in hard work and dedication, they have displayed the  fine quality of the working class and contributed to the  national defense construction and economic development. Now, it  is necessary to stabilize the work force and carry out reforms  to develop production, enhance economic efficiency, and further  improve the production and living conditions.    Liu Huaqing pointed out: Sichuan has very good natural  conditions and a great potential. Located on the major route of  the Red Army's Long March, it is an important strategic place to  which Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and other proletarian  revolutionaries of the older generation have paid great  attention. Leading comrades at all levels must fully attach  importance to agriculture, which is the foundation of economy,  and arouse the peasants' enthusiasm for production. It is  necessary to pay attention to the difficulties confronting large  and medium state-owned enterprises and use our heads to overcome  them. Liu Huaqing emphasized: Since the masses are greatly  concerned about such issues as the promotion of ethical  integrity and the improvement of public order, we should take  action to deal with those issues at the grass-roots level. On  some economic difficulties and problems at present, Liu Huaqing  said: We should work in accordance the central authorities'  unified plan and subordinate ourselves to the interest of the  whole. Under the conditions of market economy, we should  display the pioneering spirit of hard struggle, diligence, and  frugality and work as one to overcome difficulties.    Accompanied by Chengdu Military Region commander Li Jiulong  and Sichuan party Secretary Xie Shijie, Liu Huaqing visited the  officers and men of the People's Liberation Army units and the  armed police units in Sichuan during his inspection. He called  on those units to pay attention to the quality of troops and  urged them to actively support local economic construction.</p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Adjusting the numbers to meet new standards  -The effect of the change in accounting rules THE FIGURES in the accounts of many leading quoted British companies will change substantially as the proposals of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) are put into place, according to a detailed analysis released by James Capel. Reported earnings, cash flow multiples and unconsolidated subsidiaries are among the factors which will change most. Others likely to be affected under existing proposals will concern companies with intangible assets on their balance sheets and goodwill as a significant proportion of net asset values. The firm already sees signs of change. It estimates that about half of the leading quoted companies have already adopted the first financial reporting standard, which deals with the cash flow statement and became mandatory for financial year ends after March 23 this year. Capel is calculating a cash flow per share figure based on the net cash inflow from operations shown in the cash flow statement, adding returns on investment and the servicing of finance, excluding dividends to ordinary shareholders, and subtracting tax paid. That includes capitalised interest and explicitly excludes cash generated from asset disposals. The result is to cause a substantial change from the cash flow figures Capel has traditionally produced using the old source and application of funds statement. The old statement gives British Petroleum a cash flow of Pounds 3.1bn and a cash flow per share of 58p in 1991, for example. The new figures are now Pounds 2.6bn and 48p respectively. The second financial reporting standard introduced by the ASB ratifies changes in the 1989 Companies Act which deals with subsidiaries. The standard generally tightens the requirement for groups to consolidate companies even if they own less than 50 per cent of the equity. Capel says Rothmans, Boots and BOC have already disclosed subsidiaries which were previously treated as associated companies. Based on the last set of accounts for Next, including its credit card subsidiary Club 24, would increase liabilities on the balance sheet from Pounds 447m to Pounds 801m. Fred 1, the ASB exposure draft on the structure of the profit and loss account, will bring about a number of changes, notably generating far more year-by-year variation in reported earnings by effectively abolishing extraordinary items. It will also have the effect of reducing the scope for companies to take profits on disposals through the profit and loss account. Capel cites Taylor Woodrow, which has included in its disposal profits a transfer from the revaluation reserve, so that it is effectively writing the property back down to original cost before calculating disposal profit. In the case of the company's 1991 results, releasing a revaluation reserve of Pounds 19.1m had the effect of reducing pre-tax losses from Pounds 21.8m to Pounds 2.7m. That will no longer be possible if Fred 1 becomes a standard as planned later this year. Gazing into the crystal ball at future ASB standards under discussion, Capel identifies a number of issues which will cause substantial changes in financial reporting for manycompanies Goodwill: it says its 'best guess' is that the ASB will try to adopt the common international practice of capitalising goodwill as an intangible asset and amortising it over its useful life, but possibly without systematic write-offs. Since goodwill was required to be disclosed in the mid-1980s, it shows that it has grown to represent up to 400 per cent of the net asset value of Carlton Communications, 310 per cent for Emap, 300 per cent for Williams and 280 per cent for GrandMet. It stresses that it is very unlikely the ASB would make its rulings retrospective, but illustrates the impact of change. If goodwill was amortised over 20 years as a proportion of earnings per share, it would be as high as 159 per cent for Burton, 95 per cent for Cookson and 81 per cent for Carlton Intangibles: the ASB is considering whether intangible assets such as brands should be included on balance sheets, and if so, how they should be valued. This still only significantly affects 12 companies, with Reed International the most important: intangibles of Pounds 1.67bn represent 122 per cent of the net asset value of the group. Pensions and other post-retirement benefits: which are being reviewed by both the ASB and its urgent issues task force. Companies with significant possible liabilities include Shell at Pounds 350m-Pounds 520m, BP at Pounds 170m-Pounds 250m and Unilever at Pounds 140m-Pounds 190m.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       CHANGES IN CASHFLOW PER SHARE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Old definition       New definition                         1990-92   1990  1991  1992   1990   1991   1992                        % change    (p)   (p)   (p)    (p)    (p)    (p)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BICC                     -49      54.3  37.7     -   40.9    5.8     - Johnson Matthey            -      17.7  23.1  34.7    n/a   25.4   28.1 Oxford Instruments       -25      24.7  27.7  14.6   15.4   13.9    9.5 Coats Viyella            -25      20.6  21.4  26.0   15.2   10.3   28.0 Enterprise Oil           -24      71.8  58.6  70.9   58.4   47.0   47.4 Williams Holdings        -23      28.0  31.0  27.7   18.2   22.2   26.1 Wimpey                   -22      32.1   4.2  15.6   26.6    1.7   12.1 Lucas Industries         -16      32.2  16.7     -   26.6   14.4      - Ladbroke Group           -21      20.2  13.6  17.8   12.6   10.2   17.8 Burton Group             -21      23.8   0.2   7.0   17.3    0.2    7.0 English China Clays      -21      56.2  61.1  56.2   40.8   52.0   51.9 Asda Group               -21       4.3  11.6   4.5    1.9   10.1    4.2 Courtaulds               -20      44.9  50.0  51.7   33.4   39.3   44.3 Baird (Wm)               -17      30.5  21.0  31.9   20.6   16.7   31.9 ICI                      -17     141.0 162.0 145.0  141.0  118.0  115.0 BET                      -16      47.9  43.2  19.3   51.1   27.0   14.1 BPB Industries           -16      25.4  21.1  18.4   24.8   11.4   18.4 Tesco                    -15      22.2  26.4  24.9   19.3   22.6   20.5  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            SIGNIFICANT INTANGIBLES ON THE BALANCE SHEET  -----------------------------------------------------------------------               Value of  Intangibles            intangibles  as % of net               Pounds m  asset val.

[Signed] V.F. Shumeyko, chairman of the Russian  Federation Federal Assembly Federation Council    [Dated]Moscow, 8 April 1994    No. 97-I SF    In recent years the crime problem in the Russian Federation  has sharply deteriorated. The scale of crime and its tendency  to increase are dangerously deforming the course of reform and  are posing a threat to the basic foundations of Russian  statehood, constitutional legality, and citizens' security.    The level of crime has more than doubled compared with 1988.  In 1993 there were 2.8 million recorded crimes, of which more  than 500,000 were serious. These included almost 30,000  murders, 67,000 cases of grievous bodily harm, more than 200,000  robberies and muggings, and 22,500 crimes involving the use of  firearms. Young people have been actively drawn into criminal  activity. In 1993 224,000 crimes were committed by juveniles.  Of particular concern is the growth in organized crime, which  employs methods of criminal terror such as hostage-taking,  blackmail, and others. Criminal formations are engaged in  large-scale racketeering and drug trafficking, are striving to  establish control over the banks, spheres of enterprise, and the  distribution of material resources, and are linking up with  corrupt elements in the state apparatus. Illegal exports of oil,  raw materials, and metals have become unprecedentedly  widespread. Violence and threats are increasingly employed  against militia officers, investigators, prosecutors, judges,  workers in financial, tax, and customs services, crime victims,  witnesses, and citizens who help the law-enforcement organs.    The main reasons for the spread of crime lie in the critical  state and instability of society, in the legal nihilism that  grips power structures at all levels, in the lack of a  crime-prevention system, and in the inadequate legal base,  serious shortcomings in law-enforcement practice, and the low  clear-up rate for serious crimes.    To a considerable extent the crime situation has gotten out  of control. Statistics on crime and the reduction in its growth  rate do not reflect the real state of affairs. The level of  latent crime remains high. Many organs of power and  administration at the center and at local level have opted out  of the fight against crime and its prevention, deal with crime  on a case-to-case basis, and fail to monitor the implementation  of decisions that are reached.    Internal affairs organs, prosecutor's offices, the tax  police, and the customs services are failing to put a resolute  stop to criminal activities or to ensure that punishment is  inescapable. Irresponsibility and complacency are shown by  officials to the victims of crime, while the criminals are shown  leniency. There is no proper reaction to a considerable number  of reports of crimes and other breaches of the law. Unfounded  refusals to institute criminal proceedings have become  widespread, along with cases being halted or ended. Many  dangerous crimes remain unsolved. As a result, citizens' faith  in the authorities' ability to protect them is being undermined.    The crime situation and its demoralizing effect on all  spheres of social life require the adoption of effective  measures to change the situation and to ensure constant and  unremitting attention to the crime problem by all organs of  power and administration, the public, and the mass media.    The curbing of aggressive and violent crime, the fundamental  enhancement of the standard of all work to prevent and curtail  manifestations of crime, and the strengthening of public order  are urgent tasks.    The strengthening of statehood, the striving for  stabilization in political, economic, social, and spiritual  spheres of society's life, and consideration of crime factors  when implementing reform should be the abiding conditions for  achieving real results.    At the same time, all the measures that are being taken  should be based on strict observance of legality and the norms  of international law.    Particular attention should be focused on improving the  legal  base and law-enforcement practice, on upgrading the level of  law-enforcement organs' activity, and on involving all of  society's healthy forces in the fight against crime.    It is necessary to learn lessons and draw conclusions from  the shortcomings and mistakes in crime policy and lawmaking  activity. The participants in the parliamentary hearings believe  that the process of adopting laws suffers from serious drawbacks  and is not in line with practical requirements. Draft laws are  often elaborated without the participation of or without  consideration of the opinion of those departments which will  have to implement the law, and there is a lack of expert  criminological appraisal of draft laws. Legislators, the  Russian Federation president's apparatus, and the Russian  Federation Government in many instances operate in an  uncoordinated way and duplicate the same draft laws. Russian  Federation presidential edicts and Russian Federation Government  normative acts do not always meet the requirements of  legislation and the principle of the separation of powers. Many  obsolete legal norms are still in existence, and issues that are  very necessary for stepping up the fight against crime in its  most important areas do not receive legislative solutions.    The existing Criminal Code does not envisage criminal law  measures for a whole number of dangerous activities that have  become widespread. Legislation has not reinforced  responsibility for the different types of organized crime,  terrorism, and the creation of illegal armed formations.    The lack of legal norms envisaging responsibility for dummy  companies, sham bankruptcies, the "laundering" of criminal  income, and other abuses is creating considerable difficulties  in countering the black economy.    Stepping up the fight against corruption will require the  speediest legislative resolution of questions of responsibility  for crimes committed by civil servants and officials at economic  entities.    Law-enforcement and control organs have limited access to  the  documents and materials they require.    There is no reliable legal protection for victims,  witnesses,  and citizens who help the investigation and the courts, or for  law-enforcement workers against criminal violence and threats.    Certain norms relating to the execution of criminal  legislation do not conform with the provisions of the Russian  Federation Constitution, international acts on human rights, and  the tasks and goals of criminal punishment.    Prisons are in a very serious condition, particularly in  material terms. Unless the necessary measures are urgently  taken these institutions will be unable to fulfill their role at  all.    The Convention on Legal Aid and Legal Relations in Civil,  Family, and Criminal Cases, which was signed by the CIS heads of  state, has not been ratified for more than a year. Owing to the  sluggishness of the Russian Justice and Foreign Ministries, the  question of elaborating and concluding bilateral treaties on  these issues with other states has not been resolved. The  Russian Federation has still not acceded to European conventions  on reciprocal legal aid, extradition, the "laundering" of  criminal income, and a number of others.    The questions of ensuring legality and public order, of  preventing lawbreaking, and of protecting citizens' property,  rights, and freedoms are not properly reflected in the activity  of the Russian Federation Government and executive organs in  Russian Federation components.    The federal and other executive organs' lack of a  centralized  system for collecting and analyzing information on the crime  situation and the observance of legality prevents a proper  assessment of the situation from being made and the necessary  measures from being taken in good time. The help provided to  organs of local self-government and public associations is  patently inadequate. The state of legal services at  enterprises, institutions, and organizations, the auditing  apparatus, and expert institutions prevents cases of violations  of the law and abuses from being revealed in good time and often  negates all the efforts made to expose criminals.    Cadre, financial, material, and technical provision for  law-enforcement and state control organs lags behind practical  requirements.    Social guarantees for workers directly involved in the fight  against crime are inadequate. Many of them do not have the  necessary housing and everyday conditions.    Unjustified reorganizations and the lack of a careful  approach to cadres have led to their lacking any confidence in  the future, and have considerably weakened the operational  investigation apparatus. A considerable number of skilled  staffers have left over the past few years.    Many militia workers and one in four investigative apparatus  staffers at internal affairs organs do not have any legal  education. The situation with cadres in the Prosecutor's Office  remains serious. Higher and secondary legal educational  establishments are failing to train enough specialists for  law-enforcement organs. The neglect of this problem is making  it harder to create highly professional apparatuses and is  having a negative impact on activity to strengthen law and order  and to fight crime.    Attempts are being made to reform the Russian Federation  Prosecutor's Office in the absence of an integrated concept for  prosecutorial oversight. The desire to politicize Prosecutor's  Office organs is doing a great deal of damage.    The Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office has amassed the  necessary experience of cooperation and collaboration with all  branches of state power and other law-enforcement and control  organs -- consequently, the proposals to make the Prosecutor's  Office responsible for coordinating the activities of  law-enforcement organs should be supported. At the same time,  the attention of the Russian Federation Prosecutor's Office  should be drawn to its inadequate organizational role in leading  the organs under its jurisdiction.    The fight against crime is being affected by shortcomings in  the implementation of judicial reform. Certain provisions of  the concept for judicial reform do not correspond to the  realities of life.    Citizens are justifiably angry about red tape, repeated  instances of dangerous criminals being released from custody,  and other serious mistakes in judicial activity.    On the basis of Article 82 of the Standing Orders of the  Federation Council, First Convocation, the participants in the  parliamentary hearings consider it necessary:    to recognize that the crime situation in the Russian  Federation threatens the main foundations of Russian statehood,  constitutional legality, and citizens' safety;    to speedily adopt a federal program to step up the fight  against crime in 1994-1995, and to prepare regional programs on  that basis;    to examine as a priority draft laws aimed at protecting  citizens' constitutional rights against criminal infringement,  and at opposing organized and violent crime. The priority draft  laws should be the following: on amendments and additions to  the RSFSR Criminal Code, the RSFSR Code of Criminal Procedure,  and the RSFSR Code on Administrative Violations; on the fight  against organized crime; on the fight against corruption; on the  protection of witnesses, victims, and other persons assisting  criminal proceedings; on state protection for judges and workers  in law-enforcement and control organs; on the military militia  (police) in the Russian Federation Armed Forces; and on the  holding in custody of people suspected of and charged with  crimes;    to take measures to step up the role of executive organs  and officials in crime prevention, the creation of effective  mechanisms for monitoring their implementation of Russian  Federation presidential edicts and their own decisions, and the  strengthening of legal and auditing services and expert  institutions; to set up at federal and regional level a system  for coordinating the fight against crime, and to define within  it the role and functions of executive organs in Russian  Federation components and organs of local self-government;    to examine the financing of crime-fighting programs as  priority issues when drawing up and ratifying the federal  budget, the budgets of Russian Federation components, and local  budgets;    to draw the attention of the leaders of law-enforcement and  control organs to existing serious shortcomings in the fight  against crime -- particularly in curtailing organized, armed  crime and corruption, to the state of economic security and the  protection of the consumer market, and to the activity of  institutions from the criminal-law implementation system; to the  need to improve the demands made on subordinate subunits in  safeguarding citizens' constitutional rights and freedoms, and  to adopt emergency measures to enhance the effective functioning  of the entire law-enforcement system.    The participants in the parliamentary hearings call on the  mass media and their editorial colleagues and journalists to  comprehensively and objectively cover the problems of the fight  against crime, to actively reveal the causes of negative  phenomena, to promote the formation in the population of respect  for the law, and to enhance the prestige of staffers at  law-enforcement organs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Armed Forces to the people and the </F> bereaved families; place and date not given]    [Text] The Burundi Armed Forces have just learned with  dismay and deep sorrow the tragic loss of the head of state, who  is also the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and of two  members of the government, in a plane accident over Rwandan  territory.    Unfortunately the accident occurred when our head of state  was tirelessly working towards getting Burundi out of the crisis  and the sociopolitical stagnation in which it has been plunged  since the tragic loss of late President Melchior Ndadaye.    The Burundian Armed Forces convey to the entire nation, to  the family of late President Ntaryamira, and to the families of  the ministers who died in the tragedy, their deep sympathy and  join them in this profound sorrow. They urge the people to  maintain peace and dignity in these hard and trying times.    They take this opportunity to reiterate to the follow-up  committee, to the Parliament, and to the government, their firm  determination to get our country out of the crisis.    Signed, Defense Minister Gedeon Fyiroko.</p>

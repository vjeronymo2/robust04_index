			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TODAY AT AFI FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Following are The Times' recommendations for today's schedule of the American  Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival (AFIFEST), with  commentary by the film reviewing staff.  </P> <P> Information: (213) 480-3232 or (213) 520-2000.  </P> <P> Recommended:  </P> <P> "THE HELLSTROM CHRONICLE"(U.S., 1971; D: Walon Green. Century Plaza 3, 7 p.m.).  The narrative device is slightly absurd, but, back in 1971, this film's  microphotography of insects at work and war blew audience's minds. It still  should. Part of the David Wolper Tribute. (Michael Wilmington)  </P> <P> "KINDERGARTEN"(USSR: 1985; D: Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Fairfax, 9:15 p.m.) First  film by the famed Russian poet: uneven, flamboyant, deeply personal,  semi-autobiographical.(Michael Wilmington)  </P></p>

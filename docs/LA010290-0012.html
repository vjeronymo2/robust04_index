			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLUGGING THE DROPOUT HOLE  </P> <P> All junior high school students face the universal adolescent anxiety of  fitting in. In the Southland, many also face problems like persistent poverty,  abuse, a new language, a new step-parent or their own new baby. No wonder so  many drop out.  </P> <P> The junior high dropout rate was 7.4% in the Los Angeles public schools last  year with more than 8,000 students calling it quits because of sex, drugs,  alcohol, crime or because they were illiterate and bored.  </P> <P> Those dropouts needed help, but not enough was available. What is available  reaches only a lucky few. The state spends more than $12 million to keep  high-risk students in school, primarily in urban school districts like Los  Angeles and Santa Ana in Orange County, but that is only enough money to reach  hundreds of students when the need is in the tens of thousands.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School District supplements state funding of nearly $1  million per year with an additional $400,000, enough to help an average of only  100 students on 32 campuses.  </P> <P> Motivating students who are at risk is expensive but worthwhile. The schools  involved in the state dropout effort have been effective in reducing dropout  rates, increasing attendance and improving academic achievement, according to a  preliminary evaluation completed last week.  </P> <P> Helping more youngsters on the verge of dropping out is just one aspect of the  problem. More must be done at the start of the education process to keep  students from reaching that point. Early efforts must be made to help  youngsters form good habits. Take something as simple as paying closer  attention to a student's attendance record. Perfect attendance is hard to  achieve. Only one pupil out of four in the kindergarten classes at Garvanza  Elementary School in Highland Park came close in any given month last year. The  poor showing prompted the dropout prevention counselor to bring a thermometer  to school and teach kindergarten pupils to stay home only when they are sick,  not when they want to go shopping with a parent. Attendance improved. Nearly  one-third attended school every day last month. Such early intervention is  essential because problems that start in elementary school can exacerbate in  junior high.  </P> <P> To overcome another problem -- the switch from the small pond of elementary  school to the ocean of junior high campuses -- El Sereno Junior High in  northeast Los Angeles has grouped together 97 seventh-graders to form what is  in effect a school within a school. Within the comfortable confines of the  small group, the students get to know their teachers and classmates; their  teachers get to know them. After one year, the close-knit group tends to have  slightly better grades and a better outlook about school, solid antidotes to  the temptation to drop out.  </P> <P> El Sereno and other schools with dropout programs can refer failing youngsters  to a student study team. The team, which includes parents, counselors and  teachers, tries to correct mistakes without blaming the child. No meeting  begins with a scolding. Each session begins with a look at a potential  dropout's strengths, which are not always obvious.  </P> <P> Junior high students often need close attention simply because they are at a  difficult stage. They rarely get it. Special dropout programs are providing  that attention for students at a few schools in Los Angeles. An expanded state  dropout program would give even more youngsters a chance, a goal that Gov.  George Deukmejian and the Legislature should put high on their agendas for  1990.  </P></p>

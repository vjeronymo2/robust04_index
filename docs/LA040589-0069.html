			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: IN AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, SHE'S IN A CLASS BY HERSELF  </P> <P> If teachers earned grades, Mary V. Bicouvaris would get an A plus. Bicouvaris,  who has been teaching classes in American government at Bethel High School in  Hampton, Va., since 1963, was named National Teacher of the Year. The  49-year-old Greek immigrant said her formula for teaching government and  international relations combines "respect for my job, love for the children  that I teach and a very sincere commitment to make a difference." Known to her  students as Mrs. Bic, she founded and directs an award-winning Model United  Nations program at her school and organized a schoolwide celebration of the  200th anniversary of the Constitution. Her teaching ideas on the Constitution  were turned into a booklet circulated among educators nationwide. President  Bush is scheduled to present her with a crystal apple today. Bicouvaris is the  38th recipient of the award, which is sponsored by the Council of Chief State  School Officers, Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. and Good Housekeeping magazine.  Bicouvaris will spend the next year speaking to organizations around the  country.  </P> <P>  -- A White House horseshoe tournament will continue without its star player.  President Bush and his son Marvin were beaten in the start of the tournament by  two aides, Tim McBride and David Bates, but the score is classified. Bush  dropped by Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater's office to disclose his defeat,  urging Fitzwater not to "tell anybody." The President formally dedicated the  new horseshoe pit on the South Lawn at a picnic Saturday. The tournament among  White House workers, including chefs, groundskeepers, carpenters, ushers and  photographers, is expected to go on for several more days.  </P> <P>  -- Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is still in demand in Wyoming. The former  Wyoming congressman will be in that state at Wheatland High School on May 20,  and at Upton High School the next day, to speak at graduation exercises, said  Pete Williams, Cheney's spokesman. Upton High School Principal Mark Mitchell  said the 26-member senior class invited Cheney before his nomination early last  month as defense secretary. Mitchell said the students had been worried that  Cheney now would not have time for them. Last week, however, Cheney's office  contacted the high school to see "if we still wanted him," Mitchell said.  SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

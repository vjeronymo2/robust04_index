			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WARRIORS SIGN MULLIN TO A NINE-YEAR CONTRACT  </P> <P> Chris Mullin, the Golden State Warriors' first-round draft pick from St. John's  in 1985, Friday signed a nine-year contract with the National Basketball Assn.  team.  </P> <P> Terms were not disclosed.  </P> <P> Mullin, 26, averaged 26.5 points, 5.9 rebounds and 5.1 assists a game last  season, his fourth. Only Chicago's Michael Jordan and Portland's Clyde Drexler  had higher averages in all three categories. Mullin, an all-star selection, was  named to the All-NBA second team.  </P> <P> Mullin became a restricted free agent after last season. There have been  repeated rumors throughout his career that the Brooklyn native might eventually  join the New York Knicks as a free agent, but the signing precludes that.  Mullin's salary was $700,000 last season.  </P></p>

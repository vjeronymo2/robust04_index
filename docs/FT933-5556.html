			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Seagram gains from Du Pont earnings SEAGRAM, one of the world's top drinks groups, posted a 56 per cent gain in second quarter profit mainly because its shares of earnings at Du Pont, the US chemicals giant, returned to normal after the negative accounting changes of 1992. The drinks business met difficult conditions in many markets because of poor economic conditions 'and at this point it will be difficult for the spirits and wine group in fiscal 1994 to match last year's record results,' said Mr Edgar Bronfman Jr, president. Seagram's net income for the quarter ended July was USDollars 170m, or 46 cents a share, up from Dollars 109m, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. For the first half, net income was Dollars 332m, or 89 cents a share, against Dollars 262m, or 70 cents a share. Last year Seagram made significant accounting changes and included its share of a Du Pont special charge. This year Seagram received Dollars 74m in Du Pont dividends, against Dollars 72m. Its share of Du Pont's unremitted earnings was Dollars 51m against a negative Dollars 6m in 1992. Sales from the global drinks business rose 2 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 1.44bn. The gain was spread across sprits and wine operations and Tropicana, the fruit juice unit. Operating income was Dollars 158m against Dollars 156m, with spirits and wine up 8 per cent to Dollars 132m and Tropicana also up 8 per cent to Dollars 28m. Mr Bronfman said spirits and wine operations benefited from timing factors, including purchases in advance of a French excise tax increase and comparison with a very slow 1992 second quarter in Germany. Last month Seagram filed a Dollars 500m shelf offering of debt securities, raising speculation it may increase its 5.8 per cent holding in Time Warner, media and entertainment giant.</p>

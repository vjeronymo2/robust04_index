			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Company News: IBM plans to compete directly with 'clones' INTERNATIONAL Business Machines plans to launch a range of lower-priced computers that will compete directly with the many 'clones' of its original products. The move is a bid by IBM to recharge its sluggish personal computer sales. Outlining the company's strategy to maintain profitability and market share, even as personal computer prices plummet, Mr James Cannavino, president of IBM's personal systems division, says he will transform the PS/1 home computer into a broader range of machines aimed at price-conscious buyers. IBM will offer two lines of personal computers - its 'premium' PS/2 line, with leading edge technology and support services for business users, as well as an 'industry standard' PS/1 range that competes with the lowest priced clones. The PS/1 range will be sold primarily through large-volume retail outlets and mail order companies. 'The error we made was to think that the PS/2 was a one-size-fits-all product line,' says Mr Cannavino. Many buyers, particularly in the US, now choose personal computers simply by price, he acknowledges. In this 'commodity' segment of the market, IBM's share of personal computer sales has fallen sharply. IBM's new PS/1 line will span the full range of performance - from popular 386-based machines through the more powerful 486 models, and ultimately the next generation of 586 computers, based on a new Intel microprocessor. They are expected to be launched later this year. IBM is 'one of the very lowest cost manufacturers in the (personal computer) industry,' Mr Cannavino maintained. Dispelling reports that IBM will shift much of its personal computer manufacturing to south-east Asia, Mr Cannavino said: 'Labour costs are not much of an issue, because the labour content in constructing a personal computer is very small.' Instead, he said, the goal is to continually improve manufacturing efficiency by shortening the manufacturing cycle - from component purchases to computer sales. IBM is also considering joint manufacturing projects similar to its venture with Toshiba of Japan, which produces liquid crystal display screens for portable personal computers. Perhaps IBM's greatest challenge is to maintain its 'premium' product image while also taking advantage of its lower cost manufacturing capabilities to compete in the low-price segment of the personal computer market. Yet IBM is hardly alone in struggling to maintain its position in the rapidly changing personal computer market. Compaq Computer, similarly, is overhauling its product strategy while trying to reduce costs. Many second and third-tier manufacturers are also facing extreme price pressures.</p>

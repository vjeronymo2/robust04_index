			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> BUILD A TOOL BOX THAT REFLECTS PERSONALITY  </P> <P> When I first became interested in carpentry, one of the things I admired most  about the old-timers was the style and creativity that went into their wooden  tool boxes. These personalized accessories were built to last a lifetime and  often did. They were all customized to fit the needs of their creators.  </P> <P> If he was a framing carpenter, the box was large enough to carry large nails  and an extra 22-ounce hammer and a caulk line. One box I recall seeing in an  old carpenter's shop looked more like an autobiography than a tool box.  </P> <P> It had slews of calculations inscribed in lead, saw kerfs ripped across it,  glue spots on it, drill holes poked into it and coffee stained into its grain,  all of these footprints of a carpenter's career.  </P> <P> There was probably the calculation he figured twice before cutting his first  roof, and the coffee spilled while in his truck waiting to start working on a  cold gray February morning when the rest of the world was still fast asleep.  </P> <P> I'm going to share with you some of the techniques I use to build my customized  wooden tool boxes. I've built quite a collection over the years for friends,  family and myself. I may even be lucky enough to have this column reach a young  carpenter who is just starting his own autobiography.  </P> <P> There are basically two types of tool boxes: open and closed. An open box is a  box without a lid. I use these to store materials that are frequently used such  as nails, screws or tubes of caulking. Since the box is always open you can see  everything in it at once without opening a lid. I have one open box I use just  for my finish nails, aluminum capping nails, large dry wall screws and spare  tubes of silicone caulking.  </P> <P> I also store extra pencils there and extra screw gun bits. I call this my "trim  box" because I use it when I do trim work. Another open box, a very large one,  I call my "framing box." This stays in my truck and contains seven different  compartments, each with various size framing nails in it.  </P> <P> The second type of tool box is a closed box which I use to store my tools.  Wooden tool boxes are great for tools because they cushion the blows and absorb  any excess moisture in the air that can ruin an electronic motor. I have a  wooden tool box for almost all of my tools. Sometimes I make a tool box that  houses all the tools needed to perform a particular task -- like a box that  only has electrician tools or laminating tools. The possibilities are endless,  and if you're like me, you'll just enjoy making them.  </P> <P> I usually use plywood for large boxes and clear 1-x-6,8,10,12-inch board for  smaller boxes. With a closed tool box, I first create a six-sided box, then  with a table saw cut the top of the box off, seal it to protect it, add hinges  and a handle, and then put it to work.  </P> <P> That may sound fairly simple but there are a few tricky joints to mill to  assure the box's long life. First mill the four sides of the would-be box. Make  sure they're square and all the same height. Now run a router with a  three-quarter-inch bit through the bottom on each side; this creates a dado  joint (see figure). Sometimes it's easier if you run the router through a  single long piece of wood first then cut the sides. This is up to you and the  supply of wood available.  </P> <P> Now cut the bottom of the box. Make it long enough to be accepted into the dado  groove on each side of the box. Then put the five sides of the box together  dry. This is to check the fit and tightness. While it's still together measure  the top. It should be the length of the long side plus the width of the two  short sides (see figure). Now cut the top of the box to whatever size you  measured.  </P> <P> After you have the top cut, you're going to route a rabbet joint around the  perimeter of it. This is done so that the top will fit (partially) into the  box. This will assure a strong joint.  </P> <P> Put all six sides (four sides plus top and bottom) together dry. Check them  again, then disassemble it, glue it and reassemble it. Clamp every corner joint  and fasten them together with wood screws or nails. Take caution here not to  screw (or nail) where you plan to cut later. Leave it clamped and screwed for  at least 24 hours.  </P> <P> Once dried you will have a six-sided box. Now measure down about 3 inches and  make a mark for your cut. Run the box through a table saw (or use a circular  saw), and create the top lid. Prime and seal the whole box and install the  hardware.  </P> <P> To build an open tool box just use the same procedures used to build a closed  tool box except omit the top lid and add a railing handle (see figure).  </P> <P> Remember, when you create a custom tool box, add personal touches that  distinguish your box from others. Like the carpenters who use them, tool boxes  are all different, and should be. Let your tool box reflect you personally.  Dare to be unique.  </P></p>

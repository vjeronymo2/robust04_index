			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Talbott sees need for strong Israel Mr Strobe Talbott, nominated to be deputy secretary of state, yesterday told Congress his belief in a close US-Israeli relationship was 'unshakeable', as was his conviction that a strong Israel was a strategic asset to US interests. But in the course of an intermittently uncomfortable session with the Senate foreign relations committee, he admitted: 'I don't feel the way I did 13 years ago on this. I simply changed my opinion.' Part of a Time magazine article in 1981 otherwise complimentary to Israel warned that the Jewish state could become a strategic liability to the US. Mr Talbott countered that, as a commentator, he had often expressed himself 'in words appropriate to the heat of battle of the time' that no longer reflected his views. Mr Talbott's assurances notwithstanding, several Democratic committee members felt obliged, for their own political purposes, to deliver a few blunt lectures. Typical was that from Senator Joseph Biden from Delaware, who told the nominee: 'I don't think you understand the Middle East as well as you do the former Soviet Union.' Mr Talbott broke no new ground in his prepared testimony and in answering questions. He insisted that the US could not be a spectator to unfolding events in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Faysal al-Husayni, Palestinian activist, by </F> Yoni Ben-Menahem in Jerusalem on 17 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Ben-Menahem] How do you assess the peace process?    [Al-Husayni] [words indistinct] ready to hear even about  that.    [Ben-Menahem] But there has been progress today in the Taba  talks.    [Al-Husayni] Yes, progress has been achieved in the Taba  talks and I believe that it is possible to reach agreement by  the end of this month, but all this is conditional on the  Palestinian people's perception that something is happening on  the ground. Otherwise, even if, ultimately, after further delay  a good agreement is reached, a stage will come where the people  will no longer be prepared to hear what we are saying.  Consequently, it will be difficult to implement any agreement  that is reached.    [Ben-Menahem] What do you expect now from the Israelis?    [Al-Husayni] I believe that the Israelis should begin  releasing prisoners, should clearly state that no prisoner will  remain in Israeli jails, should change the firing orders in the  streets, and should stop demolishing homes under different  pretexts. It is unnecessary now for certain parties to embark on  demolishing homes becuase their owners had obtained or did not  obtain a license. Some issues pertaining to land must be frozen  until the end of the negotiating process. The continuation of  all these acts, the continued construction of new buildings in  settlements, the expansion in Ma'ale Adumim, all these things  actually lead to a single outcome, namely, that the Palestinian  street will become more convinced that Israel is not serious in  the peace process.</p>

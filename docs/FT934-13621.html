			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Anglo-US group in German coal deal THE Treuhand privatisation agency has secured one of the largest investments in eastern Germany after an Anglo-American energy consortium accepted the agency's final offer for the country's second largest brown coal field. The commercial agreement, which entails an investment of DM670m (Pounds 272.3m) for Mitteldeutsche Braunkohle, or Mibrag, was signed between the Treuhand and Britain's PowerGen, NRG of Minneapolis and Morrison-Knudsen of Idaho earlier this week. The consortium is now poised to break into eastern Germany's highly regulated energy industry after 18 months of negotiations. 'There are no hiccups left. We can now wrap up the contract,' said a consortium negotiator. 'We have finally closed the commercial side of the agreement for Mibrag,' said an official from Morrison-Knudsen. The consortium, which expects to start mining operations in the Mibrag lignite fields in January, reached agreement despite last minute concerns from PowerGen about whether energy consumption levels in eastern Germany would be sufficient to consume Mibrag's annual 15m-17m tonnes. At one stage, there were fears that PowerGen would pull out of the deal completely even though its two US partners, particularly NRG, were keen to conclude the negotiations. Last week, the Anglo-Americans acquired a 40 per cent stake in a power generating plant at Schkopau, in Saxony-Anhalt which will be fuelled by Mibrag. The DM670m investments, which will be spread over several years, will be targeted on one section of the giant Mibrag mining complex which the consortium will own. A Treuhand officials said that under the terms of the contract, the Anglo-Americans will initially guarantee 4,210 jobs. That figure will be reduced to 2,700 by 1995 and will then stabilise at 2,300 employees the following year. 'We are not only pleased about the level of investments, and the structure of employment,' said the official. 'But we are also getting a terrific amount of management expertise in an industry which can, and will be, much more competitive,' he added. He conceded however that the kind of contracts agreed for Mibrag has set a crucial precedent for the privatisation of Laubag, eastern Germany's other brown coal fields in the state of Brandenburg. A consortium, led by Rheinbraun, the brown coal subsidiary of RWE, Germany's largest utility company, is negotiating to buy it from the Treuhand.</p>

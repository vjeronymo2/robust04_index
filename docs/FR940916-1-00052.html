Accordingly, contracting activities shall procure items produced using recovered materials to the maximum extent possible when procuring these designated items: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Cement and concrete containing fly ash, 40 CFR part 249, January 28, 1983; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Paper and paper products, 40 CFR part 250;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Lubricating oils, 40 CFR part 252; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Retread tires, 40 CFR part 253; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Building insulation products, 40 CFR part 248. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Copies of these guidelines, as well as future guidelines promulgated by EPA, may be obtained by calling EPA's Recycled Products Information Clearinghouse at (703) 941&hyph;4452. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) These guidelines are applicable when the Department purchases more than $10,000 worth of a designated item, or if the cost of all such items purchased by the Department during the preceding Fiscal Year was $10,000 or more. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 623.475  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Responsibilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The requirements office initiating an acquisition is responsible for determining whether recovered materials should be included in the specifications. Requirements offices may purchase items subject to the guidelines containing other than recovered materials only if: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The price of items with recovered materials is unreasonable; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The requirement for items produced with recovered materials results in inadequate competition or adversely affects small business or the Department's metrication program; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Obtaining items with recovered materials results in unusual and unreasonable delays; or, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Items produced with recovered materials do not meet all reasonable performance specifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the requirements office chooses to procure designated items that do not contain recovered materials, a written justification must be submitted to the contracting officer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 623.476  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preference programs for guideline items. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 623.476&hyph;1  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preference program for the purchase of cement and concrete containing fly ash. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Domestic contracts requiring the purchase of cement and concrete shall specify the performance requirements of the products required under the contract using appropriate standards/specifications when available. Consistent with such performance specifications, such contracts shall allow the contractor to deliver cement and concrete products that contain fly ash, a component of coal resulting from its combustion in electrical generating plants. Architects/Engineers shall specify performance requirements for the concrete to be supplied. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 623.476&hyph;2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Preference program for building insulation products containing recovered materials. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Minimum content standards for building insulation products have been established by EPA guidelines.

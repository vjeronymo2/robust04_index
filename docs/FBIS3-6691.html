			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Honaira, March 18 (AFP) -- Solomon Islands Tourism  and Culture Minister Michael Maina has been charged with 28  counts of misconduct in office, the Leadership Code Commission  said Friday in a statement.    He is the first cabinet minister to face such charges,  although a member of parliament has in the past.    It said he faces three counts of accepting bribes, six of  using his office for personal benefit, two counts of failing to  disclose personal interests when participating in meetings, 14  counts of failing to declare his business interests to the  commission and three of accepting benefits.    The charges were laid after the commission carried out a  lengthy investigation into Maina's conduct when he was commerce,  employment and trade minister under former Prime Minister  Solomon Mamaloni.    The commission said its investigations showed prima facie  evidence to lay the charges.    They have been submitted to the office of the Director of  Public Prosecutions to commence proceedings in the High Court.    The statement said Maina's conduct was regrettable because  it  was damaging to himself and the government. It demeaned his  office and allowed his integrity to be called into question.    It also endangered the respect and confidence in the  integrity of the government which is contrary to the country's  national constitution.    Maina, from the Temopu Province in the Eastern Solomons, was  widely known to have a number of company directorships here.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Sergey Goryachev, Aliya Nugmanova, and </F> Vladimir Gerasev from Washington, including recorded remarks by  President Nazarbayev; from the "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev has  ended the official part of his U.S. visit. Our correspondents  report on the details from Washington.    [Goryachev] [Video shows Nazarabayev walking with Clinton at  press conference] President Clinton assessed relations with  Kazakhstan as a long-term partnership of strategic importance.  From now on Kazakhstan -- which is the ninth largest country in  the world, and with its resources and its position at the  meeting point of Europe and Asia -- will become an important  player in the sphere of U.S. foreign policy, and not only  policy. [video shows oil drilling]    [Nugmanova] Presidents Nazarbayev and Clinton reached  agreement on setting up in Almaty the headquarters of the  Central Asian Business Fund, for the activities of which the  United States is allocating $30 million. The amount will be  increased as specific projects are implemented. This is  advantageous to us.    [Gerasev] What is advantageous for the United States is  Kazakhstan's movement toward a market economy, which is  considered here as being successful. But the main thing is the  republic's nuclear disarmament. The official document on  Kazakhstan's accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty  is a success for Clinton. A success for Nazarbayev is major  U.S. financial aid which, it was stated, will be trebled and  will exceed $300 million.    The talks in Washington were bilateral, but Russia and its  relations with Kazakhstan was an invisible participant in the  talks.    [Nazarbayev] [Video shows Nazarbayev speaking to camera]  Another question which I put to the leadership of Russia was of  concluding a treaty on military cooperation between Russia and  Kazakhstan, whereby we would in effect become military-political  allies. Then it would have been possible to say to America that  it is our business where our armed forces and our missiles are  located in the interests of the security of the two states.  However, the Russian side did not agree to that. That is where  the whole question lies.    [Goryachev] Kazakhstan, Russia, and the other countries of  the former USSR are increasingly acting individually in their  relations with the United States. But perhaps understanding of  the fact that there is strength in numbers is not too far away.</p>

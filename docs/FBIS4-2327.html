			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (AFP)--French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur said Friday discretion was more effective than  publicity in promoting human rights and refused any comment on  the second detention within a week of a leading Chinese  dissident.    "In this matter, discretion is a more effective approach  than  publicity," the prime minister told a press conference at the  end of a two-day stay in Beijing.    Balladur repeatedly declined to provide any details of a  20-minute closed-door meeting on human rights with his Chinese  counterpart Li Peng and their respective foreign ministers,  stressing that he had "said in private all that I had to say."    "I said it in private because I thought it was more useful,"  he added. His remarks followed the detention Friday of leading  dissident Xu Wenli and the arrest one week ago of China's most  celebrated pro-democracy activist Wei Jingsheng.    Xu's detention was particularly embarrassing to the French  government, given the dissident's known interest in France,  especially its revolutionary history.    Balladur, on the first official visit here by a French  premier in 16 years, refused to say if he had discussed Wei's  detention or handed a list of dissidents to the Chinese  authorities. He also confirmed that he had handed a letter to  Chinese President Jiang Zemin from his French counterpart  Francois Mitterrand, inviting him to visit France. However, in  an apparent departure from usual protocol, no invitation was  extended to Li Peng.</p>

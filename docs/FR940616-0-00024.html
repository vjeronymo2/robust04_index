			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (A) A recorded right-of-way, recorded easement, or a permit for a coal haul road recorded as of August 3, 1977; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Any other road in existence as of August 3, 1977; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Any haul road that was in existence or operating at the time an area became protected under IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;14&hyph;1, or at the time of the coming into existence, within the prohibited distance of a structure, road, cemetery, or other activity listed in IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;14&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The interpretation of the terms of a document used to establish a valid existing right is based upon the common law concerning the interpretation of documents conveying mineral rights. If there is no applicable common law, the interpretation is based upon the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The usage and custom at the time and place where a document came into existence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A showing by the applicant that the parties to the document contemplated the right to conduct the same underground or surface activities for which the applicant claims a valid existing right. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) ``Valid existing rights'' does not mean the mere expectation of a right to conduct surface coal mining operations or the right to conduct underground coal mining. Examples of rights which alone do not constitute valid existing rights include, but are not limited to, coal exploration permits or licenses, applications or bids for leases, or where a person has only applied for a federal or state permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) If an area comes under the protection of IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;14&hyph;1 after August 3, 1977, valid existing rights are present if a validly authorized surface coal mining operation exists on that area on the date the protection comes into existence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Federal definition of VER at 30 CFR 761.5 has been affected by judicial decision and parts have been suspended by OSM (see 51 FR 41954, November 20, 1986). Specifically, 30 CFR 761.5 paragraphs (a) and (c) are suspended, and subparagraph (d)(2) is suspended insofar as it incorporates the takings test of suspended paragraph (a). Additionally, OSM has proposed that the Federal VER definition be amended (see 56 FR 33152, July 18, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the November 20, 1986,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice which suspended 30 CFR 761.5(a), OSM stated that the suspension of 30 CFR 761.5(a) has the effect of undoing that provision and leaving in its place the VER test in use before the suspended language was promulgated (the 1979 test) (51 FR 41954). That 1979 test consists of language approved on March 13, 1979 (44 FR 15342). A suspension and interpretation of the 1979 test was published in the August 4, 1980,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (45 FR 51547). This suspension resulted from judicial review of the 1979 test, wherein the court remanded to the Secretary that portion of the 1979 test which required the property owner to have obtained all permits necessary to mine (``all permits'' test, 30 CFR 761.5(a)(2)(i)). [In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation, No. 79&hyph;1144 (D.D.C. 1980)]. Specifically, the court indicated that a good faith attempt to obtain all permits before the August 3, 1977, cut-off date should suffice for meeting the ``all permits'' test. In Re: Permanent (I), Mem. op. at 20. To comply with the court's 1980 opinion, OSM suspended the definition only insofar as it required that to establish VER, all permits must have been obtained prior to August 3, 1977. (45 FR 51547, 51548, August 4, 1980) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The November 20, 1986, notice of suspension restated OSM's position that, pending further rulemaking, OSM would interpret the regulation as including the court's suggestion that a good faith effort to obtain all permits would establish VER. Consequently, in Federal program States and on Indian lands, OSM will make VER determinations on a case-by-case basis, and will consider property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which by that date had made a good faith effort to obtain all permits, as one class of circumstances which would invariably entitle the property owner to VER. This is referred to as the 1980 test. VER would also exist when there are property rights in existence on August 3, 1977, the owner of which can demonstrate that the coal is both needed for and immediately adjacent to a mining operation in existence prior to August 3, 1977 (51 FR 41954, 41955). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Indiana's proposed VER language at subsection 139(a)(1)(A) and (B)(i) and (ii) is substantively identical to the two classes of VER contained in the 1979 rule, at former 30 CFR 761.5(a)(1) and (2). Because these portions of the 1979 rule, including the ``good faith, all permits'' interpretation of the ``all-permits test'' contained in former 30 CFR 761.5(a)(2)(i) have been upheld by the court, the Director is approving the proposed language at subsection 139(a)(1)(A) and (B)(i) and (ii). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) is substantively identical to the Federal language at 30 CFR 761.5(d)(1). The Director notes, however, that the proposed language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) duplicates the intent of the proposed language at subdivision 139(d). In response to a comment from OSM about this duplication, Indiana stated the duplicative language at subdivision 139(a)(1)(B)(iii) will be deleted at the next available opportunity. The Director agrees that, for clarity, the duplicative language should be removed at Indiana's earliest opportunity. The Director finds that the proposed language at subdivision 139(A)(1)(B)(iii), while duplicative, is no less effective than the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

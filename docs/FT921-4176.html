			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / BASF and Hoechst to cut their dividends BASF and Hoechst, two of Germany's big three chemicals companies, both announced yesterday that their pre-tax profits fell by more than 20 per cent last year and that they intended to cut their dividends for 1991 - the first time that the payout has been cut back since 1982. The announcements will put pressure on Bayer, the third of the big three chemical companies, to cut its dividend as it reports its 1991 results today. However, because of Bayer's prospering pharmaceuticals divisions, the drop in profits is expected to be limited to about 5 per cent. BASF's pre-tax profits fell 23.2 per cent to DM2.11bn (Pounds 735.8m), compared with DM2.75bn the year before, while Hoechst's pre-tax profits fell by just over 20 per cent to DM2.56bn (DM3.22bn). This is the second year running that their profits have dropped substantially, reflecting poor conditions for the German chemicals sector both in the domestic market and overseas. The figures were in line with expectations, and the cut in the dividend  - by DM1 to DM12 per share - was less severe than anticipated. The share prices of the two companies rose yesterday. 'By cutting the dividend only this much,' said Ms Petra Zamatna, of the Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, 'the companies have reached a compromise. They are keeping their shareholders happy and at the same time they are giving a very clear signal that 1992 will be a difficult year as well.' Yesterday the companies gave the basic figures for profits and turnover, the latter up by 5.2 per cent to DM47.19bn (DM44.86bn) at Hoechst and virtually unchanged at BASF at DM46.63bn (DM46.62bn). The two companies will spell out the details of last year's figures and their outlook for the current year in the next two weeks. Hoechst said that in a number of areas - including synthetic fibres, plastics and dyes - it was suffering from high production costs and prices kept low by intense competition in world markets. Analysts expect little improvement in the current year and Mr Kiran Bhojani at MM Warburg in Hamburg predicted that earnings at the three companies would climb by only a fraction. Today's dividend decision from Bayer will test the principle that the three big companies maintain a similar dividend policy.</p>

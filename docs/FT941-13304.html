			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Caledonian to buy Bank of Edinburgh Caledonian Trust, a property investment company, intends to buy Bank of Edinburgh, the financial services company set up three years ago to buy small building societies, in order to use its remaining capital. Caledonian said it intended to make an offer equivalent to the net asset value of Bank of Edinburgh, thought to be about Pounds 4m. It would use what remains of the company's original Pounds 8m capital to invest in property. The offer was disclosed after the announcement that Bank of Edinburgh had given up its banking licence and was considering returning capital to shareholders. This followed its failure to acquire the Heart of England Building Society. Mr Michael Baynham, an executive director of Caledonian Trust, said that it would make a formal offer following due diligence of Bank of Edinburgh. The offer would value it as a shell company with unused capital resources. The board of Bank of Edinburgh has recommended that any offer be put to shareholders, including Scottish Amicable, which holds a 39 per cent stake.</p>

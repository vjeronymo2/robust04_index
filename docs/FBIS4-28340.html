			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Shunji Taoka of AERA editorial staff: </F> "Demonstration of Military Power Will Adversely Affect  Negotiations With the United States"]    [Text] Because of a tipoff from the United States at the  end of May that there were signs North Korea (DPRK) would  shortly test launch a ballistic missile, those in charge of  North Korean affairs at the Defense Agency and Ministry of  Foreign Affairs became excited.    Approximately one year has passed since the test launching  on  29 May 1993 of the prototype No. 1 of Nodong-1 with a reputed  range of 1,000 km. Since then, a second test launching has not  been conducted.    To develop missiles, scores of test launchings are usually  required to discover defects and improve reliability before they  are mass produced and deployed. If not, they will not work with  precision and it is doubtful whether they will hit the intended  targets after the launch buttons are pressed.  Is the "Rimpac" Exercise of Japan, the United States, and the  ROK in Mind? [subhead]    A U.S. reconnaissance satellite detected that several  containers had been taken to the missile launching site on the  east coast of North Korea and a launcher installed. A giant  shelter pad against propellant jets had been erected and the  brisk activities of North Korean warships were also noted.    But, what was launched on the morning of 31 May was  different: It was a conventional Chinese-made antiship Silkworm  missile. It is so named because of its green caterpillar shape  which resembles a silkworm.    It was a missile of 80 to 90 km range intended mainly to  defend coastal areas from enemy landing operations. Although it  was reported that a new type of missile mounted with improved  guidance apparatus was tested, Japanese intelligence experts  seemed to lose interest, saying: "Why, it is a Silkworm."    At about the same time, the United Nations Security Council  adopted a presidential statement demanding North Korea stop  pulling spent fuel rods from a nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and  have it inspected by the International Atomic Energy Agency. In  reaction, North Korea insisted that there is no need to allow  full inspections as the DPRK has a unique status since it  proclaimed its intention to withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty and then withheld its intentions to do  so. It publicly stated that if economic sanctions were applied  it would be deemed a declaration of war.    If war breaks out, the U.S. and ROK Navies will have  complete  command of the sea, and the U.S. Third Marine Division on  Okinawa and two ROK Marine divisions will be able to threaten  the flanks and rear of the DPRK forces by landing on the North  Korean coast. "Rimpac 94," a joint naval exercise of Japan, the  United States, the ROK, Canada, and Australia, is under way in  the Pacific and the DPRK surely feels the menace of awesome  naval power demonstrated by that exercise.    To show the posture that it will not yield to such threats  and it is ready to intercept any landings, the DPRK may have to  test launch what little antiship missiles it has or conduct  training in the laying of mines. But, this sort of bullying  attitude will by and large have an adverse affect on the  Americans.    If a soft and pliant attitude is taken to satisfy American  pride, the DPRK may attain its objective of holding high-level  U.S.-DPRK talks; of obtaining power generating facilities  through light water reactors which are difficult to use for  military purposes; and of obtaining economic assistance from  both Japan and the United States. On the contrary, the  demonstration of military power, however small, will make the  U.S. response difficult.  "Nodong" Missile Development May Be At a Standstill [subhead]    As for Japan, antiship missiles are no threat at all.  Whether the development of Nodong-1 or its improved type  Nodong-2 is continuing is what matters. Attention is focused on  whether test launchings are due shortly or not.    The reason why a Nodong-1 test has not been conducted for  more than a year is attributed to the North Korean practice that  "the DPRK has conducted quite a few tests on domestically  developed and produced Scud B and C missiles." This way,  missiles for practical use cannot be produced.    Scud C's and Nodong-l's are said to have been developed for  export during the Iran-Iraq war with orders being placed and  development funds provided by Iran. And, at the test launch  last May, an Iranian delegation was invited to attend. But at  present, Iran is in financial difficulty because of low  petroleum prices and it has little reason to purchase North  Korean-produced missiles.    There are strong signs that the Japanese Government has  applied pressure: "How can Iran provide money for development  of missiles by none other than North Korea" in view of the fact  that Iran is receiving economic assistance from Japan.    If the DPRK abandons the development of ballistic missiles  with a possible range reaching Japan on top of the fact that it  has a very weak air force, Japan will feel almost no threat at  all.</p>

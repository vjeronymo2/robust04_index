			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Hualon denies claims on plant Hualon Corporation of Taiwan has denied allegations that it has been planning to go back on its pledge not to compete directly with European producers at its projected Belfast textiles plant. The British Apparel and Textile Confederation last week said it would appeal to the European Court against the European Commission's approval of Pounds 61m in government aid for the Pounds 157m project, which it said had been given on the basis that 'production from the plant would be high-volume goods of low added value to compete with low cost imports'.</p>

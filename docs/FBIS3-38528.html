			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RAY/RHR: "Claes Pleads for Defense Within </F> European Union"; as released by Brussels BELGA Database]    [Text] London, 2 Feb (BELGA) -- Belgian Foreign Minister  Willy Claes said Wednesday [2 February] in London that all the  conditions had been met for the European Union to talk about  defense and for the Western European Union (WEU) to establish a  peace force.    In reference to the creation of a common foreign and  security  policy, Mr. Claes, who was invited to the Chatham House  conferences organized by the Royal Institute of International  Affairs, said that a defense element should be included in such  a policy: "Primarily by creating a common peacekeeping policy,"  said Mr. Claes during his speech entitled "Europe: An  Unfinished Symphony."    "All the conditions have been met, especially with the  relevant agreement at the last NATO summit. The Union can now  talk about defense, the WEU can put together a peacekeeping  force, and the costs can be allocated via the Union budget,"  explained the Belgian foreign minister.    In another reference to the common foreign and security  policy, Mr. Claes said that this policy would require an  apparatus making it possible to correctly prepare and apply  decisions, for example a central planning unit with the European  Commission and the secretariat of the EC Council of Ministers.    Speaking to the British, whose government is hesitant about  setting up the common foreign and security policy, since,  according to it, such a move would result in the loss of  national sovereignty, Mr. Claes said that the common foreign and  security policy should be transformed in coming years into a  genuine political instrument, "thanks, in part, to the British  contribution."</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Observer: Who governs the BA board? Today's meeting of the British Airways board will not be the last word in good corporate governance if all it does is confirm Sir Colin Marshall as executive chairman and promote Robert Ayling, a relatively inexperienced ex-civil servant, to be his number two. A swift glance at the annual report shows that BA's board would almost certainly fail the spirit if not the letter of Sir Adrian Cadbury's corporate governance report. It badly needs beefing-up. True, non-executive directors are in a majority. But on paper, at least, the current board doesn't look as well-balanced as it was when Lord King led BA into the private sector six years ago. Then there were powerful figures, such as Kleinwort's Bobbie Henderson and ex-Cadbury Schweppes boss Basil Collins, to keep a check on Lord King and Sir Colin. Today, BA has two conventional non-execs in the form of CBI president Sir Michael Angus and Michael Davies, deputy chairman of TI. Lord White, Lord Hanson's US-based partner, and Hanson director Charlie Price, a former US ambassador to Britain, are somewhat less conventional. The strong Hanson connection in BA's boardroom (Lord King and Lord Hanson also go back a long way) may be helpful for doing deals and calling in political favours. But the corporate governance lobby would query the wisdom of having two non-execs from the same stable. Given that Lord White is 70 in May and Michael Davies has been on the board for a decade, the BA boardroom could benefit from an injection of some fresh outside blood. It shouldn't be hard to find able candidates - after all, one of the perks is free first-class travel around the globe.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pilkington Pilkington saw profits double to Pounds 61m before tax and disposal gains in the six months to September helped by an improvement in most of its main markets. Including a Pounds 16m profit on the sale of its insulation business the glass maker reported a pre-tax surplus of Pounds 77m against Pounds 30m. Turnover from continuing operations rose by just 3 per cent to Pounds 1.29bn, with volume growth of 7 per cent offset by the fall in the dollar and price reductions in Germany. Earnings per share were 3p (0.4p) excluding the disposal gain, while the dividend was held at 1.5p.</p>

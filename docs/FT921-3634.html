			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: RVI struggles out of red despite decline in turnover RENAULT Vehicules Industriels (RVI), the French truck and bus maker, crawled back into profit last year, burdened by continuing losses at its US subsidiary. The group, which with its Swedish partner, Volvo Truck, forms the world's largest heavy truck maker, reported a FFr23m (Dollars 4.12m) net profit for 1991, against a FFr102m loss in the previous year. Mack Trucks, the troubled US arm, contributed a FFr621m loss last year, a sharp decline from the FFr1bn loss in 1990. This reflected the gains from rigorous cost-cutting and a decision to stop resorting to unprofitable contracts to defend market share. Group turnover slipped by 7.7 per cent, from FFr29.65bn to FFr27.38bn, a sign of the continuing downturn in the US and European transport industries. 'The economic recession was widespread, sparing only Germany and countries in south-east Asia,' said Mr Shemaya Levy, general manager. Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, RVI chairman, said the outcome 'was nothing to be ashamed about' against competitors' likely results. He predicted that 1992 would be difficult. European sales fell by 3.7 per cent to FFr21bn, with profits from the region down by 33 per cent to FFr644m. RVI's market share there held level at 11.8 per cent, in a market where overall demand fell by more than 10 per cent. The US market, meanwhile, fell by between 21 per cent and 24.5 per cent  - depending on the size of truck - to its lowest for eight years. Mack's sales fell by 23 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn and it lost market share as it held its prices. It 'virtually left the big fleet market', said Mr Capron. RVI took full control of its former minority-owned US arm 18 months ago, in an attempt to resolve its problems, a mixture of over-manning, poor quality and marketing. Mr Capron said the Mack restructuring plan was already paying off, with a 15 per cent fall in overheads over the past 15 months, and a reduction in the workforce, to 5,424 from 9,400 three years ago. He was convinced RVI needed to keep its North American presence and had no misgivings. Overall, RVI has reduced its workforce by 7 per cent to 28,100 over the past year. The partnership with Volvo Truck was proceeding well, and savings were already coming from pooled purchasing of components, said Mr Capron. More significant gains from the alliance, in which Volvo owns 45 per cent of RVI, should be evident from 1994-1995, he said.</p>

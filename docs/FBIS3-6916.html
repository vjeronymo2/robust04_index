			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to reports, Japan's NHK Television  reported on 22 March that U.S. President Clinton had ordered the  deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea.    This is a provocative step to lead the situation to extremes  by further aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula. Under  its intentional scheme to create the situation of confrontation  with us, the United States has broken up the DPRK-U.S. talks by  fully overturning the 25 February agreement made at the  DPRK-U.S. contact in New York and has more openly strengthened a  military threat and has pressured us by announcing that it will  resume the Team Spirit 1994 joint military exercise.    The order by Clinton to deploy Patriot missiles to South  Korea is a grave threat to us. This clearly shows that the  United States is leading the Korean peninsula to the situation  of war.</p>

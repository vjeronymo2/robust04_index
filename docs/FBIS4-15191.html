			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 1 April this year, Lithuania had 68,000 job  seekers registered. Among them, unemployed people accounted for  more than 28,500. Forty-four percent of the unemployed were  recorded in big cities, while the remaining quota -- in the  province. The rate of unemployment remained unchanged in  comparison with last month -- 3.2 percent. Unemployed people  included mostly workers and women. There were about 20 people  competing for each job vacancy.    Specialists from the Lithuanian Labor Exchange claim that  the  official statistics do not reflect the actual situation on the  labor market. According to them, it would be naive to believe  in such a low unemployment rate when production turnout has  dropped by 60 percent in the country over the past three years,  and the previously prosperous enterprises producing machines and  electronics have been moribund. For example, the hidden  unemployment is masked when thousands of workers go on long  unpaid leaves.</p>

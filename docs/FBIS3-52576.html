According to the sources of these reports, Culture Minister  Shirku Biks (50 years old), considered one of the most prominent  Kurdish poets at present, justified the resignation he submitted  on 11 December by saying that "he did not wish to bear the  historical responsibility, before the people, for the violations  taking place in the government administration, the daily  excesses, the intertwined ministerial powers, and other problems  of government administration."    Biks does not belong to any Kurdish party but he was a  candidate on the list of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK]  led by Jalal Talabani in the local parliamentary elections held  in Iraqi Kurdistan in May 1992. [passage omitted]    According to PUK sources, the Kurdish minister's resignation  was mainly due to his dissatisfaction with a number of measures  taken by the regional government including the closure of the  local paper WALAT by an administrative and not judicial decision  and without legal grounds. That paper was published by some  Iraqi Kurds and was known for its support for the Kurdish  Workers Party [PKK] of Turkey which has waged a guerrilla war  against Turkey and which calls for an independent Kurdish state.  [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, PUK sources have stated that the meeting held  between the leaders of two main parties in Iraqi Kurdistan [the  PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party] last Sunday ended in  agreement to cooperate to "solve the problems" resulting from  the recent fighting between the Islamic Movement of Iraqi  Kurdistan and the PUK. They added that the two sides agreed on  a "framework for dealing with and cooperating with the movement  on the basis of commitment to the local laws, and no armed  presence."    In another development, a responsible source of the Iraqi  opposition's Democratic National Accord Grouping has denied that  there was a recent split in his organization. He said that late  last month the Executive Committee held meetings "during which  it accepted the resignation of 'Abd-al-Karim al-Mashhadani,  taking into consideration his family circumstances, and  terminated the memberships of Usamah Mahdi and Munaf Hasan for  refusing to comply with the decisions made during the meetings  in connection with political, organizational, and administrative  matters." These three had issued a statement the day before  yesterday saying that they resigned in protest against  "ideological, organizational, and administrative violations."</p>

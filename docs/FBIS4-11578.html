			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] "The Socialist Left Front [FIS] electoral  alliance was disbanded on 10 April. We will continue to work  together on the agreed tasks, but as a front, it is disbanded."  With these words, a spokeswoman of the Movement Toward  Socialism (MAS) signed the death certificate for the front that  groups Trotskyist leaning parties. The other two groups that  made up the front -- the Socialist Movement of the Workers  (MST), headed by Luis Zamora, and the Workers Party (PO), headed  by Jorge Altamirano -- have decided to act jointly. As a first  measure, on 1 May at 1500 there will be a commemoration of Labor  Day at the Plaza de Mayo. The MAS will hold its own  commemoration at the Boxing Federation. [passage omitted]    Thus, the Trotskyist alliance ends following its poor  performance in the 10 April elections. It had been born in  February. At the national level, the Trotskyists lost 31,000  votes compared with the results they obtained in October 1993,  with a large loss in the Federal Capital and especially in  Greater Buenos Aires. In these two districts "the wave rolled  toward the Grand Front and we could do nothing," a spokesperson  acknowledged on 26 April, "but in the provinces of Jujuy,  Neuquen, Salta, Santiago del Estero, and especially in Santa  Cruz we increased our vote. There were workers' struggles in  those provinces and it is no coincidence that we had better  results there." In Santa Cruz Province the FIS obtained two  seats in the Constituent Assembly, the only seats that it was  able to gain in the whole country.</p>

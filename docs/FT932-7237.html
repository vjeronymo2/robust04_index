			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Most US companies in retaliatory net Sir, Mr John Wosner's letter (May 20) suggesting that UK laws designed to retaliate against US companies would have a limited effect can be of little comfort to most US-based companies with UK subsidiaries. It is true that if such companies (a) do not have their main place of business in a unitary tax state such as California, or (b) are not subject to tax by such a state, or (c) have less than 7.5 per cent of their US payroll, property or sales derived from such a state, then they cannot be affected by the threatened retaliation. But given the wealth of California there must be few US-based companies that are not potentially affected by the legislation. How many of them would be affected would depend on the form of implementation since the making of a Treasury order to enforce the provisions would not only give the effective starting date, but can also say which of the tests listed above would be applied.

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LEGISLATORS SEEK INQUIRY INTO GASOLINE PRICE INCREASES  </P> <P> Double-digit increases in the price of gasoline at Ventura County pumps angered  consumers Tuesday and prompted a Republican congressman and a Democratic state  senator to call for investigations.  </P> <P> "We do not have an oil shortage at this point; therefore, these price hikes . .  . are unwarranted," said Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), who called for  a federal investigation of possible antitrust and price-fixing violations by  oil companies.  </P> <P> State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) made a similar appeal for a federal  and state investigation.  </P> <P> Hart and Lagomarsino said they do not think the oil supply crisis, prompted by  Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, is serious enough to warrant changing  the federal government's ban on offshore oil development along the California  coast. Without such a policy change, oil officials said, the crisis will not  provide much of a boon for Ventura County oil producers.  </P> <P> The county's gasoline retailers, however, have been busy raising prices.  Self-serve, unleaded regular was selling for $1.29 a gallon at Chevron stations  in Moorpark and Camarillo on Tuesday, an 8-cent increase since the invasion.  </P> <P> In the same period, prices have gone up 6 1/2 cents a gallon at an Exxon  station in Ventura and 5 cents a gallon at a Mobil station in Thousand Oaks and  at a Unocal station in Fillmore.  </P> <P> Combined with a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the state gasoline tax that took  effect last Wednesday, gasoline prices have risen more than 10% at some  stations in less than a week. Several station operators said they expect more  increases in the coming weeks, noting that the price of crude oil has reached  the highest level in nearly five years.  </P> <P> "These scumbag oil companies remind me of looters after a disaster," said  Donald Ricky, a contractor who was filling up at a Shell station in Ventura.  The price of gasoline there went up 4 cents Sunday and 2 cents more Tuesday  afternoon.  </P> <P> "It's the same thing they did in '73 and '79," Ricky said, recalling previous  oil crises. "They immediately leap at the first opportunity to gouge the  consumer. I resent it like hell."  </P> <P> Ricky said he has no choice but to pay the higher prices because he needs his  truck for business. "I remodel houses," he said. "I can't ride the bus with a  2-by-4."  </P> <P> But a Shell spokesman in Houston said the higher prices are justified.  </P> <P> "Oil is a commodity. It's no different from oranges, soybeans or coffee,"  spokesman H.F. Hutchins said. "This is the way world commodities operate. They  react to what's going on with the supply situation on an immediate basis.  </P> <P> "It's not much different from what you see when there's an orange crop freeze  in Florida or a coffee crop freeze in Costa Rica. Prices rise almost  immediately in response to those events."  </P> <P> Hutchins said a $3-per-barrel increase on July 27 by the oil-producing  countries started the surge in prices. "The combination of that plus dramatic  events in the Middle East have added a psychology of shortage and uncertainty  in the market. The prices reflect that uncertainty in supply."  </P> <P> Not everyone buying gas on Tuesday was upset about the price increases. "I can  see the oil companies' point of view," said Mike Murray of Ventura. "They feel  there will be a shortage and they can make profits now. I'm not opposed to  that."  </P> <P> But Lagomarsino, echoing charges by other congressmen, accused some oil  companies of "taking advantage of the crisis in the gulf to make a huge profit  off the public." He called for U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to investigate  "possible antitrust and price-fixing violations."  </P> <P> In a joint statement Monday, the Justice, Energy and Transportation departments  said they would monitor oil prices and vigorously prosecute any companies  guilty of antitrust violations.  </P> <P> After attending a meeting of the state Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday, Hart  said the state and federal governments should "redouble our efforts at  antitrust enforcement."  </P> <P> "I think whenever you are in a situation like this there's an easy  justification to raise prices."  </P> <P> Hart said he disputed figures presented to the committee by Richard A. Bilas, a  member of the California Energy Commission. Bilas told the panel that gasoline  prices had gone up by only 2.4 cents on the average since the invasion. "That  seemed awfully low, based on personal experience and what constituents say,"  Hart said.  </P> <P> Hart, who has opposed offshore oil drilling, said that at this point he does  not expect a change in the federal policy banning lease sales until 1996 along  the Santa Barbara Channel and until the year 2000 along the rest of the state's  coastline.  </P> <P> "It depends how much worse it gets," Hart said. "Those of us who oppose it off  the Santa Barbara Channel would say there's much more to be gained from energy  conservation. We just don't have a national energy policy."  </P> <P> Lagomarsino aide John Doherty said the congressman believes that all parts of  the state should be treated equally. Lagomarsino has supported offshore  drilling and was politically embarrassed in June when the Bush Administration  banned it for the entire decade off most of the California coast but only until  1996 in the waters off Lagomarsino's district.  </P> <P> Oil company officials said that unless the crisis leads to more oil development  off the Southern California coast, it would not provide much of a boost for the  local oil industry.  </P> <P> "I don't see a whole lot of change in Ventura County per se," said Fred  Sarrafian, a Texaco official in Ventura. The company pumps about 9,000 barrels  a day in the county, mostly from around the Ventura River bed.  </P> <P> "There could be a substantial change if things result in more offshore oil  activity," he said.  </P> <P> Related Stories: A10  </P></p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel prices fall to 5-year lows NICKEL PRICES were hit hardest yesterday by the wave of selling that is driving down prices on the London Metal Exchange. After touching its lowest level for more than five years, the price of nickel for delivery in three months closed last night at Dollars 5,540, down Dollars 127.50 a tonne. In the past week nickel prices have fallen by Dollars 602.50 a tonne or nearly 10 per cent. Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, pointed out that cuts planned by nickel producers were 'perceived as tardy and insufficient'. Total nickel stocks, an estimated 220,000 tonnes, equated to more than 18 weeks' consumption and the outlook for stainless steel (the biggest user of nickel) was poor. 'A period of depressed (nickel) prices looks to be in prospect for the remainder of this year and the first half of 1993,' he said. Copper prices also fell heavily yesterday before recovering slightly when news about renewed political tension in Zaire created some nervousness about supplies from the African copper belt. Three-months copper closed last night at Pounds 1,411.50 a tonne, down Pounds 14.25 in one day and Pounds 64.75 or 4.4 per cent in a week. Recovery in metals prices is not too far away, suggests Mr Jon Bergtheil, analyst at James Capel, in a special report 'Metals and Easy Money'. He says metal exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States will ease just as western demand is picking up and western producers have cut output substantially. Mr Bergtheil says: 'This convergence will begin to take place from the second quarter of 1993. Metal prices will anticipate this and begin to rise from early 1993'.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Softs take off in US and London on Chicago rally Corn and soyabean futures prices at the Chicago Board of Trade surged by their allowable daily limits just after the opening yesterday, triggering a renewed rally in soft commodities in the US and London after last week's profit-taking. Chicago traders sent prices up in response to an absence of rain in the main midwestern crop areas over the long holiday weekend. The National Weather Service on Friday issued 30-day and 90-day forecasts that predicted near-normal moisture patterns in the midwest. But traders are reacting to short-term dry weather because of a shortfall in last year's US crop. 'It's still May and we've already had two weather scares,' said Mr Vic Lespinasse, a Dean Witter Reynolds trader, referring to a similar jump in grain prices on Monday last week. 'The market is reacting to every little worry.' Last Tuesday, Chicago grain markets tumbled back down again, setting off long-awaited profit-taking in other softs. At midday yesterday, July soyabean futures were up the maximum allowable 30 cents per bushel at Dollars 6.73 3/4 . Trading had halted. November Maize futures were up by their 12 cent limit at Dollars 2.78 3/4 per bushel. Investment and hedge funds have bought heavily into commodities in recent weeks, feeding a general buying spree that started with coffee futures. The early excitement in Chicago yesterday spilled over into silver and gold in New York, and into coffee and cocoa. 'It's just a technical, speculative binge that we're seeing here,' said Mr Bill O'Neill, analyst with Merrill Lynch. He underlined that the coffee market had strong fundamental support from the supply shortage. The July arabica contract in New York was up 5.10 cents in afternoon trading at 126.40 cents a pound. In London, robusta coffee futures had a strong day, but with bouts of profit-taking and very thin volume, which left traders nervous. The July futures contract closed Dollars 132 higher at Dollars 2,118 a tonne. Last week the price plunged by over Dollars 360 a tonne from its seven-year peak of Dollars 2,348. London cocoa futures picked up strongly, with July Pounds 39 higher at Pounds 1,027 a tonne. Against the trend, nickel prices tumbled on the London Metals Exchange following the weekend agreement on a new contract between Inco, the world's second-largest nickel producer, and labour leaders at its Sudbury, Ontario, metals complex. Three-month nickel closed Dollars 102.50 a tonne lower at Dollars 6,325.</p>

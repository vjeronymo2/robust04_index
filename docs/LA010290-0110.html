			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> NISSAN U.S.A. RAISES PRICES 1%  </P> <P> Nissan Motor Corp. in U.S.A. said today it has raised the prices for the  Sentra, Stanza and Maxima sedans, effective immediately.  </P> <P> The price on the Sentra has been increased $100 and the prices for the Stanza  and Maxima were raised $200.  </P> <P> "The new prices, which represent an increase of approximately 1%, are the  result of the spiraling cost of doing business," said Robert J. Thomas, vice  president, general manager.  </P> <P> "While this action is necessary, we are pleased to note that we are maintaining  1990 introductory price levels on all other model lines, including our 240SX,  Pulsar NX, 300ZX, Axxess, Hardbody and Pathfinder," Thomas said.  </P></p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Campbell Soup in the red after Dollars 300m write-off CAMPBELL SOUP, the US foods group, yesterday disclosed a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 115.9m, or 46 cents a share. The deficit was caused by an anticipated Dollars 300m write-off taken in connection with a restructuring and divestiture programme that included plant closures. Last year Campbell achieved second-quarter net profits of Dollars 160.6m or 64 cents. The New Jersey-based company said sales reached record levels in the quarter, having risen by 2 per cent year-on-year to Dollars 1.79bn. Six-month sales rose 6 per cent to Dollars 3.48bn, while first-half net earnings were Dollars 40.7m, or 16 cents a share, down from Dollars 289.8m, or Dollars 1.15 last time. Mr David Johnson, president and chief executive of Campbell, said that before restructuring charges the company's net earnings were actually 18 per cent higher in the first six months. 'In the teeth of a tough competitive environment worldwide, we have delivered strong results for the second quarter,' Mr Johnson said. Campbell's North and South American division, the single largest business, reported a 7 per cent rise in second-quarter operating earnings before restructuring charges. Sales for the division were 4 per cent better at Dollars 1.29bn. The biscuit and bakery division had a 2 per cent decrease in operating earnings before charges with sales 1 per cent lower at Dollars 214.2m in the quarter. Operating earnings in the second quarter for Campbell Europe/Asia increased by 10 per cent before restructuring charges. Sales were 1 per cent lower at Dollars 290.2m.</p>

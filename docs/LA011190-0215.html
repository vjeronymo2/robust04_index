			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EX-BULGARIA LEADER LIKELY TO BE CHARGED  </P> <P> Ousted Communist leader Todor Zhivkov is likely to face charges of abuse of  power, fraud and violating human rights, a member of a parliamentary commission  said today.  </P> <P> The inquiry might stop short, however, of unearthing irregularities by  Communists still in power, said Petar Beron, a commission member and  pro-democracy activist.  </P> <P> "It's not an easy job," Beron said, because some of Zhivkov's associates "are  still very much at large."  </P> <P> He said the commission is also looking into "the drainage of public money" by  Zhivkov, the hard-liner who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until his ouster Nov.  10.  </P> <P> Beron said Zhivkov had siphoned millions from state-run foundations promoting  arts and education, to help build more than 30 villas and luxurious residences  around the country.  </P> <P> Lyuben Kolishev, a leader of the commission, said Tuesday that enough evidence  had already been gathered on Zhivkov to open criminal proceedings on charges of  embezzlement of state funds.  </P> <P> Kolishev said he has evidence that Zhivkov had Swiss bank accounts. He gave no  further details.  </P> <P> Beron said the government requested Swiss authorities to open the accounts but  noted this would only be agreed to once a legal case was opened for crimes that  would also be punishable under Swiss law.  </P> <P> Beron said Zhivkov will be charged and then brought to trial after the  commission completes its investigation, probably by the end of January.  </P></p>

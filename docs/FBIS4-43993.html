			<p>BFN     [Text] The developments on the Cyprus issue and Cyprus'  accession to the European Union [EU] tonight focus on Corfu,  where President Glavkos Kliridhis will hold decisive meetings.  Kliridhis will meet Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou at  1945 and European Commission President Jacques Delors around  2030 today.    The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation correspondent in Corfu  reports that the Greek presidency and the Cypriot Government are  convinced that tonight's meeting between Papandreou, Delors, and  Kliridhis will mark a step forward in comparison with the  previous EU decision to review Cyprus' membership application in  January 1995.    Well-informed sources have told our correspondent that  Athens  and Nicosia have set three goals for the Corfu summit. First,  to specify that official talks on Cyprus' accession to the EU  will begin in January. Second, if the first goal is not  achieved, to secure a commitment that the timetable for the  beginning of accession negotiations will definitely be set next  January. Third, to see that the EU summit's closing statement  mentions specifically that the next EU expansion will include  Cyprus and Malta.    Kliridhis will meet British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd  at  2330 today. Hurd went to Corfu following his talks on the  Cyprus issue in New York with the UN secretary general and with  U.S. officials in Washington. Tonight's meetings come after the  Cyprus visit by Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative for Cyprus.</p>

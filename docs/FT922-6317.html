			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Blystad may recover Dollars 3.6m loan BLYSTAD, the UK oil services and drilling group, is considering steps to recover Dollars 3.6m lent to a company owned by trusts in which three of its directors, including the chairman, are beneficially interested. The announcement was made as the group revealed sharply higher pre-tax losses for 1991 of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 290,000). Mr Wilhelm Blystad, chairman, said the loan - which related to the option held by Sokana Industries on a Mexican shipyard - had been reduced by Dollars 1m, but still not repaid by the due date of March 31. Blystad's independent directors were 'considering what action is appropriate to recover the loan and are currently discussing the position with Sokana,' he said. During the year Blystad increased turnover by 10 per cent to Pounds 25.5m. Exceptional charges, including write-downs on the development of its floating oil production project and the value of the semi-submersible drilling rig, came to Pounds 3.9m. Losses per share deepened from 0.55p to 3.06p. There was no dividend.</p>

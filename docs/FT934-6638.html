			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / MPs 'misled' over policy on defence sales to Iraq, Scott told Ministers misled MPs repeatedly by insisting that the government had not changed its policy on defence sales to Iraq since 1985, a senior civil servant told the Scott inquiry yesterday. Mr Eric Beston, a Department of Trade and Industry official, said written answers to parliament, one of which was read out by Mrs Margaret Thatcher in April 1989, contained 'misinterpretations, inaccuracies, misleading statements, and things which could have been done differently'. Mr Beston, now the DTI's East Midlands regional director, was in charge of export controls when the operational guidelines were changed in December 1988 to allow UK companies easier access to Iraqi markets after the Iran-Iraq ceasefire. When questioned on why the written answers - which had been drafted by the department's senior civil servants, scrutinised by its parliamentary units, and authorised by ministers - contained such misleading statements, Mr Beston explained that written answers were 'an art form rather than a means of communication'. He said: 'Not all answers to all questions are necessarily answered fully. Information is not volunteered that goes beyond the strict limits of the question.' He had been probed about the extent to which policy had been formally made more 'flexible' and the four occasions in 1989 when written answers or replies to MP's letters concealed the change. He said that one answer, which he had helped to draft, would have been better if it 'had been shorter'. Lord Justice Scott replied: 'It would have been better if it had been an accurate answer.' Ms Presiley Baxendale, Lord Justice Scott's counsel, referred to a Foreign Office minute in which Mr William Waldegrave, then a Foreign Office minister, pointed out that publicising the relaxation in the guidelines would unduly raise exporters' hopes and draw 'unwelcome attention' from previously disinterested MPs. Mr Beston said Foreign Office officials instinctively reached for tighter export controls as a foreign policy tool, citing the freeze on certain exports to Iran following the Salman Rushdie affair. He also admitted that he did not see until the following year a crucial intelligence document, of November 1987, reporting that machine tools exported by UK companies were being put to military use in Iraq.</p>

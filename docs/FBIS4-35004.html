			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Part one" of a report on an interview with Ignacio </F> Pichardo Pagaza, secretary general of the National Executive  Committee, CEN, of the Mexican Institutional Revolutionary  Party, PRI, by reporter Jose Quintero; place and date not given;  quotation marks as published]    [Text] Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, secretary general of the  National Executive Committee, CEN, has told UNOMASUNO: "The  Camachistas [followers of Manuel Camacho Solis, former  commissioner for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas]" have not  attacked the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI]. The party  will do nothing against Manuel Camacho Solis. He is still a PRI  militant. "Camacho, who I respect, decided to resign from his  post as peace commissioner. It was his personal and respectable  decision, and it is wrong to attribute this resignation to any  statement that our presidential candidate could have made on the  peace negotiations in Chiapas.    The party will do nothing against the PRI militants who  belong to the so-called Group of 30. That group "is not our  enemy. We live in a pluralistic and heterogeneous society where  there is respect and tolerance for the opinions of the citizens,  who are free to express themselves. PRI does not agree with  their opinions, but they are absolutely free to make them known.  The party will do nothing about that."    Pichardo noted: "They are free to state their opinion, what  happens is that we disagree with some of their positions,  although there is agreement on the need for promoting democracy  in our country."    During an extensive interview, this newspaper asked him:  What is the PRI's situation as a result of the attack by the  Camachistas, considering that Camacho himself stated in his  resignation letter that presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo  did not give him a vote of confidence in the negotiations for  peace in Chiapas and hints that this was one of the causes of  his resignation?    [Pichardo] The truth is that there is no attack by the  Camachistas. Manuel Camacho, whom I respect, made a decision he  attributed, mistakenly, in my opinion, to statements made by our  presidential candidate. He decided to resign from his post as  commissioner for peace and reconciliation. This is a  respectable decision that is personal.    "He also said two other important things. He said that he  will abstain from any political activity during the rest of this  administration. He also said something I believe he said  recently during an interview, that he remains a member of the  PRI. All this leads to the conclusion that there is no attack  by the Camachistas. The party is working hard and showing  respect for the current position of Manuel Camacho."    [Quintero] Nothing will be done against him?    [Pichardo] Not at all. He has a very respectable personal  position.    [Quintero] Nothing will be done against the Group of 30  militants either?    [Pichardo] No. PRI realizes that we live in a pluralistic  and heterogeneous society and that the fundamental element is  respect and tolerance for the opinion of the citizens, who are  free to express themselves. This group of citizens is  exercising its constitutional right to meet and analyze the  country's problems and to freely state its opinion.    "Another thing concerns their positions' being in agreement  with the party's position. They are free, and the party is not  going to consider this one way or another. They are free to  express their opinions. What happens is that we disagree with  some of the positions stated by this group, although we all  agree that we must work for greater democracy in our country.    "I want to tell you that, in the opinion of the chairman of  the CEN, the march toward democracy is permanent and endless.  No political system in the world can claim it has a perfect  democracy. It is always possible to find deficiencies and  weaknesses, and therefore it is possible to take corrective  action."    [Quintero] Is there not too much tolerance for those people?    [Pichardo] No. There can never be too much tolerance. We  believe they are exercising their constitutional right to meet  and to freely express their points of view. This does not mean  that we agree with what they say.    [Quintero] Do you think there is a campaign against the PRI?    [Pichardo] There are political campaigns. They are very  intense, not against the PRI, but in the search for political  power there is, of course, heat produced by the campaign.    [Quintero] Are there campaigns from any specific group?    [Pichardo] Not at all. These are different matters. The  party has its own dynamics and course, and this group of  citizens is free to express its points of view. We do not view  its members as enemies or criticize their right to express their  points of view. This does not mean we agree with them. They can  meet and express their opinion on national problems."  <H5>  Withdrawn Employees </H5>   Later on, Pichardo Pagaza was asked whether present  government employees, who came from the PRI ranks, were not  turning their backs on their own party. The Mexican replied:  "No. What has happened is that the new legal dispositions  establish limits for government employees. Several employees  have interpreted those dispositions very broadly, and others,  fortunately only a few, have stopped exercising a right that is  guaranteed by the Constitution and secondary laws.    "Any citizen, including those who occupy a post in  government, as long as they do not use their offices' assets and  supplies or work during office hours, can fully exercise their  right to participate in political activities. Fortunately, many  are already doing this; others have withdrawn, but they are  smaller in number."    At the beginning of the interview held in one of the CEN's  private offices at PRI facilities, Pichardo Pagaza said the PRI  and its candidate to the Presidency of the republic, as well as  the rest of its candidates to other elected positions, are  carrying out an intense political campaign throughout the  country. "The information, the real situation is that the party  is vigorous, well organized, and has overcome the tremendous  blow of losing Luis Donaldo Colosio, our candidate for the  Presidency of the republic. We have now gathered around Ernesto  Zedillo Ponce de Leon, who is competing at a national level."    He emphasized: "It is the PRI that is campaigning, enthused,  facing the future, and convinced that it confronts a very strong  electoral competition. The party is in an electoral process  where all the parties have equal conditions, where the PRI no  longer has a protective mantle, and where there are autonomous  electoral bodies that are now geared towards the people. We  have a new electoral law and a number of recent factors that  have been assimilated by the PRI rank and file. Thus, we are  facing a new, unknown process, which is a challenge and a  motivation to us."    [Quintero] When you say the PRI no longer has a protective  mantle, are you referring to the often-criticized PRI-government  symbiosis, and does this mean that the PRI will be autonomous  and independent from the government?    [Pichardo] That is correct. The party is aware that it is  necessary that it remain autonomous with regard to the  government. Not only must it be autonomous, but it must uphold  it vanguardist, advanced position within the party itself. We  feel proud when elected PRI officials comply with their civic  duties. We also feel compelled, however, to point out the  errors, mistakes, and unfulfilled promises of PRI officials who  are not meeting the voters' expectations.    "You have mentioned an important point, but for many years  the PRI was the sole party, and the political struggle took  place -- it was an exclusive struggle -- within the party.  Conditions have changed, Mexican society has changed, and the  PRI is promoting those changes. We are now facing a challenge,  but this also means that we must act in a totally democratic  manner....    "It means equality of conditions with the rest of the  parties  and facing impartial electoral institutions where, from the  officials at the voting tables to the ones at the highest levels  of the Federal Electoral Institute General Council, there are  private citizens and not the government or political parties.  Far from involving a feeling that we are in an advantageous  position, the new situation is a true challenge and positively  motivates the PRI and its political competition.</p>

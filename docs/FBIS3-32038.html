General Tagliaferro de Lima is the first member of the  military High Command to leave his post. It is expected that the  other members, including Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames  Munoz will make their resignations official today or Tuesday.    After learning of Caldera's decision to remove them from  their posts, the members of the High Command announced they  would resign and request their retirement from the Armed Forces  prior to the presidential inauguration on Wednesday. Caldera, a  78-year-old Christian Democrat, should announce his new cabinet  in the next few hours. Caldera will be in office from 1994 to  1999. He had previously been president from 1969 to 1974.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Sport: Keen Kiwis look to the future - Cricket The globe may be warming, but this year's English cricketing summer has settled for erratic rain and winds to unsettle the visiting New Zealanders. By the time the tourists reached Trent Bridge, they were upset, not just by the wet and cold but, also by the bewildering speed with which wet and dry, cold and hot were succeeding each other this summer. At Chelmsford, before the Trent Bridge Test, New Zealand rejoiced in a rare chance to try out for their players, although only the last day in Essex brought out ice-creams and New Zealand flags, to celebrate a good practice and a draw. Watching Matthew Hart bat with distinction at number nine, one of several young tourists who can bat as well as bowl - Shane Thomson is another - it seemed as if New Zealand had almost too many of the all-rounders England are always seeking. New Zealand suits all-rounders and Sir Richard Hadlee is their national hero. He is pleased with the individual confidence of Hart and Thomson and also of wicket-keeper Adam Parore, who bats beautifully, with occasional lapses into one-day swiping. New Zealand's hope for the future is that this team will be able to come back in a few years with their skills refined and beat those who are giving them a hard time now. The key question is: can they do it? Matthew Hart reckons all he has to do is go on improving - as he has done since he was in England last with a representative side, in 1992. He was only 20 then and flourishing in a hot, humid summer. The weather is less friendly this time and, as he glared grimly at the rain clouds, he said: 'It's easier to stay fit in warm weather. This cold and wet weather makes people break down.' An eye for the elements has led Hart into his present role as a bowler of slow, flighted balls, including leg spinners, an old-fashioned kind of bowling, good fun to watch. He started his cricket as a batsman, which is easy to believe, then shifted the emphasis to bowling because he found it easy to get people out with his seamers. So why leg spin? 'Injuries,' was his reply. 'When I was about 15 I changed from seamers to spin because I got fed up with pulling muscles and injuring things all the time.' A sentiment that will be welcomed by cricket lovers, who seem to be presented with a barrage of injuries as soon as bowlers start bowling. While I was talking to Hart, Chris Pringle, who did well with his seamers at Edgbaston, burst in and declared that his reason for bowling fast-medium was the back-yard challenge of it all. He was looking for the physiotherapist at the time, but when I asked him how his strained back was, he said he was not giving anything away. Injuries have joined weather as strategic weapons. Newspaper speculation helps produce that attitude. 'In New Zealand the papers report matches,' said Hart, very much the child from far away. 'Here they sensationalise things, not least injuries. And they put great pressure on individual players, like Craig White. How can he play his normal game when he's had such a lot of build-up about coming into Test cricket?' White's cause is helped by the miserable time Darren Gough is having with his pre-Test side strain. Next, we know, there will be a side-strain society for bowlers, crossing the barriers of race and pace. White and Gough will have to learn early to be players with reserves of calm in the face of media pressure. Knowing their selection is for at least a season, not a single game as in the do-or-die style of the previous regime, would surely be a help. Danny Morrison has been New Zealand's main strike bowler since Hadlee's retirement. At 28 he is a veritable antique and, indeed, he limped off the field at Edgbaston, in pain from a groin strain. Groin strains are a recurring menace to faster bowlers involved in long stints of bowling, but Morrison hopes to be fit by the Lord's Test, bringing with him stability and experience. It is a difficult problem for New Zealand. The worst mistake would be to bring Morrison back too soon, aggravating the injury and depressing Heath Davis, the big, enthusiastic young risk in this New Zealand party. He was nicely described in the official programme for the one-day game that never happened at Lord's on May 21 as one of the visitors' 'Young Guns . . . the trouble is that he is never sure where the bullets are going.' There will be time for target practice because Davis is only 23 and extremely keen. Last summer he played for Sussex Second XI; last winter he took lots of wickets in New Zealand. If he can do well again this winter, it will raise his morale. At least he has some speed, which is what England's would-be pace bowlers constantly seek. At Chelmsford I watched Essex's new signing from the outback, Michael Kasprowicz, bowling far too loosely in an attempt to bowl more speedily. This was just what Devon Malcolm did at Trent Bridge, when a few yorkers would have been much more efficient. Short bowling at tail-enders is not often worth it; against experienced batsmen such as Martin Crowe it is a waste of time. The New Zealanders are better than the English at knowing their limitations and playing accordingly. This important cricketing skill needs nourishing in their new young batting star, Stephen Fleming. He is a stylish left-hander, particularly strong on the leg side, but at only 21 years old he may soon get tired of being compared to Crowe. His height sometimes rescues him from the comparison by giving the impression that he is too big for the crease. He uses a crouched stance but I reckon that increases the risk of lbw. However, he did well in getting 54 in the first innings at Trent Bridge and I look forward to watching him again. Fleming is one of many young players on this tour who will go back with his cricket enriched, if captain Ken Rutherford can keep up spirits. Looking for Hart, I walked straight past a doorman at the Chelmsford pavilion, but when I reached the balcony I was stopped while someone went to get Rutherford and Crowe. When I said it was Hart I wanted, there was general amusement, especially on the part of Crowe, but he was glad to be spared another interview. Rutherford was already at one, while everyone waited for the rain to fade. They are the leading lights of a friendly team with its focus on the future, made up largely of young players, such as Hart and Fleming, who have not yet learnt to be world-weary. It is a pleasant change to see umpires give decisions in good humour, exchanging smiles with New Zealanders who are not exciting but are working sensibly and cheerfully. Some of South Africa's young batsmen, by contrast, are said to be very exciting and they have novelty value on their side. Or perhaps one should say refreshment; South Africa have not been in England since the abandoned tour of 1968. Either way, I am sure it is good for cricket to have South Africa back on the international circuit. Apart from all the worthier reasons, it makes a change.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Observer: Evasive action Earlier this year Andy Allan, chief executive of Carlton UK Television, raised eyebrows by refusing to let MPs see an untransmitted investigation into controversial parliamentary lobbyists Ian Greer Associates and then abandoning the programme. Allan is out of luck again, this time over footage of MP David Mellor. Mellor was to feature in another programme as an example of an MP with considerable extra-parliamentary interests. Allan has supported Carlton TV managing director Paul Jackson's decision not to use footage which Mellor feared might depict him as 'shifty and evasive'. The programme-makers threatened to leave a 30-second black hole where Mellor would have appeared. But Independent Television's network centre  - has refused to broadcast a programme with a hole in it. Carlton TV has now decided to show old footage of Mellor in the House of Commons. The programme-makers are still sulking and threatening to have their names removed.</p>

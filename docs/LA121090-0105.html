			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> HOMEOWNERS GROUP SPLITS ON POLITICS  </P> <P> North Laguna Beach residents dissatisfied with their homeowners association  have formed a new community group.  </P> <P> The disgruntled homeowners say they object, in part, to the North Laguna  Community Assn. board members' attempt to politicize neighborhood affairs  through endorsements of local candidates seeking public offices. The  controversy has simmered in north Laguna for the past year, residents say.  </P> <P> Three candidates in last month's City Council race were from north Laguna, and  association President Don Black has been a council candidate in the past.  </P> <P> Ben Blount and Louis Garfin, president and vice president of the splinter  group, resigned from the North Laguna Community Assn. board in April. Blount  said he stepped down when the board voted to mail ballots to homeowners seeking  approval for candidate endorsements just weeks after endorsements were rejected  by the general membership.  </P> <P> Blount said residents decided to form a separate group after the board refused  to release the homeowners association's membership list. The dissatisfied  residents had hoped to use the list for a mailing, he said.  </P> <P> Black said the board attempted to satisfy grievances of the residents but was  justified in not relinquishing the membership list.  </P> <P> "I think it's fine if they wish to do that," Black said of the new group's  formation. "But I don't think they should do it on the coattails of an  organization that's been around for 25 years."  </P> <P> Blount said he believes that allowing an association to make an endorsement  when individual residents may have varying opinions about candidates "just  divides the community right down the middle."  </P> <P> In a statement released Thursday, Bobbie Minkin, former mayor and a vice  president of the splinter group, said the original homeowners association has  "tried to ram politics down the throats of north Lagunans instead of offering  solutions to neighborhood problems. We feel the North Laguna Community Assn.  board has lost credibility with its membership, residents and the City  Council."  </P> <P> Association board member William Buckley said that the residents' decision to  form a separate group is "a very satisfactory thing" and that he is not worried  about having another association within the community.  </P> <P> Several other Laguna Beach homeowners associations endorse local candidates,  including the Top of the World and Temple Hills neighborhood associations, he  said.

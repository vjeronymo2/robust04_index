			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Markets: Within striking distance of 4,000 - Wall Street Next stop 4,000? The Dow Jones industrial average seems within striking distance of this psychological marker as it continues its record-breaking rally, in spite of a pause for breath at the start of this week. The main reason: further evidence that while the economy is growing strongly, inflation remains subdued, which should alleviate pressures for an early tightening of credit. This benign combination was underlined yesterday morning with the release of GDP figures for the fourth quarter of 1993, showing the economy growing at an annual rate of 5.9 per cent, ahead of Wall Street forecasts, pitched at around 5.2 per cent. However, the bond market, which usually fears strong growth, took the GDP figures in its stride because they were accompanied by statistics showing lower-than-expected inflation. In addition, economists do not expect the fourth quarter growth rate, which was boosted by special factors, to be sustained in the first quarter of this year, particularly in view of the severe winter weather which has hit the east of the US and the Los Angeles earthquake. Stock markets, which paused on Monday and Tuesday after the previous week's strong run, resumed their upward advance on Wednesday, buoyed by a rally in the Dow Jones Utility Average, which some regard as a leading indicator of interest rate trends. The bullish tone was underpinned by yesterday's figures, and at lunchtime the Dow stood at 3,943.74, up 17.44 on the day and 29.26 on the week. Interest-rate sensitive stocks, such as banks and insurance companies, which have suffered recently because of fears of tightening credit, rallied in the second half of the week on the back of the better bond market sentiment. And bank stocks were further enlivened on Friday when California-based BankAmerica, the largest bank on the West Coast and the second-largest in the US, announced a Dollars 1.9bn bid for Continental Bank, the Chicago-based wholesale group which specialises in corporate lending. The takeover, the latest in a long-term consolidation of the US banking industry, is the first big move by BankAmerica to diversify geographically from its west coast base, and the acquisition will make it a substantial presence in the economically buoyant midwest. For Continental, the bid represents a final chapter in its recovery from the dark days of 1984, when the bank had to be rescued by Federal authorities from near collapse. Hopes of sustained economic growth have also given a fillip over the past week to companies in cyclical sectors, whose fortunes tend to follow those of the economic cycle. The movement has been reinforced by encouraging fourth quarter results from some leading capital and intermediate goods manufacturers. Shares in Caterpillar, the heavy plant and machinery maker, have performed strongly since the group reported good figures on January 21, and the stock got a further boost with Thursday's news that US durable goods orders rose 2.2 per cent in December, the fifth consecutive monthly advance. A good run of results from steel-makers, buoyed by strong demand from car manufacturers and construction companies, continued this week with better-than-expected figures from Bethlehem Steel, the second largest company in the sector, which forecast a further improvement in demand through 1994. However, International Business Machines cast gloom over the market on Tuesday when it reported fourth quarter earnings which were lower than forecast, and an unexpected decline in sales. IBM did manage to get back into the black - its first quarterly profit in more than a year - but the figures showed just how far Lou Gerstner, now coming up to his first anniversary as chairman, still has to go to restore the business to robust financial health. IBM's sales of mainframe computers, on which it remains highly dependent, fell 30 per cent in the quarter, which more than offset a 35 per cent surge in sales of lower-margin personal computers and a 4 per cent increase in workstation sales. Jerome York, IBM's chief financial officer, has been slashing the company's bloated cost base, taking Dollars 2.8bn out of expenses in 1993. He plans a further Dollars 3bn cut this year, which may be enough to offset falling profits from mainframes. His forecast that the company will break-even in the first quarter helped stabilise IBM stock after a tumble early on Tuesday morning. As York told analysts: 'This ain't a candy store on Main Street, and it won't be turned around in one or two quarters.'  ------------------------------ Monday     3912.79  -  01.69 Tuesday    3895.34  -  17.45 Wednesday  3908.00  +  12.66 Thursday   3926.30  +  18.30 Friday     3945.43  +  19.13  ------------------------------</p>

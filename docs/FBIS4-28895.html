On his return to Phnom Penh he said that "foreign military  aid to the government army to fight Khmer Rouge rebels will  bring stability but will not affect the peace process in the  country."    In the meantime, Prince Norodom Sirivut attended the 11th  conference of nonaligned countries, held from 31 May to 3 June,  in Cairo (Egypt). During his stay in France he specified that  he had asked for French aid for the Cambodian Army. "When we  asked for military assistance, it was not that we wanted to  aggravate the situation; we want stability," added Prince  Norodom Sirivut.    Australia, France, and the United States are discussing the  request to train and equip some 160,000 government combatants.  The Khmer Rouge have vigorously condemned all foreign aid.    Prince Norodom Sirivut reaffirmed that the royal government  does not however want to continue the war against the rebels.  According to him, the government and Cambodia's king, His  Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, are trying to bring the guerrillas  into the national community.    Cambodia's chief diplomat also pointed out that he has  received a 10-point proposal from the Thai Army aimed at  settling border problems between the two countries.    "I am very happy to hear about this proposal from the Thai  Army; it is a good proposal; I appreciate it," said the prince  without giving further details.</p>

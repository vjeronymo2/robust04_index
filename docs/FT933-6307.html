			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Shorco declines to Pounds 80,000 Profits of Shorco Group Holdings fell from Pounds 105,000 to Pounds 80,000 pre-tax for the half year to end-June. Turnover declined by Pounds 224,000 to Pounds 3.33m. A same-again interim dividend of 2.4p is being paid from earnings per share of 1.7p (2.3p). The USM-quoted company has interests in trench support systems and allied equipment and trades almost exclusively within the construction sec-tor. The directors said that although the UK economy as a whole was believed to be showing signs of improvement, the level of activity of the construction sector had 'so far shown little change.' Margins were expected to continue under pressure.</p>

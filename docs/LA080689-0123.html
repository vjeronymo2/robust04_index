			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROWING;  </P> <P> THEIR OWN;  </P> <P> WESTSIDERS PLANT, HOE AND WEED IN COMMUNITY GARDENS; IN RETURN THEY REAP FRESH  PRODUCE, FLOWERS AND SOMETHING EVEN BETTER: PEACE AND QUIET  </P> <P> Surrounded by a housing project, perched below a historic mansion, across a  hillside overlooking Santa Monica Airport or on a busy street opposite a  massage school, patches of earth burst forth with six-foot-tall corn and  scarlet tomatoes, and the sweet smell of roses and herbs fills the air.  </P> <P> They're the product and the pride of their fastidious caretakers, Westside  residents who come to stoop over them, tug at weeds, and churn the soil with  hoes and rakes.  </P> <P> The parcels are community gardens, managed by cities and by nonprofit groups.  For several hours a week of weeding and watering and for a low fee or no fee at  all, they provide their gardeners fresh produce year-round, savings on grocery  bills, and respite from the stress of living and working in a metropolis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Biggest Bargain'  </P> <P> "It's the biggest bargain in the world," said Herschel Burke Gilbert, president  of Metropolitan Neighborhood Gardens and Farms Inc. (Metro Farms), a nonprofit  group that oversees four gardens on the Westside and 11 elsewhere in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> "I read a lot of things all week long which are kind of sad -- so I have to get  away from it," Mickey Engle, a medical records clerk and doctor's assistant,  said on a recent Saturday at Ocean View Farms in Mar Vista. She was wearing  soil-stained white tennis shoes and a straw hat, and a grapefruit-size tomato  was perched on her fence. Gardening on Saturdays and one night during the week  "gives me therapy, away from all those sick people," she said.  </P> <P> Santa Monica and Culver City operate gardens on city land, and West Hollywood  leases a plot from a private landowner. Metro Farms and the Common Ground  Garden Program, another nonprofit group, lease public and private land.  </P> <P> In most cases, the leased land is obtained for free, but the property owners  benefit because the lessees provide liability insurance, trash collection and  weed control, said Rachel Surls, community outreach coordinator of Common  Ground, a 12-year-old program of the University of California Cooperative  Extension that starts gardens in low-income neighborhoods. It sponsors one  garden on Crenshaw Boulevard and one in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project.  </P> <P> If landowners have vacant lots they plan to keep vacant for a while, "they'll  save some money on it, and it's good community relations," Surls said. "It's  going to turn probably from a trashy, vermin-infested lot with kids hanging out  . . . into something beautiful and nice for the community."  </P> <P> Among the gardens affiliated with Metro Farms are Ocean View and one in Wattles  Gardens Park in the Hollywood Hills, below Wattles Mansion and surrounded by  avocado trees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Victory Gardens'  </P> <P> Community gardens have roots going back to at least World War I, and sprang up  again in World War II, when food was in short supply and the federal government  urged citizens to grow their own vegetables in "victory gardens." The  Department of Agriculture and the Office of Civilian Defense published such  manuals as "A Victory Gardener's Handbook on Insects and Diseases."  </P> <P> Communal gardens were in style in the 1970s because of the environmental  movement and the "back-to-the-land feelings people had," Surls said. Now, she  said, they are cropping up once more because gardening is popular and people  fear pesticides on their produce. There are at least 50 community gardens in  Los Angeles County, she said.  </P> <P> "It's much better and healthier" knowing how your vegetables grow, said  Rosemary Channel, 30, pointing to her frilly, bright green lettuce at the Mar  Vista Gardens housing project.  </P> <P> The plots are also in demand by apartment and condominium dwellers. Culver  City's garden, wedged between office bungalows for the Veterans of Foreign Wars  and the Boy Scouts, accommodates "a lot of condo owners who have lost a place  to dig," said Carolyn Cole, Culver City's secretary of community services.  </P> <P> As a result, waiting lists have sprouted up at many gardens, with 15 people and  more -- who should expect to wait anywhere from a few months to more than a  year, officials said. Santa Monica has about 50 people waiting each year for  the $18-a-year, 18-by-20-foot plots on Main Street and on Park Drive near  Broadway, said Ramona Cicciarelli, who supervises the gardens. The wait can be  as much as three to four years, she said.  </P> <P> Some gardens, such as those in West Hollywood and at Mar Vista Gardens, charge  the gardeners nothing, but most collect an annual fee of around $20 to cover  trash collection, water, insurance and tools.  </P> <P> The gardens come with their own sets of rules, such as limits on fences and  pesticides, requirements on upkeep, and prohibitions on selling produce.  </P> <P> At West Hollywood's triangular garden at San Vicente Boulevard and Norwich  Drive, pumpkins and marijuana are forbidden, said garden manager Kamish Blume.  "Pumpkins, because the city considers them an attractive nuisance -- kids jump  over the fence and try to steal them. And marijuana, because it's illegal," she  explained.  </P> <P> Many of the green thumbs say they didn't start that way. "The first year up  here was hysterical," recalled Barbara Schoenwetter, who has tilled at Ocean  View since the seven-acre hillside at Centinela and Rose avenues opened 12  years ago. "Everyone had a book -- 'How to Plant Vegetables.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Accomplished Something'  </P> <P> Carolyn Craig, who lives in the Mar Vista Gardens project, grew up in North  Carolina, where her mother had a bountiful garden. But to her, "getting up in  the hot sun in summer to pick vegetables, and then (having) to can all night  long" was unappealing.  </P> <P> But Craig, 33, watched last summer when part of the project's trampled lawn was  dug up to make way for 10 garden beds, and on the spur of the moment, she  signed up. Now, she is a convert: "You get the thrill of seeing the first  cucumber or tomato come out. You feel you've accomplished something."  </P> <P> The gardeners say they're learning by trial and error. "Whatever we want, we  plant it -- and it if doesn't come up, we know it's not the season," quipped  Craig's neighbor, Valita Robinson.  </P> <P> But grapefruit-size tomatoes, zucchini as big as your arm and fragrant roses  such as Mr. Lincolns don't just happen. "Spiritually, it's rewarding to grow,  but it's a lot of work," said Eleanor Flannery, 37, an office worker who spends  more than 10 hours a week at Ocean View tending her summer eggplant, tomatoes  and carrots. The payoff, she said, is the joy of sending tomatoes to her mother  in Philadelphia and to friends in Denver.  </P> <P> Mark Channel, 33, a soft-spoken Mar Vista Gardens resident who belonged to a  gang in high school, said that his patch of collards, beets, turnips and  watermelon -- and his job at a supermarket -- "keep me out of trouble."  </P> <P> "It's a good hobby," he said.  </P> <P> The gardens have blossomed from mere tracts of dirt and mulch into social  centers. The gardening mothers at the housing project come out of the  concrete-and-stucco apartment blocks to sit on the wooden edges of the beds,  chat and swap vegetables. Their children come to play with ladybugs and hose  the cucumbers and tomatoes and one another. At Ocean View, people showcase  their produce at monthly potlucks on the hillside.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Own Governments  </P> <P> Ocean View and other gardens have developed their own governments. The 500-plot  Ocean View has an elected board of directors, representatives for different  sections of the hill, and a system for settling arguments about shade or  leaning fences. Mailboxes, a bulletin board and a newsletter are needed to keep  its gardeners informed.  </P> <P> Scattered over the Westside as they are, the gardens reflect their gardeners.  In the Crenshaw Boulevard garden managed by Common Ground are several rows of  do ra ji, a bitter Korean root smaller than a carrot that is used in soups and  salads. Nearby is a "black heritage" plot, in which Sherl Hopkins, Common  Ground demonstration projects coordinator, pointed out sweet potatoes, okra,  corn, sorghum, black-eyed peas, beets and several varieties of squash.  </P> <P> At Ocean View, eggplant is popular. Quince and loquat trees, raspberries,  several varieties of roses, dill and majestic red cannas dot other parts of the  tract.  </P> <P> Then there are those who plant neither vegetables nor flowers. At Santa  Monica's Main Street garden, across the street from a massage school and a  French bakery, Klaus Rinke has devoted two plots to pots of cacti of all shapes  and sizes. Rinke, who was admiring his estimated 500 plants on a weekday  evening recently, said he buys pastry at the bakery every morning and then  breakfasts among his cacti, some of which tower 10 feet tall. He returns in the  evening as the sun goes down.  </P> <P> A sculptor from Germany, Rinke, 50, said he likes cacti "because they're like  sculpture."  </P> <P> The gardens reflect their locales in other ways. At Ocean View, the biggest  problem seems to be gophers. "You can watch a tomato plant or a cabbage just  disappear from the ground," said garden master Jerry Elliott. When they  devoured her yellow wax beans, gardener Mickey Engle said, "I almost cried."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, at Mar Vista Gardens, Robinson lamented the recent murder of the  homemade scarecrow by gang members. They lifted it from its seven-foot-tall  stake, "beat it to death" and spray-painted gang names across its chest, she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pilfering a Problem  </P> <P> Pilfering, either by outsiders or other gardeners, is an occasional problem  everywhere, but for all the troubles, the gardeners say the flavorful produce  alone makes the effort worthwhile.  </P> <P> Robinson, for example, was plucking mustard greens as she devised a menu: "Cook  them with some salt pork, with salt and pepper, and onions. Let them cook down,  make some corn bread, and you can have a barbecue!"  </P> <P> As she picked, a burly youth sauntered past the project's garden, gestured to  the foot-and-a-half-long cucumbers Carolyn Craig was holding, and said: "Excuse  me -- you grew that here? That's good!"  </P> <P> "People didn't think anything could grow -- (the garden is) by a playground, by  the sidewalk, and people just walk up and down," Robinson said.  </P> <P> Robinson has planted onions, greens, spinach, cabbage, green beans, cucumbers,  carrots, garlic and basil. "When we have company, we show it off," she said.  She estimated that the garden saves her household about $80 a month in  groceries.  </P> <P> And even the children have become fans of gardening. "I plant things, clean up,  help pick up the papers," said Robinson's niece, Tiffany Beasley, 10, who added  that watering was the most fun. She insisted that she likes spinach, lettuce  and cucumbers, and that the taste is far superior to store-bought produce.  </P> <P> Mark Channel Jr., 9, concurred, calling store vegetables "nasty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Haven for Souls  </P> <P> Most of all, the gardens are a haven for tension-filled, smog-choked souls. At  Ocean View, Elliott and Bob Eckert, lunching under umbrellas on a recent  Saturday, were surrounded by roses, casaba gourds, eucalyptus- and mint-scented  geraniums and squiggly, purplish ornamental kale in their plot at the top of  the hill. The talk was of gophers. Cornstalks and cannas nearby waved in the  breeze. "In the middle of a city like L.A., you've got this real wild world  here," said Eckert, a Culver City condominium dweller and head of acquisitions  at the UCLA library.  </P> <P> "You go out in the garden and get peace and quiet," said Robinson at the Mar  Vista housing project. "You don't get peace and quiet when you have eight kids  in the house."  </P> <P> To her, the garden is comforting, convenient and near-perfect. "If we're making  tacos, we just go out and get tomatoes," she said. "I wish I could grow cheese  and chickens out there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMUNITY GARDENS  </P> <P> Here are major community gardens on the Westside and where to call for more  information. Some, such as the West Hollywood and Mar Vista gardens, charge  nothing to gardeners, but most collect an annual fee of about $20 to cover  trash collection, water, insurance and tools.  </P> <P> LOS ANGELES  </P> <P>  Common Ground Garden Program: Rachel Surls, community outreach coordinator,  </P> <P> (213) 744-4341.  </P> <P>  Crenshaw Garden, 1423 Crenshaw Blvd., near Pico Boulevard. 32 plots.  </P> <P> Mar Vista Gardens housing project, Braddock and Marionwood Drives. 10 plots.  </P> <P> LaSalle Garden, 1467 W. 38th Place, near Denker Avenue.  </P> <P> 8 plots.  </P> <P>  Metropolitan Neighborhood Gardens and Farms Inc.: Herschel Burke Gilbert,  president,  </P> <P> (213) 876-6040, or individual  </P> <P> garden leaders.  </P> <P>  Ocean View Farms, Centinela and Rose avenues. 500 plots.

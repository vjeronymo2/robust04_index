			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Retail side behind 74% fall at Blacks BLACKS LEISURE, the camping goods and sportswear company, reported a 74 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to August 29 after its retail division incurred its first ever loss. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 580,000 on sales ahead to Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 33.8m). The interim dividend is cut to 0.75p (1.1p), payable from earnings of 1.68p (6.41p) per share. Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said the decision reflected uncertain expectations of the second half. The company intends to maintain the dividend at its new level. The shares, which have slid slowly from a peak of 130p last November, yesterday fell another 7p to 32p. A lack of consumer confidence and competitive price cutting adversely affected the retail operation which incurred a deficit before interest and tax of Pounds 89,000 compared with profits of Pounds 1.1m. The outcome included an exceptional profit of Pounds 185,000 related to the sale of the High Wycombe site. Mr Bentley warned that the effective devaluation of sterling would make things worse because the division imports much of its sports footwear. The distribution operation saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.35m to Pounds 1.72m. Mr Bentley said the decline in consumer spending was mainly responsible for the fall. S Eker, the textile converting and merchanting operation, was closed and shown as an extraordinary charge of Pounds 8.8m, including Pounds 7.7m of goodwill already written off. Gearing fell from 37 per cent to 31 per cent.</p>

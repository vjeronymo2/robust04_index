In the ruling, the U.S. 2nd  Circuit Court of Appeals denied a motion by lawyers for more than 1,000  asbestos victims to stop the efforts by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein, who  has indicated that he wants the Manville trust to be converted into a national  fund to pay claims against the less financially secure defendants.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's peacekeeping forces in the hotspots of the  CIS could not be replaced by UN subunits. This opinion was  expressed in a RIA interview by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.  The reason he gave for this is that the international community  does not have the funds to deploy a new peacekeeping operation.  Moreover, there will hardly be many wishing to leave for the  conflict zones on the territory of the former USSR, the minister  said. He believes that only UN observers could be present in  the hotspots of the CIS, the more so as, he believes, it is the  Russian Army that the majority of CIS members would like to see  as peacekeeper on their territories.    Touching on the presence of Russian subunits within the UN  peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia, Pavel Grachev said  the United Nations has requested Russia to increase its  contingent. However, in view of the latest events in Bosnia, the  Defense Ministry will have to discuss this matter in detail, the  head of the Russian military said.</p>

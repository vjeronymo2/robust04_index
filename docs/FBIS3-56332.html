Volunteers From Among Russian Cossacks Do the  Fighting in the Former Yugoslavia"]    [Text] A delegation of the Republic of Serbian Krajina  under foreign minister Slobodan Jarcevic visited Moscow at the  invitation of the joint staff of Russia's Cossack troops. The  republic and the Cossacks Union of Russia signed an agreement on  cooperation in providing humanitarian aid to Serbian Krajina,  and exchanging cultural and sports delegations. They also plan  to engage in joint publishing activity. In the near future,  wounded Serb soldiers will be rehabilitated in guest houses and  sanatoriums on Cossack lands in Russia.    "What remains in the current situation is for the Serbs to  rely on support from their Russian brothers," Mr. Jarcevic said.  "The Islamic world stands behind the Bosnian Muslims, the  Croats rely on support from the Catholics, and the Orthodox are  historically destined to be friends with Russia." The minister  said he highly appreciated the assistance provided by Russian  volunteers to Serbian Krajina's army, although, in his view, it  was primarily moral in nature. The number of volunteers from  Russia, Bulgaria, and Romania remains very small. According to  Ivan Chernikov, commander of Cossack troops and minister of  economic and cultural ties in the Cossacks Union of Russia, as  of today there are a few Cossack units of no more than 10 men  each fighting in the former Yugoslavia. "If a Cossack goes to  war, the commander cannot ban him from doing so," he said.    The Russian Federation Foreign Ministry learned about the  foreign guests' visit from the mass media. Staffers from the  European Department, to whom your SEGODNYA correspondent turned  for comment, said only that the Republic of Serbian Krajina does  not have an official status and that the same applies to any  agreements signed with it. The Russian Foreign Ministry has not  received any requests in that regard from either side, nor did  they have any consultations on the subject.</p>

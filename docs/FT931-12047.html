			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Markets: Societies head for messy compromise - Serious Money THE BASE rate cut this week might have marked a turning point. Savers, rather like the cast of the film Network, are starting to yell: 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more.' Building societies, which welcomed all previous cuts with enthusiasm, were distinctly lukewarm about the fall to 6 per cent. Their concern is understandable. In five of the 12 months of 1992, they had suffered an outflow of savers' funds. More cuts will only worsen the trend. Of course, part of the rationale behind the base rate cut is to encourage people to stop saving and start spending their money on consumer goods, thereby reviving the economy. That is all very well for those in employment. But it is not an option for those (mostly retired) people who are living off their savings. Since 1990, base rates have fallen from 15 to 6 per cent; for many savers, this will have meant a cut in income of 60 per cent. To make matters worse, although the rate of inflation has been falling, prices have continued to rise. What can societies do? They are entitled to a certain amount of sympathy. The housing market is depressed and the bad debt problem remains horrendous. If they fail to turn base rate cuts into lower mortgage rates, they will attract the outrage of home-owners and the press. It looks as if the societies are attempting a messy compromise. Mortgage rates have come down by around half a percentage point, to 7.99 per cent, with suspicious unanimity in a supposedly competitive market. Savings rates details will emerge only next week (which means our Highest Rates table on page IV is particularly subject to change). The societies will protect their biggest savers - perhaps with only a half-point cut. But if you have a small sum on instant access, you might find the return is now very low indeed. The chances are that this compromise will satisfy neither savers nor borrowers. Criticism may well focus on one particular point - why do societies make a profit? They are mutual societies, after all, supposedly run for their members' benefit. Surely, in such straitened times, they should let their profits take the strain by squeezing their margins? The flaw in this argument is that the societies' desire for profit has in part been fuelled by the regulators. They have been quick to deliver any small society which dips into loss into the hands of one of the top 10. Even if the Treasury and the Building Society Commission made it clear that profits were no longer the be-all and end-all, that might not help. The money markets would react adversely to poor profit figures from a society - and force up the cost of its borrowings. Even worse, depositors might take fright and withdraw their savings. So, what is the consumer to do? Borrowers should consider that mortgage rates may well have fallen as far as they are likely to go; the next base rate cut might see mortgage rates drop only a quarter of a percentage point. That makes the argument for fixing rates at present levels compelling (although you should watch out for onerous conditions). Savers are faced with some difficult choices. They will need to keep on their toes and not allow their money to rot in an uncompetitive account. Tax efficiency is vital. Do both spouses use their full personal allowances, for example? Some people reject Tessas because they think that they lock up their money for five years. But, provided the scheme has no penalties, all that happens if you withdraw money early is that you pay tax; if you leave your money in a society, you will do that, anyway. What is more, most Tessas pay higher rates than other savings accounts. Realism also is needed, according to David Harris, of Chantrey Vellacott; savers simply cannot expect the returns they got 12 or 18 months ago. So, beware of plans that offer a very high income, as they probably involve a significant risk to capital. A rule of thumb is to look at yields on long-dated gilts which are now between 8.5 and 9 per cent. Any product yielding above that level must involve risk. Gilts are worth considering, but care is needed. Many are trading above face value; thus, you are locking in a long-term capital loss. You can also make a loss in the short term if gilt prices fall. The best way of buying gilts, therefore, is to think only of the yield and hold the bonds till maturity. Harris says bond funds may now be better than holding gilts directly. There are low-charging funds, such as Abtrust Gilt Income, which has no initial charge and yields 9 per cent; or the Murray Global, which has an initial charge of only 1 per cent and yields 7.4 per cent (although this has an element of currency risk). Finally, equities. As I argued last week, this is not the time to stake your all in shares. But as the BZW study shows (see page IV), they are the best long-run investment. Yields of 4.4 per cent are comparable with returns on instant access accounts. A regular savings plan is a good way to get the best out of shares while reducing the risk of plunging in at the top of the market.</p>

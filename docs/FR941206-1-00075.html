			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the rule pursuant to section 112(g) is still in the proposal stage, any changes made to the proposed rule upon its becoming final that affect the wood furniture NESHAP will be made before the wood furniture NESHAP is promulgated. For example, if any VHAP of potential concern changes in its hazard ranking categorization (e.g., a VHAP is recategorized from the high concern list to the threshold list) or if information used to determine the exposure level associated with either a one-per-million cancer risk or an ``ample margin of safety'' for noncancer effects changes the de minimis value, these changes will also be made to the formulation assessment plan in the wood <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  furniture NESHAP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formulation assessment plan is beneficial to the industry in that its inclusion in the MACT standard and potential impact on emissions of VHAP of potential concern may reduce health risk to the extent that it would alleviate the need for additional risk-based Federal air toxics standards to be promulgated for this industry. Section 112(f) of the Clean Air Act specifies that additional standards may be required for a source category even after a MACT standard is promulgated. In particular, under section 112(f), EPA is required to promulgate an additional emission standard for a source category within 8 years after promulgation of the MACT standard depending on the risk remaining to the most exposed individual or to prevent an adverse environmental effect. An additional standard would be required if the MACT standard for a source category that emits a pollutant classified as a known, probable, or possible human carcinogen does not reduce lifetime excess cancer risks to the individual most exposed to emissions from a source in the category to less than one-in-a-million. Because the formulation assessment plan of the MACT standard deals with the volatile HAP which likely cause such a risk or other adverse environmental effects upfront and in the MACT standard, it provides a possibility that the industry would not be subject to future Federal risk-based standards under section 112(f).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cleaning and Washoff Operations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As discussed in section II, cleaning operations that occur at wood furniture manufacturing operations include cleaning of spray guns, lines conveying solvent, finishing materials and adhesives from storage to the spray guns, and spray booths. In evaluating work practices that could be implemented to reduce emissions from cleaning and washoff operations, the Committee considered work practices already in use by some facilities in the source category. In addition, the Work Practice Work Group explored options used by other industries, in particular, the use of alternate cleaning materials with lower vapor pressure or HAP content. This option was rejected because it limited the source's ability to reuse the cleaning materials elsewhere, such as for thinning finishing materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

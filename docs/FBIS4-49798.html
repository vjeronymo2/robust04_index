			<p>Fujian   <F P=102>   OW1105040694 Beijing XINHUA in English 0316 GMT 11 May 94 </F> <F P=103> OW1105040694 </F> <F P=104>  Beijing XINHUA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Fuzhou, May 11 (XINHUA) -- This capital of  southeast China's Fujian Province has made remarkable headway in  improving its old urban districts with overseas investment.    A local official said that the city government had approved  the establishment of 310 overseas-funded companies engaged in  real estate business by the end of last year.    These companies had a combined investment of 2.5 billion  U.S.  dollars, including contractual overseas funds totalling 2.2  billion U.S. dollars.    The city has already leased out 442.3 ha [hectare] of land  and approved 134 overseas-funded real estate projects.    So far, construction of projects with a total floor space of  3.5 million sq m and accounting for 60.7 percent of the city's  target are proceeding well and some have been completed.    The official attributed the progress to the city  government's  policy of unified planning and transforming stretches of old  districts; and leasing the land-use rights through public  bidding while positively improving investment conditions.    The city government has also simplified formalities and  improved services for overseas business people.</p>

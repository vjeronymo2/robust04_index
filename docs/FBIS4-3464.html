			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of report on the implementation of Jiangsu's </F> 1993 budget and the draft 1994 budget by Shi Xuedao, director of  the Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department]    [Text] 1. Implementation of the Budget for 1993    In 1993, people throughout Jiangsu, under the direct  leadership of the provincial party committee, studied in depth  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important talks during his southern  inspection tour along with the 14th CPC National Congress  guidelines on seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening  up wider, strengthening and improving macroeconomic regulation  and control, readjusting economic structure, accelerating  scientific and technological progress, and raising economic  efficiency, thereby promoting rapid and sound development of the  economy. Finance and taxation departments at all levels in  Jiangsu earnestly consolidated financial and taxation order,  reinforced financial and economic discipline, improved the  collection and management of tax revenue, promoted financial and  tax reform, and made energetic efforts to ensure revenue,  thereby overfulfilling the task of revenue. They also actively  allocated funds for various financial expenditures and basically  ensured funds needed for economic construction and development  of social undertakings in Jiangsu.    The revenue budget deliberated and approved by the first  session of the eighth provincial people's congress was 16.435  billion yuan. According to preliminary statistics, total revenue  came to 22.13 billion yuan, or 134.65 percent of the budgeted  figure. The state's decision to raise the business tax rate by  two percentage points added 192 million yuan to Jiangsu's  revenue budget. In the second half of the year, the state  tasked the province to strive to overfulfill the budgeted  revenue by 1.8 billion yuan. As a result of these adjustments,  the budgeted revenue was 18.427 billion yuan. Thus, 1993 revenue  amounted to 120.1 percent of the adjusted budgeted figure, up  6.899 billion yuan or 45.3 percent from the previous year. The  big growth in Jiangsu's revenue in 1993 can be attributed  primarily to the following factors: First, rapid economic  growth and thriving markets brought about increased revenue.  Second, we earnestly implemented the central authorities' No. 6  document and the guidelines of the national financial work  conference and resolutely curbed tax reductions and exemptions  for taxpayers in temporary difficulty and the contracting of  turnover tax, thereby conspicuously reducing revenue losses.  Third, we strengthened tax collection and management of  individual industrial and commercial units by launching a  general taxation and accounting inspection, thereby increasing  revenue. Fourth, implementation of the state policy to hike the  business tax rate also resulted in increased revenue. Moreover,  because of natural disasters in 1991, base figures for Jiangsu's  revenue for 1992 were low, resulting in a relatively big rise in  the 1993 revenue.    Of the total revenue, tax receipts came to 22.005 billion  yuan, 122.67 percent of the adjusted budgeted amount, and 7.456  billion yuan or 51.25 percent more than the previous year. Of  these, receipts from industrial and commercial taxes totaled  21.273 billion yuan, 123.63 percent of the adjusted budgeted  amount, and 7.497 billion yuan or 54.42 percent more than the  previous year. Receipts from enterprises were minus 840 million  yuan, as compared to minus 289 million yuan of the previous  year. Revenue from other sources came to 220 million yuan,  116.4 percent of the budgeted amount, and 50 million yuan or  28.96 percent more than the previous year. Revenue from special  projects amounted to 563 million yuan, 116.63 percent of the  budgeted figure, and 57 million yuan or 11.2 percent increase  from the previous year. The portion of the fund for key energy  and communications construction projects retained by the local  government came to 71 million yuan, 50.71 percent of the  budgeted figure, and a decrease of 52 million yuan or 42.38  percent from the previous year. The portion of state budget  regulating fund retained by the local government was 111 million  yuan, 61.67 percent of the budgeted amount, and a decrease of 60  million yuan or 34.87 percent from the previous year.    Budget expenditures for 1993 approved at the first session  of the eighth provincial people's congress amounted to 9.787  billion yuan. After adjustment -- adding funds transferred from  the previous year, special funds appropriated from the central  treasury, funds allocated by local authorities from  overfulfilled budget revenues, and funds transferred from other  sources earmarked for expenditure -- the total budgeted  expenditures came to 18.794 billion yuan. Based on initial  figures, actual expenditures for the year totaled 16.258 billion  yuan, an increase of 3.673 billion yuan, or 29.18 percent, over  the previous year. The relatively large increase in  expenditures was largely due to implementation of the contracted  financial responsibility system, which stipulates that  localities, after fulfilling their contracted financial  responsibilities, may spend more if they get more revenue.  Thus, large increases in local revenue inevitably brought with  them corresponding increases in expenditures. Major  expenditures that registered increases were: investment in  technological transformation of state-owned enterprises and  village and town enterprises; investment in agriculture,  education, science and technology, urban infrastructure, and  social welfare; and subsidies to workers through the increase of  subsidies standards. The major categories of expenditure were  implemented as follows: 1) Expenditure for capital construction  amounted to 955 million yuan, an increase of 234 million yuan or  32.53 percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of  enterprises and for technological transformation amounted to  1.360 billion yuan, an increase of 1.101 billion yuan or 4.25  times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science and  technology amounted to 240 million yuan, an increase of 96  million yuan or 67.07 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of  agriculture and for water conservancy projects related to  agriculture and forestry amounted to 1.798 billion yuan, an  increase of 709 million yuan or 65.11 percent. 5) Expenditure  for urban maintenance and construction amounted to 1.233 billion  yuan, an increase of 540 million yuan or 77.97 percent. 6)  Expenditure for culture, education, science, and public health  amounted to 4.984 billion yuan, an increase of 1.156 billion  yuan or 30.19 percent, of which 3.069 billion yuan were spent on  education, an increase of 738 million yuan or 31.65 percent. 7)  Expenditure for administration, procuratorial, public security,  and judicial undertakings amounted to 2.255 billion yuan, an  increase of 580 million yuan or 34.62 percent. 8) Expenditure  for pensions for the disabled and for families of diseased and  for social welfare and relief amounted to 478 million yuan,  about the same as the previous year. This was largely because  some of the relief funds for 1991 disasters were established in  1992, making the base figures higher for 1993. 9) Expenditure  for price subsidies amounted to 597 million yuan, a decrease of  1.694 billion yuan or 73.95 percent. This was mainly because  the state reduced subsidies to workers for increased grain and  edible oil purchase prices and for price differentials in the  purchase of special grain reserves. In 1993, following the  lifting of controls on grain, edible oil, and coal prices, the  state gave workers appropriate amounts of subsidies. Some of  the subsidies were borne by enterprises, while others were  allocated from the budget.    Generally speaking, the 1993 budget was implemented quite  successfully. It is expected that revenues not only will be  able to cover the year's expenditures, they will also be able to  make up for some of the past deficits, thereby reversing the  perennial deficits registered since 1989.    The 1993 provincial level budget was implemented as follows:    Provincial-level expenditures approved at the first session  of the eighth provincial people's congress totalled 2.047  billion yuan. After adding additional funds transferred from the  previous year's balance and special funds appropriated from the  central treasury and deducting special funds allocated to cities  and counties, the adjusted expenditures totalled 3.040 billion  yuan. According to initial figures, provincial expenditures for  the year were 2.528 billion yuan, a decrease of 1.144 billion  yuan, or 31.16 percent over the previous year. This was largely  because of the reduced subsidies to workers to cover grain and  edible oil price increases and to cover price differentials in  the purchase of special grain reserves. The major categories of  expenditures were as follows: 1) Capital construction totaled  602 million yuan, an increase of 68 million yuan or 12.81  percent. 2) Expenditure for tapping the potential of  enterprises and technological transformation amounted to 82  million yuan spent, a decrease of 19 million yuan or 18.53  percent. The decrease was largely the result of one-time loan  discounts for the technological transformation of large and  medium- sized enterprises made in 1992. If this factor is  excluded from consideration, the budget would have shown an  increase of 6 million yuan or 11.76 percent. 3) Expenditure for  three categories of science and technology amounted to 91  million yuan, an increase of 16 million yuan or 22.01 percent.  4) Expenditure spent in support of agriculture and on water  conservancy projects related to agriculture and forestry  amounted to 217 million yuan, an increase of 49 million yuan or  28.95 percent. 5) Expenditure for culture, education, science,  and public health totaled 673 million yuan, an increase of 128  million yuan or 23.48. 6) Expenditure spent on pensions for the  disabled and families of the diseased and on social welfare and  relief amounted to 15 million yuan, an increase of 1.3 million  yuan or 9.57 percent. 7) Expenditure on administration,  procuratorial, public security, and judicial undertakings  amounted to 159 million yuan, an increase of 24 million yuan or  17.57 percent. 8) price subsidies totaled 324 million yuan, a  decrease of 1.513 billion yuan or 82.35 percent.    The provincial level budget was basically balanced with  some surplus.    To better implement the 1993 budget, we put emphasis on the  following aspects:    (1) Conscientiously carrying out the CPC Central Committee's  policy of strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and  strictly observing the "three rules."    Last year's Central Document No. 6 put forward the policy of  strengthening microeconomic regulation and control and set  precise demands for financial work. Last July, leading cadres  of the State Council put forward three rules: tightening finance  and taxation order, strictly placing tax exemptions and  reductions under control, and strictly controlling financial  deficits. Various localities in Jiangsu vigorously carried out  the guidelines of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council, effectively managed financial matters and tax revenues  according to law, and improved the provincial financial  situation. First, they persisted in managing tax revenues  according to law. In accordance with the CPC Central  Committee's guidelines, governments at all levels and taxation  departments earnestly checked various regulations governing tax  exemptions and reductions and governing the budget regulatory  fund and energy and communications construction funds formulated  by localities themselves. All regulations established without  proper authorization were suspended. Examinations and approvals  of temporary and contingency tax exemptions and reductions were  halted. Second, they continued the general inspection of tax  revenues and financial matters. By the end of last year, the  amount of money found and seized under tax evasion and other  illegal acts reached 626 million yuan. Out of 441 million yuan  to be turned over to the treasury, 417 million yuan, or 94.6  percent, was actually turned over to the treasury. Third, they  intensified their efforts in collecting, managing, and  inspecting tax revenues from individual businessmen. In 1993,  tax revenues from individual businessmen totalled 2.708 billion  yuan, up 973 million yuan or 56.01 percent.    (2) Vigorously raising and allocating funds to support  economic development.    Over the past year, under the leadership of party committees  and governments at the corresponding levels, finance and  taxation departments at all levels tried every possible means to  raise and allocate funds and made vigorous efforts to promote  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the provincial  economy.    To develop industrial production, finance and taxation  departments at all levels, first, vigorously transformed their  functions and created conditions to help enterprises change  their operating mechanisms. Having trained a large number of  qualified personnel and made sufficient preparations, on 1 July,  finance and taxation departments smoothly implemented the  "Enterprise Accounting Norms," the "General Rules for Enterprise  Financial Affairs," and the accounting systems for different  professions. This granted more decision-making power to  enterprises and enabled enterprises to develop on their own.  Second, they promoted technical transformation. The provincial  government allocated 13.9 million yuan to 19 small enterprises  that produce nitrogenous fertilizer and encouraged them to  conduct technological transformation to conserve energy by  changing coal consumption methods. The provincial government  also provided loan discounts worth 25 million yuan to 83 key  technological transformation projects. Third, province  financial institutions continued to increase investment in  production that is in line with the state industrial policy and  structure and in enterprises that produce high technology  products, products with high added-value, exchange-earning  export products, and products in great demand on the market.  Province financial institutions granted these enterprises small  loans worth 155 million yuan. Better economic efficiency was  realized.    In developing agricultural production, governments at all  levels conscientiously carried out various measures promoting  agriculture that were launched by the CPC Central Committee and  the State Council and made efforts to increase agricultural  investment. First, they earnestly implemented the "Agricultural  Law of the PRC" and the "PRC's Law Governing Agrotechnology  Popularization," and increased investment in agriculture.  Second, they rationally adjusted the utilization structure of  funds supporting agriculture and ensured the smooth progress of  key agricultural projects. In the past three years, they  invested 173 million yuan of construction funds through various  channels to quicken the construction of unified seed supply  projects at township level across the province. To promote  infrastructure construction of irrigation, financial  institutions at all levels vigorously collected 400 million yuan  for the flood prevention security fund. Of this, 82 million  yuan was collected by province financial departments. Third, to  continue efforts to develop the economy in poverty-stricken  areas and change their outlook, province financial departments  allocated special aid-to-the-poor funds worth 22.93 million  yuan, supporting a total of 130 economic development projects to  help 61 poor towns, townships, and old revolutionary bases such  as Maoshan and Huangqiao develop their economies.    (3) Increasing input into social undertakings to promote  their development.    In 1993, finance departments at all levels across Jiangsu  energetically raised and allocated funds and made overall and  rational arrangements to promote the development of various  social undertakings. While ensuring regular expenditures,  finance departments allocated funds to help institutions and  units solve a number of outstanding problems. For example, the  provincial government allocated a portion of the fund to poor  counties in northern Jiangsu to pay teachers' salaries; it  allocated 17.6 million yuan to support the construction of  laboratories, specialized departments, and teachers' living  quarters in a number of institutes of higher learning as well as  key research institutes affiliated with the provincial  government; it allocated 11 million yuan and, together with  funds raised by localities through various sources, repaired and  built health clinics for 100 towns and townships in poor areas;  it continued to allocate funds totaling 2.5 million yuan to  improve drinking water in rural areas and, by raising funds in  different sectors, improved drinking water for 2 million rural  residents; it allocated a 6.59 million yuan special fund to  support 25 key projects to fight snail fever in Yangzhong,  Haian, Yixing, and other areas, and completely eliminated snail  fever in three pilot areas of Dantu, Jiangpu, and Hanjiang.  Finance departments at various levels also allocated necessary  funds for housing construction for intellectuals and for sports,  culture, and radio and television facilities.    (4) Launching the anticorruption drive and earnestly  screening wanton collection of fees.    In line with the provincial party committee's plans to fight  corruption, a campaign to screen the wanton collection of fees  was launched throughout the province and achieved interim  results in 1993. According to statistics, 2,266 of the 2,409  fees charged in Jiangsu were abolished through the campaign,  thereby lightening the burdens on enterprises and people in  general and reassuring the public.    Despite achievements in financial work in 1993, quite a few  problems remain. They are reflected largely in the following:  Regulatory capability at the provincial level was relatively  weak; even though expenditures and revenues were balanced for  the fiscal year, a handful of counties (cities) in northern  Jiangsu continued to suffer deficits and were unable to pay  teachers and administrators from time to time; failure to  improve the economic efficiency of some enterprises resulted in  aggravating deficits; and while conducting financial management,  we failed to exercise effective supervision over waste and  extravagance in enterprises.  <H5>  2. The Draft Budget for 1994 </H5>   Financial revenues and expenditures in 1994 will be  affected,  to a certain extent, by the largest number of reform programs  ever to be launched in China this year. As the economy and work  in other fields of endeavor develop, more input from the budget  will be needed for expenditures. Newly increased revenues will  be difficult to satisfy the needs of newly increased  expenditures, and localities will continue to face extremely  tight budgets. In accordance with the guidelines of the 14th  CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th  CPC Central Committee, the guiding principle for the 1994 budget  is: To subordinate to and serve the overall interests -- put  forth by the central authorities -- of "seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  ensuring stability;" to actively implement fiscal and tax reform  to ensure the smooth progress of reform measures; to concentrate  efforts on raising funds and strictly collecting and managing  tax payments; and to strive to strike a balance between revenues  and expenditures by persisting in doing things within the limit  of financial capabilities, improving the management of  expenditures, readjusting their pattern, ensuring key  expenditures, and reducing routine expenditures.    In accordance with the above principles, the objective of  national economic and social development for 1994, as well as  the program for fiscal restructuring toward establishing a tax  assignment system, the 1994 provincial budget is drafted as  follows:    (1) Fiscal revenue budget    Based on the circumstances of economic development in the  province, provincial revenue is projected to grow by 7 percent,  reaching 23.527 billion yuan in 1994, if calculated according to  the parameters before implementation of the tax assignment  system. Calculated according to the parameters after the tax  assignment system is implemented -- i.e. after deducting all the  consumption tax revenue and 75 percent of the value-added tax  revenue to be turned in to central authorities and after  allowing for other adjustment factors -- the 1994 provincial  revenue is budgeted at 0.638 billion yuan, up 9.53 percent over  the corresponding amount calculated the previous year. Various  itemized revenues are budgeted as follows: (I) Tax revenues are  to total 11.476 billion yuan, an increase of 1.165 billion yuan  or 11.3 percent over the previous year. These include  industrial and commercial tax revenues totaling 9.126 billion  yuan, up 924 million yuan or 11.27 percent. (II) Loss subsidies  [bu tie fu shu 5943 6317 6298 2422] to state-owned enterprises  are to total 1.728 billion yuan, up 165 million yuan over the  previous year largely due to a rise in policy-related subsidies  for enterprises' losses. (III) Other incomes are to total 250  million yuan, up 13 million yuan or 5.33 percent from the  previous year. (IV) Income derived from contributions to  special funds is to be 290 million yuan, an increase of 6  million yuan or 1.95 percent over the previous year. (V) Income  derived from contributions to development funds for key energy  and communications projects is to be 30 million yuan, down 41  million yuan or 57.63 percent from the previous year. Income  derived from contributions to the budget regulatory fund is to  be 40 million yuan, down 71 million yuan or 64.1 percent. The  decrease in contributions to these two funds is a result of the  abolition of mandatory contributions by state-owned enterprises  beginning this year. (VI) Income derived from additional fees  for education is to be 280 million yuan, up 19 million yuan or  7.37 percent over the previous year.    (2) Fiscal expenditure budget    After adding to the budgeted fiscal revenue for 1994 the  consumption and value-added taxes to be returned by the central  authorities based on the 1993 base figures and deducting from it  the revenues turned in, according to the original procedures, to  the central authorities in the form of special-fund  contributions or progressive contributions based on the  contracted financial responsibility system, the province's  expendable fund for 1994 comes to 14.6 billion yuan -- an  increase of 4.813 billion yuan or 49.18 percent over the  previous year -- all of which will be allocated to budgeted  expenditures. The 1994 expenditure budget is much larger than  that of 1993 mainly because extra revenue for 1993 was not  included in the fiscal revenue budget formulated at the  beginning of that year, coupled with a certain growth in fiscal  revenue for 1994 itself.    Major expenditures are budgeted as follows:    1) Expenditure for capital construction accounts for 556  million yuan, an increase of 151 million yuan or 37.33 percent  from the previous year's budget. 2) Expenditure for tapping the  potential of enterprises and technological transformation  accounts for 705 million yuan, an increase of 519 million yuan  or 2.79 times. 3) Expenditure for three categories of science  and technology accounts for 149 million yuan, an increase of 55  million yuan or 58.82 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of  agriculture and for water conservancy projects related to  agriculture and forestry accounts for 1.326 billion yuan, an  increase of 448 million yuan or 51.08 percent. 5) Expenditure  for operating industries, communications, and commerce accounts  for 232 million yuan, an increase of 71 million yuan or 44.37  percent. 6) Expenditure for urban maintenance and construction  accounts for 1.148 billion yuan, an increase of 376 million yuan  or 48.61 percent. 7) Expenditure for culture, education,  science, and public health accounts for 5.394 billion yuan, an  increase of 1.389 billion yuan or 34.68 percent, of which 3.843  billion yuan is for education, an increase of 54.1 percent. 8)  Expenditure on pensions for the disabled and for families of the  diseased and for social welfare and relief accounts for 396  million yuan, an increase of 76 million yuan or 23.89 percent.  9) Expenditure for administration, procuratorial, public  security, and judicial undertakings accounts for 1.968 billion  yuan, an increase of 442 million yuan or 28.96 percent. 10)  Expenditure for price subsidies accounts for 253 million yuan,  an increase of 35 million yuan or 15.83 percent.    (3) Provincial-level budget    In 1994, province-level financial resources available for  expenditure stand at 2.460 billion yuan, largely from  province-level revenue and revenue delivered to the provincial  government by various localities. A total of 2.460 billion yuan  is budgeted for province-level expenditures, an increase of 413  million yuan or 20.17 percent over the previous year's budget.  Excluding increased expenditures resulting from wage  adjustments, the budgeted expenditures represent an increase of  14 percent. The provincial budget strikes a balance between  revenue and expenditures. Major expenditures are budgeted as  follows: 1) Capital construction accounts for 306 million yuan,  an increase of 30 million yuan or 10.87 percent over the  previous year's budget. 2) Expenditure for tapping enterprises  potential and technological transformation accounts for 60  million yuan, an increase of 3.58 million yuan or 6.3 percent.  3) Expenditure for three categories of science and technology  accounts for 60 million yuan, an increase of 9.04 million yuan  or 18.06 percent. 4) Expenditure in support of agriculture and  on water conservancy projects related to agriculture and  forestry accounts for 422 million yuan, an increase of 59  million yuan or 16.28 percent. The increase amounts to 19.01  percent if the 10 million yuan for new water conservancy and  capital construction projects is included. 5) Expenditure for  operating industries, communications, and commerce accounts for  115 million yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan or 21.42  percent. 6) Expenditure for culture, education, science, and  public health accounts for 789 million yuan, an increase of 144  million yuan or 22.42 percent, of which expenditure for  education is 385 million yuan, up 27.94 percent. 7) Expenditure  on pensions for the disabled and the family of the diseased and  on social welfare and relief accounts for 47 million yuan, an  increase of 7.15 million yuan or 17.94 percent. 8) Expenditure  on administration, procuratorial, public security, and judicial  undertakings accounts for 176 million yuan, an increase of 30  million yuan or 20.46 percent. 9) Price subsidies total 122  million yuan, an increase of 11 million yuan or 9.4 percent.  10) Reserves account for 60 million yuan, an increase of 9  percent.    3. Deepen Financial and Taxation Reform, Promote  Economic Development, and Strive To Successfully Accomplish the  1994 Budget    1994 is a crucial year for reform and development. To  accomplish and overfulfill the task in implementing this year's  budget, we will work effectively in the following main areas:    (1) Earnestly implement the plan for financial and tax  system reform. Ensuring smooth implementation and achieving the  expected results in financial and tax reform measures is this  year's central task. Therefore, we must do a realistically good  job in the following three aspects. First, we must actively and  firmly promote tax system reform, study and formulate specific  implementation details, as well as establish a tax system and  operating mechanism that corresponds with the demand of  development of the socialist market economy. We must strictly  enforce the new tax law and strengthen tax collection management  to reduce revenue losses for a steady growth in revenue.  Second, we must effectively implement the financial system of  separate tax collections for the province and localities. We  must arouse the enthusiasm of localities and gradually regulate  financial distribution as well as ensure that the province  financial authorities retain certain financial regulation  capabilities at the same time. Further, we will give  appropriate assistance to a small number of localities with  actual difficulties so as to promote coordinated economic  development in various localities. Third, we must do a good job  in reforming the enterprise profit distribution system.  Beginning this year, income tax collected will be based on the  specified uniform tax rates without exceptions, and the contract  method of submitting enterprise profits is abolished. Finance  and taxation departments at all levels must earnestly publicize  and explain this year's three major financial and tax reform  measures, as well as forge a uniform understanding and work for  the overall task to ensure smooth implementation of these  measures.    (2) Impose strict control in tax collection and management  to ensure that the task is accomplished and overfulfilled. As  this is the first year for implementing the new financial and  tax system, there is significant meaning in accomplishing and  overfulfilling this year's task in financial and tax collection.  This is because, first, this is a crucial year for promoting  and achieving key breakthroughs in the reform of China's  economic system. The financial and tax system reform will prove  decisive in various reforms. Financial and tax reform as well  as economic development and social stability must be successful  to accomplish and overfulfill this year's task in revenue  collection. Second, localities must increase their incomes  while maintaining the financial capability that they have  already achieved. Third, because expenditures for this year  have increased, increased revenues are necessary to meet  essential expenditures. Therefore, we must do our utmost to  build up income sources, uphold law enforcement in tax control,  improve the collection and management of taxes, and undertake  vigorous efforts to increase revenues. All localities must  fulfill the task in revenue collection, and those with good  income sources must strive to overfulfill their collections.    (3) Promote economic development. In accordance with the  demand of the provincial economic development plan, we must  uphold the strategic principle of upholding the role of the  foundation of the national economy, stressing industrial  development, and vigorously developing tertiary industry in this  year's task of promoting economic development with financial  capability. First, we must do an active good job in supporting  agricultural undertakings with financial resources. Jiangsu  will increase an investment of 10 million yuan in water  conservancy construction and appropriate spending for other  agricultural undertakings. The entire province must strive to  collect for the agricultural development fund, food risk fund,  anti-flood and security fund, as well as the newly introduced  land value appreciation tax. It is necessary to raise funds by  all means to increase investment in agriculture. The funds  should be invested and utilized in key areas, primarily in  constructing agricultural infrastructures, supporting commodity  grain production, building high-yield cotton growing bases,  implementing comprehensive agricultural development projects,  and developing comprehensive trade, industry, and agricultural  enterprises, as well as constructing agricultural service  systems. It is necessary to effectively develop the "shopping  basket" project to increase non-staple food supply in market and  bring market prices under control.    Second, we must actively experiment in the modern  enterprise system and reform the state-owned enterprise  shareholding system. We must promptly study and handle  financial issues that crop up during the reform process. Third,  we must appropriately increase investment in science and  technology, improve the financial subsidy method, quicken  scientific and technological progress, promote enterprise  product mix and industrial restructuring, assist enterprises in  turning losses into profits, and strive to raise economic  efficiency. Fourth, we must support governments at all levels,  departments, and enterprise units in every possible way in  making full use of their conditions and advantages to vigorously  initiate and develop tertiary industry and in building up local  financial resources. Fifth, we must continue to ensure sound  financial foundations for enterprises and assist enterprises in  developing sound internal financial control systems, as well as  further implement the general financial rules, accounting  principles, and branch accounting system for enterprises.    (4) Implement rational plans for various expenditures and  realistically strengthen spending control. In this year's  budget, it is necessary to implement wage reform for enterprise  units and ensure the funds needed for key spending in  agriculture, science, and education, as well as for the 26  practical projects the Jiangsu government will undertake this  year, apart from imposing strict control over other routine  expenditures. Financial departments at all levels must bring  into play the spirit of arduous struggle and thrift, oppose  extravagance and waste, strive to increase income while reducing  spending, and not draw up budget deficits. We must regulate  funds by ways and means to ensure prompt wage payments for  teachers and grass-roots cadres. In line with the party's basic  policy on organizational reform, we must strive to reduce  staffing, vehicle purchase, and meeting expenses. Enterprise  units should continue to strengthen and perfect various budget  control systems. We should encourage and support these units in  rationally increasing their income within the limit allowed by  policies and laws. Units with capabilities that receive their  entire budgets from the province should gradually transform into  units that receive differential budgets. Units receiving  differential budgets should gradually transform into units that  generate their own income for expenditures. We must further  perfect the multiple forms of budget contract system as well as  strengthen quota control and efficiency evaluation.    (5) Strengthen the management of state assets. This year,  we must continue to formulate effective policies and laws to  strengthen the management of property rights (shareholding  rights) income and prevent the loss of state assets, as well as  ensure that the costs and appreciated value of state assets are  preserved. We must implement plans for gradual inspection and  evaluation of the assets of 800 large and medium-sized state  enterprises as well as regulate the relations between owners of  state assets and enterprise corporations in property ownership.  We must effectively reorganize state assets and the management  of property rights as well as vigorously cultivate and develop  the property rights market. Through effective methods such as  joint-venture, joint operations, auctions, mergers, transfers,  leasing, sales, and bankruptcy, we will promote the rational  circulation of state assets and optimize their distribution and  restructuring to further bring into play their economic  efficiency.</p>

			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Fines for soft drugs may leap to Pounds 2,500 Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, will decide this week whether to impose the first increase for 17 years in penalties for possession of a broad range of illegal drugs, Kevin Brown writes. He is considering proposals to raise the maximum fine for possession of class B drugs from Pounds 500 to Pounds 2,500. The main drugs affected would be cannabis, barbiturates and amphetamines. There are no plans to increase penalties for possession of class A drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Home office officials say that a five-fold increase in penalties is needed to take account of inflation and to bring fines into line with tougher penalties for other offences. Higher penalties would also signal that the government does not intend to legalise soft drugs such as cannabis. Officials said there were no plans to reduce the number of cautions for drug possession, which account for about half of all cases investigated. However, ministers are understood to be concerned that penalty increases could worsen the backlog of court cases if it led to a rise in non-payment of fines. If Mr Howard decides to go ahead, the government will table an amendment to the criminal justice bill, currently passing through parliament. Organisations representing people who deal with drug users questioned the logic of the move. The charity Release said increasing the maximum fine would have no positive effect. The Police Federation said the present maximum fine was rarely used. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said the government should concentrate on tackling the growing problem of hard drugs.</p>

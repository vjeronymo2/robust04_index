Nevertheless, it is not the  mediating services of the Norwegian Government that will be  remembered, but the moment when U.S. President Clinton, arms  held wide, formed the background for the historic handshake  between Yitzhaq Rabin and Yasir 'Arafat. The U.S.  Administration, the superpower United States, was the godfather  of the agreement and signaled the seriousness of the difficult  new undertaking.    At the beginning of March, the scene was repeated in  Washington, even though at a lower echelon of diplomatic  hierarchy. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher stood behind  Bosnian Prime Minister Silajdzic and Croatian Deputy Prime  Minister Granic when the two initialed a Croatian-Bosnia  agreement on a common state consisting of cantons. Once again  the truth has proved true, which is more than well known from  the times of the Cold War -- namely, that the superpower United  States can solve problems if it uses its diplomatic weight.    This is an impression that became quite obvious shortly  before, when NATO broke the ring of siege around Sarajevo with  the threat of bombing [Serbian positions], especially with the  help of U.S. fighter bombers. There you see, it was thought,  the Europeans had held discussions and mediated for almost two  years, but the United States finally really achieved something  by threatening to use force. Moscow immediately jumped on the  train, and once again it seemed as if the old superpowers alone  would do the trick.    This impression is correct and wrong at the same time. The  way in which the opportunity of putting an end to the two years  of war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has developed and is growing  confirms the old insight that it is not coalitions that pursue  foreign policy but nations. The attempt to end the war between  the Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims by means of multilateral  organizations, represented by mediators Vance, Stoltenberg  (United Nations), and Owen (European Union), proved to be  unsuitable. The warring parties accepted the mediators and  repeatedly split them up at the negotiating table. British  against French, French against Germans, Germans against Greeks.  Nothing could be seen of the nascent common foreign and  security policy of the European Union after Maastricht. In the  meantime, the warring parties seized their opportunities on the  battlefield. The European Union looked just as helpless as the  blue helmet soldiers at and between the frontlines. Despite all  the economic power and political relations, it proved to be  depressing for the Europeans that "the West" is not able to  settle crises such as the one in the Balkans without the United  States.    However, just as the Gaza-Jericho agreement was not possible  without the preparations in Norway, the Croatian-Bosnian  agreement is not conceivable without long preparations and work.  And that was done by the European Union, in particular by the  cooperation between Paris and Bonn. Graphically speaking, the  Europeans brought in the piano on which the United States can  now play its triumphal march as the superpower. Ever since the  action plan was recommended by Foreign Ministers Juppe and  Kinkel to the European Union last November, a red thread of  persistent negotiations and flexible plans has been running  through the emerging peace process for Bosnia. Just as the  continuing embargo against Serbia, giving up the plan to divide  Bosnia into three parts contributed to pulling the United States  into the peace process. Bonn's approach to bring Croats and  Muslims together led to first negotiations in Vienna and at  Petersberg in Bonn at the beginning of January; to negotiations  at Frankfurt Airport; to the Bosnian conference in Bonn; and  finally to new negotiations in Vienna. Mr. Chrobog, the  political director of the Foreign Ministry, went to Moscow and  Washington in November to integrate this dimension in the  mediating process. If the agreement, in which now the Serbs are  also showing interest for the first time, is signed in  Washington in a few days, the European Union has very right to  be visibly participating.    The fact that this will probably be done on the back burner  is reason enough for the Europeans to think about how they can  -- as soon as possible -- use more than just their economic  potential to settle conflicts. "It is too early for us," a  high-ranking official of the Foreign Ministry stated, referring  to the need of the European Union to be able to use military  means to give bite to the Union's diplomacy and foreign policy  -- bite that is, as the Bosnian war clearly shows, is necessary  to be successful.    The United States should also be interested in that,  especially since it again and again experiences the magical  point in foreign policy, from where on prestige and military  potential are the decisive elements.</p>

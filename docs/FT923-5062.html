			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Japan's cabinet power remains in kitchen: Political reputations are built on past favours and can survive bribery scandals TITLES don't necessarily count for much in Japanese politics. The prime minister may be one of the weaker members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, while the most powerful politicians are often content to exercise their influence in the backroom, only occasionally surfacing to take positions of official authority. As titles are no certain indicator of influence, resignations are no accurate measure of a decline in power. Mr Shin Kanemaru resigned last week as the LDP's vice-chairman, and yet he will remain the 'kingmaker' and the 'godfather', cultivating younger politicians by furnishing the funds they need for election campaigns. By title, Mr Kanemaru is the most senior politician to have been implicated in the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, a still unfolding saga of massive payments, reckoned to be Y520bn (Pounds 2.1bn), to politicians and government officials by ambitious executives at a parcel delivery company. On Tuesday Mr Kiyoshi Kaneko, the governor of Niigata prefecture north of Tokyo, also resigned, though he too is likely to remain a politician of importance, partly because of his strong local links and his personal friendships with Tokyo's party powerful, including Mr Kanemaru. The timing of these resignations is convenient for the LDP coming, not surprisingly, after an upper house election in July in which the party was particularly successful. The Tokyo prosecutors pursuing the Sagawa case have a reputation for independence, but they also have a habit of intensifying their investigations in the wake of an election. Mr Kanemaru admitted that his office had received Y500m from Tokyo Sagawa, though he claimed to have rejected an initial overture from the company and discovered, much to his surprise, that his office workers had accepted the money. And Mr Kaneko denied receiving funds, but was forced to resign after his office workers told prosecutors that they saw at least Y100m in Sagawa donations. Apart from stepping down from the official party post, Mr Kanemaru promised that he would resign as head of the party's largest faction. Having since been told by faction members that this move would 'create confusion', Mr Kanemaru, in a characteristically vague and mumbled explanation, insisted that he would resign but said he dislikes 'confusion'  -meaning that he may remain at the helm. The departure of the two office-bearers marks either the real beginning or the possible end of the Sagawa scandal. Mr Kanemaru's admission that his office accepted Y500m means a possible breach of the Political Funds Control Law, which limits companies to donations of Y100m to one party or individual in a year. If prosecutors pursue Mr Kanemaru over this payment and attempt to prove a violation, it will be clear that the Sagawa scandal is far from over. The maximum penalty for a violation of the funds law is a hardly punitive Y200,000, but more significant would be the public humiliation of Mr Kanemaru, and the likelihood that other LDP leaders would be pilloried, delaying their turns at the top of government. And if the prosecutors are truly enthusiastic in the pursuit of Sagawa funds, they may find embarrassing links between the LDP and gangster groups. Ordinary Japanese take for granted that the party's far right has regularly done business with gangsters, but the illumination of murky links between mainstream LDP leaders and the gangs would stir controversy. Mr Masaya Ito, a political commentator, said Sagawa offers a good opportunity to expose the gangster links, as employees of the parcel company appear to have acted as an intermediary between a gang boss and a leading LDP member: 'This could be the first time we can clearly see this linkage.' A gangster controversy would not necessarily lead to substantial changes in Japanese politics, although a gangster scandal provoked upheaval in the securities industry last year. On becoming prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa promised that 'political reform' would be a priority, but his predecessor, Mr Toshiki Kaifu, was dumped because he showed unexpected reformist zeal and because he forgot that titles do not confer power in the LDP. The LDP's success at the upper house election means Mr Miyazawa is likely to serve out a two-year term, but the latest revelations have failed to inspire him to renew the call for political reform, which is intended to make politics less expensive and less prone to the Sagawa-style scandals. Making politics less expensive means undermining the influence of the likes of Mr Kanemaru, whose authority comes from their long-term cultivation of younger, needy politicians. Unless prosecutors launch a series of high-profile bribery cases, having established that Sagawa money was swapped for legislative favours, the scandal is unlikely to threaten the LDP's hold on power. Conveniently, the leading opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, is also implicated. Meanwhile, Komeito, the Clean Government Party, has suggested that all corporate donations to politicians be banned, a change that would certainly work to its benefit. The right-leaning Komeito receives funds through Soka Gakkai, a lay Buddhist group whose leader is perceived by his followers to be not only a 'godfather', but a god.</p>

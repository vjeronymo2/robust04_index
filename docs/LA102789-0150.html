			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DELAYS GROSSO TRIAL, ORDERS PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION OF SUSPECT  </P> <P> A judge interrupted the trial of Joseph Grosso and ordered a psychiatric  examination of the distraught defendant Thursday, one day after Grosso blamed a  murder attempt on the underboss of a Los Angeles organized crime family.  </P> <P> Acquaintances of Grosso in Orange County Jail, where he is being held, said he  was unable to sleep and was extremely agitated after testifying Wednesday that  Michael Anthony Rizzitello Jr., reputed underboss of the Milano organized crime  family, shot a topless bar owner three times in an attempt to kill him.  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court Judge John L. Flynn ordered prosecutors and  defense attorneys not to discuss the case.  </P> <P> Rizzitello is a co-defendant with Grosso on charges of attempted murder in the  1987 shooting of William Carroll, a financier associated with the Mustang Club,  a now-defunct topless bar in Santa Ana. Grosso testified Wednesday that  Rizzitello, who will be tried separately, shot Carroll three times in the back  of the head. Carroll was found bleeding and near death in the parking lot of  the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Carroll survived the attack, but was blinded. Carroll earlier testified that  Rizzitello shot him.  </P> <P> After an in-chambers hearing Thursday which lasted more than an hour, Flynn  interrupted the trial and Grosso's testimony, telling jurors to return Monday.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Grosso told jurors that he drove the car in which Carroll was  shot, but said he was surprised by the shooting, and denied prosecution claims  that he was involved.  </P> <P> Grosso also denied the prosecutors' contention that Rizzitello wanted to gain  control of the lucrative Mustang topless bar on Harbor Boulevard. Rizzitello,  62, is scheduled to go on trial next month in the Carroll shooting. Rizzitello  has a long history of fraud and racketeering convictions.  </P> <P> Grosso's acquaintances in the Orange County Jail said Thursday that he is  worried the Milano crime family will be angry with him for "giving up"  Rizzitello.  </P> <P> Grosso's best friend, "Big George" Yudzevich, who also worked at the Mustang,  was shot to death last year in Irvine. Authorities say it's possible his death  was ordered because he testified before an East Coast grand jury about a New  York crime family's activities.  </P> <P> "Joey (Grosso) is scared all right," one acquaintance said. "He knows what  happened to Big George."  </P> <P> Whether Grosso will resume the witness stand Monday is still unknown.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Grosso also suggested in testimony that Carroll was responsible  for the unsolved murders of racing entrepreneur Mickey Thompson and his wife  Trudi last year.  </P> <P> Grosso testified that he once heard Carroll ask Yudzevich to commit a murder,  but Yudzevich refused. Then, Grosso told the jurors, Carroll asked Yudzevich if  he would pick up somebody on a bicycle who would be committing a murder for  him. "It was a race-car driver. Mickey Thompson," Grosso said.  </P> <P> But on cross-examination, Grosso said he only deduced that Carroll was talking  about Mickey Thompson in jail after reading newspapers stories that Thompson  and his wife had been shot by gunmen who rode away on bicycles. On  cross-examination, Grosso explained that Carroll never said anything about a  race-car driver.  </P> <P> Law enforcement officials were skeptical of Grosso's accusations, and said that  Carroll is not a suspect in the Thompson murders. One official said that  Grosso's claims about Carroll were made to law enforcement officials long  before his trial began.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The police gang unit continued its search Monday for a man who shot into a  group of late-night beach-goers Saturday and wounded four people after an  altercation near La Jolla Cove.  </P> <P> Three of the injured were taken to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla,  treated and released Sunday morning, said Lt. George Saldamando, head of the  police gang unit.  </P> <P> A 17-year-old girl was listed in fair condition at the hospital Monday after  undergoing surgery for a gunshot wound to her left leg, a hospital spokeswoman  said.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred about 11:10 p.m. Saturday in a parking lot north of the  lifeguard tower in the 800 block of Coast Boulevard, Saldamando said. A group  of blacks was having a party in the parking lot just north of a larger group of  Filipinos, when words were exchanged between the two groups, he said.  </P> <P> A black man picked up a trash can and charged at the Filipinos, Saldamando  said. A Filipino man fired two warning rounds from a handgun into the air,  frightening off two of the black man's companions, he said.  </P> <P> The man with the trash can continued to challenge the Filipino, who then fired  four shots into the group, hitting two group members and two bystanders who  were passing through on their way to go scuba diving, Saldamando said. The  gunman's shots were not returned, he said.  </P> <P> Steve Rabin, 28, was struck in the right arm; Gary Hurd, 43, was hit in the  left ankle, and Lonnie Bennett, 24, was struck in the right leg. The  17-year-old's name was withheld by authorities because she is a minor.  </P></p>

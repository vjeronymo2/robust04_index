The meeting is that of the political affairs group of the  preliminary working committee for the preparatory committee of  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, which operates  under the Standing Committee of China's National People's  Congress.    According to the group, the People's Republic of China, in  accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, will resume  sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997; the British  Government will also return Hong Kong to China on the same day.    This means that British rule over Hong Kong is based on two  constitutional documents as legal grounds until June 30, 1997,  when the rule of the British Government over Hong Kong will be  ended.    That is to say, the British Government rules Hong Kong  through a political structure composed of the Legislative  Council, municipal councils and district boards, which embody  British power.    However, with the termination of British rule over Hong Kong  in 1997, the two constitutional documents will become null and  void, marking the end of the British Hong Kong political  structure.    British rule over Hong Kong can neither be extended beyond  the date of June 30, 1997, nor can it be allowed to make any  decisions to let the existing political structure do so.    Otherwise, it will be considered to have overstepped its  power, and the principle of sovereignty stipulated in the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law will be  meaningless.    As a result, the term of the last three-tier political  structure of the British Hong Kong Government has to be  terminated on June 30, 1997.    And the four-year term of the structure as set out in  current  British Government documents obviously contravenes the  principles of the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic  Law. Therefore, it is invalid.    This is an inevitable outcome of the British handover of  Hong  Kong to China and of China's resumption of the sovereignty of  Hong Kong.    The termination is also the duty of the British Government  and the right of the Chinese Government as stipulated in the  Joint Declaration.    The group explained that the first legislative body and  districts organizations of the Hong Kong Special Administrative  Region, which will be established after July 1, 1997, will be  different in nature from the political structure of the present  Hong Kong Government. They will by no means be a "complete copy"  of the old British Hong Kong political structure, but one that  will enjoy a high degree of autonomy as a regional  administration under the Chinese Government.    They will be organized in accordance with the Basic Law and  relevant decisions of the National People's Congress, and be run  by local Hong Kong residents.    The Chinese Government had hoped to make an arrangement  through Sino-British negotiations to extend the term of service  of the British Hong Kong Legislative Council members, in a bid  to achieve a smooth transition.    Unfortunately, no agreement was reached during the  Sino-British talks on the arrangements for the 1994/1995  elections in the territory, and the conditions for the council  members to extend their service beyond June 30, 1997, no longer  exist.    It should be pointed out that the two legislative  institutions different in nature cannot be lumped together, even  if there had been agreement reached between the two sides.    It is because of the different legal grounds that decide the  different natures of the two legislative bodies.    As the component parts of the political structure, the  district boards and two municipal councils are closely connected  to administrative power of the British Hong Kong Government.    Therefore, they must also be abolished on June 30, 1997,  just  like the Legislative Council, the group concluded.</p>

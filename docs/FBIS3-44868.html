			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 20 Dec (XINHUA) -- It was learned from the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Ministry of  Supervision that, to promote the in-depth development of the  anticorruption struggle, the party Central Committee selected a  number of responsible cadres and staff members from units  directly under the party Central Committee and the State  Council, the National People's Congress, the National Committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the  Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Supreme  People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and  organized them into 20 investigation groups together with a  number of responsible persons from democratic parties and  democratic personages without party affiliation. The 20  investigation groups were dispatched to 20 ministries and  commissions and 20 provinces and municipalities to supervise and  inspect the situation of the current anticorruption struggle.  Generally speaking, since the party Central Committee set the  three major tasks for anticorruption struggle in the latter part  of August this year, various localities and departments have  taken prompt action and adopted effective measures for the work  and achieved certain achievements in the anticorruption  struggle. Recently, the central authorities held several report  meetings to hear the results of checking by those investigation  groups. Wei Jianxing, Ren Jianxin, Luo Gan, Li Guixian and  Zhang Siqing, as well as several responsible comrades of  concerned departments, heard reports by those investigation  groups.    In line with the requirements of the party Central  Committee,  various investigation groups integrated the work of supervision  and inspection with investigation and study to promote the  in-depth struggle against corruption. Members of those  investigation groups carefully listened to reports by leading  members of concerned ministries, commissions, provinces and  municipalities and exchanged opinions with them. Meanwhile,  they also spent quite some time hearing opinions and comments  from cadres and masses on the anticorruption work. Judging from  the reports made by those investigation groups, in the past four  months, the whole party has taken part in tackling the problem  of corruption under the leadership of the party Central  Committee with the active support of the masses, and thus the  stuggule has had a good beginning. The tendencies of corruption  have basically been checked and the three anticorruption tasks  have achieved good results to various extents in different  localities and departments. Leading cadres at various levels  have paid good attention to their behavior through self-  inspection and self-correction, and have improved the party's  workstyle and enhanced the consciousness of building an honest  government. Leading cadres have strengthened their efforts to  investigate various cases and completed the handling of a number  of major and serious cases. They have announced and  straightened out some fees which should not be levied in a  wanton manner. The unhealthy tendency of using public funds for  pleasure trips abroad has, in the main, been stopped. In light  of the dissatisfaction reflected by the masses, some departments  and trades paid attention to correcting serious unhealthy  practices. Through anticorruption struggles launched over the  past several months, the broad masses of cadres and people have  enhanced their confidence in the anticorruption struggle and are  convinced that, as long as the struggle can be waged in a solid  manner in accordance with the demands set by the party Central  Committee, the tendencies of corruption can certainly be  gradually curbed, and better and more apparent results can be  achieved in improving party's workstyle and building an honest  government. In this way, reform, opening up, and economic  construction can also be promoted smoothly in a better way.    Judging from the situation learned from the investigations,  there is still a lot of work to do to reach the target of the  anticorruption struggle. In some localities and departments,  leadership over the struggle is not strong enough, and so  progress has been slow and results are not apparent. The  progress is also uneven in various localities. In some  localities and departments, leading cadres are not serious  enough in self-discipline and they have not corrected problems  found in their self-examination. The task of investigating and  handling major and serious cases is still very heavy and the  unhealthy practices reflected by the masses still have not been  corrected by some trades. In short, we must make great efforts  to understand the situation, improve our work, and adopt and  implement correct policies to solve problems.    Through investigation, we can understand that to achieve  signifcant results in the current anticorruption struggle, we  must do solid work and make greater efforts in the more than one  month period before the Spring Festival. Meanwhile, it is  necessary to integrate the anticorruption struggle with the work  of promoting clean and honest practices during the New Year and  Spring Festival periods so as to further consolidate and develop  the achievements gained in the earlier period.    The participants in the report meeting held that inspection,  supervision, and investigation by the investigation group in  various localities and departments are important measures to  promote in- depth development of the struggle. The  participation in investigation groups by people of various  circles is also a successful experience.</p>

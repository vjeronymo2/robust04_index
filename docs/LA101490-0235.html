			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> FOOD;  </P> <P> THE ORGANIC ROADSIDE STAND  </P> <P> THE OLDEST organic farm in the United States, operated organically since 1906,  has long been known for its tasty apricots. That acreage, now the K. B. Hall  Ranch, has for two generations supported a summertime roadside fruit stand on  Highway 150 between Ojai and Santa Paula.  </P> <P> This year, K. B. Hall joined with several of its neighbors, all members of  California Certified Organic Farmers, to offer (on weekends only)  environmentally conscientious, palate-pleasing fruits and vegetables. The  ranchers not only adhere to CCOF standards -- no spraying, no concentrated  fertilizer, no pesticides and no herbicides -- but they maintain dry-farmed  orchards as well, thus conserving precious water resources.  </P> <P> Come Thanksgiving, you can look out for the Royal Burgundy purple string beans.  </P> <P>  The CCOF roadside produce stand, 11999 Ojai/Santa Paula Road (Highway 150);  telephone (805) 525-3170.  </P> <P> ELLEN ALPERSTEIN  </P></p>

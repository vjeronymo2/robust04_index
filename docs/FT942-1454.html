			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Death drug share sales investigated Japan's securities industry watchdog yesterday raided a drug wholesaler, Nippon Shoji, at the centre of a scandal over alleged share sales by 175 employees and their relatives just before an announcement linking the company's shingles drug to the deaths of 15 patients. The raid was the first by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, which the government established two years ago to clean up the image of the Japanese securities industry after an embarrassing spate of brokers' scandals. Before the raid, which came after several days of press speculation, the allegation that company officials had profited from their knowledge of the patients' misfortune had stirred outrage, even though insider trading is often taken for granted by the public. Deaths caused by side effects of a drug manufactured and distributed by the Osaka-based Nippon Shoji provoked criticism last October, when the company conceded that, for some patients, the drug could be fatal. But the new allegations have deepened the public's mistrust of Japan's health establishment. The shingles drug case comes after the deaths of 20 patients taking an anti-cancer drug. This case late last year had prompted a dispute among officials at the Health Ministry, drug companies and doctors, who blamed each other for the deaths. The ministry has since agreed to disclose its evaluation procedure for new drugs. Yesterday's investigation follows an earlier probe into the case by the Osaka securities exchange. A total 175 company employees and their families are suspected of selling Nippon Shoji shares before last October's announcement by the government. Nippon Shoji, which is listed on the second section of the Osaka securities exchange, started falling a few hours before the Health Ministry's announcement, closing down 7.6 per cent on the day at Y3,150. The stock declined a further 15.5 per cent following the release. Following numerous many allegations of unfair trade practices during the stock market 'bubble' of the late 1980s, the Ministry of Finance tightened Japan's regulations on insider trading and set up its own version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The Nippon Shoji case has allowed the watchdog, criticised for its ineffectiveness, to show some teeth. In a related development, officials at Eisai, another leading drug maker which was helping Nippon Shoji with the promotion of Sorivudine, said it had launched its own investigation on possible insider trading among its employees.</p>

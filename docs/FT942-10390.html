			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / World Trade News: Gatt launches drive to find new chief The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade yesterday formally launched its hunt for a successor to Mr Peter Sutherland, who plans to stand down from Gatt's top job at the end of this year. The successful candidate will become the first director-general of the new World Trade Organisation which will absorb Gatt in 1995. However, he or she will be selected under current Gatt procedures. Mr Andras Szepesi of Hungary, this year's chairman of the contracting parties (members), said yesterday he would begin the necessary consultations, which are designed to secure a consensus. Trade diplomats in Geneva said they hoped agreement could be reached by the summer. No names are yet officially in the ring, but several possible candidates have been mentioned, not necessarily with their knowledge or approval. Among the more plausible are Mr Renato Ruggiero, former Italian trade minister and an early advocate of the WTO, Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's environment minister and a former Gatt ambassador, and Mr Philip Burdon, trade minister of New Zealand. Developing countries, which account for three-quarters of Gatt's 123 members, are expected to make a strong push for the WTO top job. Many Third World nations, who played a key role in the just-completed Uruguay Round of trade talks, see the vacancy as a golden opportunity to break the hegemony of the industrialised powers over the big international economic institutions. Latin American candidates mounted a vigorous challenge to Mr Sutherland last year. US officials in Geneva yesterday denied suggestions that Washington was opposed to the WTO job going to a developing country national. 'We have no geographical or developed-developing country limitations', said one senior US diplomat. Whoever succeeds Mr Sutherland will need to win the assent, if not the sponsorship, of the leading trading powers - the US, the European Union and, to a lesser extent, Japan.</p>

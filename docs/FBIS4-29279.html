			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Seoul TONG-A ILBO on 23 May reported on  page 2 that with the local election date set for 27 June 1995,  the government is planning to transfer over 500 responsibilities  to local governments. The government believes this will  accelerate local autonomy. These tasks concern regional  matters, including issues such as public welfare, revitalization  of the economy, local transportation and roads, promotion of  agriculture, and boosting local customs and culture. The  government is sending two information-gathering teams to 15  cities in May and a final decision will be announced in December.</p>

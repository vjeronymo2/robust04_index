			<p>BFN     [Text] Vicente Albero, minister of agriculture, fisheries,  and food, has handed in his resignation to Felipe Gonzalez. The  resignation is described as irrevocable. He is now explaining  the reasons for this resignation at the Ministry; the reasons  why he is voluntarily leaving his post are linked to the Ibercor  affair. Over to our reporter Manuel de Ramon. Hello Manuel de  Ramon, good evening.    [Ramon] Former Minister Vicente Albero has explained that he  resigned because he had mortgage bonds deposited in the office  of the former receiver of the Madrid stock market, Manuel De La  Concha. He gave Manuel De La Concha orders saying that these  bonds were not to be speculated with. He had obtained these  mortgage bonds when he resigned as managing director of the  Marie Claire hosiery company in 1982. He was managing director  until 1982, and then he got a job as general director in the  socialist administration. He was paid in mortgage bonds which  he deposited in Manuel De La Concha's office.    Vicente Albero has repeated that he did not speculate while  he was working as a politician and as a civil servant. He only  worked at his job and he is not mixed up in any shady deals.  This is all we can say just now.</p>

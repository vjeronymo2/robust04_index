			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Budget fears hit utilities Shares in the regional electricity companies (recs) fell sharply after the Labour party's shadow chancellor reiterated plans for a tax on windfall gains arising from the sale of the National Grid. Sentiment was further hit by speculation that the government might actually introduce a watered down version of the tax in the Budget, although political jitters ahead of next Monday's crucial vote in the House of Commons on UK contributions to the EU budget were said to have been a more important factor. However, strategists also pointed out that part of the slide could be attributed to profit-taking after the recent strong performance of the sector. One trader simply said he was 'squaring the books' in calling the sector lower. The day's main casualties included East Midlands, down 27 at 734p, Midlands, which also retreated 27, to 740p, South Wales, 34 lighter at 760p, Southern, 21 weaker at 765p, and South West, which surrendered 31 at 732p. Mr Doug Falconer at Yamaichi said that as a result of the statement from Labour 'it is extremely likely electricity companies will feel under pressure to announce special dividends sooner rather than later'. He remains positive on the sector, with Southern among his favoured stocks.</p>

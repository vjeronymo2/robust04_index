			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, YSP Political Bureau </F> member and official in charge of foreign relations, by Salah  Salamah; place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, Yemeni  Socialist Party [YSP] Political Bureau member and official in  charge of foreign relations in the party, the recent reports  about the battles say that the northern units of the Yemeni army  are now 20 km away from Aden and that they continue to advance  toward the country's economic capital. How true are these  reports? How do you assess the situation on the ground?    [Al-Dali] It has become clear that Sanaa has been  transmitting lies since the very first day these battles began.  You followed with me the news that Sanaa has been transmitting  over the past 10 days, that they are 3 km away, 6 km, and 10  km, then they went back and said 20 km. The truth is that  these are all lies by which they seek to boost their morale in  order to prevent popular upheaval in wake of the big defeats  they have sustained over the last 10 days. Now, fighting is  raging on the borders between the former two parts of the  homeland. The situation is very good in Abyan, and also [word  indistinct] in al-Dali.'    [Salamah] Have you recaptured al-Dali' city?    [Al-Dali] Yes, yes. We recaptured it yesterday and [words  indistinct] settled in our favor, and the al-'Amaliqah elements  are being liquidated. They have entered houses, (?plundered]  villages and valleys [indisdtinct word] in Abyan.    [Salamah] The central command in Sanaa seems to be set on a  military solution and seeks, as it says, to arrest the leaders  of the south, after describing them as the advocates of apostasy  and secession, with Vice Chairman 'Ali Salim al-Bid at their  head. Do you believe it is still possible to resort to dialogue  to find a political solution to the conflict in Yemen?    [Al-Dali] I say that political dialogue is a sine qua non,  no  matter how intense the fighting becomes. In the end, there will  be no other choice but to hold a dialogue. The military  settlement about which they have spoken so much has reached a  dead end. There is no other course open to them but to [words  indisintct] and sit around the table so we may talk and hold  consultations.    [Salamah] The YSP has addressed urgent calls to the Arab  League to have it immediately intervene to stop the battles.  The Arab League delegation to Yemen still waits in Sanaa  without any result. The delegation still waits to meet [words  indistinct]. On your part, do you still hope for the success of  the Arab efforts to stop the fighting?    [Al-Dali] The truth is that the parliamentary bloc within  the  YSP is the one that addressed an urgent call to the Arab League  to stop this massacre Sanaa's soldiers are determined to carry  out. Yes, we still call for stopping the fighting and the  bloodshed, in spite of everything. We, the Yemenis, do not  have any other course but to sit together after stopping the  fighting and to hold a dialogue. We give the Arab League an  important role. We hope that it succeeds in its endeavor.    [Salamah] Many Arab countries, especially Syria, as well as  the Arab League, today made a new appeal to the friends in Yemen  to halt the battles and implement the pledge and accord  document. This is what the United States also did yesterday.  Do you believe this document is still suitable and can be  implemented after all what has happened? Will the Yemeni  leaders respond to the calls of the fraternal and friendly  countries?    [Al-Dali] I believe that if the fighting halts, the document  can be discussed because it is still vital.    [Salamah] What new element can make Yemeni leaders implement  this document, which was signed in Amman a long time ago?    [Al-Dali] I said we hope the other party will also be ready  to implement and apply the document. But if they do not want  to, as they did in the past, if they reject the document, or if  they are unable to implement it, then that is another question.  The document cannot be applied by one party. The document  should be applied by all parties involved. For our part in the  YSP, we still believe the document can be applied and can be  dealt with. But, if the other party does not want to, then this  is another question and it will be difficult and even impossible  to implement the document.    [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, in light of the facts  in  the field and the adopted positions, it is regrettably clear  that the military option still overwhelms other options. The  contradiction has assumed a conflicting nature, and it may not  be decided in light of current factors unless there is a victor  and a vanquished in Yemen. Do you believe that there is still a  chance of dealing with the conflict politically?    [Al-Dali] I believe that despite all that has taken place,  we  can deal with the issue politically. We always prefer the  political option, to which we should resort in the final  analysis, when all the other options, including the military  one, fail -- a military option adopted by Sanaa. We have not  resorted to the military option. We have opted for the  political solution. We believe that after the military option  fails, Sanaa will inevitably return to the political option.    [Salamah] Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali, the human and the  material losses are huge. How long will the fighting in Yemen  continue, in your opinion?    [Al-Dali) We will continue it until the last man. We will  not allow the imposition of any solution by force. We will not  allow any one to enslave us in this way Sanaa (?ruler) wants.    [Salamah] Thank you Dr. 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Dali for your  interview with Paris Radio Monte Carlo.</p>

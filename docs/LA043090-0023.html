			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES: HE HAS FACTS NAILED DOWN  </P> <P> Steve Weinberg, author of "Armand Hammer: The Untold Story," says he tries not  to think about the defamation suit that the Occidental Petroleum chairman filed  against him in London. "It ruins my day," Weinberg said at a recent journalism  seminar in St. Louis.  </P> <P> However, Weinberg, who is executive director of Investigative Reporters &amp;  Editors, didn't seem worried about defending his work. He asserts that Hammer,  who had lawyers and other representatives working overtime in an attempt to  keep the book from being published, filed suit in England because of the  country's less permissive libel law.  </P> <P> "I have thousands of pages of documents. I have his income tax returns for  several years. I have his high school report card from 1916. I have records of  all the pieces of property he owns. I have his congressional testimony from the  1930s. I have details of 50 lawsuits (involving Hammer and his businesses) and  information from another 250 minor lawsuits. I have the complete file of his  two divorces," Weinberg said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Firm, Old Symbol  </P> <P> The new logo for Time Warner Inc. may look made for the 1990s, but it also  contains hints of symbols dating back thousands of years. As is its corporate  creator, the new logo is the result of a merger. A stylized eye and ear have  been used to represent, as the company describes it, the appeal of Time  Warner's products to those senses.  </P> <P> But it doesn't take a mythology expert to see similarities in the new logo to  the symbols of earlier times. The sign of Horus, the ancient Egyptian  falcon-headed god, also used a stylized eye with a spiral.  </P> <P> "There was no attempt to connect with something ancient," said Steff  Geissbuhler, partner in the New York design firm Chermayeff &amp; Geismar,  which created the new logo. "But every time you use an icon such as an eye or  ear you echo ancient themes." And, in a way, Horus was in the communications  business too. Four thousand years ago, the eyes of Horus were sometimes painted  on the outside of coffins in the belief that they would help the dead to see in  the afterlife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hidden Value in Stock  </P> <P> The way one analyst sees it, Safeway Inc.'s 35% stake in El Monte-based Vons  Cos. boosted by a hefty amount what investors were willing to pay for Safeway  shares in the Oakland company's initial public offering last week.  </P> <P> Here's how Suzanne McGrath of the Black &amp; Co. investment firm in Portland,  Ore., figures it: Safeway owns about 13.6 million shares of Vons, which is  trading at about $23 a share. That yields a stake in Vons of nearly $313  million.  </P> <P> On a fully diluted basis -- taking into account management stock options and  the exercise of warrants -- Safeway would have about 100 million common shares.  The Vons holding, therefore, contributed $3.13 to the value of each Safeway  share, so that investors who subscribed to the offering at $11.25 really paid  only $8.125 for Safeway.  </P> <P> Got that?  </P></p>

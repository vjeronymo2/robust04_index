According to the local press, about 450 State Judicial  Police  (PJE) carried out seven simultaneous operations in different  areas and in one of them they were attacked by armed men  presumed to be guerrillas. No casualties were reported.  Unofficially it was learned that the operations were conducted  when the police heard about the presence of armed groups in some  parts of the state, although PJE spokesman Gustavo Castanon told  EFE that "these are only routine operations."    The policemen carried out patrols in the villages of San  Luis  Acatlan, Cutzamala, Papanoa, and San Luis Loma. In the two last  villages an armed group fired upon official vehicles, without  injuring anyone, according to the newspaper reports. In San  Luis Acatlan police arrested three persons and charged them with  armed robbery. High caliber weapons were seized.    A group of Guerrero State lawyers said that in the event  that  guerrilla groups appear in that state, none of the public  security organizations have the capability or information to  confront them. They agreed that to confront the armed groups it  was necessary to form a special information network that did not  depend on the Judicial Police, but the Government Secretariat  instead.    At the beginning of the 1970's the country's first guerrilla  groups were formed in the mountains in Guerrero State: the 23  September Communist League and the Revolutionary Armed Movement  headed by Lucio Cabanas and Arturo Gamiz.    Following the Chiapas State armed uprising, when on 1  January  the Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) rose up in arms  against the government, surveillance has increased to other  areas that suffer serious social backwardness. Guerrero State,  in addition to Oaxaca and Chiapas States, is a state with a  large Indian population and also one of the most affected by  violence due to extreme poverty and backwardness.</p>

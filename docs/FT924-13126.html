			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Management: Consistency pays best dividends - Roger Young of the British Institute of Management suggests a new approach to top executives' salaries The debate on top people's salaries in Britain has reached such a pitch this year that there is an outcry every time a company reveals a sharp rise in the salary of its chairman or chief executive. At present, discussion is focusing on the disparity between the basic salary or performance bonuses of several high flyers and their company's short-term performance. Instead of each rise being condemned out of hand, the debate should now broaden to include how total remuneration for all managers should be defined, established, maintained and controlled. The goal should be the use of professional processes which are transparent and systematic, right through companies - including the top. However irresponsible the ballooning salaries of some high flyers, we must not get carried away. Such people, although very visible and with large, well-known enterprises at their command, are relatively few in number. A recent British Institute of Management survey of both managers' and directors' salaries, showed that the increases received by the directors of small- and medium-sized organisations were far more restrained than those of directors of large companies with substantial turnovers. In fact, the percentage increases of the more lowly-paid directors were below those of employees generally. They led by example as they flew over the choppy economic waters in which their corporate rivals were sinking. In some cases their reductions in remuneration were the surplus ballast ditched to keep the company afloat. So what is remuneration, as opposed just to salaries? Pro Ned, the organisation which promotes the role of non-executive directors, defines the elements of the remuneration package as: basic salary, a performance-related element, profit-sharing schemes, share options and other benefits. Pension entitlements and the wording of any service contract are the 'off-balance sheet' equivalents that I believe should be included. Too often, these are the more costly elements that only come to light, if at all, when the remuneration incentive package fails to achieve the expected results and the chief executive leaves amicably to pursue other interests. How should top executives' remuneration be established? The answer is simple. By the same process and with the same care as any other salary in the same company. If this principle were applied throughout Britain, two significant changes would occur. First, if the same high level of detailed consideration were given to the pay and conditions of the workforce as is currently applied to top executives' financial rewards, personnel practices would improve significantly in many companies. Second, throughout the workforce, a far greater level of satisfaction and improved output would be achieved. Employees would understand the process of evaluation, be correctly counselled, appraised and take a greater interest in the progress of the company. If good management practices are used, there should be little difference in the application of the standard corporate principles to the principals. There are many well-established and widely-used systems offering help in evaluating the breadth and depth of a position. Extending their principles to directors' remuneration should prove no problem to those familiar with their use. The beauty of such systems is that they establish a framework. If those at the top are included within the same framework as those under their control, it means that all are tied to the same industry conditions and constraints in times of austerity. Where current debate has been unhelpful is in the assumption that directors are an industry group unto themselves and, therefore, need to be compared across the piste. What is different at the very top of the management hierarchy is the need for referees. In the parlance of academia, there is a requirement for accreditors and verifiers to maintain, respectively, the application of standards and also their continuing credibility. So who should take on the mantle of accrediting the application of the remuneration process? Quite clearly, in the case of the chief executive's salary and that of any other executive on the main board, a remuneration committee of independent directors is the appropriate body  - providing, of course, that the members are truly independent. Pro Ned not only produces guides and guidance but also offers a service to companies both public and private to find independent non-executive director candidates. A candidate chosen from a Pro Ned assembled list, matching criteria selected by the company, should assuage any criticism of back-scratching from suspicious shareholders or others. And who fulfils the role of verifying the continued credibility of the remuneration process? On this, we have yet to see the final deliberations of the Cadbury Committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance. My suggestion is that the first cautious step in this direction might be taken by the stock exchange. If, to one of their many listing requirements, was added: 'that a statement on the basis for establishing the remuneration of the executive members of the board be included in the annual report and accounts', then shareholders at the annual general meeting would be entitled to ask questions on the subject without being ruled out of order by an obstructive chairman. To suggest that a similar statement should be incorporated in the Companies Act before first piloting the idea might be precipitate. If institutional shareholders backed the Stock Exchange route and offered advice on the amount of detail and how far companies needed to travel to comply, then this initiative might save the need for politically-inspired legislation.

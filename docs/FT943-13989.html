			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / C&amp;G looks to bypass legal obstacles to Lloyds' merger Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society said yesterday it was confident of devising a scheme that would enable the agreed takeover bid by Lloyds Bank to proceed, without having to appeal against last month's High Court judgment. While C&amp;G believes the deal, heralded as overcoming the obstacles for banks in taking over building societies, can go ahead, it also signalled that there could be a delay in the timetable. A restructured plan for distributing the Pounds 1.8bn offered by Lloyds and a new timetable for getting the agreement of C&amp;G's 1.4m members, are now expected to be announced in mid-August. Yesterday's statement, which came a few days before the deadline for deciding whether to seek an expedited appeal, is a sign that C&amp;G already has an outline revision of the original scheme. C&amp;G's task is to devise a lawful scheme giving the greatest possible overlap between members who can vote and members who are eligible for cash payments. The smaller number of those qualifying for payments means that the payments themselves should be higher than originally intended. Lloyds Bank shares rose yesterday after C&amp;G's statement to close 21p up at 557p, as the bank's strategy of expanding its share of the retail financial services market appeared to be back on track. If approved, the bid would create the fourth largest mortgage lender in the UK, supplying 7 per cent of the home mortgage market. The new scheme will have to take account of the decision by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, that cash payments could not be made to investors of less than two years' standing, or to borrowers from the society. This confirmed the 1986 Building Societies Act which intended to stop 'speculative flows' between societies, by creating a class of members who could vote on such an offer without being eligible for any immediate cash benefit if it proceeded. The very high voting thresholds required under building society legislation for members to approve such a deal means that these votes could be critical to acceptance of the proposal. Mr Andrew Longhurst, C&amp;G chief executive, and Sir Brian Pitman, Lloyds Bank chief executive, both expressed confidence in the deal. The original schedule envisaged the deal being concluded in the second quarter of next year. Complex calculations, Page 7 See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In Cameroon, the government has given a  clarification: civil servants' jobs will indeed be cut, but it  will not be anything like the 23,000 layoffs announced by the  press agencies and RFI. The whole operation will be carried out  over four years and will be accompanied by a social plan  described to us by the Civil Service Minister Sali Dairou. He  is speaking to Chantal Lorho:    [Begin Dairou recording] We are in the process of thinking  about reducing staff numbers, but by this we do not mean layoffs  in the pejorative sense of the word, as the man in the street  understands it. Cameroon in fact plans to reduce staff numbers  progressively by encouraging voluntary early retirement and by  creating a reintegration fund to finance the plans of certain  civil servants and state employees who would like to retrain to  work in the private sector. If these plans are considered  viable and feasible, it is possible that they will be financed  by those funds. Moreover, since 1987 we have kept recruitment  frozen, which means that those who leave at normal retirement  age and those who retire after 30 years service form a means of  reducing the numbers of staff in the civil service without this  being a constraint -- as a certain sensationalist section of the  press wishes to believe, saying that we are laying off 20,000  civil servants. The Cameroonian Government has never intended  to lay off 20,000 civil servants. No agreement has been reached  with the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank to that  effect.

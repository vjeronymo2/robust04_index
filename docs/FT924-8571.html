			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Computers in Finance (1): New search for value - The pressures of deregulation, growing competition and rapid technological change are forcing senior managers to look carefully at their IT budgets. Alan Cane finds that the financial community is demanding more for its money THE world's big financial institutions may have killed off the computing 'dinosaurs' - huge projects which promised to integrate every aspect of their businesses - but they still have to learn how to exploit information technology (IT) for survival and growth. A decade ago Dr Eckart Van Hooven, then head of Deutsche Bank, told a conference a price had to be paid to move into the new world of electronic banking, adding: 'If the price means giving up the identity of the banking profession as we know it today, then for me the price is too high.' But in spite of predictions that technology would eliminate distinctions between financial institutions, they have remained separate in culture, management style and business strategy. And for most, it is the cost of the technology that seems too high. The dinosaur projects, epitomised by Anacomp's ill-fated integrated banking system or Midland Bank's cancelled 'Megabank' project, were creatures of the 1980's, nurtured in those balmier days when money was seemingly no barrier to attempts to scale the technological heights. Today, a more realistic regime prevails. The pressures of deregulation, increased competition and technology changing at an unprecedented rate are forcing senior managers to examine their investments in IT more carefully. Expectations of the technology are rising, but budgets are under close scrutiny. There is also a new understanding that technology is a moving target and that standards laid down in mega-projects are impossible to enforce. A survey of IT operating costs in Europe carried out by Andersen Consulting shows that the rise in IT operating costs is set to continue. It suggests these costs are rising at an overall rate of 21 per cent a year, compared to 5 per cent for other non-interest costs. Andersen says: 'The dramatic 30 per cent growth in capital expenditure between 1988 and 1989 has faltered slightly but there is commitment to the next wave of massive investment in technology'. It warns, however, that the economic justification for large scale expenditure on IT is becoming increasingly difficult. Unit costs have not been reduced; revenue generation has not been adequately improved. Suppliers of computing equipment are keenly aware of the pressure on IT budgets. Mr Roger Bellass, managing director of Tandem's UK subsidiary, says the total amount spent on computing equipment by the financial community has fallen: 'Institutions are looking closely at the cost of ownership.' Tandem is one of a number of companies that supplies banks with equipment for 'mission-critical' applications, where computer failure has an immediate consequence in terms of money lost or customers angered. Mr Robin Stainer, Andersen Consulting's retail banking specialist says that senior managers are determined to achieve better control of their technology. While at one stage IT was seen as a black art, an understanding of the potential and pitfalls of computing is now recognised as an important component of a financial specialist's skills. Three main issues now dominate thinking about IT in finance: downsizing, security and out-sourcing. All are a consequence of the increasing power and falling cost of today's microelectronic technology. All are concerned with keeping a cap on costs and achieving value for money. Downsizing implies the substitution of low cost networks of small computers for large and expensive mainframes. The financial services business has traditionally been built around mainframes with huge processing power and the capacity to handle a database of millions of accounts. 'Client-server' is the name given to a network of smaller machines which operate collaboratively to process a workload. The clients may be personal computers or workstations. In a simple network, the servers might also be workstations, but could also be either mainframes, or even supercomputers. The database may be distributed through the network. Lively debate surrounds the question of which approach offers the most advantages. Supporters of mainframe technology argue that in the long run, centrally managed data is cheaper and more effective. They also point out that software for collaborative processing in client-server networks is at an immature stage of development. Data processing management of personal computing systems is at a similarly early stage. A survey by the consultancy Nolan Norton shows that personal computing management practices are relatively immature. 'On average,' it says, 'current personal computing practices are only 34 per cent effective, compared with 81 per cent effectiveness in traditional mainframe environments'. Client-server advocates point to lower costs - perhaps as little as 25 per cent of an equivalent mainframe system; PCs are less expensive on a price/performance basis and cost little to run. Security has become the single biggest technological concern for the financial services business. As managers have become more knowledgeable about computing and communications, they have become aware of the risks to their business in networking. In the UK, the subject has been given added impetus by worries about the integrity of plastic card processing systems. Questions have been raised about so-called 'phantom' withdrawals from automated teller machines (ATMs), cash taken from machines apparently without the card owners' knowledge or consent. While such withdrawals amount to only a tiny percentage of the card fraud, they indicate there may be unexplained loopholes in the ATM security. This is an important question for banks, building societies and any other financial institution using ATMs as a cost-effective way of expanding business. Barclays Bank in the UK says: 'The idea that money can mysteriously disappear from an account without the use of a card and the correct personal identification number is a pure myth'. The question will shortly be tested in the British courts. In the meantime, the principal banks are debating a move to 'smart' or chip cards with a renewed enthusiasm. Smart cards, which contain a microprocessor and memory, are virtually impossible to fake. The banks are also experimenting with cameras in ATMs to establish without question customer identities. Biometric methods including fingerprinting and signature verification are also being tested. Out-sourcing is perhaps the most controversial of the cost-saving measures with which financial services companies are experimenting. It implies passing over to a third party control and management of the data centre against an agreed level of service. In practice, the data centre and computers frequently pass into the ownership of the third party while the data processing staff are taken on to the payroll. According to the marketing consultancy Dataquest facilities management or out-sourcing is set to grow by 20 per cent annually in the UK. It represents a significant change for companies which have seen their data processing systems as their source of competitive advantage. Nevertheless the London Stock Exchange earlier this year agreed to pass responsibility for running its computer systems to Andersen Consulting in a deal worth up to Pounds 15m a year over the next five years. Other financial sectors are following suit. Mr Michael Kelly, head of Touche Ross's asset management and insurance division recently wrote that insurance firms no longer believed they could secure a competitive edge through technology: 'Companies have matured in their views on IT. They are saying, 'Let's give IT to the professional managers'.'</p>

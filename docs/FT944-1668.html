			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Berisford in talks for US purchase Berisford International, the former property and commodities group which earlier this year bought Magnet kitchens, is in negotiations which could lead to the acquisition of a US kitchen equipment maker for about Dollars 500m (Pounds 305m). While talks could be concluded this week, Berisford has yet to agree terms with Welbilt Corporation, which manufactures commercial kitchen equipment for fast food chains such as McDonalds and Burger King. If the deal goes ahead, Berisford will finance the deal through a rights issue. On December 6, Welbilt said that it had received an approach which could lead to the sale of the company and had appointed Donaldson Lufkin Jenrett, the US investment bank, as adviser. Welbilt is 47 per cent owned by Mr Jerome Kohlberg, a founder of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out company. A secondary offering of shares held by Mr Kohlberg was withdrawn when Berisford made its approach. In 1993 Welbilt's net income before extraordinary charges was Dollars 9m on turnover of Dollars 426m. The acquisition would allow Berisford to utilise some of its accumulated US tax losses arising from activities in commercial property in the 1980s. The deal would be Berisford's second large acquisition since Mr Alan Bowkett took over as chief executive in 1992. In January it paid Pounds 56m for Magnet, also financed through a rights issue. Last year, its Pounds 180m bid for C&amp;J Clark, the privately owned shoe company, was rejected.</p>

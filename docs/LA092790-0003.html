			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REASONS FOR S&amp;L CRISIS  </P> <P> If we lived in a true democracy, here is how the bill for the savings and loan  mess might be distributed. Those in Washington who made it possible through  legislation and those who owned/managed the S&amp;Ls that failed, would be  stripped of all they own to pay the bill.  </P> <P> Then those who had $100,000 or more on deposit would be taxed a certain  percentage, going on down to lesser taxes for those who had only a few thousand  on deposit. And the poor, urban dweller who never even heard of an S&amp;L? His  tax bill for this would be zero.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, we have something that interferes with such a democratic  spreading of the bill -- they are called politicians!  </P> <P> FRANK W. HEISER  </P> <P> Riverside  </P></p>

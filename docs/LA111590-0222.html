			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITAN VOLLEYBALL AVOIDS SANCTIONS FROM BIG WEST  </P> <P> The Big West Conference compliance committee has decided not to impose  sanctions on the Cal State Fullerton volleyball program for minor NCAA rule  violations, Titan Athletic Director Ed Carroll said Wednesday.  </P> <P> But Carroll said he sent a letter of reprimand to Coach Jim Huffman because of  Huffman's involvement in the violations.  </P> <P> According to an athletic department report submitted to the conference, Huffman  allowed volleyball players to use his office telephone, a violation of NCAA  rules.  </P> <P> A study of telephone records from February, 1989, to August, 1990, indicated  that 34 illegal calls, totaling $3.89 in charges, were made by three players.  </P> <P> An athletic department inquiry uncovered two other possible rules violations, a  student-athlete who spent a night at Huffman's house and the hiring of two  players to coach a private volleyball team operated by Huffman assistant Marlon  Sano.  </P> <P> According to Fullerton's report, a team member who was having domestic problems  with her roommates went to Huffman's home for counseling, and because it was  late, Huffman allowed her to stay the night.  </P> <P> Big West Conference Associate Commissioner Dennis Farrell said he was "not at  liberty" to discuss compliance committee issues. But Carroll said the  committee, which met during this week's conference meetings in Los Angeles, did  not deem this a violation.  </P> <P> However, the coach "was reprimanded for the use of poor judgement in housing  the student-athlete," the athletic department report said.  </P> <P> Carroll said the compliance committee did not address the possible problem  involving players coaching on club teams because the issue will be discussed at  the conference's next meeting in February.  </P></p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Russian democracy On October 4, when forces loyal to President Boris Yeltsin were still battering the remains of the Russian parliament into submission, western governments were quick to express their support for him. They were right to do so, because Mr Yeltsin was clearly preferable to his opponents. Parliament had degenerated into a rabble, taking its lead from an alliance of communists and fascists. Mr Yeltsin at least offered some hope of coherent government. He also promised to make the people the final arbiters of the conflict. This latter point was stressed in a solemn declaration issued by European leaders four days later: 'We attach the utmost importance to the earliest possible holding of free and fair elections which will give the Russian people the possibility to express themselves clearly on their future and create conditions for the adoption of the required new constitution.' In the event Mr Yeltsin telescoped that process. He has called on the Russian people, in 10 days' time, both to elect a parliament and to adopt a constitution under which that parliament would serve. This involves a contradiction. Some opposition parties are campaigning not only against Mr Yeltsin's government but also against the draft constitution, which - modelled on that of the fifth French republic - gives the president very extensive powers. Were they to succeed in defeating the constitution, theoretically they would also invalidate their own election. Official warning Last week Mr Yeltsin seized on that contradiction (which is actually of his own making) to threaten his opponents with loss of their free air time for party political broadcasts if they continued to use it to attack the constitution, rather than explain their own programmes. This week Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister and chairman of the commission organising the referendum, went further, demanding on the same grounds that two leading opposition parties be disqualified outright and two centre ones be given an official warning. Evidently Mr Yeltsin and some of his aides are worried that the constitution may be defeated, or (more likely) that the 50 per cent minimum turnout may not be reached. They should realise that the best way to ensure a good turnout is to have a lively debate, and that their attempts to interfere in the electoral process can be counterproductive. At least the main pro-government party, 'Russia's Choice', realises this: its leaders hastened to explain, rather quaintly, that Mr Shumeiko had spoken 'only' in his official capacity, and not as a candidate of their party. Misplaced scepticism Mr Yeltsin and his advisers should also realise that their outbursts are prominently reported in the west, and contribute to a widespread western scepticism about the depth of their commitment to democracy and the 'free and fair' quality of the current electoral process. That is unfortunate because the scepticism, especially on the latter point, is largely misplaced. What is surprising about the election campaign, given all the circumstances, is its freedom and vigour. In a perverse way Mr Yeltsin and Mr Shumeiko have provided new evidence of this: opposition parties have ignored their warnings, and Mr Shumeiko's call for their banning has been summarily rejected by the electoral commission. Party political broadcasts have also been used for scathing attacks on the government, some of which would fall foul of libel laws, or indeed of anti-racist legislation, in many western countries. Opposition newspapers, most of which have been allowed to reappear after the brief clampdown imposed in October, are similarly outspoken. Only the most overtly racist, such as Dyen, remain banned. It is true that Russia's Choice is better financed than its competitors. But in which western democracy could that not be said of a strongly pro-business party? Perfect formal democracy is a rare bird, very unlikely to be sighted in a country as large and hard to govern as Russia, which has no democratic tradition and is trying to come to terms simultaneously with the dissolution of its empire and the collapse of its economic system. All things considered, the process we are now witnessing is a much closer approximation to it than anyone had a right to expect.</p>

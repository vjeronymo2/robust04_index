			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Weakened by an enemy within: Japan's divided government is finding it hard to respond to unfamiliar economic problems For the next few months, Mr Takufumi Sato's office at the Japanese Ministry of Finance will be the engine room of the flagging Japanese economy. Mr Sato, director of research in the ministry's budget bureau, devised the Y10,700bn (Pounds 54bn) emergency spending package announced in August. His office is now drawing up next year's budget, which will be crucial to Japan's attempts to avoid recession. With investment falling and consumption stagnant, public spending is the only domestic source of growth. So the responses of Japanese politicians who control public spending will be more important in the next few months than those of its industrialists. But with the economy poised on the edge of a recession, the country's political leadership is consumed by a destabilising power struggle in the wake of the Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal in which senior politicians were accused of taking bribes from a trucking company. Mr Sato's August package of measures to support the stock market and increase investment in public works was greeted with euphoria. The decisiveness of the government's kick-start, equivalent to about 2.3 per cent of gross national product, seemed to set Japan apart from the US and UK where policymakers have floundered in their attempts to stimulate the economy. But recently high spirits have begun to wear off. Over the next six months, it will be touch and go whether Japan falls into recession. The core of the current downturn is not a sharp blow to the international competitiveness of Japanese manufacturing, but a deep-rooted malaise within its financial system. As a result, the responses which have guided Japan through previous downturns - principally Japanese industry's ability to improve its export competitiveness - will not be enough this time. Nevertheless, most Tokyo economists, financiers and politicians believe that the economy will recover to grow by 3.5 per cent next year. They point to a pick-up in housing starts as evidence that the property market is recovering. They believe industry will soon be able to reduce its inventories of unsold cars, air conditioners and video equipment to acceptable levels. Production should recover soon, they predict, with investment following in its wake. They also argue that the August spending package had an important psychological impact: it was a sign that the government was committed to do whatever was necessary to prevent recession, including delivering further boosts from public spending if necessary. The Japanese economy's capacity to recover, even after sustaining great damage, should not be underestimated. It emerged strongly from the recession caused by the international oil price rises of the 1970s and the surge in the value of the yen in the mid-1980s, which threatened to undermine the export competitiveness of much of Japanese industry. But this time the threat is different in several crucial respects. As a result, the confident Tokyo consensus is likely to prove ill-founded. The cause of the current contraction is the sharp rise and, since 1989, the steep fall of asset prices. The effect has been to undermine the financial system and the resources available to industry. As Mr Ogata puts it: 'In the past the threats were like a broken leg - sharp, painful but specific - and it was clear what was needed to mend them. This downturn is more like a virus affecting the blood system - much more complex and pervasive.' The distinctive nature of the downturn means that different people and institutions are in the front line. Japan's response in the past was based on close co-operation between the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry and large manufacturers. This time the government response will be led by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan working with the financial sector. Japan's banks have been weakened by non-performing loans which, for the top 21 banks, rose by 54 per cent to Y12,300bn in the six months to September. The most pessimistic forecasts circulating in the banking industry suggest perhaps as much as Y60,000bn of the industry's Y430,000bn of outstanding loans may turn out to be non-performing. The central problem is that the fall in asset prices has eroded the banks' capital base and reduced the collateral for outstanding loans. The stagnant property market makes it difficult to establish the real price of property and thus the true extent of the losses the banks face. So much of the banks' resources will be devoted to clearing up this mess that bank lending could be kept at a very low level for the next few years. Bank lending grew by only 0.7 per cent in the six months to September, depriving business of the funds needed for recovery. Demand for funds is also weak, and industrial investment is unlikely to fuel renewed growth. In the late 1980s Japanese manufacturers expanded capacity, encouraged by the low cost of capital and strong domestic economic growth. Japan's regions have several gleaming new car and semiconductor plants which are lying virtually idle. Inventories of unsold products are rising at an annual rate of 20 per cent despite cuts in industrial production, which fell by 7.6 per cent in August on the year before. According to Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Miti vice-minister, it will take another two years for these inventories to reach sustainable levels. This excess capacity means there will be little need for renewed investment. A recent survey by the Industrial Bank of Japan of more than 3,500 of its corporate customers predicted that an 11.8 per cent cut in manufacturing investment this year will be followed by a 13 per cent drop next year. Consumption, which represents 56 per cent of gross national product, will not deliver the solution. Despite low unemployment, real incomes are likely to grow negligibly over the next year as employees find their overtime, bonus payments and wage increases cut sharply as employers trim costs. Consumption is likely to remain flat for perhaps another year. The weakness of the private sector means the public sector must take the strain if the economy is to recover. On the face of it, the government is well placed to respond. Public finances - the central, local and social security budgets combined - have been in surplus since 1987. According to figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, outstanding government debt, less government assets, has fallen from 26 per cent of GNP in 1985 to 7.5 per cent in 1991. On paper there seems plenty of scope for tax cuts or higher spending in next year's budget. In addition the government can use the funds of the Y138,000bn postal savings system, which is run by the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, for investment. However, a fiscal remedy is not that simple. Japanese fiscal policy is becoming an intense civil war between bureaucrats and politicians. It is not just the fate of the August spending package that is in the balance. The question now is whether there will be an additional boost in 1993 and possibly 1994 and, if so, how large it should be and how it should be financed. As next year's budget is debated, Japan's bureaucracy, renowned for its long-term strategy, will soon display its even greater capacity for infighting. Ministry of Finance officials talk as if public finances are under assault from politicians, industrialists and bankers seeking hand-outs. They insist the budget surplus is to fund pensions for Japan's ageing population. They believe government borrowing rose to unsustainable levels in the 1970s, pushing up interest payments on government debt as the country was recovering from the oil shocks. They are determined not to let borrowing get out of control again. The Finance Ministry insists that any income tax cut would have to be financed by an offsetting increase in consumption taxes, which would be politically unpopular. The Finance Ministry's opposition to tax cuts could complicate monetary policy. This is because the Bank of Japan has made it clear that, after six reductions in interest rates in the past 16 months, it believes a further relaxation in monetary policy should only follow a decision to loosen fiscal policy. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications is fighting plans to use its funds to prop up the stock market. Meanwhile, manufacturing industry, working through Miti, is opposed to the banks being given public funds to clear their bad debts without industry being helped too. The intensity of bureaucratic infighting is usually overcome by policymakers' capacity for striking pragmatic compromises. But that may not be enough to break this log-jam. Two ingredients are lacking. The first is the threat of a serious financial crisis at a large bank, which might swing public opinion behind government support for the banks. The second is the political leadership to wield authority over the fractious bureaucrats and interest groups. Recent decisive shifts in economic policy, such as the introduction of a 3 per cent consumption tax in 1989, were only possible because the Takeshita faction, the dominant group in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, was united behind the move. The finance ministry had wanted to delay the emergency spending package until later this autumn. But it was given a political instruction from the top of the LDP to bring it forward. That order almost certainly came from Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former head of the Takeshita faction, who resigned last month over his involvement in the bribery scandal. With Mr Kanemaru's departure, the administration lacks a member with enough authority to forge a consensus. Indeed, agreement may now be even harder to achieve because the power struggle to succeed Mr Kanemaru has pitted Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, against Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, his ambitious predecessor who remains a senior figure within the ruling party. Many western analysts believe Japan's economic success rests upon the strength of the triangular relationship between business, bureaucrats and politicians working in concert. The current downturn is so threatening because it is prompting new tensions in these relationships at a time when the political authority to maintain order has been undermined. Unless Japan's political leadership can reassert its authority quickly, there will be an increasing risk that the Japanese economy will fall into a prolonged decline.</p>

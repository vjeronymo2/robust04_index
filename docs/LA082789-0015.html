			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCO'S QUICK PROFIT IN ITS SALE OF SOLAR TECHNOLOGY IS BAD NEWS FOR THE NATION  </P> <P> I must also echo Representative Elton Gallegly's sentiments ("Siemens Wins  Bidding for Pioneering Arco Solar Unit") that the sale of Atlantic Richfield  Company's Arco Solar Inc. to Siemens of West Germany is not "in the best  interests of the country's economy or national defense."  </P> <P> In this case, we are not only talking about U.S. technology that can positively  build the U.S. competitive edge, provide reliable domestic energy, lower  environmental degradation, strengthen national security, lessen Third World  debt and aid the U.S. balance of trade. We are also talking about technology  that John Q. Public has helped pay for via federal and state taxes.  </P> <P> The focus on energy issues is increasing rapidly because of all its  geopolitical, economic and environmental baggage: global warming, oil spills,  our growing reliance on imported oil, the increasing cost of imported oil ($40  billion to $50 billion er year), projected energy price increases and the  battle over cleaning up urban air. We can't lose sight that photovoltaics (and  solar energy technology in general) can help tremendously in providing  solutions to these problems.  </P> <P> Inefficient energy use wastes at least one-twelfth of the gross national  product of the United States. If the United States were as energy-efficient as  Western Europe, we could save $200 billion a year in energy costs. If we  selected the best energy buys until the year 2000, we could save several  trillion dollars -- enough, in principle, to pay off the national debt.  </P> <P> In 1988, Japan and Germany surpassed the United States in photovoltaic  research. Exxon spent twice as much money (over $1 billion) cleaning up the  Alaskan oil spill as the federal government has spent, in total, on  photovoltaic research and development.  </P> <P> While photovoltaics is not the only solution to our energy and environmental  problems, it should be considered a major contender. Americans cannot afford to  let their investments in photovoltaic development slip away.  </P> <P> MARC RIES  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party Political </F> Bureau; place and date not given]    [Text] The political bureau has been following with great  concern the insistence by influential military forces in Sanaa  of continuing the military crime in 'Imran, and in all of Yemen,  to escalate military tension. These influential forces, up to  the issuance of this statement, continue to amass large forces  to besiege and strike at the 3d Armored Brigade and heroic  citizens from among the sons of the people of Jabal Iyal, Yazid,  Iyal Sarih, Sufyan, Arhab, Bani Abd, and other honorable  citizens.    The 3d Armored Battalion moved to new positions in the Sanaa  Governorate, and was subjected to barbarous and treacherous  aggression by the 1st Armored Brigade, Republican Guard forces,  and central security and tribal forces, which were transported  to 'Imran from other areas a few hours before the military  conflict, which was led by such warmongers as Humud Atif and Ali  Hamid Qulaydan. These forces were not satisfied with imposing  an intensive siege on the new positions to which the 3d Armored  Brigade had moved, but prevented the passage of food and medical  supplies, as well as the transport of the dead and wounded to  the hospitals. Indeed, they went further in their violations of  human rights and the genuine ideals and norms of our Yemen  people by throwing the wounded into prison and subjecting them  to torture. They were treated as if they were POW's from a  foreign army -- not the sons of the same homeland. This  irresponsible stance by the ruling military family reached its  peak when it left the wounded to die on the battlefields.    The military family provided aid only for certain wounded  persons -- this is the expression of an abominable secessionist  trend. More atrocious than this was that the representatives of  the ruling military family supervised the dragging of the  wounded as POW's to central security cells, where they were  tortured while interrogated. This is a cheap game they play for  the media, without any conscience or moral restraint.    There is no doubt that giving orders to strike at the 3d  Brigade was tantamount to a declaration of civil war, which was  issued by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, frankly and clearly,  on 27 April, prior to the military conflict in 'Imran. This was  the same day that aggression was committed against the 3d  Armored Brigade in 'Imran, as part of a military and political  plan by the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Alliance for  Reform, and the ruling military family. The aggression was  committed two hours after the war declaration was delivered by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the secretary general of the  General People's Congress. It is now clear that the plan is  aimed at emptying the northern governorates of the brigades  which moved there after the declared union of north and south  Yemen, and at their bloody liquidation by dealing with them one  at a time in a gradual manner. This has been done by contriving  many different, flimsy justifications as a prelude to engagement  in an overall war, a war planned by fundamentalist forces in the  General People's Congress and the Yemeni Alliance for Reform, in  addition to external fundamentalist forces, and with the support  of the ruling military family in Sanaa.    It is now confirmed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is  the one who is personally commanding this grave military action  from the operations room. It is he who is issuing directives to  pursue the 3d Brigade and liquidate it, after having given  orders for striking and annihilating it. He has been leaking  misleading information to the international news media about the  annihilation of the 3d Brigade during the incident, to cover his  pursuit of the heroes of the brigade as they moved to to new  positions. It is he who is personally supervising ongoing  preparations to strike the Ba Suhayb Brigade in Dhamar, as well  as the build-up of reinforcements around it, and the besieging  of that brigade by Republican Guard and central security  brigades, along with the assistance from battalions from the  Majd Brigade, which was moved from Bajil in the Hudaydah  Governorate.    The 3d Brigade faced with rare heroism the atrocious  conspiracy and the loathsome crime to which it was subjected.  It managed to withdraw outside its camp after its stores and  ammunitions, as well as a part of its forces, had been  destroyed. Had President Ali Salih been a unionist and  responsible for all the people, in accordance with the oath he  took before the House of Deputies, in the name of God Almighty,  to bear his responsibility with honesty -- had the president  been so, it was in his power, while commanding and directing the  battle personally, to work for the preservation of what was left  of the 1st and 3d Brigades. However, he gave orders for the  pursuit of the 3d Brigade, with the aim of annihilating it. He  pushed two brigades from the Republican Guards and central  security forces, under the command of his brothers, in addition  to other warmongers such as Sheikh Humud Atif and Sheikh Ali  Hamid Qulaydan, to pursue the brigade after it was cut off from  food supplies, fuel and water.    We appeal to public opinion; human rights organizations; the  Yemeni, Arab and International Red Cross and Red Crescent  Societies; and to all those with living human consciences to  provide essential and urgent assistance to save the wounded,  remove the dead, and stop the horrific actions to which the  wounded are being subjected in the prisons of the ruling  military family.    This crime indicates that those who are managing and  implementing this operation, bit by bit, do not care about  sacrificing everyone to stay in power. This confirms what  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih said in Amman, that he was ready  to wage war and sacrifice 30,000 soldiers to liquidate the YSP.  What is being prepared and planned now must be regarded as part  of a bloody and horrible venture, which is likely to inflict  great harm on the unity of the homeland, its security, and  stability. Indications of the start of the implementation of  this reckless venture appeared in a political statement issued  personally by President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in a speech he  delivered in the Sab'in ground on 27 April. It included attacks  which were inappropriate from a head of state against a party  which is his partner in power, and against opposition parties  and the dialogue commission which [word indistinct] that great  historical and national achievement reflected in the pledge and  accord document.    The president was not satisfied with that only, but was keen  to include in his speech an open call to spark off a civil war,  and issue a fatwa for a jihad, similar to the fatwas issued by  heads of terrorist organizations to justify their acts of murder  and assissinations. The speech called on every individual to  make himself a judge, a prosecutor general, and the president of  a court. This indicates a desire to undermine the constitutional  and legal foundations of the unified state and open the door to  anarchy, terrorism, and civil war as an excuse for secession.    The YSP, as it is part of the masses of our people and its  political parties and its vital forces, expresses its deep  concern over the insistence of the ruling military family in  Sanaa to spark off of a civil war in Yemen. It holds  responsible those adventurist forces. President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih must bear full and personal responsibility for what has  happened, and continues to happen with regard to the shedding of  the blood of the Yemeni Armed Forces and the threatening of the  unity of the homeland, since orders were issued to part of the  Yemeni Army to strike at another part of the same army. This is  unethical and unpatriotic, and we cannot remain silent about it.  It is difficult for the people to understand the legitimacy  about which General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih was talking. It is  also difficult for all of us to understand the unity which they  speak about so flippantly, while they direct their treacherous  artillery against it.    The statement, leaked to the news media by the ruling  military family and its puppets concerning the pursuit of the  commander of the 3d Armored Brigade, the heroic Colonel (Sayf  al- Bakri) and the militant brother Yahya Dahis, is a  disgraceful act indicating the bankruptcy of its authors. It is  an attempt to get a cover for the justification of the  massacres. The adventurers in Sanaa are planning to continue  the attack on the 3d Armored Brigade at its new positions north  of Sanaa. Those who issued these orders should be ashamed of  themselves. The commander of the brigade, accused by the ruling  family of having given orders to the 3d Brigade, was taking his  lunch in a mess with members of the joint military commission in  the presence of the U.S. and French military attaches and a  number of officers of the brigade. Brother Yahya Dahis was not  even present at the camp. The commander of the brigade was  surprised by the explosion inside the camp, as was the joint  military commission.    We can say with all confidence that those who should be put  on trial are the adventurers who issued orders to start the  implementation of the extermination plan and above all the civil  war. The criminal and engineer of terror, murder and  assassination, is Col. Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, who began the  implementation of the first phase of this war when he struck the  unarmed 5th Brigade at Harf Sufyan. He then continued his war  against the 3d Brigade.    He may continue it in a different phase tomorrow and in a  different place in the northern governorates and face units  moving towards southern governorates.    The attack against the 3d Brigade is a detestable crime  which  will not pass away easily and the insistence on besieging and  pursuit of this brigade, aimed at annihilating it, will also not  pass away easily. Because that means the launching of total  civil war, whose responsibility and aftermath will rest on those  adventurous secessionists. The spokesman stressed that true  unity is the unity being manifested today in its various  aspects, insofar as the heroes of the 3d Armored Brigade are  joining together with hundreds of thousands of the heroes of the  al-Sanadid tribe in the areas to which the brigade's positions  have been moved, and where it was welcomed in a brotherly,  nationalistic and unionist manner. Those heroes who are coming  together today as one are the true unionists, while those  adventurists implementing the plot to detonate civil war in  Yemen [words indistinct] are the true secessionists.</p>

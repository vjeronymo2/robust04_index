			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Russian government battles with farmers on grain prices A battle over grain prices is growing between the Russian government and farmers as this year's grain harvest draws to a close. Officials yesterday forecast that the harvest would reach between 90m and 100m tonnes. For the first time since the collectivisation of Russian agriculture, the government is buying grain from its own producers at market rates rather than at a state price. But grain producers are balking at what they complain are prohibitively low prices and warn that impoverished farms may be unable to bring in the harvest in some regions. Mr Nikolai Rybakov, a manager at Roskhlebprodukt, the state grain purchaser which was transformed into a joint stock company, said yesterday that the government had bought about 2m tonnes of grain so far, just half of the amount bought by the end of August last year. Roskhlebprodukt's granaries are not filling up because farmers are lobbying to persuade the government to buy their grain at the 'indicative price' of between 200,000 and 220,000 roubles (Dollars 93 and Dollars 102) a tonne agreed by the regional government officials and producers in the spring. But Roskhlebprodukt is, for the first time, trying to operate like a private company. 'We look at the rates in regional commodities markets and then we decide what price to pay farmers,' Mr Rybakov said. He said that Roskhlebprodukt had been paying between 90,000 and 180,000 roubles a tonne of grain, 'but we cannot pay farmers more than the world prices'. Some regional authorities warn that Moscow's financial austerity could jeopardise the harvest. Agriculture officials in the east of the country said that because of a shortage of fuel and spare parts only 55 per cent of the crop had been harvested. But the Russian government, struggling to keep inflation in check, appears determined to face down the farmers. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, warned farmers in central Russia at the weekend that the state would not pay more than world prices for grain. If farmers refused to sell at these prices, he cautioned, the government 'is buried under more favourable offers from foreign grain producers'. His tough statements came two days after farmers demonstrated in Moscow to protest at the government's 'criminal destruction of Russian agriculture'.</p>

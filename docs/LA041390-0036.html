			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-ABORTIONIST STIRS STRONG REACTIONS  </P> <P> McMillan says, ". . . I murdered a child." I suggest she mitigate her offense  by hopping in her Mercedes 380SL, driving up to Central L.A. and adopting one  of the hundreds of black, Hispanic, or physically challenged babies whose  mother practiced what McMillan preaches.  </P> <P> That would accomplish so much more than attempting to deny a woman the right to  choose. Better yet, McMillan should gracefully bow out of the fight. Her thread  of credibility is hopelessly frayed.  </P> <P> DENNIS D. JAMES, Ranch Santa Margarita  </P></p>

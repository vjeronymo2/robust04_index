			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: OTC outstandings may top Dollars 30,000bn - Derivative Instruments The total value of outstandings in the over-the-counter derivatives market seems likely to exceed Dollars 30,000bn by the end of this year, according to Swaps Monitor, the specialist New York-based publication. The projections - based on limited information currently available - imply growth this year of at least 20 per cent. Swaps Monitor estimates that the global market in interest rates swaps - one of the most popular derivatives contracts - will be more than Dollars 12,000bn compared with Dollars 8,200bn in 1993. The 1994 projections are contained in the publication's annual review of the derivatives industry*, which consists of a comprehensive breakdown of figures for 1993. The survey shows that the outstanding value of OTC contracts increased by 20 per cent last year to reach Dollars 25,500bn. Foreign exchange forward contracts - the biggest single class of business - increased to Dollars 9,500bn from Dollars 8,400bn. The outstanding value of forward rate agreements and interest rate options also rose, to Dollars 3,500bn from Dollars 3,300bn and to Dollars 2,000bn from Dollars 1,200bn, respectively. The survey also indicates that there is a high degree of concentration in the OTC market with a few large players controlling large chunks of business. * The World's Major Derivatives Dealers: Swaps Monitor Publications, Inc 648 Broadway, suite 705, New York, NY 10012 Telephone (212) 254 9500</p>

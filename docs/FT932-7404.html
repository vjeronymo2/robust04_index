			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Two deficits worse than twice one A three-month period of falling UK unemployment is still not enough to establish that the peak has passed. The probability, however, is that unemployment has levelled off. Even that, however, is remarkable, given that unemployment is usually a lagging indicator and that the forecasting fraternity expected much worse. The main danger to UK recovery now lies in a delayed effect from the European recession, which started after Britain's but is now of comparable severity. There is not all that much scope for domestic demand to rise more quickly. The 5 per cent 'output gap' shown at the bottom of the table is the Bank of England's central estimate of the gap between the actual level of output and that consistent with a stable rate of inflation. This could be an over-estimate and would have to be filled gradually and without more sterling depreciation. Some 3 percentage points of the gap corresponds to the UK current balance of payments deficit. A sustainable recovery would involve taking up this part of the slack with exports or import savings. There is thus, at most, 2 per cent that could be taken up by an above-trend rise in domestic spending. If growth is already, or is likely soon to be, above trend, there is, as the National Institute for Economic and Social Research rightly says, little scope for further stimulus. The main longer-term problem comes, of course, from the twin deficits: budget and balance of payments. The twins have long been familiar from discussions of the US economy. What no one can say is whether they are like a bomb on a very slow fuse - as in the US - or one liable to blow up early, as in the UK in the 1970s. The twin deficits have connected remedies: cutting the growth of spending, or raising taxes. (If such curbs are in the end offset by higher private-sector borrowing, they will still be worthwhile. For the balance of payments 'problem' will then become a self-correcting private-sector one, as the Treasury once correctly argued.) The usual argument against restrictive fiscal measures is that they just make a hole in the economy which would worsen the recession. That was the valid argument for Norman Lamont's 'Augustinian' policy of Pounds 10bn pa of deferred tax increases. But, now that there are fairly strong signs of domestic recovery, it is time to start complementing them by a similar spending package. It so happens that, by one of those suspicious arithmetical coincidences, the size of the current payments deficit, estimated by the NIESR at just under 3 per cent of GDP, is almost identical to that part of the budget deficit believed by the Treasury to be structural. Many mainstream economists argue that freeing resources for exports and import-saving will not be enough without another devaluation. That is highly perverse counsel. Even the UK's ERM departure was widely seen as competitive depreciation. A further dose would confirm the worst suspicions and help unleash a beggar-my-neighbour trade and exchange-rate war. If a further improvement in UK competitiveness is required, the most promising route would be a rate of inflation below that of competitors. Evidence that this is achievable is that UK pay costs per unit of output have been falling by nearly 3 per cent a year. There are more signs that UK industry is competitive already and that the payments gaps reflects a combination of overseas recession and insufficient UK capacity. In the 1980s, the UK share of world manufacturing exports was stable or even rising slightly, in strong contrast to the 1970s. This is despite the fact that the real exchange rate (measured by price competitiveness) was much less favourable than it has since become. UK budgetary retrenchment will not close the payments gap while Europe goes into recession, but it will prepare the ground for improvement later and, meanwhile, sustain confidence.  ---------------------------------------              UK ECONOMY 1993                 % OF GDP  --------------------------------------- Current account deficit            3 Available domestic slack           2 Output gap                         5  ---------------------------------------</p>

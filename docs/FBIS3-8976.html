			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Party Chairman Vilmos Bereczki by </F> Daniel Bodnar; place and date not given: "The Democratic Party  -- They Would Cross the Threshold"]    [Text] The Democratic Party was founded on 4 September  1993. We asked Party Chairman Vilmos Bereczki, who used to be a  deputy for the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP], about the  Democratic Party's foundation and its chances at the  parliamentary elections.    [Bodnar] You also actively participated in the  reorganization of the FKGP. What made you create a new party?    [Bereczki] I did indeed participate seriously in the  creation of a multiparty system and in the reorganization of the  Smallholders' Party from 1988. It was clear to me that, among  the parties that were emerging at that time, the ideas of the  Smallholders were closest to mine. Unfortunately, this party  later fell apart and, thus, I had to join the group of  independent deputies in Parliament with the intention to engage  in politics in a smallholders' spirit until the end of the  current parliamentary cycle. I also accepted lobbying work in  the course of my activity as a parliamentary deputy, and I  presented various bills under discussion to the representatives  of various trade union organizations and asked their opinions.  A lot of modification motions emerged from this activity. The  need then emerged for a party that deals with the real problems  of society at the legislative level, a party that seeks a  consensus and, at the same time, also controls the activity of  Parliament and of the government to a certain extent. This is  how the Democratic Party emerged.    [Bodnar] How would you characterize the Democratic Party?    [Bereczki] The Democratic Party is a program party in the  center, and it is trying to give an adequate political answer to  society's challenges. Within this, in the current situation,  given that the challenges of the left are rather strong in  Hungary, according to its program, the Democratic Party  represent a bourgeois leftist trend, one similar to one wing of  the Smallholders' Party before 1945. I think that our party  provides an alternative in the sense that those who do not want  to vote for a party that lies more to the left than we do can  find a proper bourgeois organization in the Democratic Party.    [Bodnar] On whose votes are you primarily counting?    [Bereczki] We have recently enjoyed some success primarily  to the benefit of the fallen middle classes. In addition, we  have achieved results among people working in health care and  welfare. Among our supporters, I can also mention the  approximately 100,000 victims of the "bio-earthwarm" affair,  whose interests no one dared to represent in Parliament, apart  from myself.    [Bodnar] What is the financial situation of your party?    [Bereczki] We do not receive any government support at all.  Our opinion is that we must return to the previous practice in  which parties did not operate using taxpayers' money.    [Bodnar] Which parties are close to the Democratic Party?    [Bereczki] Primarily those parties that think that the  players in political life should come to a certain minimum  agreement. There can be opposing ideas, but not conflicts. We  do not have any reason for this because, apart from the economic  difficulties, no other pressure is being exercised on this  country and, therefore, it is useless to be hitting, kicking,  and biting one another. We must find a way to settle conflicts  in a European way and, in our view, the fate of this country  will be primarily decided on economic and social issues, and not  issues that express superficial political helplessness.    [Bodnar] What election results are you counting on?    [Bereczki] I think that we will reach the 5-percent  threshold in any case. We hope that many citizens who would not  otherwise have voted will vote because of our appeal, because  they are interested in all the things that we have already  succeeded in achieving. I would like to mention here that my  proposals were taken into consideration on the issue of  increasing pensions, and the government's media proposal is also  very similar to my original motion. We find it promising that  our party has thousands of members, we have more than 200  organizations in the provinces, and a lot of people are asking  to become members. I think that this definitely deserves  attention in the current situation.</p>

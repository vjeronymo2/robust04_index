			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / NTT battle with competitors hots up The battle between NTT, Japan's largest telecommunications company, and its smaller competitors over use of NTT's local network intensified yesterday as three long-distance telecoms operators asked the authorities to step in. DDI, Japan Telecom and Teleway Japan have asked the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to intervene in talks with NTT, stalled because of differences over rates set by NTT for use of its local network. The companies, which have been negotiating with NTT for the past five years, claim this prevents them from offering discounts to customers equivalent to the discounts NTT can offer for the same services. The three compete with NTT as long-distance carriers but depend on using NTT's local network. They want to set up so-called virtual private networks (VPNs), allowing users to cut their communications bills substantially by using public networks as though they were internal networks. NTT has already started providing VPN services. This is the second time in recent months that NTT has been accused of using its monopoly over the local network to impede the business of its long-distance competitors. The latest row is likely to support claims that NTT should be broken up into separate local and long-distance businesses to introduce greater competition into Japan's telecommunications market and ensure existing competition is given a fair chance. NTT faces a decision by the Japanese government next year on its future status. The three long-distance carriers have been asking NTT to allow them to set their own rates for VPN calls made on NTT's local network so that they can offer their own customers similar discounts to what NTT offers. NTT counters it is happy to link the three carriers to its local network for VPN services but cannot allow them to set rates for use of its own network. 'The local network is NTT's business,' an NTT official said. Japan's telecommunications policy, which separates long-distance and local operations, has not kept up with developments in the industry, such as the emergence of new services such as VPN. To accommodate the emergence of these new services, policy should reflect the need for telecoms operators to provide end-to-end services, the NTT official noted.</p>

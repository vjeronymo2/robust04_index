			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE: IN SEARCH OF . . . RAQUEL WELCH  </P> <P> She made an early acting career of skimpy on-screen outfits in B and C movies,  but later quieted skeptics with her comedic skills in "The Three Musketeers"  (1974) and her SRO performances on Broadway as Lauren Bacall's replacement in  the Tony Award-winning "Woman of the Year." Now, soon to turn 50 (Sept. 5),  Raquel Welch is gradually easing herself out of the role of actress, aiming at  a new career as a producer.  </P> <P> Acknowledging Hollywood's unkindness to aging actresses, she hopes "in five  years time I wouldn't have to be in front of the camera" and could be producing  full-time, developing strong film roles for women.  </P> <P> "I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with anyone," Welch says. "I think  they are waiting to be told. . . . This is a marketplace. Here, they are ready  for people with ideas. I have plenty of ideas."  </P> <P> Not that she's disappeared. She's just released her fourth fitness video ("Body  &amp; Mind") and has made a TV movie each of the last three years. But she  hasn't had a feature film role since 1982 when Debra Winger replaced her in  MGM's "Cannery Row." She later sued MGM and was awarded $10.8 million, a  judgment that's been appealed.  </P> <P> "My feature career got cut off at the knees" with the "Cannery Row" incident,  Welch admits, but feels it's now behind her.  </P> <P> Working out of an office at First Management, an arm of Guber-Peters  Entertainment, she's a bit cagey about projects she says she has in development  -- "You're talking about a cake that is baking, and I'm not ready to open the  oven door yet." She mentions features, TV movies, miniseries and sitcoms that  she would produce and appear in, including a miniseries on controversial '30s  torch singer Libby Holman, but won't provide many details.  </P> <P> The face and body that made her famous were "my ticket to ride," Welch says,  although she concedes that the sex-symbol stereotype can be a trap. "Here I am  an actress in my late 40s -- I don't look like that, but that's where I am  emotionally and personally.  </P> <P> "I am grown up and I don't have any yen to play in 'Splash,' you know?"

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 26 (XINHUA) -- The five principles of  peaceful coexistence provide a sound basis for building a new  international order, according to China-based Indian and Myanmar  [Burma] ambassadors in recent interviews with XINHUA.    The five principles of peaceful coexistence, namely mutual  respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity,  mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each other's  internal affairs, [equality and mutual benefit] and peaceful  coexistence, were jointly promoted by China, India and Myanmar  in June 1954.    Indian Ambassador to China Das Gupta told XINHUA that India  and Myanmar were the first two countries outside the socialist  camp to establish diplomatic relations with China, following the  birth of the People's Republic of China in 1949.    In April 1954, India and China signed an agreement on trade  and intercourse between the Tibet region of China and India.  The five principles came to be formulated by the two sides  during discussions on this agreement and they were incorporated  in the preamble of the agreement as guiding principles in  India-China relations, he said.    The leaders of the two countries believed that the  principles  also had a wider application. They were relevant not only to  bilateral ties but as guiding principles for international  relations generally. This was the message of the joint  statement of the prime ministers of India and China in New Delhi  on June 28, 1954, he said.    "We are deeply convinced that these principles remain as  relevant today as they were in 1954," said the Indian ambassador.    They provide a peaceful, just and cooperative international  order in which countries may cooperate with others but not  interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, he  stressed.    Recalling the five principles enshrined in the Myanmar-China  joint statement on June 29, 1954, Myanmar ambassador to China U  Set said that the early 1950s was a time when the whole world  faced insecurity and instability with the threat of nuclear war.    Having gone through a period of foreign domination, Myanmar  and China shared similar perceptions on the desire for peace,  for preservation of newly-won independence, sovereignty and  territorial integrity, and for the right to choose and shape our  own destiny, U Set said.    Both countries believed that if these principles were  observed by all nations in the world, peace, security and mutual  trust and confidence would be restored and the fears of  aggression and interference in internal affairs could be  avoided, he noted.    In the past 40 years since the annunciation of the  principles, U Set continued, Myanmar and China have stuck to  them and developed a brotherly friendship based on these  principles.    These principles remain as valid as they were 40 years ago,  he stressed.    Though the Cold War has ended, the Myanmar ambassador  pointed  out, the current world remains marked with disputes and armed  conflicts, with religious and ethnic conflicts, with  inequalities and injustice. And political, economic, and social  problems still abound in the world today.    The world still faces many instances of resorting to force  rather than trying to seek peaceful solutions. Direct or  indirect attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other  countries still exist, he added.    On the other hand, in this increasingly interdependent  world,  there is a growing need for nations to unite and cooperate with  each other to achieved progress and development, he said.    It therefore becomes imperative that all nations should try  to strictly adhere to the five principles that are essential for  the creation of a peaceful, just and equitable international  order, the ambassador concluded.</p>

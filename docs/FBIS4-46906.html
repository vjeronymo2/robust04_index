			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by the Republic of Tatarstan Center for Social </F> Problems under the rubric "Social Monitoring: Month by Month":  "How We Lived in March: We Continue the Monthly Publications on  the Standard of Living of Our Republic's Population"]    [Text] Recall that the standard of living is assessed by  the criterion of personal buying power, while the cost of living  is determined by the system of consumer budgets: the minimum  living standard and the minimum consumer budget. In accordance  with the RT [Republic of Tatarstan] Law "On the Minimum Living  Standard in the Republic of Tatarstan" signed by the president  of the RT, M. Shaymiyev, on 20 October of last year, the cost  amount, make-up, and structure of the minimum living standard  are periodically published in the mass information media. The  republic's inhabitants should know the cost amount of the  minimum living standard for the additional reason that according  to the RT Law "On the Minimum Wage," the minimum amount of labor  payment cannot be lower than the minimum living standard.    So, according to RT Goskomstat [State Statistics Committee]  data for March, the value of the minimum living standard for  Tatarstan rose by 11.1 percent (at an absolute value of 3,729  rubles [R]) and totaled R37,445 as opposed to R33,716 in  February. And expenditures for food rose by 11  percent and totaled R28,808 or 76.9 percent in the structure of  the minimum living standard [MLS] (figure 1 [not reproduced]),  expenditures for nonproduction goods increased by 16  percent and totaled R3,420 (9.1 percent), and expenditures for  personal paid services rose by 7 percent and totaled  R3,495 (9.33 percent). Analysis of the expenditure headings of  the minimum living standard shows that in March prices for  nonfood goods rose at a faster rate (16 percent) than for food  (11 percent) and for personal paid services (7 percent).    The cost of the minimum consumer budget [MCB] in March rose  by 8.5 percent and totaled R131,984 as opposed to R121,595 in  February. The structure of expenditures of the MCB: expenditures  for food--R53,085 (40.2 percent), expenditures for  nonfood goods--R36,077 (27.3 percent), expenditures  for personal paid services--R36,750 (27.8 percent),  and expenditures for taxes and other payments--R6,071  (4.6 percent).    Analysis of the cost of the minimum living standard by  cities  and regions of the republic shows that the cities of Kazan  (R40,324) and Naberezhnyye Chelny (R35,678) continued to be the  most "expensive" in Tatarstan in March, while the "cheapest"  were the city of Bugulma (R32,822) and Aksubayevskiy and  Sabinskiy rayons (R31,437 and R31,516, respectively).    Besides the consumer budgets, personal income is also  classified as a basic social indicator. According to the rough  estimates of RT Goskomstat, average per capita income for  Tatarstan in March was R90,100, which is 1.2 times the February  figure (R74,870).    In studying the rate of growth in the cost of the minimum  living standard and average per capita income during 1993, we  saw that average income during the year rose by a factor of 9.7,  while the minimum living standard rose by a factor of 7.3 (see  RESPUBLIKA TATARSTAN of 27 January 1994), that is to say, last  year the standard of living of the average statistical resident  of the republic did not decline at least. But if we study the  year from March 1993 through March 1994, we get a slightly  different picture. In March of last year, the MLS was R4,500 and  average per capita income was R11,800, while in March of this  year the corresponding figures were R37,440 and R90,110. During  the period from March of last year through March of this year,  average per capita income rose by a factor of 7.64, while the  cost of the MLS rose by a factor of 8.32. This means that the  rise in prices exceeded growth in our income and the standard of  living began to fall in 1994.    Here mistakes made in managing the economy most likely began  to have an effect. For example, the Government just did not  manage to "force" the directors of certain enterprises to comply  with the law on the minimum wage and instead of R30,000 (the  "minimum" in the RT since February of this year), R14,620 (the  minimum for the Russian Federation) are paid. This is another  example: the minimum living standard in March "stretched" to  R37,400, while the "minimum" is balanced at just R30,000. But we  have already written that the minimum living standard is the  line where poverty begins. And that in evaluating the standing  of living the cost of the minimum consumer budget must be taken  as the reference point rather than the cost of the minimum  living standard.</p>

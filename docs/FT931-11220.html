			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: St Lucia's banana exports to Britain St Lucia's banana exports to Britain last year reached 133,000 tonnes, 2,100 tonnes more than in 1991, according to the island's producers' association, writes Canute James in Kingston. The island is the largest producer in the Windward group of the eastern Caribbean, and its earnings from exports last year were USDollars 68.1m, some Dollars 10m more than 1991'. Mr Elijah Marquis, chairman of the St Lucia Banana Growers Association, said earnings would have been higher but for the devaluation of sterling.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BYRD SUGGESTS AID CUTS OF 10%-20% FOR SOME NATIONS  </P> <P> Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) suggested today that countries receiving the  biggest share of U.S. foreign aid, which includes Israel, could face cuts of as  much as 10% or 20%.  </P> <P> Byrd, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, did not mention Israel  or other major recipients such as Egypt, Greece, Turkey, the Philippines and  Pakistan in a Senate speech.  </P> <P> But the former Senate Democratic leader said cuts in aid for some countries  could be "substantially larger" than the 5% across-the-board reduction for all  recipients proposed recently by Senate Republican leader Bob Dole in order to  redistribute the funds to Eastern Europe and Latin America.  </P> <P> "Some countries, certainly the largest of our historic aid recipients, can  probably take cuts substantially larger than 5% -- somewhere between 10% and  20% would be more realistic, I would think," Byrd said.  </P> <P> A cut of 20% for Israel, the largest single recipient at $3 billion, would  reduce aid by $600 million.  </P> <P> "Some recipients might not take any cut at all," Byrd said. "There is one thing  for certain: No foreign aid country has earned the right to our money or  resources. And no foreign country can assume it has an American entitlement  program."  </P></p>

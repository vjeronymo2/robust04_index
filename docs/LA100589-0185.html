			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW ROUND FOR FAIRNESS DOCTRINE  </P> <P> The broadcast industry's Fairness Doctrine is proving to have more lives than  "Nightmare on Elm Street's" Freddie.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives tagged the controversial issue  to a budget reconciliation bill in an effort to force TV and radio broadcasters  to air opposing viewpoints on controversial issues or risk losing their  licenses.  </P> <P> The Democratic majority in the House has tried unsuccessfully to revive the  doctrine three times since the Federal Communications Commission killed the  regulation two years ago.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Broadcasters opposes the doctrine on First Amendment  grounds. While supporters maintain that it promotes free speech, an association  spokesman contended that it potentially would restrict speech because  broadcasters would hesitate to air any controversial issues.

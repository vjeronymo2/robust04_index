Nine of the victims died during the  incident while three died later in hospital, a police spokesman  said.    He said the crowd had marched on the bank when word went  round that a Kokomba man was inside to cash some money,  apparently to lynch him. "The bank called in the soldiers after  the crowd refused to heed appeals to disperse after failure to  convince them that no Kokomba man was inside", the police  spokesman said. When the soldiers failed to disperse the crowd  by shooting into the air, "they started shooting into the crowd  which had by then started stoning them".    The incident has undermined the relative calm that had  slowly  returned to the municipality over the past two weeks, after  previous incidents of rioting, killings, arson and looting, in  the wake of the Kokomba-Nanumba ethnic conflict, which later  engulfed the north to include the Dagombas and Gonjas. The  Tamale municipality is predominantly Dagomba.    The National Mobilisation Programme (NMP) said over 120,000  people have so far been registered as refugees and are being  held in schools, mosques, church compounds, police stations and  military barracks in the conflict areas.    More than 1,000 corpses had been buried following the  fighting, which erupted after a Nanumba killed a Kokomba man in  a marketplace row over the price of a guinea fowl. Several  others either died in the bush or were thrown into rivers or  burnt alive in their houses.    The police said all markets within the Tamale Municipality  had been temporarily closed down and a night curfew continues  while a three-month state of emergency has been clamped on the  conflict areas of Gushiegu/Karaga, Zabzugu/Tatale, east Gonja,  Nanumba, Saboba/Chereponi and Yendi.    Meanwhile, police said three persons were injured Tuesday  night when a grenade exploded at the yam market in Accra,  popularly known as "Kokomba market" because the Kokombas who are  mainly yam farmers are engaged in the supply and distribution of  the food stuff to that market. They named the three, who were  described as traders, as Kwaku Sasu and Eric Danso, on admission  with serious injuries and Joseph Asare, who had been treated and  discharged.    "No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion and no  one has been arrested. But we believe the incident is a  spillover of the Kokomba-Nanumba conflict in the northern  region", they said.    They said one unexploded grenade was found at the site of  the  incident, and that the injured were asleep when the grenade  exploded. Police said three men in military uniform were seen  in the market area about the time of the incident and that  investigations are going on.    The National Electoral Commission (NEC) has postponed  indefinitely the district election slated for 22 March in the  entire northern region and parts of the Volta and Brong-Ahafo  regions which experienced a spillover of the conflict.</p>

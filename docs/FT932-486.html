			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Guatemalan minister dismissed GUATEMALAN President Ramiro de Leon Carpio yesterday removed General Roberto Perussina, his hardline defence minister, after just three weeks in office and replaced him with a moderate, writes Edward Orlebar in Guatemala City. The new minister, General Mario Enriquez Morales, opposed the coup attempt last month by the now-deposed President Jorge Serrano and the subsequent bid by former vice-president Gustavo Espina to assume office. Gen Enriquez has been a senior negotiator in two-year-old peace talks with left-wing guerrillas. Mr de Leon said he had made the move to consolidate democracy and as a sign of his promised restructuring of the executive branch of government. The president appears to be using his popular support - and a constituency within the military - to affirm civilian authority over the armed forces.</p>

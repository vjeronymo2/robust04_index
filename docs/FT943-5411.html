			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Books: Faith in freedom - David Goodhart on a hymn of praise to civil society CONDITIONS FOR LIBERTY by Ernest Gellner Hamish Hamilton Pounds 18,99, 225 pages The existence of a flourishing civil society is what distinguishes the west from post-Marxist or Islamic societies. It is also responsible for most of what we hold dear, from economic growth to political liberty. Yet we have little idea how it came about and even find it difficult to define. Ernest Gellner's idiosyncratic hymn of praise to civil society reflects his recent re-immersion in the intellectual life of the Czech Republic, where the recreation of civil society was one of the slogans of the velvet revolution. Looking from Prague the civil society that we take for granted becomes a miracle, and one that is not easy to manufacture in a broken-down monolith like Russia. Civil society is not just the social residue left when the state is subtracted. It is altogether more attractive and subtle, requiring both a central coercive governing authority and economic pluralism. Thus armed it can sprout a cluster of institutions strong enough to prevent tyranny but which are entered and left freely. 'You can join (say) the Labour Party without slaughtering a sheep . . . and you can leave it without incurring the death penalty for apostasy'. It is civil society which has led the march to a prosperous, secular, world, but its main rival - the theocracy or ideocracy where a society is defined by its faith - has held on in large parts of the globe. Gellner describes the complex social chemistry which has produced civil society in one place but not in another. Much of the argument is wise and original, although the place of the individual and the 'private' in the Judaeo-Christian tradition seems underplayed. But this is not an essay for tidy minds. Gellner is one of the last of the great central European polymath intellectuals. He writes with staggering erudition and does not bother with hand-rails as the essay twists and turns through world history and global politics. Why is Islam growing ever stronger while Marxism has collapsed? Gellner finds the answer in the shift from the low (folkish) to the high form of Islam among the masses in Moslem countries. 'The essence of nationalism in the west is that a high - literacy-linked - culture becomes the pervasive, membership-defining culture of the total society; the same has happened in Islam, but it expresses itself in fundamentalism rather than nationalism, though the two are sometimes conflated'. In fundamentalist states like Iran there is little civil society and not much pressure for more. Yet it is not clear that Islam and civil society are incompatible; Malaysia, Turkey and pre-civil war Bosnia have all combined them. Nor is it clear that the desire of many post-Marxist societies to establish, or re-establish, civil society is sufficient. 'The bourgeoisie which is being begged to crawl out from under the stones of the Communist monolith does not look promising. Where are the Forsytheskis and the Buddenbrookovs?'. He concludes, reluctantly, that China might have made the right choice in putting economic reform before political reform. Conversely he is optimistic about the prospects for world government and expresses none of the fashionable anxieties about the withering of civil society and the collapse of community in the west. The parting note is equivocal. Reviewing East Asia's combination of economic success and almost feudal hierarchy he concludes: 'Whether we like it or not, the deadly angel who spells death to economic inefficiency is not always at the service of liberty. He had once rendered liberty some service, but does not seem permanently at her command. This may sadden those of us who are liberals and were pleased at being given such a potent ally - but facts had better be faced'.</p>

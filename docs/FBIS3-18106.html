Both companies, which presently have  minor common interests in cable networks throughout 11  countries, are preparing what is already known in the United  States as the "electronic highway," i.e. cable networks through  which any possible information can be transmitted.    So far, Philips and United were competitors on the newly  emerging market for cable TV in Europe. The joint venture they  intend to establish by the end of the current year, will not  only be the biggest, but also the only private operator. Unlike  in the United States, most cable TV networks in Europe are still  controlled by municipalities or by semi-public institutions such  as the German Bundespost. [passage omitted]    According to spokesmen for United and Philips, the new  company has a very strong growth potential. Right now, steps  have already been taken in order to acquire an interest in cable  networks worth another 5 million connections in 10 European  countries. According to United's Chief Executive W. Eisner,  both companies benefit from the European trend toward  privatization of cable networks.    United International is only operational outside the United  States. [passage omitted]    United International has business interests in the Far East,  Czechia, Brazil, and Chili.    In Europe, most networks are still being used to transmit  radio and television only. However, Philips is mostly  interested in the future transmission of other information. The  concern from Eindhoven is obviously thinking of applications  such as video movies, music and other information products.    The European Union is also interested in the new  technological possibilities offered by cable television  networks. A working party with representatives from telephone  companies, cable operators, and electronics manufacturers such  as Philips, is going to examine on behalf of the European  Community, whether the implementation of an electronic highway  is feasible.</p>

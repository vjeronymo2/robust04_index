			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. NEIL SOLOMON: FOOT THERAPY  </P> <P> Question: My boyfriend is trying to persuade me that foot massage not only  feels good, but also has health benefits. Is there any medical basis for what  he says, or is he just giving me a line?  </P> <P> Answer: Foot massage helps improve circulation and relieve tension. In fact,  some people maintain that, when properly done, it helps relax the entire body.  </P> <P> A byproduct of foot massage is that it provides an opportunity for checking the  feet, and for making certain that minor conditions are treated appropriately.  </P> <P> Q: When an older child is not feeling well, he can at least tell you what's  bothering him. But since a baby can't talk, the problem is very different and  can become quite frustrating. My daughter has an infant who was very cranky for  a long period of time, until finally it was found that he had an ear infection.  Isn't there any way to determine if a very young child has an ear infection  without having to go through as much aggravation?  </P> <P> A: Infants who have an ear infection, as you have learned, may be irritable and  have trouble sleeping. More specifically, they may tend to pull at the ear. The  possibility of an ear infection in the face of such behavior becomes more  likely if the child recently had a cold.  </P></p>

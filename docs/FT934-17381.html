			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Party braced for Trident setback PARTY officials last night sought to play down the impact of an expected reversal for the Labour leadership when the votes after yesterday's defence debate are counted today. Delegates are thought to have defied the National Executive Committee in approving a motion which demands the immediate cancellation of the Trident nuclear weapons programme. It had the backing of several trades unions, including the TGWU general union, and Usdaw, the shopworkers' union. The leadership is also braced for defeat on another motion, calling for defence spending to be cut to the 'average level of other European countries'. Mr John Smith's aides emphasised that the conference had already overwhelmingly passed two motions in line with party policy, so the decisions to be announced today would not matter. A largely muted debate came to life with a speech from Mr Tony Benn, the veteran Labour figure who was voted off the NEC earlier this week. Mr Benn called for a massive transfer of resources 'from military waste to the means of life', and ended with a warning that socialism was the only alternative to barbarism. Delegates supporting the motion on Trident argued that the savings from cancelling the programme could be ploughed back into public services. Mr David Clark, shadow defence secretary, said that cuts in the defence industry could not be left to the market alone, and underlined Labour's commitment to a defence diversification agency as a way of transfering skills.</p>

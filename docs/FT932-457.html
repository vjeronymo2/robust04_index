			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / City watchdogs oppose disclosure moves THE SECURITIES and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has joined forces with the two self-regulating bodies for the life insurance industry to oppose tough disclosure rules proposed by the Office of Fair Trading. SIB, Lautro, the organisation for the life insurance industry, and Fimbra, the body for independent financial advisers, are urging the Treasury to reject the recommendation that independent financial advisers be required to disclose the amount of commission they will earn from prospective customers. They are also opposing the Office of Fair Trading's proposal that life insurers spell out projected surrender values year-by-year on policies. The move underlines the retreat by Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, who six months ago said he favoured requiring life insurance companies to tell prospective customers more about the products they buy. But two weeks ago Mr Large told the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee that he opposed the disclosure rules and favoured those proposed by his predecessor, Sir David Walker. The Office of Fair Trading has already said that Sir David's proposed rules contained seriously anti-competitive elements that should be changed. The OFT has submitted a report to the Treasury, which is still considering the subject of disclosure for the sale of life insurance products. The three regulatory organisations, however, have apparently accepted the OFT's view that companies should be required to disclose their own charges in illustrating returns for prospective customers rather than be allowed to use industry average costs. But the three oppose the OFT recommendation for 'differential pricing'. That means that low-cost sales outlets such as building societies could charge less for a life insurance policy sold by a direct sales agent of the same insurance provider.</p>

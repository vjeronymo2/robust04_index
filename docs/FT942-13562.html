			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / CIS bankers fight shy of rouble zone: Belarus bank chief distances himself from economic pact with Russia Central bankers from the most important countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States agreed at the weekend that the close economic union sought by Russia was not in their interest and would be impossible to realise. The governor of the central bank for Belarus, Mr Stanislav Bogdankevich, dissociated himself from the treaty signed between Russian and Belarus two weeks ago aimed at creating an economic union so close as to deprive the smaller Slav state of any economic independence. He said that the vote expected on the agreement in the Belarus parliament on Wednesday would not approve the deal, though he said the government might then put the issue out to a referendum. Speaking to a conference on central banking in the former communist states, at Chicago Law School's Centre for the Study of Constitutionalism in eastern Europe, Mr Bogdankevich said: 'Belarus will not benefit from tying itself into a common monetary and credit system with other republics and even with Russia. 'The levels of economic development and their individual specialisations differ greatly and they are solving their problems with incompatible methods.' In an interview, Mr Bogdankevich said that he had signed the agreement - a landmark treaty between two former Soviet states and one widely seen in Russia as a harbinger of similar pacts with other CIS states - with the reservation that it broke Belarus' constitution, a major reservation, as he agreed. 'I am sure that the vote on this agreement will not pass in the parliament,' he said. No representative of the Russian central bank attended the conference, but Mr Boris Fyodorov, the former deputy prime minister for finance and present leader of the reformist Liberal Democratic Union in the Russian parliament, said that the three-quarters majority necessary to ratify the agreement in the parliament was also not available. 'Nobody can explain what Russia gains from this deal,' he said. Mr Fyodorov also claimed that the International Monetary Fund had not been informed about the agreement, which - because it changes the Belarus population's cash holdings in the Belarus coupon with the Russian rouble at the rate of one to one while the market exchange rate is 10 to 1 - will boost inflation in Russia at least in the short term. Questions were raised about this at the IMF board meeting last week which discussed the granting of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.02bn) loan to Russia, but the loan was approved in spite of the disquiet. Senior officials from Ukraine and Kazakhstan, the other two republics closest to Russia both politically and in the sense of having large ethnic Russian populations, resolutely rejected a closer economic union with Russia, while acknowledging the need for an efficient and transparent payments union. Mr Victor Yushchenko, the Ukrainian national bank chairman, said in an interview that 'there is a political mood in Ukraine that everything was better five years ago and therefore we need to seek some sort of unity with Russia. It's Utopia - Russian interests are quite different from ours.' In his conference speech, Mr Yushchenko said that 'we should not regret leaving the rouble zone - and it is not the issue of the day. Those politicians who want to join it merely want to continue receiving cheap raw materials and cheap credits.' Mr Grigory Marchenko, the deputy governor designate of the national bank of Kazakhstan, told the conference: 'I believe the rouble zone is unworkable. For far too many people it is an evasion from the major task of creating a viable banking system and a payments system.' All of the central bankers and senior officials saw the provision of external financing by the international financial institutions as the main means of alleviating what is for many of them an increasingly desperate situation. Mr Levon Barkhoudaryan, the finance minister of Armenia, who said the economy was largely dependent on Russia, nevertheless considered the main task of his central bank to be to strengthen the new Armenian currency - the dram. He said: 'Credits from the IMF and the World Bank will play a significant role in promoting the stabilisation of the economy and curtailing the balance of payments deficit.' In many cases the situation seen from the vantage point of the central bank or Finance Ministry is one on the verge of catastrophe. Mr Roman Gotsiridze, who recently resigned as the deputy premier for the economy in Georgia, said that the Georgian coupon was now trading at 500,000 to the dollar - and that 'we will face hunger this year, especially this winter. The economy has already collapsed.' Prof Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economics professor who until January had directed the Macroeconomic Finance Unit attached to the Russian Finance Ministry, told the ministers and the bank governors in an evangelical address that 'to bring yourselves back into the rouble zone, to the Russian military-industrial complex is a disaster for you. Your future is not just with Russia, it is with the whole world.'</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: NEC sees upturn in market for chips NEC, Japan's largest semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday sounded an optimistic note on the outlook for the sector in the months ahead following a period of weak demand and intense price competition that has eroded profits throughout the electronics industry. Mr Hajime Sasaki, senior vice-president, said that while the Japanese market would be flat until the spring of next year, the industry would enjoy strong demand from elsewhere. This is good news for Japanese industry, which is in a deep recession and looking for signs of recovery. Mr Sasaki said that the worst for the semiconductor industry was over. A turning point was a decision by the US in August to levy anti-dumping duties on dynamic random access memory chips imported from Korea. This had caused American chip-users to place more orders with Japanese suppliers and had placed a firm bottom on memory chip prices. Mr Sasaki cited three other factors supporting the market: the shift of the market away from one-megabit D-rams to four-megabit D-rams as the industry standard; increased sales of personal computer boards and hard disk drives because of the price war in the US; and restoration of balance between supply and demand caused by restraint among producers. Mr Sasaki was also optimistic about the outlook for demand for 16-megabit chips. NEC now produces 100,000 of the chips a month, and may raise this to 500,000 a month by March next year. NEC produced Y380bn (Dollars 3.1bn) worth of semiconductor devices in the half-year to September, a 1 per cent rise from a year ago. It now expects to product Y780bn for the entire fiscal year, or 3 per cent more than last year. NEC's pre-tax parent company pre-tax profits fell by 71 per cent to Y15.1bn in the interim period.</p>

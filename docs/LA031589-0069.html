			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CITY MANAGER MOVES TO ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> After only a year on the job, El Segundo City Manager Fred Sorsabal is  resigning to become city manager in Mission Viejo in Orange County.  </P> <P> Sorsabal, 51, said he will start his new job April 24, replacing William  Talley, who took a similar job with the city of Dana Point.  </P> <P> Sorsabal said his departure was not greatly influenced by the defeat last week  of two local ballot measures that would have raised new revenues and bailed El  Segundo out of a financial crisis. The city expects to have a general operating  deficit of $1.6 million in fiscal 1989-90.  </P> <P> Rather, Sorsabal said, he looks forward to the challenge of managing a city  that is only a year old. Mission Viejo, whose population of about 70,000 is  more than four times that of El Segundo's, became a municipality on March 31,  1988.  </P></p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / 'Gutsy governor' drops the gimmicks / Profile of the independent policies of Connecticut's Lowell Weicker HE is being called the 'gutsiest governor in America' and a precursor and political role model for Mr Ross Perot's independent bid for the US presidency. Mr Lowell Weicker, the subject of these eulogies, is the governor of Connecticut, a small New England state not normally associated with the political cutting edge. Yet Connecticut anticipated the nation's current distaste for mainstream party politics 1990 when it elected Mr Weicker on an independent ticket - making him one of only a handful of politicians this century to have won state governorships without major party backing. Mr Weicker kept Connecticut at the forefront of political consciousness by a long battle with the Democrat-controlled legislature which eventually pushed through the state's first income tax. Locally, the move was extremely unpopular. Connecticut, a state of leafy suburbs boasting one of the highest per capita incomes in the US, prided itself on being among the few remaining states without a tax on income. Mr Weicker, accused of breaking election promises, was spat on, hung in effigy before a crowd 40,000, and became the butt of bumper stickers demanding his impeachment. Nationally, however, the tax tended to be viewed far more sympathetically: as a rare example of a politician prepared to put his neck on the block by taking tough, realistic action in a severe fiscal crisis. Time Magazine labelled him the 'gutsiest governor ' while he recently won an award - named after President John F. Kennedy - for political courage. Such is Mr Weicker's national reputation that there have even been rumours he could emerge as Mr Perot's vice-presidential running mate. The Governor, however, insists there is absolutely no possibility of him quitting Connecticut to stand on anybody's Presidential ticket. Certainly, he and Mr Perot do not appear to have much in common apart from their political independence and a plain-speaking manner. While Mr Perot is a self-made businessman with no political experience, Mr Weicker has spent 30 years as a professional politician - including 18 years in Washington as a Republican senator from Connecticut. Aged 61, an imposing 6ft 6in tall, and a descendant of the family which founded the Squibb pharmaceuticals group, Mr Weicker made a name as an independent-minded Republican liberal in 1973 when he served on the Senate committee investigating the Watergate scandal and aggressively grilled President Nixon's White House staff. His term as governor underlines some of the advantages and drawbacks of independent candidates. Mr Weicker contends he only managed to get the income tax bill into law because he was an outsider. 'Neither party was going to lay claim to being the father of the tax,' he says. But independent candidates offering sweeping change can also generate unrealistic expectations of painless problem-solving, as the row over the Connecticut tax demonstrates. During the gubernatorial campaign Mr Weicker did not explicitly rule out an income tax, but he did say such a levy would be like 'pouring gasoline on the fire' of recession, and promised no new taxes if the state produced no new fiscal surprises. Defending himself against accusations of lying, he points out that by the time he took office, Connecticut faced a fiscal deficit of Dollars 1bn on an Dollars 8bn budget -the highest percentage shortfall of any state in the union. 'I'd say that's very much a new problem.' The income tax has been accompanied by a thorough reform of the state's tax structure, including a reduction in punitive business rates which were driving companies away. However, the Governor insists he never set out to be quite such a thorough-going reformer. He settled on the income tax after three weeks of seeking alternatives which did not work. He was not prepared to go along with the 'the accounting gimmicks, smoke and mirrors, crooked Ouija boards and other apparatus of deception that had led to our fiscal crisis. We resolved government would tell the truth to the people and attempt to fix the problems for the long term rather than for the next election.' The budget crisis has now eased following spending cuts and a shake-up of the civil service which removed 10 per cent of its jobs and amalgamated many services. Mr Weicker, however, is wary of the privatisation initiatives being embraced by many other governors. 'There's a lot to be said for some of it, but some of it is overblown.' His top concerns now include reviving the inner cores of cities like Hartford, Bridgeport and New Haven, islands of minority deprivation in Connecticut's sea of affluence; and attracting business to an economy hit extremely hard by recession and US defence cuts. The state is putting together Dollars 200m of its own funds, together with a Dollars 1bn from the private sector, to ease a credit crunch. As for the cities, Mr Weicker argues that one reason so many US initiatives fail is because they adopt a uniform 'one size fits all' policy which fails to take account of the uniqueness of each urban area. He intends to pursue a case by case approach. All this is improving Mr Weicker's local popularity. A recent poll in the Hartford Courant newspaper found that 41 per cent of the electorate thought his performance was good to excellent, up from 33 per cent. The governor puts this down to the fact that 'we faced up to reality. The state of Connecticut was exactly like the United States (after) 10 years of Reaganomics which said you can have it all and you don't have to pay for it. In essence, what the state of Connecticut - not just its government, but a group in the legislature, people in the street, said was: 'we know there's no such thing as a free lunch.' 'Whatever the problem is, apply realistic answers, not political answers, and the politics will take care of itself.' Easily said, but the test of this benign view will only come this autumn, when Connecticut's somewhat nervous legislators face re-election.</p>

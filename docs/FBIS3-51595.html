			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 20 Jan (AFP-NA) -- The national news agency  FIDES today reported that according to charges by Government  Minister German Quiroga, a group of Bolivian Army men reportedly  attempted to conspire against the stability of the democratic  government of President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, which was  installed in August 1993.    The alleged military conspirators presumably had the help of  Former Interior Minister Antonio Arguedas (1966-68) and the  (national) prosecutor at that time, Juan Carlos Camacho, who  have been arrested and will be arraigned before the courts  charged with conspiracy.    Quiroga told FIDES that military men are presumably  involved,  including some high-ranking officers, who are discontent with  the most recent list of promotions issued in December by the  High Military Command.    The minister also warned that these military men, whose  identity he did not reveal, "are going to be investigated in  accordance with the internal military rules and regulations, in  order to entirely clarify the case that has been the constant  concern of the nation over the past few days."    The "concern" to which the minister referred relates to the  public apparition, through the English-language weekly BOLIVIAN  TIMES in its 23 December and 11 January issues, of a former  sergeant named Ernesto Beltran Gardiazabal.    This former military man confessed that he had participated  in the infamous attacks and political murders that occurred in  Bolivia during the 1960's, which he attributes to the  anticommunist "military lodges" that were active at that time,  while also promising to provide the details known to him after  having been assured of guarantees from the government and the  judicial branch.    After the Government Ministry and the La Paz Prosecutor's  Office offered the guarantees, the imaginary sergeant never put  in an appearance.    It was then that government and military intelligence  services began to investigate the motives behind the sudden  reappearance of events that had occurred some 25 years ago.    According to Quiroga the investigation confirms that Beltran  Gardiazabal never existed, having been invented by the  conspirators with the help of Arguedas and Camacho "with the  objective of destabilizing the democratic government, thus  setting it against the Armed Forces."    Arguedas is a singular personality, having in 1968 become  famous for sending Fidel Castro the hands and campaign diary of  Ernesto Che Guevara, who had been executed in 1967 in Bolivia.    After many years of ostracism, Arguedas, who in general is  considered to be a typical "double agent," reappeared on the  political scene.    Quiroga told FIDES that the group of discontent military men  finally turned to Aguedas to fabricate the "Beltran case," with  the purpose of preparing an action to destabilize the current  government in a confrontation with the Armed Forces.</p>

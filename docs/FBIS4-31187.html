			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Andra Aurora Manta and Marcela Feraru: </F> "Alexandru Oproiu, State Secretary of the Health Ministry,  Falsified the Cirrhosis Diagnosis of Nicu Ceausescu"]    [Text] "The population of Sibiu feels pity and sympathy  for Nicu Ceausescu, although according to the findings of the  commission [investigating the 1989 December events], he was the  one who called the terrorists to come to that town," Serban  Sandulescu, senator for the PNTCD [National Peasant Christian  Democratic Party] and a member of the commission investigating  the 1989 December events, asserted during a news conference  yesterday.    The cirrhosis diagnosis, on the basis of which Nicu  Ceausescu  today walks around as a free person, was established on the  basis of an endoscopic examination that actually did not take  place at all. Nicu Ceausescu was "submitted" to that examination  by Alexandru Oproiu, state secretary of the Ministry of Health.  According to the conclusions of Senator Sandulescu, Oproiu  "deliberately falsified the diagnosis."    The PNTCD senator also said that he is in possession of a  copy of the medical records on the son of the former dictator  and that one of the physicians who had been in charge of tending  to Nicu Ceausescu in the Colentina Hospital confirmed that the  latter's cirrhosis "is merely a bedtime story for children."    Senator Sandulescu also stated that the bodies authorized to  investigate the 1989 December events "did everything possible to  conceal the truth and remove the traces." "Despite the fact  that all the persons who were summoned to bear witness in front  of the senators' commission swore to tell the truth, they  actually lied," asserted Sandulescu.</p>

			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Yeltsin may see Major before summit: Russian leader's presence at UN talks will let members voice concerns BRITAIN'S prime minister Mr John Major has invited President Boris Yeltsin of Russia to visit London on his way to a United Nations security council summit in New York, now confirmed for the end of this month. In the short visit, which has yet to be finalised, the two leaders will discuss a range of issues, including Russia's application for full membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The news of the invitation was seen in the UK as highlighting the prime minister's role on the world stage in the run-up to the election, particularly as it coincided with Tory demands for greater clarity in Labour's defence policy. Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, accused the government of 'looking for a photo-opportunity not an agenda'. Speaking in Downing Street after a meeting with Mr Boutros Ghali, who took over as UN secretary-general at the beginning of this month, Mr Major said the meeting, on January 31, would both be the first occasion for Mr Yeltsin to attend the security council as Russian president, and an early opportunity for security council members to discuss a range of matters with the new secretary-general. It will also enable security council members to discuss with Mr Yeltsin concerns about the effective control of the former Soviet Union's nuclear weapons following the country's dissolution into independent republics. There are particular worries that the smaller independent former Soviet republics might sell off some of their nuclear weapons and technology to foreign buyers. Mr Major singled out as other key subjects for discussion the enhancement of the UN's role as a 'peacemaker, peacekeeper and settler of disputes' in regional conflicts; and the 'very great importance the UN generally gives to good government and human rights'. As the UK took over the rotating presidency of the security council at the start of the month, Mr Major will chair the general meeting. Mr Major himself said yesterday that he did not claim credit for the idea of the meeting, which came from President Mitterrand of France some months ago, but that he was confident in view of the warm response it had received that it was 'an idea whose time has come'. His remarks came after both Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, and Mr Tom King, the defence secretary, renewed their demands for Labour to 'come clean' on its defence policy. Underlining that the opposition had failed to produce a document on defence despite more than 70 policy launches in the past two years, Mr Patten said Labour's position was merely 'to sit on the fence and say as little as possible.' But Mr Kaufman countered by charging the government with calling a 'stunt debate' for electoral purposes while ignoring the key issues raised by the break-up of the Soviet union. Tabling an amendment to the motion for debate in the Commons today, he demanded substantive government action to address the issues of nuclear proliferation, arms control and defence diversification.

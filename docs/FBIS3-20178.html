			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger (FDP) has called for "clear signals"  from the Chinese Government of a change in its human rights  situation. The human rights issue was of great significance in  Sino-German relations, the minister said after talks with her  Chinese counterpart, Yang Xiao, in Bonn today. A "basic  agreement" on human rights is indispensable to cooperation with  Beijing.    Germany and China joined international agreements based on  the universal applicability and indivisibility of human rights,  the minister stressed. The interstate dialogue on human rights  became a component of international law after the World War II.  Thus, a dialogue of this kind is not inadmissible interference  in a country's internal affairs. Bonn does indeed recognize the  significance of "national and regional distinctive features as  well as different historical, cultural, and religious  prerequisites." However, "basic human rights criteria" are valid  everywhere.    In the "very open" dialogue with the Chinese politician she  stressed the human rights of the individual. China, on the  other hand, has focused on "collective human rights." It is  important that these different views be discussed openly.  However, it would be "very desirable" if agreement could be  reached on the "basic human rights criteria." [passage omitted]    Yang Xiao stressed that they were able to achieve a  consensus  on many issues. However, given the differences in social order  and economic development and the different cultural  prerequisites, it is obvious that they would also have differing  views. Nevertheless, his country is ready to enter a dialogue  "based on equality."</p>

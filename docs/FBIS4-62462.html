			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 12 May (TURAN)--The meeting between  President Aliyev and Armenia's President Ter-Petrosyan is due to  take place in Moscow in the up-coming days, reports sources from  the Russian Foreign Ministry. Russia is acting as initiator and  organizer of the Armenian-Azerbaijani summit.    "The presidents of both republics are expected to sign an  agreement providing for a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops from  captured territories, and a restoration of communications,"  reported the Russian Foreign Ministry.    The Russian Foreign Ministry reports that the leadership of  Nagorno-Karabakh will sign the agreement as well.    The agreement is to be based on the agreement signed in  February 1994 by Azerbaijan's and Armenia's Defense Ministers  as well as representatives of Nagorno-Karabakh.    The key point of the agreement is the introduction of  peacemaking separating forces in the zone of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict.    "In line with the agreement, Moscow will be the guarantor of  the Armenian-Azerbaijani truce. The peacemaking forces can be  referred to as international element to the CIS peacemaking  forces, but they will be headed by Russian armed forces," told a  highranking diplomatic source to Moscow's TURAN's correspondent.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum price at a 3 1/2 -year high Platinum prices were given a boost yesterday when speculators seized on bullish comments by Mr Michael Steel, market research director of Johnson Matthey, the world's biggest platinum market group. He suggested in an interview with a Reuter correspondent in Tokyo that Japan might import record quantities of platinum and palladium this year and that the world's platinum supply surplus might disappear in 1995. Both metals are used in car anti-pollution catalysts. Some US funds took this as a 'buy' signal and in London platinum's price raced up to its highest level in three and a half years before closing at USDollars 421.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 5 an ounce. Palladium's price was 'fixed' in London at Dollars 151 an ounce, its highest since July, 1989. Mr Steel said that platinum should be helped by a pick-up in world economic activity and a steady increase in demand for platinum jewellery. Demand in Japan, the world's largest consumer of both platinum and palladium, was high because of jewellery and investment demand even though use by Japan's motor industry would fall this year, he added. Some analysts suggested that platinum prices would continue to be supported by worries about labour unrest in South Africa, the biggest producer, and also growing doubts about production at Norilsk in Russia, the second-largest. However, Mr George Milling-Stanley, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said it was not a good sign that jewellery and investment demand - rather than the industrial sector - was helping prices up in Japan. He said: 'This may well be a flash in the pan for the platinum group metals'.</p>

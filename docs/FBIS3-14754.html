Attention please.    [Durdynets] The appeal by the Supreme Council of Ukraine:  Esteemed Ukrainian citizens, Ukraine is experiencing hard times.  The economic crisis has not been overcome. Social problems have  become extraordinarily acute. Under conditions when trust in  any branch of power has gone down, the Supreme Council of  Ukraine, at the people's justifiable request, adopted the only  right decision to hold early elections first to the Supreme  Council in March and then to Ukraine's president and local  authorities in June.    So, Ukraine is on the threshold of undergoing new important  changes to its political and economic life. We have a chance to  continue the transformation of Ukraine in a peaceful way, doing  this as it was done in the majority of democratic countries in  Europe and the world: From an election to an election, replacing  the Supreme Council and therefore, the government, i.e. making  changes in the body of those who will determine state domestic  and foreign policy.    It is very good that Ukraine has avoided the use of armed  force to change political power. However, in order further to  ensure the peaceful way of revolutionary transformation in  Ukraine, the elections to the Supreme Council of Ukraine on 27  March of this year have to take place successfully.    Some facts and statements, however, demonstrate that not  everybody in Ukraine has an interest in holding these elections  successfully. There is talk about some kind of vacuum of power.  Some are even openly interested in the sabotage and disruption  of these elections. If the elections to the Supreme Council of  Ukraine do not take place, this will only increase political and  economic instability and lead to a constitutional crisis in  Ukraine.    However, there will be no vacuum of power. After all, the  current Supreme Council convocation will retain its  constitutional powers and work until March 1995. But do we  really need to go back when a change in the body of the  Ukrainian Supreme Council already can and must occur on 27 March  1994.    This is exactly why the Supreme Council of Ukraine appeals  to  its citizens, every official and authority who is involved in  organizing and holding the election campaign and asks them to  demonstrate high responsibility at this time so important to  Ukraine. Any actions and statements that lead to the disruption  or sabotage of the elections, are inadmissible. Nor are any  violations of the law on elections are admissible.    The Supreme Council of Ukraine draws the attention of the  central, district, and all area electoral commissions, state  mass media and state TV and radio leadership, to the need  essentially to improve their activity aimed at stepping up the  preelection campaign, ensuring the objectivity and fullness of  its coverage, and preventing restrictions of the rights of  candidates for deputies and electors.    Dear compatriots, let us realize our chance of changes in  the  life of each of us and our society as a whole. [Deputies then  adopted the above appeal in a vote by raising hands.]</p>

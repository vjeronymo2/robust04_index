			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Go for less accuracy in forecasts Sir, July's lower than expected public sector borrowing requirement figure (not, please, 'number') followed hard on the heels of last year's lower than estimated current account deficit. Once again, this underlines the precariousness of short-term economic forecasts. And because of the growing likelihood of a lower than budgeted PSBR out-turn for the current financial year as a whole, it also points to inaccuracy in long-term forecasting. So why can't forecasters take the hint and hedge their bets more safely by forsaking the dare-devilry of decimal-point precision, in favour of nothing more ambitious than half, or at most quarter percentage-point gradations only? (As if the difference between actual or forecast 1.2 and 1.3 per cent gross domestic product growth was at all meaningful.) Let them remember, first, that the greater the accuracy aimed at, the poorer the accuracy likely to be achieved, quite apart from the ricketiness of underlying data. Second, let awareness of their fallibility encourage more humility on their part and less gullibility on ours - both, admittedly, tall orders.

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Letter: More explicit rules of behaviour for utilities' regulators needed Sir, Your leader 'Time to review the regulators' (June 10) is right to call for a review of the regulatory process, but not for one quango, the Office of Fair Trading, to review a series of others, namely the regulators. Only the sponsoring government departments the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment, acting in concert, can do the job effectively. There are, though, other reasons for a review, beyond those you state. The proper role of the utility regulators is to balance the interests of the customer with those of the company's shareholders. The regulator should act as the referee, carefully and impartially enforcing clearly stated rules which are agreed between the utilities and the regulators for periods in excess of one year. Unfortunately the rules of the regulatory game are vague and the regulators have huge discretion over how they apply their powers. Their unpredictable intervention is now increasing the uncertainty in the utility industries. The regulated companies will be reluctant to invest where the risks are rising but the returns are eroded. And investment in Britain's infrastructure is not something we should allow the regulators to deter, however unintentionally. They must be mindful of the needs of future customers as well as the wishes of today's. Any inquiry into the regulators must therefore recognise that more explicit rules of regulatory behaviour are needed to provide a more stable business environment. It must also recognise that utilities need an adequate rate of return to encourage investment in the hugely expensive, long-term capital projects that are so important to this country's competitive position. If unchecked, the present short-sighted approach will damage the interests of customers - the very people the regulators so publicly claim to be protecting.

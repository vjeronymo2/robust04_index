			<p>CSO   <F P=106> ["Appeal of the Majority Party Political Council to all </F> Parties and Public Associations, to the Citizens of Russia":  "Conciliation Requires Charity"]    [Text] Dear compatriots!    A wave of rallies is again spilling out onto the streets of  Russian cities, there is a search again for who is right and who  is wrong, while politicians still busy themselves only with  disparaging one another and wasting time on fruitless  discussions. This was demonstrated especially graphically during  the sad half-year commemoration of the October 1993 tragedy.    In this situation we--a party of the middle class, a party  of  stability, legality, and patriotism, a party that rejects  extremism--proclaim once again that we intend to strive for  civil peace and well-being through concrete deeds. Within the  framework of our economic program we are preparing radical  reform of the taxation system and agricultural production. We  are implementing projects in the area of culture, sports,  education, and health care.    During these difficult days for Russia we are undertaking a  new initiative capable of becoming a basis for cooperation  between all political parties and other public associations for  the purpose of consolidating Russia and achieving civil peace.  We are opening a special account, money from which will go  to help families of those who died in the October 1993 clashes,  regardless of whose side they were on. The Majority Party  is making a contribution to this account, which will enable us  to provide at least 5 million rubles [R] for each family.    We urge citizens of Russia, parties, and other organizations  to contribute to the extent possible, thereby showing a true  desire for civil peace. Let those representing different views  bow their heads at the yet-not-erected monument to the victims  of the October tragedy and take a step toward one another.    By 1 June of this year we promise to make public the names  of  parties and other associations and the names of  citizens-participants in the noble action, and invite them to  take part in the observer council, which will distribute the  money collected. In the month of June all money deposited into  the special account will be transferred to accounts of those for  whom they are intended, as well as spent for commemoration of  the victims of October events.    Our particulars: KB KhELP, correspondent account 115161600  of  the Moscow Oblast main administration's clearing center of the  Central Bank of Russia, interbranch turnover No. 211004, account  700008, the Majority Party. When transferring money, please make  the notation: participation in the "October-93" action.    Our address: 6, 2 Ochakovskiy Lane, Moscow 119361.  Telephone 430-70-80.    [Signed] On behalf of the Majority Party Political Council,  Majority Party Chairman Vyacheslav Grechnev    ROSSIYA supports the initiative of the Majority Party and  intends to print the names of its participants. National  reconciliation is only possible when mercy toward the fallen  becomes a national affair.</p>

The UN Security  Council Resolution 816 bans all unauthorized flights by  helicopters or aircraft in the airspace of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and permits all necessary measures to ensure  compliance with this ban.    "At 0648 (Central European Time) the NATO F-16-type aircraft  of the U.S. Air Force engaged six aircraft. The pilots asked  the aircraft to land according to instructions; otherwise, they  would attack. This request was ignored. The NATO Flying  Falcons then attacked, downing four of them."</p>

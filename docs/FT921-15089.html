			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (9): Denmark bucks the downward trend - Nordic Region - The majority of companies experienced a substantial fall in market capitalisation, particularly those in Finland and Sweden THE majority of Nordic-based companies listed in the FT500 experienced a substantial fall in market capitalisation, particularly those in Finland and Sweden. Only Denmark bucked the overall downward trend with a relatively impressive performance, reflecting the country's economic achievements. Most of Sweden's leading companies experienced severe troubles during 1991 with declining production, investments and profitability. Eight disappeared from the FT500 - NCC, the construction group, Nobel Industries, the office equipment company Esselte, Gota bank group, the cement company Euroc, and Cardo, the investment company. Saab-Scania, the motor and aerospace company, left the bourse after all its shares were acquired by the Wallenberg family-dominated investment companies. In November, it was announced that Investor and Providentia were to be merged into one company early this year. The other large company to leave the bourse was the dairy company Alfa Laval as a result of its acquisition by the Swiss-based packaging firm Tetra Pak. Four new corporate entrants appeared from Sweden - Gambro, the pharmaceuticals company, the newly-floated Wallenberg industrial group Incentive, and the Wallenberg investment companies Investor and Providentia. It is indicative of Sweden's dismal industrial scene that only three of the 29 Swedish companies in the FT500 improved their relative positions during the year. The successful pharmaceuticals company Astra climbed from 48th to 37th to become the highest placed Swedish company. In the first nine months of the year its profits rose by 40 per cent to SKr2.58bn (Dollars 447m), due mainly to the continuing rise in demand for its anti-ulcer drug Losec. The food and pharmaceuticals conglomerate Procordia - owned jointly by Volvo and the Swedish state - rose nine places from 58th to 49th. Its earnings rose by 23 per cent in the first nine months of 1991 to Skr3.08bn. The only other Swedish company to climb up the table was the insurance conglomerate Trygg-Hansa SPP, which was formed after a merger earlier in the year. The new conglomerate rose impressively to 321st from its 1990 ranking of 417th when Trygg-Hansa first entered the table after its flotation on the Stockholm bourse in December 1989. Its profits for the first eight months of the year totalled Skr1.5bn, a quadrupling of its figure in 1990, mainly because of the improved performance of its investment portfolio. By contrast, a number of Swedish companies suffered sharp falls in relative market capitalisation during 1991. The troubled state-controlled Nordbanken dropped the largest number of places from 200th to 476th. This reflected the market's response to its mounting credit losses that look likely to total nearly SKr10bn for the year, ensuring the bank has a group deficit of around SKr4.6bn. The largest construction company in the Nordic region, Skanska, also dropped back to 169th position from 93rd in 1990. Its profits declined to SKr1.19bn from SKr1.71bn for the first eight months of the year, reflecting the fall in real estate prices and slump in the building trade. The mineral and industrial conglomerate Trelleborg - one of Sweden's corporate success stories of the 1980s - declined as well, dropping to 422nd from 312th. The corporate picture was even more dismal in Finland during 1991. This reflected the country's worst recession since 1917 with the virtual collapse of its once-important Soviet trade, a cyclical trough in the paper and pulp industry, soaring bank credit losses, and a slump in engineering production and investment. The combination of these adverse economic factors forced the Helsinki bourse into a sharp decline. Fewer than half the Finnish-based companies listed in the 1990 FT500 re-appear this time. Out go the state-controlled forestry group Enso Gutzeit, the shipbuilding company Wartsila, the industrial group Rauma Repola, Sampo and Pohjola insurance companies, the wholesalers Kesko Oy and Partek, the building materials group. As a result only five corporate entrants remain from Finland - the forestry groups Repola (after the merger of United Paper Mills with Rauma-Repola) and Kymmene; the industrial conglomerate Nokia; and two banks, Union Bank and Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP). Of those only Repola recorded an improved its position - climbing from 485th to 325th. By contrast, Denmark enjoyed a highly satisfactory corporate year. The country may have an industrial structure where small and medium-sized companies predominate but as a favourable sign of its economic success story this year the country can boast 12 companies in the FT500, three more than in 1990 with not one falling out of the table. The most impressive arrival was A P Moeller, the merchant shipping company in the form of its strange, divided structure which consists of twin parent companies D/S af 1912 and A/S D/S Svendborg. As newcomers to the table they appear at 141st and 142nd positions respectively. Berendsen (Sophus), a diverse industrial company that is the parent of Rentokil was also a newcomer to the FT500 in 1991. Novo Nordisk, Denmark's leading pharmaceutical company which is the world's leading producer of industrial enzymes, also performed well in 1991, climbing 92 places to 208th position from 317th. As a producer of insulin and diabetic care products, it now has 40 per cent of the world market in those products. In the first nine months of 1991 the company's profits climbed by 22 per cent to a healthy Dkr1.11bn (Dollars 181m), an indication of the successful merger of 1989 that brought Novo and Nordisk Gentofte together. While corporate Denmark flourished in 1991, Norway's companies stagnated in an economy over-dependent for its growth on the level of oil and gas prices but with severe mainland structural problems and a banking crisis that worsened dramatically during the year. As a result the stock market was in a jittery and depressed mood for most of the year, reflected in its generally low market capitalisation figures. There were six Norwegian-based companies listed in the FT500, all of them the same as in 1990. But only two - the pharmaceutical company Hafslund Nycomed and Saga Petroleum - improved their relative standing in the table rising from 286th to 227th and from 272th to 241st respectively. The others fell down the table. The paper products group Orkla Borregaard declined to 463rd place from 411 while Bergesen dy group, the shipowners, fell back to 323rd position from 281.</p>

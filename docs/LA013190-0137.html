			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL TRUSTCO CUTS GLENFED STAKE  </P> <P> Royal Trustco Ltd., the Toronto financial services firm that bought the failed  Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa, has cut its stake in Glenfed Inc. from  9.44% to 6.7%, or 2.04 million common shares.  </P> <P> Royal Trustco must cut its stake in Glenfed, a savings and loan holding  company, because federal regulation prohibits the owner of one federally  insured S&amp;L from holding more than 5% of an S&amp;L that it does not  control, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> Royal Trustco also owns Pacific First Financial Corp. in Seattle, a savings and  loan holding company that is managing Pacific Savings, now called Pacific First  Bank.  </P> <P> Glenfed is the Glendale holding company for Glendale Federal Bank.  </P> <P> Royal Trustco sold 836,400 Glenfed shares between Jan. 19 and Jan. 26 for  $13.02 to $17.02 a share. It plans to sell enough Glenfed shares to reduce its  stake to below 5%.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Pay cut for Next chief MR DAVID Jones, chief executive of Next, the fashion retailing company, will accept more than a 50 per cent pay cut this year as a result of financial difficulties the company is experiencing. However, it was revealed in the company's annual report and accounts that his pay fell only slightly last year to Pounds 395,000 from Pounds 404,247. Otto Versand, the German retailer that has bought the Grattan mail order business from Next has already agreed to pay Pounds 100,000 a year to Next for Mr Jones to act as a consultant to the business.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Three convicted of pension plot THREE men were convicted at Birmingham Crown Court yesterday of conspiring to defraud pension funds of Aveling Barford, an engineering company based in Grantham, Lincolnshire. Two other men were cleared of being part of the conspiracy. The verdicts came at the end of a 4 1/2 -month trial in which it was alleged that Pounds 6.7m had been taken from the pension funds and used as capital for Aveling Barford and for paying commissions. Mr Robin Chapman, who was Aveling Barford's solicitor, Mr David Carter, a financial adviser and pensions expert, and Mr Graham Severn, a former director of Mildminster, an investment company, were found guilty of conspiring to defraud the pension funds' trustees and beneficiaries by failing to disclose to them the true nature and value of a Pounds 5.7m investment in a Royal Heritage Life Assurance pension portfolio. Mr Peter Murphy, a former executive director of Aveling Barford, and Mr Harold Hobson, another former director of Mildminster, were found not guilty on that charge. Mr Chapman was also convicted of conspiring to obtain Pounds 1m of the pension funds' property by deception. Mr Severn was also convicted of stealing Pounds 424,525 belonging to the pension funds, a charge on which Mr Hobson was found not guilty. All the charges were denied. A sixth man, Mr Mathieu Einhorn, a pension fund trustee who had denied two conspiracy charges, had been dropped from the case early in the trial because of his ill health. Judge Clive Tayler QC will sentence the convicted men today. The court heard that the matter came to light in late 1988 when Standard Chartered, Aveling Barford's bank, put in administrative receivers. The money removed from the pension funds was subsequently recovered - Royal Heritage repaid the Pounds 5.7m invested with it - and the pensioners have not suffered any loss. Aveling Barford is now in liquidation.</p>

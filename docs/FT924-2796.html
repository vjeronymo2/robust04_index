			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Drive to increase private cash in public sector THE GOVERNMENT has invited businesses to suggest ways of increasing the use of private finance in public services and to identify obstacles which stand in the way of such co-operation. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said yesterday the government was determined to remove unnecessary obstacles to private-sector investment in Britain's infrastructure. At the same time the Treasury published the guidance issued to departments giving details of the private-finance initiative announced by the chancellor in the Autumn Statement. This aims to involve the private sector in funding infrastructure projects and in capital investment in public services. The guidance covers four areas of greater co-operation: Projects the private sector can finance wholly out of user charges, such as toll roads or river crossings. These will no longer have to show that they would be cheaper than publicly financed projects. Joint ventures. The government might provide part of the funding for projects the private sector cannot wholly finance by user charges - for example toll roads which are profitable only with a government grant. Leasing of assets. At present the capital value of most leased assets is counted as public expenditure in the first year of the lease. In future the costs can be spread over the period of the lease where the 'great majority of the risk' lies with the private-sector lessor. Buying in services which need large capital expenditure from the private sector. Instead of buying costly equipment, such as body scanners, the health service could pay for the use of such equipment owned by the private sector. The guidance says the crucial factor will be that 'the private sector must genuinely accept the risk'. The Treasury says that once this criterion is met it should be left to the private sector to make its own decisions. Projects should be open to competition if the government needs to facilitate them, though this will not be needed if the only action involves planning permission. This might discourage promoters from putting forward proposals which might then be taken up and won by competitors, so the government says it will consider whether there should be payments for such preparatory work. Sir David Hancock, a former top civil servant who is now a director of Hambros Bank, said the guidance showed the government was now making real efforts to involve private finance.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Letter: Report on Yugoslavia 'balanced' Sir, Christopher Dunkley criticises ITN for 'sensational' reporting of 'systematic and organised rape' in the former Yugoslavia ('Glitz threatens the News at Ten', December 23). Our lead story by Penny Marshall on News at Ten, December 17, was nothing of the kind. Her report on allegations of brutality and rape at Serbian detention centres was a balanced piece of journalism which attributed the charge of systematic rape to the World Health Organisation. Far from failing to produce a 'single woman who would substantiate the story' ITN interviewed an eye-witness to two rapes and a doctor who treated other victims. Our report went on to point out the great difficulty European Community investigators will have in substantiating reports of the rape of Moslem women, most of whom are reluctant to talk about their time in detention. ITN has pursued the story of the abuse of human rights in the former Yugoslavia with great vigour. In August our pictures of the Serb detention camps alerted the world to the true horror of ethnic cleansing. We are proud of our record of accurate and balanced reporting of the war and are determined to maintain ITN's tradition of high quality news coverage. Michael Jermey, Head of foreign news, ITN, 200 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8XZ</p>

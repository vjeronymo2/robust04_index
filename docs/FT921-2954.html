			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC wants tougher fishing punishments EUROPEAN COMMUNITY member states are hampering the community's fisheries inspectors and limiting their efficiency with bureaucratic rules, according to the European Commission. In a report published yesterday on surveillance of the EC's common fisheries policy, the commission called for the powers of EC inspectors to be strengthened and punishments for overfishing and other breaches of the CFP to be tougher. 'Surveillance is supposed to happen on a co-operative basis, but in practice the (community) inspectors are seen as intruders,' said a commission official yesterday. The commission will produce formal legislation to improve CFP surveillance later this year, and will also propose minimum community sanctions for fishing vessels which break EC rules. Brussels believes improved surveillance and control of fishing are essential if planned reforms of the CFP are to be successful. The report itself does not single out individual countries for criticism but the problems are thought to be worst in the North Sea where stocks are at their lowest. Commission officials say they do not want to interfere with surveillance which can best be carried out at national level, but the commission does want national authorities to improve the transparency of their own administrative procedures. According to officials, member states' attitude to EC surveillance has improved significantly in recent years as the need for changes in traditional fishing policy has become obvious. But surveillance has not kept pace with technological developments in the practice of fishing. A comprehensive community register of fishing vessels was only set up last year, and the commission would like to improve the monitoring of fishing fleets by computer and satellite.</p>

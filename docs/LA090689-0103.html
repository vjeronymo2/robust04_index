			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VALENCIA GIRLS' COACH WOELKE NAMED UC RIVERSIDE ASSISTANT  </P> <P> Debi Woelke, who coached the Valencia High School girls' basketball team to the  4-AA Southern Section championship last year, has resigned to become a women's  basketball assistant at UC Riverside.  </P> <P> Woelke, 32, compiled a record of 59-22 over the past three seasons.  </P> <P> "I don't know how I'll be as an assistant, but my ultimate dream is to be a  head coach at a college," Woelke said. "So far as I've seen, you have to be an  assistant first. Use it as a steppingstone."  </P> <P> Woelke is a Valencia graduate. She played basketball for two years at Fullerton  College, then went to Cal State Fullerton but did not play basketball.  </P> <P> A replacement for Woelke is expected to be named later this month.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Petroleum demand spurs BP to Pounds 415m: Higher international sales volumes beats expectations British Petroleum yesterday said demand for petroleum products was growing faster than expected because of economic recoveries in key regions, including the US, Europe and south-east Asia. BP executives in London said higher sales volumes were one of the main factors behind the company's strong third-quarter quarter performance. Replacement cost profits of Pounds 415m were 23 per cent up on the previous quarter and the same period last year. Mr David Simon, chief executive, said oil production in the first nine months of the year was up 4 per cent, while natural gas volumes showed a 20 per cent increase. Chemical volumes were up 10 per cent. 'The growth in volumes was better than predicted,' he said. 'There is a buoyancy on the demand side that is most encouraging.' Japan was the only main country where increased demand failed to appear, according to Mr Simon. BP predicted that the firmer demand could ' ..support crude oil prices' over the next few months. Mr Simon warned, however, that rising demand for petroleum products might not translate into wider margins for BP and other oil companies. He said the volatility evident in oil markets this year was likely to continue. Price swings of as much as Dollars 3 around a Dollars 17-Dollars 20 range for the benchmark brent blend could be expected, even in the face of firming demand. BP's strategy was to remain cautious. Improved efficiency has recently allowed it to increase its margin per barrel to around Dollars 4, towards the top of the industry range, from around Dollars 3.50 a barrel. Its cost of finding, developing and producing a barrel of oil has also fallen to Dollars 8-Dollars 9, about Dollars 4-Dollars 5 below its peak several years ago. The average third-quarter brent oil price was Dollars 16.62 a barrel, close to the average price many analysts expect for the year. But market volatility means that BP will continue to use a benchmark of Dollars 14 a barrel to test the economics of proposed upstream projects. Mr Simon said BP was uncertain whether the sharp rise in demand for chemicals would result in the big margins of previous economic recoveries. In the first nine months of the year, BP made a replacement cost operating profit of Pounds 133m on chemicals, compared with a Pounds 53m loss last year. Mr Simon said price rises of between 20 per cent to 30 per cent helped to return BP's chemical divisions to profit. 'The price rises are running at about half the rate of those last time,' he said. Increased competition was one reason for price moderation. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 26</p>

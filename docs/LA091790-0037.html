			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA BODYGUARD ABANDONS VATICAN EMBASSY REFUGE  </P> <P> The head of security for deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on  Sunday abandoned Panama's Vatican Embassy, where he had taken refuge after last  December's U.S. invasion, and immediately went into hiding, Panamanian  officials said.  </P> <P> The escape of Eliecer Gaytan, who was Noriega's chief bodyguard, prompted a  full-scale manhunt by U.S. and Panamanian authorities, a local radio station  said.  </P> <P> Television news reports showed the embassy ringed by American troops and  Panamanian police.  </P> <P> Gaytan took refuge on Dec. 23 in the Vatican Embassy, joining Noriega, who  later handed himself over to U.S. authorities to stand trial in Florida on  drug-related charges. Gaytan remained for the next nine months.  </P></p>

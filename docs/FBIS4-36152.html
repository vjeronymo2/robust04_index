			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, June 7 (AFP) -- Southern Yemeni warplanes  flying from Aden airport attacked northern forces all along the  front line around the southern port city from daybreak Tuesday  [7 June], Yemeni Planning Minister 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani said.    The planes were attacking northern positions from Little  Aden, just west of the main city, to Lahij to the north,  "continuously bombarding the whole front," he said.    "This is a violation of the ceasefire," announced by the  Sanaa authorities late Monday, al-Iryani said.    The ceasefire took effect midnight Monday (2100 GMT) but  collapsed six hours later.    Al-Iryani said the Sanaa government would inform UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali about the southern air  raids "immediately."    Asked whether the northern forces were firing back,  al-Iryani  said "I presume so."    A correspondent in Aden said northern artillery was pounding  the airport and surrounding area for the third straight day in  an attempt to prevent it being used as a base for the warplanes.</p>

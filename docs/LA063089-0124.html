			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3,700-ACRE ELIZABETH LAKE BLAZE NEARLY UNDER CONTROL  </P> <P> Firefighters declared Thursday that they have gained the upper hand on a  3,700-acre fire that burned a house and two barns near the remote Los Angeles  County community of Elizabeth Lake.  </P> <P> Full control was expected by this morning. Elizabeth Lake is a community of  2,500 in the foothills west of Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County firefighters said the fire is "95% under control." They said  five vehicles and electric power poles and lines were also destroyed. Southern  California Edison Co. officials said power was restored by 10:30 a.m. Thursday  to about 700 customers who had been without power overnight.  </P> <P> "Everybody's feeling real good about the way things are going," County Fire  Department spokesman Corey Lovers said.  </P> <P> Charred ground surrounded some homes Thursday, showing how close the fire came  to causing much greater property loss. Several people praised the efforts of  firefighters, saying they had fled their homes expecting to return to  smoldering rubble.  </P> <P> "The closest burn is 10 feet from the house," said Don Simpson, a 23-year  resident. "Everything around the house is black."  </P> <P> About half a mile away, Velma Majors and her family sifted through what was  left of the rented home they moved to four years ago to "get away from the  hustle-bustle" of Redondo Beach.  </P></p>

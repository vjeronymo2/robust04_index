			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Technology: Helping firemen breathe easier: Worth Watching The technology that helped British 'superbike' cyclist Chris Boardman win a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics is also being used to provide ultra-lightweight breathing apparatus for firemen. EFiC, part of Racal Electronics Group, has launched a new generation of carbon/glass fibre hybrid cylinders bringing weight savings of up to 70 per cent over traditional steel equivalents. Weight-for-weight, the carbon fibres are also 20 times stronger than steel. The cylinders are made from high-performance carbon fibres in an epoxy resin matrix, wound round an aluminium alloy liner. An outer laminate of glass fibre/epoxy is then applied as an additional barrier against abrasion and impact damage. The new cylinder weighs 3.4kg compared with 10kg for a typical nine-litre cylinder used by British fire brigades. EFiC: UK, 0909 731686.</p>

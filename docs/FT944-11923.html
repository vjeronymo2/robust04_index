			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Fed intervention pulls dollar off post-war low The US Federal Reserve yesterday intervened repeatedly in currency markets to support the dollar after it touched a post-war low against the yen of Y96.05, writes Philip Gawith. The dollar recovered on the intervention to trade up to Y97.95 and DM1.5190 in the New York afternoon before ending there at Y97.65 and DM1.5153, compared with a London close of Y96.205 and DM1.4945, after DM1.4910. In the absence of concerted intervention, and supportive monetary policy changes, however, most analysts remained resolutely bearish of the dollar, with predictions that it will soon fall to DM1.45 and Y95. Yesterday the Fed was alone in its intervention; in May and June it had the support of 16 other central banks. The Fed first intervened to support the dollar on April 29 when it was at Y101.45 and DM1.6590. Some observers believe there is a good chance of concerted intervention before the weekend, quite possibly accompanied tomorrow by an increase in interest rates, after the release of the US payroll figures. Elsewhere, the main market move came from the lira, which fell to L1,030/DM, from L1,027. The stronger D-Mark, as the dollar fell, and ongoing political weakness, were the main factors behind the lira's fall. Sterling had a steady day, with the trade weighted index finishing at 81.1, from 80.9. There was no apparent trigger for the dollar's decline, though analysts cited the violation of the November 1 deadline for a US-Japan agreement on flat glass, and rumours that the Bank of Japan had stopped intervening to support the dollar, as souring sentiment. A further factor supporting the yen has been the better than expected performance from Japanese corporates in the current results season. This, said one analyst, lay behind the heavy dollar selling during Japanese trading, as the realisation set in that the stronger yen was not hurting Japanese corporates as much as had been predicted. Short-term money market rates also nudged up in Japan yesterday, and this provided a further incentive for Japanese investors not to buy the dollar. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said: 'This move looks like it has Y90 written on it.' He added that there was 'very little' the authorities could do to stop the dollar's fall as it was fundamentally based. The Fed first bought dollars at Y96.10 and DM1.4955, and continued with waves of buying up to and beyond Y97.75 and DM1.5130. The Fed's move was supported by the Bundesbank and the Bank of France, but analysts agreed that the dollar needed monetary, rather than verbal, support. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency strategy at JP Morgan in Europe, commented: 'I think the market is going to brush this aside unless it sees the Bundesbank come in. It is not a strong enough signal that the US and Japan are serious about changing their monetary policy to support the dollar.' Mr MacKinnon said: 'This intervention buys time, but it will be unsuccessful in stopping the dollar's decline.' Another problem with intervention is that the market is not correctly positioned for it to succeed. The general view is that the market is roughly neutral in terms of its Dollars /D-Mark positioning, and still underweight to the yen. A key factor in how the Fed proceeds will be the response of US bond and equity markets. Some analysts believe the Fed is more concerned in the stability of these markets than protecting the dollar. A measure of bearishness surrounding the dollar comes from Swiss Bank Corporation, which is forecasting the dollar at Y90 and DM1.45 a year out. Furthermore, the bank thinks that the dollar is more likely to reach DM1.25, than DM1.70, and believes that the risk with its yen forecast is that it will reach Y90 much sooner. Analysts said the lira's weakness was attributable more to dollar weakness, and commensurate D-Mark strength, than Italian factors. Mr Giorgio Radaelli, international economist at Lehman Brothers, said insofar as the lira was weaker than other European currencies, this reflected ongoing political uncertainty in Italy, and the fact that the budget had not yet been approved. He predicted that if the dollar fell to DM1.45, then the lira could go to L1,040. The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 1.2bn shortage in UK money markets at established rates. The December short sterling contract closed at 93.52, from 93.51, and three-month LIBOR was unchanged at 6 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / State relaxes iron grip The entrance to the giant Wuhan iron and steel works is dominated by a statue of Mao Zedong, but the late chairman's socialist theories bear little relation to what is going on inside the sprawling complex, writes Tony Walker. Nearly two decades after Mao's death, the Wuhan works in central China is striving to break free of the legacy which had left the company with a bloated workforce, inflexible bureaucratic control from central government ministries and provincial authorities, and stifling social welfare obligations. Reform of China's seventh-largest state corporation is a good example of the route chosen by the authorities to transform larger enterprises into modern companies weaned off state subsidies. That, at least, is the theory. Previously, such entities were under the rigid direction of central and provincial governments, which would set production targets and would insist on approving virtually all new capital spending proposals. Greater flexibility for managers has been achieved under a State Council (cabinet) decree of July 1992 known as 'The Regulations for Transforming the Operating Mechanism of State-Owned Enterprises', but old habits die hard and bureaucratic interference remains a problem in such areas as investment, personnel and taxation. At Wuhan, progress is being made in slimming down a giant workforce and detaching non-core businesses from the parent company. Since 1992, 70,000 out of a total 123,000 workers have been shed, but most have been absorbed in newly created subsidiaries. Mr Liu Ben Ren, the 52-year-old chairman and chief executive of the newly-named Wuhan Iron and Steel Group Company, the parent company, likens the 'corporate engineering' under which the subsidiaries have been formed to helping someone mount a horse, then leading the horse a short distance and seeing it gallop away. But in response to a question about what happens if the subsidiaries, which include a mining company with some 30,000 employees, encounter financial difficulties or even face bankruptcy, Mr Liu indicates that this possibility has not been considered. The subsidiaries have been required to sign contracts described as 'three responsibilities and one link' with the parent. This obliges them to assume responsibility for their own profits and losses; not to sell off state assets illicitly; to continue serving their owner, the Wuhan municipality; and to link wages to productivity. Mr Liu boasts that Wuhan iron and steel works has not laid off a single worker in its transformation to a slimmed-down corporation - although this raises questions about actual savings for the group as a whole. By allowing the parent company to concentrate on its core activities with a smaller workforce, greater efficiencies should be possible, however. These include achieving the target of doubling production by the year 2000 to 10m tonnes of steel products with a workforce of 40,000, compared with today's 53,000. In one respect, Wuhan, in spite of progress made in 'corporatising' its activities, is no different from thousands of other state enterprises. It is enmeshed in the problem of 'triangular debt'. It is owed Yn5bn (USDollars 575m) by customers, including car makers, and in turn owes Yn3bn to raw materials suppliers. Unless the central government is prepared to see industry grind to a halt across the country, it will be obliged to inject funds into the state system to snap the links of the 'debt chain'. This requirement puts in perspective the limits on reforms achieved thus far, and on the state's continuing central role in shielding enterprises from the vicissitudes of the market-place.</p>

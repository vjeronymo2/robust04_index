			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Medium-term jobs outlook promising MEDIUM-TERM employment prospects are surprisingly good, according to a survey by the Manpower employment agency and the British Institute of Management. They say that 51 per cent of employers expect to employ more staff by 1996 and only 30 per cent predict an overall decline. The survey of 163 chief executives and senior directors also finds that 74 per cent of employers expect flexible working to increase in the next four years, with rises in contracting-out of non-core activities, flexible retirement and temporary staff. The public sector expects a faster rate of change than the private sector. Since 1985, 88 per cent of organisations have carried out a substantial restructuring, and 66 per cent since 1990, while 45 per cent plan to restructure again in the coming year. In 76 per cent of organisations, at least one layer of management has been removed. The trend towards a smaller core of highly trained staff and a larger periphery of temporary and less-skilled staff will continue, the survey says. The biggest increase in temporary workers is expected to be among clerical and secretarial staff, and contracting out will grow most rapidly in facilities management and driving-and-distribution. Short-term employment prospects are less good than the medium term. Some 50 per cent of employers expect net job losses over the next year, compared with 19 per cent which expect to increase jobs.

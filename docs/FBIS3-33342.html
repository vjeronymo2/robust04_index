All these rumors seem to be supported by a meeting I had a  couple of months ago with former General Ruben Dario Paredes at  his request. Gen. Paredes was interested in talking to me about  his ideas on national security regarding the future protection  of the Panama Canal. It goes without saying that I far from  share the ideas of the aforementioned officer on national  security and that I have never been associated with or served  under him at any time in my life. That, however, did not keep  me from listening to what he had to say.    The PRD was organized as a party under the sponsorship,  protection, and support of the military dictatorship to serve as  its political arm. The PRD fulfilled this role until 20  December 1989. During the dictatorship, the leaders of the PRD  rose to their positions within the party cadres after proving  themselves unconditional servants of their military chiefs. Now  that the dictatorship they served so submissively has been  overthrown, they are trying to discredit me by linking me in  some way to their former masters with whom they were closely  involved.    If the former officers of the defunct Defense Forces wanted  to discredit the members of the PRD who are so fearful of them  today because of what the former officers know about them, they  would not need me. All the former officers have to do is go  public with all they know about the activities of their  unconditional servants of the past, when they very  enthusiastically formed part of the dictatorship which they bent  over backwards to serve. The officers who were members of the  military leadership know very well and have firsthand  information about the stories and adventures of those who served  as the civilian instruments of the regime. The best thing that  could happen would be for the Panamanian people to find out what  really went on. To do this, the former officers do not need my  advice or recommendations.    I would appreciate your publishing this letter with the same  emphasis given the "news" item to which I am referring.    Sincerely yours,    Ruben Carles, presidential candidate</p>

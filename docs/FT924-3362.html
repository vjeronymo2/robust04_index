			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower ahead of BoJ survey SHARE prices moved marginally lower in quiet trading ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly business survey and the settlement for December futures and options contracts at the end of the week, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 88.57 to 17,207.12 after a high of 17,326.38 and a low of 17,175.13 in the morning. The index moved up in early trading on buying by public funds but hardly moved in the afternoon as investors took to the sidelines. Volume fell from 179m shares to 140m, the lowest since November 16. Public funds and companies, purchasing for their employee stock ownership plans, were the only participants noted. Declines led advances by 573 to 344 with 183 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 2.44 to 1,300.41 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.56 to 1,050.92. Investors did not react to a fall in money market rates. The unsecured overnight call rate, strongly influenced by Bank of Japan's money market operations, fell to 3.84375 per cent, the lowest since January 1989. Yields on three-month certificates of deposit fell to a record low of 3.70 per cent. Traders said last week's cut in the short-term prime rate by Sanwa Bank prompted the easing. Large-capital, interest-rate sensitive stocks rose slightly on the lower interest rates. Nippon Steel was the most active issue of the day, rising Y1 to Y296, while Kawasaki Steel also gained Y1 to Y289. Car stocks were higher on hopes of an early economic recovery in the US. Toyota Motor gained Y10 to Y1,440 and Honda Motor rose Y40 to Y1,340. Isetan, the department store, plunged Y250 to Y2,350. Traders said Shuwa, the financially troubled real estate and stock speculator, was liquidating its stake in Isetan. Nihon Unisys fell Y20 to Y1,120 on reports that the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, the stock market watchdog set up last July, had launched a raid on Teishin Fudo, a stock speculator group, for allegedly cornering Nihon Unisys shares. Sumitomo Realty and Development, a leading real estate developer whose affiliate, Sumitomo Fudosan Finance, had lent some Y55bn to Teishin, retreated Y17 to Y543. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 37.91 to 18,632.16 in volume of 11.1m shares. Roundup HONG KONG was the worst performer last week, according to the FT-A World Indices, falling 12.9 per cent in local currency terms. In its weekly report, Hoare Govett says that although the local economy remains strong there is clearly an unpredictable element to the market because of the state of political relations between Britain and China. It notes that historically, such skirmishes have produced p/e levels of 8 or 9 times, but that the market, now on a 1992 p/e of 11.2 and 9.4 for next year, is still some way off these levels. Yesterday, the market showed some signs of resistance to the political tension. The Hang Seng index closed 76.35 lower at 5,191.35, but was off the day's low of 5,126, in turnover of HKDollars 2.1bn. The most active issue was HSBC Holdings, down HKDollars 1 at Dollars 54, while Hang Seng Bank eased 75 cents to HKDollars 46.75 and Cheung Kong lost 50 cents to Dollars 18.10. Other markets in the region were mixed. Bombay was closed because of violence following the storming of an ancient mosque in Ayodhya. AUSTRALIA was firmer in quiet trading. The All Ordinaries index rose 9.7 to 1,444.7 in turnover of ADollars 209.3m. Among active issues, CSR gained 7 cents to ADollars 3.90 after announcing the appointment of a new managing director. BHP added 28 cents to ADollars 11.70, while News Corp climbed 40 cents to ADollars 29.60.

The shares were up 4 cents at ADollars 2.96. National Australia rose 6 cents to ADollars 7.43 and ANZ lost 1 cent to ADollars 2.59. SEOUL fell back as further evidence emerged that Hyundai Group companies were funding the political campaign of Chung Ju-yung, the group's founder, who is standing in the presidential elections on December 18. Hyundai Motor fell Won1,000 to Won20,600 as the composite index shed 7.04 to 616.21. MANILA advanced on good macro-economic news over the weekend and the composite index closed up 4.70 at 1,284.24 in combined turnover of 216m pesos. Some analysts said that publication of lower November inflation data could support the market this week. KUALA LUMPUR declined on profit-taking. The composite index weakened 2.05 to 635.56 in turnover of MDollars 346m. The debut of the financial services group, Malaysian Industrial Development Finance, generated the day's most active dealings. MIDF closed at MDollars 3.18, up 68 cents from the offer price.

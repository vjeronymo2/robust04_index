			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / International Company News: Earnings ahead to Dollars 66m at Minorco Minorco, the offshore investment arm of South Africa's Anglo American group, lifted operating earnings to Dollars 66.6m from Dollars 37.7m in the six months ended December. Turnover increased to Dollars 1.2bn from Dollars 1.17bn. The Luxembourg-listed group last November completed a Dollars 1.43bn asset swap with Anglo, which owns 46 per cent of the shares. It took control of Anglo's non-diamond interests outside South Africa. The group, which has restated figures for the 1992 half to reflect the asset swap, said that for the first time operating profits were its main source of earnings. 'This completes the transformation from a holding company to an operating natural resources group,' said Mr Hank Slack, president and chief executive. Significantly lower financial income helped to reduce earnings before extraordinary items to Dollars 105.9m from Dollars 117.8m. But extraordinary gains of Dollars 57.7m, mainly from profits on the sale of its stake in Charter Consolidated and Zambian Copper Investments, left net earnings at Dollars 164m, against Dollars 133m. The interim dividend is 19 cents. The group is proposing to change its financial year-end to a calendar year to bring it into line with North and South American practice. It will pay a final dividend for the year to June, followed by a second final for the 18 months ending December this year. Minorco now operates four divisions - gold, base metals, industrial minerals, and pulp and paper. Gold production improved by 5 per cent to 331,200 ounces at an average price of Dollars 380 an ounce, up from Dollars 353. Copper production rose to 51,400 tonnes from 46,300 tonnes, with an average price 13 per cent down at 92 cents a pound. The group invested Dollars 270m in existing and new businesses in the half. At the end of December net cash stood at Dollars 842m, compared with Dollars 1.04bn last time.</p>

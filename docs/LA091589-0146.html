			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> EX-RAIDER MILLEN DECIDES NOT TO SWITCH, SO HE SIGNS WITH 49ERS  </P> <P> The Rams lost another one to the San Francisco 49ers on Thursday when their  rivals from the north signed linebacker Matt Millen, who was released by the  Raiders last week.  </P> <P> The Rams were ready to sign Millen on Tuesday to play their unique nose  tackle/linebacker position in the Eagle defense.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson said it was clear that Millen, when it came time to choose,  wasn't ready to tackle a new position.  </P> <P> "I think he expressed concern about it it being foreign or new," Robinson said.  "I think the 49ers were looking at him as one of those linebackers that kind of  get up in there and stuff the rush."  </P> <P> Robinson said he would not pursue another linebacker now that Fred Strickland  has returned to practice this week. Strickland underwent arthroscopic surgery  on his right knee Aug. 8 and will return to the starting lineup Sunday against  Indianapolis.  </P> <P> "Freddy's back," Robinson said. "I was most panicked that if something happened  to Freddy, and (Larry) Kelm wasn't coming back, then we were in deep trouble."  </P> <P> Strickland will not play "nosebacker" this week, though, the Rams figuring it  would put too much pressure on the knee. He'll move to Larry Kelm's "Mack"  position. Kelm is out again this week with a foot injury.  </P> <P> Will tailbacks Greg Bell and Eric Dickerson exchange greetings before Sunday's  game? Will Dickerson apologize for calling Bell "that little dwarf" last  season?  </P> <P> Actually, Bell's more afraid that Dickerson will bring up Bell's new two-year  contract with the Rams. Bell will receive $450,000 this season and $475,000 in  1990, far less than he sought during his summer holdout.  </P> <P> "I don't even have to shake his hand," Bell said. "He'll just look at me, and  he'll be laughing at me . . . especially if he gets to look at me and say, 'I  told you you wouldn't get anything (from Rams management).' I'll have to listen  to that from him."  </P> <P> Dickerson said this week that Bell's contract doesn't concern him.  </P> <P> "It's none of my business what he got," Dickerson said. "Whatever he gets, he  gets. I don't know what he got. He must be happy, he's in camp."  </P> <P> Bell added that he had no hard feelings toward Dickerson for his "dwarf"  comment last year.  </P> <P> "I don't have any bad blood about anyone," Bell said. "You can say anything in  the world that you want. I'm going to live my life, I'm going to be happy.  Heck, every day I read I still got an attitude problem, I'm on everybody's hate  list. I'm going to continue my day whether anyone cares or not. I don't linger  on bad press or bad vibes. That's for those who don't have a lot of self  confidence. I got plenty of that."  </P> <P> For what it's worth, Bell out-gained Dickerson the first week, 128 yards to  106.  </P> <P> Nearly two years after making the Dickerson trade, Colts General Manager Jimmy  Irsay is still gloating.  </P> <P> "When No. 29 runs out of the tunnel, it's hard to ever even think about being  disappointed with the trade," Irsay told Indianapolis writers recently. "Also,  you have to consider the progress that we have made after the trade. We got a  tremendous player, and had the ability to add other great players. There was a  lot of talk of us mortgaging the future, but we have created a very good team."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> Linebacker Larry Kelm has missed the past three games with a foot injury and  won't play again this week. Coach John Robinson said the Rams would risk losing  Kelm for the season if they tried to rush him back. "We're better off waiting  for him to get well," Robinson said. "Injured players don't play well." . . .  Safety Vince Newsome is expected to play Sunday despite a slight hamstring  pull. Robinson said the safety may need some relief during the course of the  game.  </P></p>

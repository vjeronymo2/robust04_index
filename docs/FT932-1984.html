			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling's bumper year still shows promise IT HAS certainly been a bumper year so far for the Eurosterling bond market. New issuance for the first half of 1993 reached Pounds 15.6bn, exceeding the total new supply in the Eurosterling market for the whole of 1992, according to figures from Euromoney, with no sign of the steady flow of dealsabating. Not surprisingly, the Eurosterling sector suffered a severe setback in the second half of 1992 as the pound took a pummelling, culminating in its ignominious departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. That the tide has clearly turned is due to a combination of factors, including strong demand - both domestic and overseas - for relatively high-yielding paper, and attractive swap opportunities for the issuers of fixed-rate sterling paper. Investors have been keen to lap up the new Eurosterling issuance for several reasons. In the case of overseas investors, one of the main attractions in recent months has been the belief that sterling would appreciate against the D-Mark, although with over DM2.5 to the pound now, some of the European investors may become more cautious about prospects for further currency gains. Leaving aside the currency aspect, however, underlying conditions for the bond market are still regarded as attractive. Recent news on the inflation front has been good, and the market is being encouraged by 'noises from the government that it will try to get expenditure under control,' in the words of one dealer. There remains the question of when the next interest rate cut will take place. Last week's announcement of a further surprise drop in unemployment in May quickly dispelled hopes of an imminent base rate cut, leading to the underperformance of the short end of the yield curve. Realistically, the question of a base rate cut may not resurface until either the Bundesbank eases, or the economic recovery in the UK appears to be delayed again. For the time being investors appear content with the relatively high yields on offer in the Eurosterling market. 'Yields are very attractive compared with other European paper at the long end,' says one UK house. UK institutions are particularly interested in buying the long end of the market because of the yield, especially pension funds which want 10-year or longer-dated paper. There is also a healthy appetite from retail investors in this maturity range. Dealers point out that Channel Island accounts and high net worth individuals have been enthusiastic buyers of the higher-yielding corporate bonds and building society subordinated paper. 'With inflation still at only 1.3 per cent and gilt yields of 8 per cent to 8.5 per cent, investors are getting outstanding value from Eurosterling paper,' says one UK house. Furthermore, investors have been spoilt for choice with an interesting range of credits - and hence yield spreads. In June, the market has been tapped by names ranging from Bank of Greece (which is rated BAA1/BBB-) and Forte (rated A-/BAA1) to those top-notch borrowers Unilever and Marks and Spencer. Bank of Greece launched its Pounds 100m 10-year deal at a yield spread of 175 basis points over the gilt. As one dealer put it, 'given that the gilt yield is 7.9 per cent, that's an enormous pick-up in percentage terms - in other words, 20 per cent of the yield is spread'. At the other extreme, and appealing to investors who were after quality, Unilever and Marks and Spencer Finance both launched 15-year deals, at spreads of 23 basis points and 25 basis points respectively. One of the key factors behind the surge in Eurosterling issuance from the borrowers' point of view is the attractive swap opportunities. One dealer estimates that between 60-70 per cent of the deals launched have been swap-driven, mainly from fixed-rate sterling into floating rate sterling, although there have been opportunities to swap into other currencies as well. 'It (swaps) has driven the volume in five-year sterling, and to a lesser extent at the 10-year area,' says one dealer, pointing out that the deals from M&amp;S and Unilever were swap-driven. Opportunities in areas such as the dollar sector and D-Mark have been less favourable recently, and the main opportunities, on and off, have been in Canadian dollars, French francs, and sterling. Most of the houses specialising in Eurosterling expect to see the steady supply of paper continue, noting strong interest in the seven to 15-year area. 'We're seeing corporates increasingly interested in doing something and watching with varying degrees of readiness. Some are fine-tuning while others are only thinking about getting themselves ready,' according to one of the main Eurosterling houses. Borrowers' main concern is to lock into fixed-rate sterling at the right moment - when interest rates are at a low. For the top names, it is cheaper to borrow long term in the bond market than to turn to the banks for syndicated or bilateral credits, especially since banks are often unwilling to arrange loans with maturities of over five to seven years. Added to which, borrowers appear keen to diversify their sources of funding, veering away from bank lending. 'If you are a triple A credit it is cheaper to raise money in the international capital markets, but if you are a lesser credit, it may make more sense to use bank loans,' points out one dealer.</p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Time to take an interest in rates - Charles Batchelor says entrepreneurs should reassess the ways in which they are funding their enterprises It has been a trying week for Chris Tubbs, managing director of Wiltshire-based Tubbs Elastics, a family-owned business with sales of nearly Pounds 8m and 200 employees. Last Thursday's threatened five point increase in interest rates had Tubbs postponing several spending decisions. He put on hold approval for the purchase of three new directors' cars, delayed implementation of a programme to upgrade the company's computers and cancelled a photocopier machine contract. But within 24 hours, the chancellor had reversed the interest rate rises and Tubbs had reinstated his spending plans. As the Forum of Private Business, a small firms lobby group, reminded the government last week: 'Unstable interest rates prevent businesses planning ahead with certainty.' How are businesses to cope with gyrating interest rates? Smaller firms do not have their own treasury departments and they lack ready access to financial management expertise. Nevertheless, even the smallest firms can carry out some fairly basic financial planning while financial instruments such as 'caps', which set an upper limit on interest charges but which were previously reserved for the large corporation, are now available to the smaller business. As a first step, management should check existing financing arrangements, says Colin Moor of Taurus Banking Consultants. Moor says one client who thought he was paying 3 per cent over base rate discovered he was paying his bank's penalty interest charge of 33 per cent on his entire loan facility. This error had cost him Pounds 15,000 in excess charges. One detail of some loan arrangements which will become more important if interest rates start to fall is the setting of a minimum base rate, says Alastair Winter of the Bank Relationship Consultancy. 'Some agreements state that you will never pay less than, for example, 8 per cent,' he notes. Businesses must also check whether the overall structure of their banking arrangement makes sense, advises Phil Doggett of Business Banking Review, a consultancy. One company was involved in engineering contracts with an average life of 12 months, yet it financed itself with an overdraft which was subject to three-month reviews. This made a nonsense of its financial planning. Once the business has established that its existing banking arrangements make sense and are error-free, it should go on to plan its future requirements. How do these match up with future expectations on interest rates? Many companies refuse to plan for interest rate movements, arguing that it is too much effort, that the markets cannot be beaten or that uncovered positions will average out over time anyway. This is fine provided that they can pass on any increase in interest costs to customers without reducing sales, their margins or their market share, says Eric Warner, a director at National Westminster Capital Markets. Some companies attempt to hedge their bets by dividing their borrowings equally between fixed-rate and variable-rate loans. This implies that they have no expectations at all of the direction of future interest rate movements, says Warner in the Director's Guide to Getting the Best from your Bank.* But while it may sometimes be the case that rates are as likely to move up as down, it is more often likely that the economic cycle will be tending to push rates in one or other direction. In the six years up to early 1992, sterling interest rates  - based on the six months' London inter-bank offered rate (Libor)  - averaged just under 12 per cent but fluctuated between 8.4 and 15.25 per cent. Past performance is no reliable guarantee of future trends but a check against the longer-term trend will show whether present interest rates are below the average, and therefore likely to rise, or above average and therefore likely to fall. In principle, therefore, managers can decide whether they need to increase the proportion of fixed-interest debt in the expectation of higher interest rates in future or increase variable borrowings because they expect a fall. Many commentators are now expecting interest rates to fall since Britain no longer needs to defend a fixed parity for sterling within the ERM. This may encourage the already strong tendency of British small firms to rely on short-term, fixed-rate borrowings, mainly in the form of overdrafts, though fixed-rate borrowings need to be considered for some purposes. 'We recommend fixed-rate loans if a business is particularly susceptible to interest rate movements because the business operates with large borrowings and narrow margins,' says Richard Parkinson of the Bank Relationship Consultancy. Despite the banks' urgings to their small business customers to take up fixed-rate term loans instead of relying on overdrafts  - only about one-third of small firms have term loans  - there are a number of disincentives. Fixed-rate loans are not offered on the sharpest terms, notes Parkinson, while the penalties for prepayment can be high. In addition, front-end fees of 1 1/2 to 2 per cent for term loans are not uncommon and act as a disincentive, says David Burton of the Centre for Consultancy (Surrey). Another disadvantage of switching from an overdraft to a term loan is that the business may lose the benefit of current account balances. If the company runs an overdraft, payments received reduce the size of that overdraft. If it has a term loan but no overdraft, payments go into the current account, which normally does not earn interest, and make no contribution to reducing financing charges. Term loans make strong sense when long-term assets are being bought. Buying land over a 20-year period using finance subject to three-monthly review or recallable 'on demand' exposes the business to changes in bank lending policies or to a change in bank manager. The popularity of the overdraft means that many small businesses do not look beyond that for their finance. However, the banks have begun to tailor some of their financial services to their smaller customers. Caps  - which set a ceiling on the rate of interest which can be charged  - are commonly used by larger companies to limit their interest rate exposure. If interest rates exceed the ceiling, then the bank pays the company the difference. Until a few years ago, caps were only available in amounts of Pounds 5m or more but they have recently become available in smaller amounts. National Westminster Bank now offers a Pounds 100,000 cap tailored to 'mid-corporate' customers. Caps may be less popular if interest rates do fall  - though they still represent an insurance policy against the unexpected  - but companies which have taken out caps may now need to check the terms. Companies which buy caps frequently reduce their premiums by, at the same time, agreeing a floor. If interest rates fall below the floor level, then the company pays the bank. The prospect of lower interest rates means cap and floor agreements, known as 'collars' may start to become a charge on companies. Lower interest rates are a temptation to businesses to pay less thought to their financial arrangements but careful planning is still needed. Doggett says: 'At the moment, the businessman asks 'How can I reduce my overdraft?' What he should be saying is 'How can I fix my interest charges? How can I get to medium-term borrowings? What about caps and other products?' He should get his bank manager to be more pro-active.' *Institute of Directors 84 pages, Pounds 9.95.

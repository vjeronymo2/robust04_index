			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WALKER 4TH DESPITE FALL IN SHORT PROGRAM  </P> <P> Tisha Walker of the Conejo Valley Figure Skating Club moved into fourth place  in the women's senior division of the Pacific Coast championships Friday night  at the San Diego Ice Arena.  </P> <P> Walker was eighth going into Friday's short program, in which she fell on her  opening jump. But the 16-year-old's marks for presentation were enough to move  her into fourth, behind Holly Cook of Utah and Jeri Campbell and Karen Terry,  both of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Walker is two-tenths of a point out of third place.  </P></p>

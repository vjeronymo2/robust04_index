			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (10): Tribute from Major - Profile of Nokia NOKIA may not enjoy instant recognition in Britain but at least it is well-known in Mr John Major's Huntingdon constituency. Last spring Finland's giant telecommunications and electronics group established a strong foothold in the town when the UK prime minister opened its British headquarters there. 'The speed with which the company has established itself both internationally in the highly competitive and innovative telecommunications market but also as a growing and important presence in this part of the world is a great tribute to Nokia,' Mr Major said then. The company has seized the opportunities provided by the emergence of the UK's deregulated and liberalised telecommunications system with a five-fold increase in its telecommunications sales to the country in the past two years. Last spring the Finnish company won an order to supply Windsor Cable Television's cable telecom division with Nokia DX 200 digital cross-connect systems to link its local service franchise to the national and international network. Similar equipment has been ordered more recently by Mid Downs Communications with the provision of 37,000 lines to cover Crawley, Horley and Gatwick airport. Today the company is the world's second largest mobile phone manufacturer after Motorola. It also claims to be the third biggest European manufacturer of colour television sets while it is the continent's sixth largest maker of cable as well as a global leader in cable machinery production. With 27,000 workers in 36 countries, Nokia has become a substantial European technology group. While its corporate headquarters remain in Helsinki, its consumer electronics division is run from Geneva. Under Mr Jorma Ollila, the 41-year-old chief executive who became Nokia's president last January and chief executive officer only in June, the company looks set to thrive in its designated business areas - telecommunications, mobile telephones, consumer electronics, cables and machinery. 'The worst is over,' he insists. 'We won't make a profit this year but the result will be better than in 1991 when the company made a FM324m pre-tax loss.' A primary cause of last year's setback was the collapse of Nokia's telecommunications business with the Soviet Union. 'From FM1.2bn sales in 1990 it fell to zero in 1991,' he explains. 'But over the past 10 months we have filled the gap through acquisition of orders for our GSM and PCN systems in Germany.' An important advance was achieved by the company in June when it announced it was forming a joint venture at Fort Worth in Texas for the production of mobile telephones in collaboration with a subsidiary of the Tandy corporation. The newly formed TNC company is scheduled to start production of high volumes of cellular phones early next year for the US market. Last year North America accounted for around half the cellular phones sold worldwide. Mr Ollila says: 'Two reasons have necessitated our US presence, the weakness of the US dollar and the need to be closer to a market with a 30 per cent annual volume growth.' He is well equipped to develop the company's telecommunications and mobile phone activities. In just two years - 1990 and 1991 - he turned the mobile phones division from loss to profit through cost-cutting and rationalisation which meant reducing the workforce and doubling production volume. 'I brought research and development, manufacturing and the marketing work much closer together and reduced the cycle time.' Mr Ollila's managerial performance impressed Nokia's board and paved the way for his meteoric rise to the top. The company solved the problem of its loss-making data division, bought from Ericsson, by selling it in 1991 to ICL for Pounds 230m. It also partially divested itself from chemicals by merging them with the Finnish company Kymmene in a 50-50 partnership. Consumer electronics remains a headache. Production of colour TV sets has been concentrated in the company's two plants at Turku in Finland and Bochum in Germany. The cables business is also suffering from a fall in European capital investment and overcapacity in the industry. Nokia has carried out cost-cutting and has benefited from orders for power and telephone cables, with a 24 per cent increase in the order book in the first four months. 'We are not a conglomerate any more but a focused technology group,' says Mr Ollila. The company appears to have a promising future in the telecommunications industry. In 1987, Nokia made a splash by hiring all the billboards in Sweden. The company can hardly do the same in Britain. But across much of western Europe it looks like one of Finland's corporate flagships, signalling the arrival of the country's industry in the wider continental markets.</p>

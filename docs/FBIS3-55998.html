After the beginning of the talks both presidents expressed  confidence that the dialogue between Russia and the U.S. would  promote the consolidation of world peace and tranquility, as  well as the deepening of cooperation between the two countries.    On the first stage the talks are held in a narrow format at  the Green Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace. Aside from Yeltsin  and Clinton, they are attended by Dmitriy Ryurikov, assistant to  the Russian president, and Strobe Talbott, special adviser to  the U.S. secretary of state on the new independent states.    According to the information from reliable sources, during  their first one-hour meeting the Russian and U.S. presidents are  expected to discuss issues dealing with economic and political  cooperation between the two countries, the implementation of the  Russian reform, the consolidation of international security,  specifically, the settlement of regional conflicts and the  non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. Probably, they will touch  upon the mechanism of putting into effect Ukraine's decision on  the withdrawal of nuclear warheads from its territory.</p>

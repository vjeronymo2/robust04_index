			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norway's Gullfaks South field declared commercial STATOIL, THE Norwegian state oil company, yesterday declared the Gullfaks South oil and gas field commercial and said it would lodge a development plan for the field late next year. Gullfaks South has estimated gas reserves of 60bn cubic metres and oil reserves of 125m barrels. It will cost an estimated NKr14bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to develop, according to Statoil. Production is likely to be from a wellhead platform, along with a new process platform for gas, linked to the existing Gullfaks A platform. The field will use oil processing capacity on Gullfaks A, which will become available towards the end of the decade. In this case, it will come on stream in 1998 with annual gas output of 5bn cu m. Statoil said an alternative plan under consideration called for a record length horizontal well to be drilled from the Gullfaks A platform, which is situated 10km away from Gullfaks South. This would enable oil from the field to come on stream earlier than gas output and would accordingly boost profitability while providing an early return on investment. If this plan is chosen, oil production could theoretically and technically come on stream during 1995. However, the field has a highly fractured, complex reservoir so a 10 km long horizontal well would be a major challenge. Statoil's longest existing well, on the Statfjord field, is 7km. Statoil said gas from Gullfaks South was being considered as a source of supply for a gas-fired power generation plant to be built by Britain's National Power. The supply contract calls for annual deliveries of 2.2bn c m a year from the second half of the 1990s.</p>

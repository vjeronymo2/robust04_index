			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MOVIE'S A HIT WITH EX-MOBSTER  </P> <P> Mobster-turned-informant Henry Hill has seen "GoodFellas," the movie based on  his life, and gives it two thumbs up for reality.  </P> <P> "That movie was 99% accurate.  </P> <P> That's the way we lived, that's (the way) we treated our wives, always on the  hustle," Hill said in an interview with the syndicated television program  "Inside Edition."  </P> <P> Hill, who appears on the show wearing a beard and sunglasses because he is in  the witness protection program, says life has changed dramatically since he  turned government witness and slipped into anonymity. He is remarried and has a  new baby.  </P> <P> "I can put my head on the pillow and not have to worry about a phone call in  the middle of the night to 'come and meet me with a shovel,' " Hill said. "All  that craziness, that insanity, is gone from my life."  </P></p>

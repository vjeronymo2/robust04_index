			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Sport: Waddle Hoddle-itis - Soccer TODAY's FA Cup Final marks the start of a fraught period for English soccer fans whose sense of identity and self-worth are intimately tied up in the performances of the national side. Six of Arsenal's cup final players and two of Sheffield Wednesday's are in Graham Taylor's squad for two World Cup qualifying games - in Norway on June 2 and Poland six days later - followed by three games in the US. Recent England performances at Wembley have provided contradictory evidence. Against Norway and San Marino the team played the predictable, uninspired, functional soccer that the fans identify with Taylor. Against Turkey and the Netherlands there were signs of a more self-confident style. Today's game will be scoured for omens. Arsenal in spite of the presence of Ian Wright, the best attacker in England, scored the fewest goals in Premier League - just 40. But they only conceded 38. They symbolise the dour, defensive side of the British game. Sheffield Wednesday represent the attacking spirit. This contradiction is personified by two players. Tony Adams, of Arsenal, who will almost certainly play against Norway, and Chris Waddle, of Sheffield Wednesday, who will not even be on the flight there. Adams' ungainly gait is a constant reminder of England's humiliation in the European Championships in 1988: three defeats. The whole business summed up by the way Marco van Basten skipped around Adams to score for the Dutch. Waddle's lanky, lazy, elegance recalls memories of England's last moment of glory: the unexpected run to the World Cup semi-finals in Italy in 1990. If his extra-time shot against the base of the West German post had been an inch to the left, or his kick in the penalty shoot-out just four yards lower, England could have been in the final. Adams is big, strong and brave. He is a leader and scores his share of goals. His strike beat Spurs in the semi-final. 'Donkey won the derby' sang the Arsenal fans. But just because he looks clumsy does not mean he is without skill. Where Waddle's long passes are invariably elegant but frequently ineffective, Adams' passes, delivered elbows locked, with a stiff swing of the leg and a strange crank of the torso, are consistently accurate and often imaginative. His re-emergence as a first-choice international is a reward for persistence and relative youth. He is 26. Among his rivals, Richard Jobson, Mark Wright and Keith Curle are all 30 or close to it. Even so, the donkey has not become a thoroughbred. He remains the player he has always been; with the same, under-appreciated, virtues and the same weakness: his slowness on the turn. Against Turkey the giveaway was precisely the feature of his game that drew most praise: the string of last-ditch diving tackles deep in his own penalty area. The sliding tackle is a difficult art and Adams' tackles were magnificent: but why did he need to make so many? Was it because the Turkish attackers found it so easy to by-pass him. What distinguishes top international sides is the number of attackers who combine close control with speed. The Dutch have three. Last month, Adams' nemesis, van Basten, did not play, so Des Walker could mark Dennis Bergkamp while Lee Dixon struggled with Marc Overmars. The moment of truth could come when the two countries play again on October 13. While Adams is a pragmatist Waddle is a determined spokesman for the fantasy tendency in English soccer. He demands the freedom to express his creative whims. Sadly, what Waddle is demanding is the freedom not to do what he does best. He is the foremost ball dribbler of his generation. He has a repertoire of tricks and deceits and can beat defenders from a standing start. Perhaps this most precious of soccer gifts comes too easily for he does not seem to value it. In his time at Tottenham Hotspur, Waddle caught Hoddle-itis. Ever since, he has wanted to be something which he is not: Glenn Hoddle. He wants to destroy defences with one elegant 70-yard pass. The problem with Waddle's long passes is that too many do not reach their target. He is, in American football parlance, 'forcing' his passes, hitting them at players who are too well marked. A 70-yard pass cut out a yard from its target may look wonderful for 69 yards but is a waste of possession. Worse, Waddle can only play 70-yard passes if he is 70 yards away from the opposing goal; away from the area where his dribbling - and his imaginative short-passing - is most dangerous. Over-optimistic long passes are meat and drink to the Arsenal defence. Adams' greatest fear must be that Waddle will run at him with the ball on the edge of the Arsenal penalty area. When the two teams met in the League Cup Final a month ago Waddle played too deep and did not run at the Arsenal defence at all. Only if he does so this afternoon can Waddle demonstrate why he could still play for England while Adams should not.</p>

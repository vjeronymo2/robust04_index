			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 15 (XINHUA) -- Greece has raised  a new proposal for avoiding NATO air strikes on Serbian  positions around Sarajevo.    Visiting Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias told  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic today that the proposal  includes two points: To demilitarize Sarajevo and put it under  U.N. mandate for two years; and to press the Muslim side to  accept the European Union peace plan which divides Bosnia into  three ethnic states.    Milosevic and Papoulias agreed that any air strike on  Serbian  positions will undermine the Bosnian peace talks and will only  encourage what they called "militants" to continue to refuse  peace and prolong the war.    Papoulias also handed over a letter from Greek Prime  Minister  Andreas Papandreou to Milosevic.    Greece was the only NATO member country to oppose issuing an  ultimatum to the warring Bosnian sides to remove their weapons  from around Sarajevo at the NATO meeting last Wednesday [9  February] in Brussels.    Papoulias promised to do his best, while serving as the  chairman of the European Union's ministerial meeting, to avoid  the worst -- air strikes.    He said air strikes will not help bring about peace in  Bosnia, and a political settlement will benefit not only the  Balkans, but also the whole of Europe.    It is not fair to only ask the Serbian side to withdraw  weapons from around Sarajevo, he said, adding that the Muslim  side should also be pressed to withdraw their weapons.</p>

			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / NUM seeks repayment of Pounds 435m THE NATIONAL Union of Mineworkers is to take British Coal to the European Court over its pension fund contribution 'holiday', Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM president, announced at the union's conference in Scarborough yesterday. The move will form part of an NUM campaign against privatisation of the coalmining industry and is designed to discourage potential buyers. The union hopes to force the corporation or future employers to repay Pounds 435m into the miners' pension fund. Mr Scargill also called for the NUM to join forces with the RMT rail union to take industrial action against privatisation in coal and rail. He rejected the idea that privatisation was inevitable and urged a 'massive campaign' for action. An investigation by the Commons social security committee into British Coal's pension fund contributions holiday over the past three years was called for by Mr Scargill. He was particularly critical of the role played by trustees belonging to the rival Union of Democratic Mineworkers. There was little difference between someone such as Robert Maxwell stealing Pounds 450m from Mirror Group Newspapers' pension fund and the corporation taking a contribution holiday of Pounds 435m, Mr Scargill said. 'The end result is the same. Money meant and designated for a pension fund has ended up in the employer's balance sheet,' he said. The European Court's Barber judgment had established that pension-fund money was deferred wages, Mr Scargill added. Now the NUM would argue in the court that the Pounds 435m should be repaid. Later British Coal said the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme's rules amendment committee had voted by six to four to put part of its surplus towards a contributions holiday. The NUM's general secretary retires this week after eight years as Arthur Scargill's righthand man. Mr Peter Heathfield said he still felt 'bitter' after a long fight to clear his name over newspaper accusations of financial irregularities during the 1984-85 pit strike.</p>

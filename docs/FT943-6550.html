			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Top Tory defends 4.7% pay rise for MPs The government moved yesterday to defend plans to raise MPs' salaries by more than twice the rate of inflation amid fears that the increase could undermine its case for public-sector pay restraint. As union leaders and others lined up to attack the 4.7 per cent increase, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, denied that the government had broken its own guidelines on public-sector pay. Mr Newton said that over a three-year period, MPs would have been treated in 'precisely the same way as . . . the civil servants with whom their pay has been linked for many years.' He added: 'I don't think that any fair-minded person who looked at the position on this over a three-year period . . . would regard this as either unreasonable or a breach of pay policy.' But the increase - well above the 2.3 per cent rise in the retail prices index in the year to July - was widely criticised by trade union leaders. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the public services union, said: 'This is sheer hypocrisy. It is grossly unfair that the government should impose a three-year pay freeze on 5m public-sector workers and not set an example within MPs' awards. 'Poorly paid local government and health workers, facing cuts in their living standards, are bound to be enraged by the government's scandalous double standards.' Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: 'Their pay formula rides roughshod over the government's spurious arguments about pay rises being dependent on increases in productivity and efficiency.' Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union whose next strike in a pay dispute with Railtrack starts tomorrow, said: 'My signalling grade members have been trying to get their claim recognised for seven years. If the government has devised a formula to meet the particular circumstances of MPs then we should be able to devise one to fit our circumstances. If they can shift the goalposts for themselves they can do it for other groups.' Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association of top civil servants, said: 'MPs' pay is now a hopeless muddle. What's really needed is a complete review of how MPs are paid.' Details of the MPs' increase could hardly have emerged at a worse time for the government, with a damaging rail dispute in full swing and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, expected soon to remind public-sector pay review bodies that any increases next year must be paid for out of improved productivity. The raise, which will take effect from January, will take an MP's basic salary from Pounds 31,687 a year to Pounds 33,169. The 4.7 per cent figure comprises 2.7 per cent which MPs were already due to receive as the second part of a two-stage pay settlement, and an additional 2 per cent to bring them into line with middle-ranking civil servants with whom their salaries have been linked.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Allied Colloids drops to Pounds 19m as higher costs bite Shares in Allied Colloids, the chemicals company, fell 10p to 228p yesterday as pre-tax profits for the six months to October 2 dropped 15 per cent from Pounds 22.5m to Pounds 19m. While the fall was predicted at the AGM in August, it turned out to be greater than expected. The company blamed exchange rate movements and other increased costs, including insurance. Overhead costs rose by about 16 per cent. The insurance premium rose from Pounds 1.5m a year to Pounds 5m following a fire at Bradford in July. The costs of defending patents also increased. Sales rose by 17 per cent from Pounds 136.3m to Pounds 159.3m. However, about 10 per cent of the increase was accounted for by the change in exchange rates following the UK's departure from the ERM. The company increased sales in all areas apart from the UK, which accounts for about 15 per cent of group turnover. Sales in North America grew to Pounds 52m (Pounds 44.4m) and in Asia to Pounds 18.1m (Pounds 12.5m). European sales improved to Pounds 53.8m (Pounds 45.5m), but the company reported continuing difficulties in Germany. Sterling devaluation hit the cost of petrochemicals and other raw materials, many of which are priced in D-Marks. The company had been unable to recover this in selling prices. The second half is expec-ted to be better as exchange rate benefits emerge as a result of hedging curren-cies. The company also said that raw material prices had stabilised, and it expected a modest improvement in margins. Earnings per share fell to 4.99p from 5.47p. The in-terim dividend is increased from 0.94p to 1p. COMMENT The City, disappointed that the first half had come in below Pounds 20m, yesterday downgraded its full year forecasts from Pounds 50m. It is now expecting pre-tax profits to be about Pounds 44m - roughly equal to last year. This implies a much better second half as about Pounds 5m flows in through currency benefits. While sales continue to show strong growth, the rise in costs gives some cause for concern. On the latest forecasts the shares are on a prospective p/e of almost 20, a good premium to the market. The company cannot afford any further slippage in margins.</p>

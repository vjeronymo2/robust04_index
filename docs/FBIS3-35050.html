			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Taba by political correspondent Udi Segal] </F>   [Excerpts] The Security Committee's talks will resume in  Cairo on Monday [21 February]. The Taba negotiations have  adjourned for the week, and Israeli delegation sources described  the progress achieved this week as tremendous. We used to argue  for a month and a half over one clause, and yet we concluded  five clauses within the last three days, one of the delegates  told us. Major General Amnon Shahaq recapped the discussions:    [Begin Shahaq recording] We have concluded the agreement  segment dealing with security coordination and cooperation. We  have reviewed every aspect of the police issue, and later we  will discuss several aspects of its size. We have started  discussing security arrangements in Gaza and Jericho. The  Civilian Affairs Committee has also concluded a series of  issues, and it will pursue some of the issues next week. [end  recording]    Shahaq and Sha'th have started discussing the format of the  comprehensive arrangement. Unfinished issues include two  substantive matters: the Palestinian council and the  self-administration's jurisdiction. The Civilian Affairs  Committee still has five points to conclude before the civilian  chapter of the Taba negotiations can be closed. [passage  omitted]    Members of the Israeli delegation said the talks were swift  and favorable this week, although they were unprepared to commit  themselves to a timetable. Gen. Shahaq said:    [Begin Shahaq recording] We aim for an agreement covering  every issue, giving us guarantees. I hope it will happen  quickly. We all want it to happen as soon as possible, but I  would not....[pauses] If two more weeks are required, then we  will take two more weeks. If a month is needed, we will take a  month. And if we find we can finish it in less than two weeks,  we will all be glad. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Christmas Food and Drink: Pick your guiding light - Nicholas Lander navigates his way around the 1995 restaurant guides One restaurant guide describes it as 'relying to much on its reputation'; another as 'guaranteeing a sense of occasion'; a third calls it 'legendary' and a fourth, after rating it 1 out of a possible 5, saysit is unable to confirm details because the restaurant did not reply to its questionnaire. A fifth guide does not include it because, after a critical review, the restaurateur wrote asking the reviewer never to darken his doors again. Which well-known London restaurant is being referred to? The answer is Langan's of Mayfair. The five reviews of the same place illustrate not just how subjective reviewing is, but what different principles the five food guides in question - Harden's, Time Out, Egon Ronay, The Good Food Guide and The Evening Standard - take. The biggest problem their editors face is the enormous growth in the number of restaurants in Britain. At the same time there is a numerical gulf between the number of restaurants within London and outside. This makes producing a guide which does not include the capital's restaurants a difficult commercial proposition - unlike America where the initial Zagat Guide to New York spawned guides to almost all the other major American cities. There is no doubt that demand for good eating exists throughout the UK - one wine merchant told me that Leodis restaurant, Leeds (0532-421010) served 278 customers on a recent Saturday night, a figure most West End restaurateurs would envy. But there are not that many restaurants in Leeds. Five are listed in the Good Food Guide and 14 in Egon Ronay. Yet, confined to London, the number of restaurants under consideration is vast. The Time Out Guide is the most comprehensive with 1,229 entries. It contains some enticing photos of chefs, waiters and customers and has the most quirky approach to what London has to offer: restaurants are listed by national cuisine then, suddenly, there is a chapter on 'fish restaurants' followed by another on 'hotels and haute cuisine'. Unfortunately, the guide's A4 size makes it unwieldy. To get the best out of it, you must sit down at home and plan your excursions. As Harden's Guide (700 entries) already quotes me on its back cover I must be brief. However, the fact that two brothers have, by themselves, managed to produce the least expensive guide is a tribute to their business acumen and judgment. Particularly useful over the past year has been a companion volume, Harden's London Party Guide (Pounds 6.95) which lists venues for hire from the 19th century Old Operating Theatre Museum and Herb Garret, in London SE1, to the Nine Kings' Suite at the Royal Lancaster Hotel, in London W2, which can accommodate 1,300 for a dinner dance. The Evening Standard Guide (267 entries) is doubly disappointing. First, it looks drab and second, it fails editorially to promote its author Fay Maschler, the most knowledgeable of all of us fortunate enough to earn a living writing about restaurants. Only Maschler could describe The Brackenbury, in London W6, as 'an unpretentious neighbourhood restaurant with chef/proprietor Adam Robinson the ideal boy next door for any keen eater.' One of the most irritating developments in all the guides is the creation of their own awards systems. The Standard has the Eros awards for its top 20 London restaurants. Time Out has an awards evening with its own ceremony, and Egon Ronay has a plethora of sponsored awards including 'Kitchen of the Year', underwritten by a company of environmental hygiene specialists. The Good Food Guide is the most idiosyncratic with awards made to restaurants for being 'East Sussex Flavour', 'Humberside Achiever' and 'Leicester All Day Restaurant' of the year. Jim Ainsworth, a former restaurateur, is its editor and is one of the wittiest of food and wine writers. He has injected a sense of humour and warmth which makes this guide a very good read. There is no doubting the usefulness of the Egon Ronay Guide, with more than 3,000 entries its is both clear and comprehensive. However, there is an editorial tendency to praise every entry so that guide's opinions should be best kept in perspective. From a consumer's point of view the most useful guide would be a mongrel, combining the breadth of Egon Ronay, the enthusiasm of Time Out, the wit and experience of Jim Ainsworth and Fay Maschler respectively, and the business acumen of the Hardens.

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Laying the ghost of Mr Maxwell A crucial test of the government's proposals for reforming the UK pensions industry is whether they offer adequate protection against crooks like the late Robert Maxwell. Confidence in the security of occupational pensions was badly shaken by the monstrous theft he perpetrated against pension scheme members in his business empire. Establishing a coherent regulatory framework for pensions is essential in a world in which private pension provision is becoming increasingly important in sustaining living standards in old age. There is, of course, no foolproof protection against the predations of a determined fraudster. Even trustees representing the interests of members can be intimidated into silence, as Mr Maxwell proved. Yet by largely endorsing the recommendations in the report of the Goode committee on pension law reform, the government has shown itself determined to move towards a comprehensive and statutory form of regulation that will create a succession of obstacles to fraud. In the front line of defence will be the members, who will be given better access to information on their schemes. They will also have the right to select a third of the trustees - a long-overdue provision for those on whose behalf pension funds exist. The role of trustees is to be strengthened by clarifying their responsibilities and duties. Professional advisers are to be told that they are accountable to the trustees, not the employer. The solvency requirements provide a further line of defence, with a full valuation required if the annual solvency report reveals an unexpected deficiency. An independent regulator will be appointed with powers to investigate and enforce schemes' compliance with their statutory obligations. Compensation scheme Finally, a compensation scheme is to be established that will pay out if a fraudster succeeds in jumping all these hurdles. The scheme, funded by an industry levy, should avoid the heartbreaking uncertainties experienced by many Maxwell pensioners over their income in retirement. If there is any doubt over the government's plans, it lies in the reactive nature of the proposed regulatory framework. Scheme members will be entitled to request annual reports and accounts, but will not automatically receive them. Trustees will have to prepare an annual report but not file it with the regulator where it could be open for public inspection. The regulator will wait for whistle-blowers to raise the alarm rather than analyse scheme reports. Proactive approach In most cases, this is less than what was recommended by the Goode report, which rightly favoured a more proactive approach. The committee wanted schemes to send annual reports to members in the same way as companies do to shareholders. It also proposed that schemes should make annual returns to the regulator that would have provided warning of potential problems. Indeed, the regulator could use such returns to identify at-risk schemes and initiate investigations in the same way as charity regulators and tax inspectors do. On one matter, however, the government was right to water down the Goode report's proposal - on the definition of minimum solvency requirements. Members need a simple indicator to judge whether their scheme has the resources to redeem the pension promises it has made to them. The government has opted for the compromise proposed by the actuarial profession which values liabilities on a mixture of equity-type returns and gilts-based returns according to the age profile of scheme members. This allows for a more diversified investment portfolio than implied in Goode. All in all, this is a white paper which strikes the right note, though with inadequate conviction. The government would also be wrong to think that it can now relax about the subject of pensions. Changing employment patterns, changing capital markets and changing consumer preferences all suggest that the defined benefit occupational pension scheme is in decline. Creating a sound framework for personal pension schemes, given the recent record of mis-selling, remains a large and important task.</p>

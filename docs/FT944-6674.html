			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Trade News: China spells out views on Gatt membership timing China said yesterday that it would offer no new concessions in its eight-year-long negotiations to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade if the talks were not concluded by the end of the year. However, Beijing said it would continue to participate in negotiations after the deadline until its Gatt status was resumed, if it were asked to do so by the secretariat of Gatt or the World Trade Organisation, its successor. The message was conveyed to Mr Peter Sutherland, Gatt director-general, by Mr Long Yong-tu, Beijing's chief negotiator, who has led a Chinese delegation to Geneva to take part in further membership talks. Western diplomats said the statement appeared to be a face-saving acknowledgement that it may be impossible to reach an agreement on WTO entry terms by the end of the year, and that China may have no option but to accept an extension. They pointed out that Beijing appeared to have softened its previous line by dropping suggestions that it would walk away from the talks if the year-end deadline was not met. They also said China's insistence that it would not make fresh offers or seek bilateral negotiations with Gatt members after the end of this year need not prevent it from responding to demands by other countries that it make concessions. 'To the extent that it is not useful to set artificial deadlines, then so much the better,' said one US trade official about Mr Long's statement. The US and the EU have both told Beijing recently that they would be prepared to consider helping China to fulfil its ambition of becoming a founder member of the WTO by conferring such status on it even if it joined well into next year. However, China has balked at the offer, arguing that it is a device to enable the US to continue spinning out membership negotiations indefinitely. Beijing blames the US for the slow progress of the talks up til now, saying that every time China makes a concession, Washington asks for more. The US, under strong pressure from American industry, has insisted that China join the WTO as a developed country - a demand which Beijing has strongly rejected. Although the EU agrees with Washington that Beijing still has a long way to go to meet the requirements of the multilateral trading system, it is ready to be more flexible by allowing China an adjustment period after it enters the WTO.</p>

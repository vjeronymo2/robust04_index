This  investment project will amount to around 150 million dollars.  Although the Japanese side is fully prepared to take action on  the agreements, it has encountered delays on the Russian side.  This was the topic of discussion at yesterday's meeting of  executives of the Japanese firms involved in the project.    The contract the Russian Tekhnopromimport Association  (representing the interests of the Orsk Mechanical Plant and the  Krasnoyarsk Refrigerator Plant) signed with a Japanese  consortium (the Nissho Iwai, Sanyo Electric, and Toyo  Engineering firms) for the delivery of Japanese technological  lines for refrigerator compressor production was negotiated back  in 1990. After the breakup of the Union, however, the Japanese  government lines of credit for the financing of this contract  were frozen. Talks on the resumption of the deliveries were held  regularly after that, but the absence of Russian guarantees of  the repayment of the credit from the Japanese Export-Import Bank  was the main obstacle. It was not until 1993 that an agreement  was concluded by the Export-Import Bank and Russian Foreign  Economic Bank on the resumption of operations with lines of  credit for the Orsk and Krasnoyarsk contracts.    According to the terms of the new contract concluded in  December (for a total of around 150 million dollars), the  Japanese side promised to deliver and install the technological  equipment and train Russian personnel. The credits would be  repaid in installments over a period of 8.5 years, starting in  November 1995. The Japanese are ready to start acting on the  agreements, but now the situation has been complicated by the  procrastination of the Russian Ministry of Finance, which still  has not provided the Japanese Ministry of International Trade  and Industry with government guarantees for the credits.    According to observers, the Ministry of Finance's  temporizing  might be due to the general mood in government. When First Vice  Premier Oleg Soskovets, Central Bank Chairman Viktor  Gerashchenko, and Minister of Economics Aleksandr Shokhin met  representatives of the Japanese Export-Import Bank and Mitsui  Corporation in early February, it was clear that the Russian  administrators were not eager to accept any government-backed  credits. The "no-strings" preferential credit of 2 billion  dollars from the U.S. Eximbank for the Russian petroleum  industry was cited as a positive example at that meeting  (although the possibility of obtaining this credit and of  repaying it seems quite dubious--see KOMMERSANT-DAILY, 3 March).    In contrast to the American billions, which would be  guaranteed by Russian oil, the Japanese credit presupposes  repayment from the foreign currency proceeds of profitable  enterprises. The Krasnoyarsk plant, for example, is already  exporting its products successfully, and the Orsk plant even has  a direct relationship to the military-industrial complex and to  the budget allocations for conversion. The simple credit and  repayment plan proposed by the Japanese and the low rate of  interest (5 percent per annum) in comparison with the American  rate are completely in line with government programs for the  support of machine-building exports and the enterprises of the  military-industrial complex. The behavior of the Ministry of  Finance, however, could discourage the already cautious Japanese  from investing in the Russian economy.</p>

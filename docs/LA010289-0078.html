			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEW YEAR, NEW CITY;  </P> <P> DANA POINT SETS SAIL ON INDEPENDENT TACK;  </P> <P> COUNTY'S 28TH MUNICIPALITY STARTS WITH A BANG, FACES THE CHORE OF UNITING  DISPARATE ELEMENTS  </P> <P> Blessed by a harbor, beaches and world-class hotels, all that Dana Point needed  was a sense of community to tie it all together.  </P> <P> As of Sunday, Dana Point lacked for nothing as it officially became the  county's 28th city.  </P> <P> During a brief ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim (the first Pilgrim  carried 19th-Century author and city namesake Richard Henry Dana Jr. to what he  would later call "the only romantic spot in California") Dana Point's  five-member City Council was sworn in Sunday.  </P> <P> In one of the council's first official acts, Councilwoman Judy Curreri was  voted temporary mayor by her colleagues.  </P> <P> A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- marked the birth of the  municipality as 100 people aboard the square-rigged Pilgrim winced at the roar.  A fire engine-red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat chugged up the  Dana Point Harbor channel toward the ship moored at Dana Cove Park, its sirens  wailing and five jets of water spraying high.  </P> <P> "I think it'll be a great coastal city," said Ingrid McGuire, newly sworn in as  the city's temporary mayor pro-tem. "I think it's a marvelous omen today that  the sun is shining. Even the elements are smiling on Dana Point."  </P> <P> Now, the city will get down to the giddy business of collecting millions of  dollars in hotel bed-tax revenue and making sure that its 26,000 residents have  enough essential services. A consultant has determined that the city's  first-year revenue would be about $9 million -- $2 million more than needed to  provide services at the level they are now under county auspices.  </P> <P> The new council will have some nettlesome problems in governing a community so  diverse that transient day laborers sleep in fields within view of $250-a-night  hotel rooms. But nearly everyone in Dana Point is optimistic, given that it is  entering cityhood as one of the more prosperous new municipalities in  California.  </P> <P> "I see this as probably the greatest city in the United States," Lynn Dawson, a  member of the Dana Point Task Force for Incorporation, said last week. "We've  got harbors, hotels, beaches and sun nearly every day of the year. I mean, what  else can you want?"  </P> <P> On Sunday, council members Bill Bamattre, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause, Curreri  and McGuire conducted their first act of business by adopting a 2-inch-thick  set of county ordinances and regulations -- a routine procedure until the city  adopts its own laws.  </P> <P> Standing on the Pilgrim II's deck with hands raised, the council members were  sworn in by County Clerk Gary L. Granville. Newspaperman Dana sailed on the  original brig Pilgrim in 1834-36 and published "Two Years Before the Mast,"  based on those experiences, in 1840.  </P> <P> The council will select a mayor and mayor pro-tem Wednesday and participate in  a ceremonial inauguration at the Dana Point Resort. Fifth District County  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is to administer the oath of office. The public is  invited to the free event, at which hors d'oeuvres will be offered.  </P> <P> The council will eventually have to adopt a general plan and hire a city staff.  For now, the city has hired former Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley as  its city manager and former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson (D-Garden Grove) as its  city attorney.  </P> <P> The city hall now consists of a trailer at the construction site of an office  building, where the city has leased space. The city plans to build a civic  center within 3 years.  </P> <P> "I don't know that I'm nervous," Curreri said last week. "But I am excited and  glad that we're finally at the point that we can take action."  </P> <P> Getting there has been a long and troublesome journey for Dana Point.  </P> <P> Citizens who first tried to incorporate in 1961 couldn't even get enough  signatures on their petitions to qualify for a hearing before the County Board  of Supervisors, according to Dana Point historian Doris Walker.  </P> <P> Twice more during the next decade, residents tried to incorporate but were  turned down by the county for, among other things, not having a strong enough  economic base, Walker said. During that period, Dana Point was little more than  a sleepy backwater, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego.  </P> <P> But by the 1980s, the Dana Point Harbor had been built for yachts, the  Ritz-Carlton and Dana Point Resort hotels had opened and the community was  beginning to rival other county coastal cities for the lucrative tourist trade.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1987, Dana Point decided to try again for cityhood. Curreri  lead a group of residents to the County Local Agency Formation Commission with  a plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known as Old Dana Point.  </P> <P> LAFCO later added 1.5-mile-square Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that  outraged adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-mile-square coastal strip that  includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach  resort. The two resorts are expected to account for nearly $10 million in hotel  bed taxes -- a major reason Laguna Niguel laid claim to the same strip.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel's claim, however, has been rejected by both the county and by a  Superior Court judge. Laguna Niguel is appealing further.  </P> <P> With Dana Point's incorporation boundaries finally set, an election was held  June 7 in which three-quarters of voters approved cityhood.  </P> <P> The cityhood outcome pleased nearly everyone in the community, as it finally  freed residents from having to deal with county bureaucrats in faraway Santa  Ana for such matters as street improvements.  </P> <P> "The reason people wanted cityhood was to have accessibility to the  decision-makers," Curreri said.  </P> <P> Stan Cummings, director of the Orange County Marine Institute at Dana Cove  Park, said the incorporation finally gives him the sense of identity that he  had while growing up in a close-knit New England town.  </P> <P> "I really feel that we now have a city which controls a certain amount of its  own destiny," said Cummings, who will be master of ceremonies for Wednesday's  inauguration festivities. "The people running it will be people you see on the  street every day and who are friends and neighbors."  </P> <P> The self-governing process actually began before Sunday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traffic, Parking, Renewal  </P> <P> Dana Point's City Council-elect met on several occasions in recent months to  hear what residents want from their new city. They have cited traffic  congestion, parking shortages and the need to upgrade older areas.  </P> <P> It will take time for the city to organize, but Eggers and some other council  members believe they can alleviate traffic congestion quickly.  </P> <P> One major bottleneck, Eggers said, is at the intersection of Coast Highway and  Del Obispo Street, where afternoon commute traffic often backs up more than a  mile. Eggers said the city may press the California Department of  Transportation to widen Coast Highway by restriping the lanes.  </P> <P> The city may also try to speed up the planned extension across San Juan Creek  of Stonehill Drive, Eggers added, which would give motorists a second artery  for getting to Old Dana Point from Capistrano Beach. That extension project is  financed jointly by state and local agencies, so he said the city can help  facilitate the work by making sure its share of the money is allocated swiftly.  </P> <P> Conversely, some merchants are concerned that a recent rerouting of Coast  Highway traffic so one-way northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a  large chunk of the city's main business district causes traffic to whiz by too  fast for many potential customers to safely stop, Curreri said. She wants the  city to install lights on both one-way corridors to slow traffic down.  </P> <P> The city will also need to spend untold money repairing and maintaining roads  in older parts of the city, City Manager Talley said.  </P> <P> One of his first orders of business will be to study which roads need  attention, Talley said.  </P> <P> Eggers said the council will get involved in Dana Point's economic development.  "You can't have a healthy city if you don't have a healthy business community,"  he said.  </P> <P> Eggers would like the city to establish an economic development committee to  take a long-term look at the city's business needs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tourist Orientation Shunned  </P> <P> One thing Dana Point wants to avoid, he said, is seeing its business district  taken over by tourist-oriented "yogurt shops and novelty items," as he said has  happened in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> Instead, he said, the city needs to bill itself as a "destination resort" that  will not only have businesses catering to tourists but also to residents.  </P> <P> Ed Conway, a local Realtor and past president of the Dana Point Chamber of  Commerce, said business is growing in the city. Membership in the local Chamber  of Commerce, he said, grew from 400 in 1986 to 600 in 1988. Conway added that a  2-year boom in local real estate has pushed property values to unprecedented  levels. A three-bedroom home worth $150,000 in 1986 now fetches up to $300,000.  </P> <P> But the economic picture is not so bright for everybody in the new city.  </P> <P> In Capistrano Beach, for example, transients are known to be camping under  bridges and in fields, while Latino laborers congregate in large numbers along  Doheny Park Road in search of temporary work. Capistrano Beach merchants have  complained about the laborers, as well as about run-down housing along Doheny  Park Road.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Big Contrasts in 3 Areas  </P> <P> With pockets of poverty on one side of town and fabulous wealth on another --  homes in the Monarch Beach coastal strip on the north side of the city run into  the millions of dollars -- the Dana Point council will face a challenge in  meeting the needs of all residents.  </P> <P> But the council may be ill-equipped to do that, as two of the council members  live in the Monarch Beach strip and the other three live in Old Dana Point,  said Peg Maynard, leader of a citizens' watchdog group calling itself the  Coastal Organization Group.  </P> <P> There is no one, she said, to watch out for the interests of Capistrano Beach,  where 7,000 city residents live.  </P> <P> Maynard, who along with many other members of the group ran unsuccessfully for  the Dana Point council, said the city should have its council members elected  by district to ensure fair representation.  </P> <P> But Curreri argued that districting "tends to narrow people's focus and tends  to encourage political deal-making. I would rather have five people concerned  equally about the whole area."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Lonn Johnston contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DANA POINT: AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Named after: Richard Henry Dana Jr., author of the classic American seafaring  tale, "Two Years Before the Mast" (1840)  </P> <P> Location: On the coast midway between Los Angeles and San Diego (60 miles from  each)  </P> <P> Transportation: Auto via Interstate 5 or Pacific Coast Highway, Amtrak from San  Juan Capistrano Depot, air out of John Wayne Airport (35 miles away), bus via  Greyhound and Orange County Transit  </P> <P> Incorporated: Jan. 3, 1989 (Orange County's 28th and newest city)  </P> <P> Population: 26,000  </P> <P> Registered voters: 15,572  </P> <P> Area: 6 square miles  </P> <P> Elevation: Sea level to 350 feet  </P> <P> Average rainfall: 10 inches per year  </P> <P> Median family income: $39,000  </P> <P> Major employers: Hotels, restaurants, supermarkets, real estate, offices,  school district and Capistrano-by-the-Sea Hospital  </P> <P> Number of businesses: 1,500  </P> <P> Lodging: 10 existing hotels (1,155 rooms and suites), 5 proposed hotels (1,399  rooms and suites)  </P> <P> Landmarks: Richard Henry Dana statue on Harbor Island, the tall ship Pilgrim,  Orange County Marine Institute, Harbor View gazebo, Harbor Pier, Doheny State  Beach, Lantern Bay Park and Heritage Park  </P> <P> </P> <P> DANA POINT'S FIRST CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bill Bamattre  </P> <P> Occupation: Los Angeles Fire Department captain.  </P> <P> Age: 36  </P> <P> Residence: 6-year Dana Point resident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judy Curreri  </P> <P> Occupation: nurse.  </P> <P> Age: 46.  </P> <P> Residence: 13-year Dana Point resident.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mike Eggers  </P> <P> Occupation: Businessman and congressional aide to Rep.

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> WOMAN BURNED IN 'SPITE FIRE'  </P> <P> A Newhall woman who was burning her husband's clothing in a barbecue after an  argument set fire to herself and her house early today, authorities said.  </P> <P> Linda Sue Dittman, 32, was in critical condition at County-USC Medical Center  after the 1:30 a.m. fire in the 24000 block of Chestnut Street, Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Davidheiser said.  </P> <P> Damage to the house was estimated at $40,000.  </P> <P> Dittman told county firefighters that she had argued with her husband, whom she  is divorcing, and decided to burn his clothes, officials said. She took an  armful of clothes to a front porch barbecue and used lighter fluid to ignite  them.  </P> <P> The fire flashed and Dittman ran out to the street, her clothing on fire. The  fire from the barbecue ignited the porch overhang and nearby boxes and quickly  spread to the house.  </P> <P> Her husband, whose name was not released, was not home at the time of the fire.  A neighbor who saw Dittman in the street called the Fire Department. She was  taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and later transferred to the burn  unit at County-USC Medical Center.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Jiang Zuozhong (3068 0146 0022) and He Ping </F> (0149 1627)]    [Text] Shenzhen, 6 Feb (XINHUA) -- The No. 1 Generating  Unit of Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant -- China's  first large nuclear power plant built with foreign funds and  advanced equipment and technology -- recently began commercial  operation. Li Peng, premier of the State Council, attended and  cut the ribbon at a celebration held at the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant this morning. In the evening of 5 February, Premier  Li Peng held a reception in Shenzhen. He cordially met and  addressed those attending the celebration, including those  responsible for the joint venture that set up the Daya Bay  Nuclear Power Plant; Chinese and foreign suppliers and  contractors; representatives of Chinese and foreign experts; and  French and British diplomats in China. He pointed out: The Daya  Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result of reform and opening up,  and has been a beneficial experiment in establishing a modern  enterprise system.    Jointly funded and constructed by the Guangdong Nuclear  Power  Investment Company Limited and the Hong Kong Nuclear Power  Investment Company Limited, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is  a large nuclear power plant with two pressurized water reactors  capable of generating 900,000 kilowatts. The reactors were  imported from France and Britain. Construction of the plant  began in early 1984 and civil engineering and construction  projects for various key buildings were essentially completed at  the end of 1990. The No. 1 Generating Unit formally began  commercial operations on 1 February. The No. 2 Generating Unit  of the plant is expected to commence commercial operations this  year. Once fully complete, the nuclear power plant will  generate more than 10 billion kwh of electricity annually, and  will play an active role in helping economic progress and  prosperity in Guangdong and Hong Kong.    Li Peng said at the reception: The commercial operation of  the No. 1 generating unit of the power plant marks a new step  for China in the development of its nuclear power industry. The  Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant is China's first medium-scale  nuclear power plant which was researched, designed,  manufactured, and built by China itself. The Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Plant is China's first large nuclear power plant built  with foreign funds and advanced equipment and technology. The  construction of both nuclear plants has important significance  for China as it starts to develop its nuclear power industry,  cultivate its technological personnel, and master nuclear power  technology.    Li Peng said: The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a result  of reform and opening up. As early as 1979, when China had just  begun to implement its policy of reform and opening up, the  Power Industry Ministry Industry and Guangdong Province proposed  the idea of taking advantage of Shenzhen's favorable  geographical location to attract foreign capital, construct a  plant with loans, and repay the loans by selling electricity,  thereby blazing a new path for China in the use of foreign funds  and the development of large infrastructural projects. The Daya  Bay Nuclear Plant was China's largest Sino- foreign  joint-venture enterprise set up in the early period of reform  and opening up. In accordance with international normal  practice, the plant has established a modern enterprise  management system and enforces a responsibility system whereby  the general manager is under the guidance of a board of  directors. The plant has, therefore, separated government from  enterprise functions, and has instituted specific  responsibilities and a scientific management system. In the  course of constructing the power plant, it has introduced  competitive mechanisms, and has adopted a system of attracting  and accepting public tenders whereby it chose outstanding  Chinese and foreign suppliers and construction enterprises to  join in various endeavors including design, construction,  experimentation, and consultation. The commendable aspects of  the construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Plant are not only that  China has imported advanced foreign equipment and technology,  but it has also gained from advanced foreign experience in  organizing and managing construction projects, thereby  considerably raising its standards of modern construction.    Li Peng said: The party central committee and the State  Council have been paying attention to and supporting the Daya  Bay Nuclear Power Plant project. The State Council has held  many meetings to expound and demonstrate the necessity of the  project. When the joint-venture agreement was signed by the  Guangdong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited in 1985,  Comrade Deng Xiaoping personally met Lord Kadoorie, founder of  the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited and  former chairman of Hong Kong's China Light and Power Company,  thereby fully endorsing his approval and support for the new  project, which arose from reform and opening up. Comrade Jiang  Zemin has been very concerned with the work at the nuclear power  plant: He personally visited and gave instructions at the work  site. During crucial moments when the project was under  construction, many leading comrades of the party Central  Committee and the State Council involved themselves personally  and resolved problems as they occurred in an effort to help the  project progress smoothly. Localities and departments --  including the Power Industry Ministry, the China National  Nuclear Corporation, Guangdong Province, and Shenzhen city --  have done a lot of work to help construction of the nuclear  power plant, have created various conditions, and have provided  effective support in various aspects. The plant is also a  product of the constructive efforts of both the central and  local governments.    Li Peng expressed his hope: Chinese and foreign suppliers  and contractors, as well as Chinese and foreign personnel at the  work site, should continue to make efforts and contribute to  finishing the whole nuclear power plant project comprehensively  and efficiently. Not only should we properly construct the new  nuclear power plant, but we should also manage it properly. In  a sense, it is more difficult to manage a nuclear power plant  properly than to build it properly. Therefore, when operating  the power plant in the future, all personnel must persistently  pursue the principle of "quality and safety first" to ensure  that electricity is safely, efficiently, and continuously  generated and supplied to Guangdong and Hong Kong and so  promotes economic prosperity in the region.    Li Peng said: China needs a lot of electricity. While  vigorously developing thermal and hydroelectric power stations,  we should also appropriately develop nuclear power plants as  local conditions demand. The construction of the Daya Bay  Nuclear Power Plant has generated successful experience on which  the development of China's nuclear power industry can be based,  and has trained a large number of specialist nuclear power  professionals. Meanwhile, it has also created favorable  conditions for the development of the second-phase construction  project at Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant. At present, China is  comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, it is deepening reform and opening wider to  the outside world. Foreign investors have been very  enthusiastic about investing in China. China has continually  improved its investment environment and has further widened the  scope for new investment. We welcome foreign investors to join  us in developing China's basic industries and infrastructural  facilities and warmly invite friends from various countries to  carry out further economic and technological cooperation with  China.    Leading comrades attending the celebration and the reception  were Ding Guangen, Zou Jiahua, and Xie Fei; and also responsible  persons from relevant departments of the State Council, from  Guangdong Province, and from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong  branch.    Also invited to attend the celebration and reception were  the  French and British ambassadors to China; and responsible persons  from enterprises including Hong Kong's China Light and Power  Company, the Hong Kong Nuclear Power Investment Company Limited,  the French Power Company, the French Framatome Corporation, the  French and British General Electric Alsthom Corporation, and the  British General Electric Company.</p>

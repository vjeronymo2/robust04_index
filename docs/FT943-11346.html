			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Bullion pressures S Africa Gold shares came under pressure in afternoon Johannesburg as sellers gathered after the bullion price failed to recover from overnight lows. Other shares also drifted lower but no real selling was seen as sentiment held up after Wall Street gained overnight and posted gains in early trade yesterday. The overall index finished 20 softer at 5,652, industrials lost 27 to 6,407 and golds fell 28 at 2,138. Few fresh factors emerged to influence direction in the slow pre-weekend atmosphere. Gencor continued to tend softer as demand slowed after the announcement of its purchase of Billiton. It was 5 cents softer at R11.90. Anglos added R3 to R249, De Beers was 75 cents lower at R111 after falling on Nasdaq, and SAB fell R1 to R87. Remgro shed 50 cents to R25.50 and Barlows made 25 cents to R34 in a late rally. Lonrho picked up 30 cents to of Thursday's losses to R9.75. Vaal Reefs shed R4 to R406 and Kloof was 50 cents off at R58.50.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Paul Simon and MC Hammer - Wembley Arena So what's wrong with perfection? It was certainly on offer at Wembley on Wednesday when Paul Simon brought his Born at the Right Time tour to the capital. Here was musicianship of consummate skill; here catchy songs of four decades, which stretch from the homesick musings of an American in Wigan, where Simon wrote 'Homeward Bound', to a joyous celebration of the 'world music' which Simon has almost single handledly popularised; here was an orchestrated performance which would have won the approval of the military. And here were quite a few yawns. For everything on stage was as sanitised and well behaved as the audience, which sat in awestruck wonder for an hour before finally rising as a man to 'You can call me Al'. Simon was so pleased to have broken the spell that he played the song twice. From then on the tingle level rose steadily and by the time he had shed his baker's dozen of supporting musicians, shouldered his guitar, and stepped back in time three decades for the songs of his youth, you could accept his old fashioned standards. Simon does not come across as a member of the monster raving looney party. He is a stocky, immobile figure in black suit and T-shirt. He obviously took pleasure in the enjoyment of the audience but he equally obviously rules his band with a rod of iron. Since they are mainly uninhibted African musicians, including five percussionists, it rather hints at a party which never really starts. But few musicians have given so much to popular music as Simon and he is still experimenting, not only with his dashes into Soweto and Salvador for the rhythms for his last two albums, but also in his repackaging of chewed over chestnuts like 'Bridge over troubled water', here revived to a reggae beat. This was a concert rather than a show, with no screen to magnify the tiny star, and with an array of musical hardware on stage which severely inhibited scope for movement. Not that there was much desire to dance - to sway, yes, to 'Graceland'; to re-live pretty songs like 'Still crazy' and poignant songs, like 'The Boxer', and to admire the way that Paul Simon has made pop politically, musically and aesthetically respectable. But not quite as respectable as Monday night on the same stage when MC Hammer, the most successful rapper in the world, brought a very bland version of the art to the UK. He has made money by adapting rap for Middle America - no 'burn whitey' talk here, more love your neighbourhood cop. MC is quite without charisma, using the hammer of a non-stop 'posse' of dancers, singers and musicians to crack some very small nuts.</p>

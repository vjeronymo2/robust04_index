			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE;  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED AFTER PHOTO SHOWN ON TV  </P> <P> A Pennsylvania man wanted as a suspect in at least 10 armed robberies was  arrested in California after he was featured on a national television crime  show. Paul Coury, 38, of Mt.  </P> <P> Lebanon, Pa., was arrested Friday at his electronics rental business in  Riverside, police said. He is a suspect in Pittsburgh-area robberies in 1986  and 1987. Pittsburgh Detective James Holliday said the break in the case came  last weekend when the nationally syndicated program "Crimestoppers" ran a  feature on Coury and showed a picture of his face. The program airs in  Pittsburgh and dozens of viewers called Holliday. One man identified Coury as a  man at the rental business using an alias of Steve Pierce. Coury also is wanted  for robbery in West Virginia, authorities said, and was a suspect in an arson  that destroyed a pizza shop he owned.  </P></p>

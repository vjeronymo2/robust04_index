			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> POPE CONDEMNS ABORTION, DIVORCE AS HE ARRIVES IN LIBERAL DENMARK  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II bitterly condemned abortion and divorce as ravages of sin as  he began a visit today to Denmark, known for its liberal views on sex and the  family.  </P> <P> It was the first time John Paul raised the subjects on his tour of Scandinavia,  where attitudes on sex clash sharply with Roman Catholic teachings.  </P> <P> Celebrating a Mass in the park of a monastery, the pontiff said sin in today's  world takes the form of "widespread indifference to the things of God . . . a  readiness to disregard human life or manipulate it. . . ."  </P> <P> The Pope was speaking in a country where one abortion is recorded for every  three births and half the marriages end in divorce.  </P></p>

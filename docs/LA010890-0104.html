			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> HONECKER TO UNDERGO SURGERY  </P> <P> Former East German leader Erich Honecker is in an East Berlin hospital and will  undergo surgery for a cancerous kidney tumor, the West German news agency DPA  said today.  </P> <P> Honecker, 77, is under official investigation on charges of profiteering and  abuses of power, but East German doctors said last week that he was suffering  from a malignant kidney tumor and was too ill to be jailed.  </P> <P> DPA, quoting hospital sources, said the former hard-line Communist leader was  admitted at East Berlin's Charite hospital last weekend. The agency said  Honecker was seen in the corridors of the hospital, wearing a jogging outfit  and looking "well considering the circumstances."  </P></p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / MPs oppose closure of Department of Energy GOVERNMENT plans to close the Department of Energy were condemned yesterday amid warnings that the move would stifle public debate in the formulation of UK energy policy. The Commons energy committee rejected Conservative party claims that privatisation of gas and electricity had made the department redundant. The all-party committee argued in a report that may be its swan-song that it should survive even if the department was closed. The committee's plea was directed at the Conservatives because Labour has no plans to close the department. The MPs noted that the regulators appointed to monitor the privatised gas and electricity industries were answerable to parliament. But that would be 'little more than a constitutional fiction' if they were not interrogated regularly by the committee, the MPs added. The committee said it had made useful recommendations in the past. It had corrected the government's tendency to plan large new power stations rather than considering alternatives such as controlling demand through energy efficiency. The government had often made mistakes by acting against committee recommendations, the MPs said.</p>

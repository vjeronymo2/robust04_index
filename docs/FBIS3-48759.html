			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "NHK News 7" program] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has begun an investigation into whether a Japanese  trading firm violated a law prohibiting arms deals. The firm  was involved in a deal whereby a decommissioned Russian  submarine was exported to North Korea.    Since the deal was revealed early this month, the ministry  has suggested that the firm might have acted as a mediator to  provide arms to North Korea. The submarine was sold by Russia  to North Korea.    NHK took this footage last May when a salvage operation was  underway. [video shows Russian submarines -- including a  worn-out "Golf II" class submarine -- being salvaged] Ruskiy  Island in Vladivostok Bay is the graveyard for decommissioned  ships from the Russian Fleet. The submarine in question was  towed from the island to Najin, a port in the north of North  Korea.    THE NEW YORK TIMES of the United States reported 40  submarines have been sold by Russia to North Korea through  Japanese trading companies. The report has caused considerable  concern since the international community increasingly suspects  that North Korea is attempting to develop nuclear weapons.    How was this recent deal concluded? It was a salvage company  in Vladivostok which refloated the submarine and towed it to  North Korea. (Boyko), managing director of the submarine  salvage company, said they towed only one submarine to North  Korea. Asked if this was disassembled, he said they salvaged it  as it was. He added he heard the North Koreans would scrap the  submarine.    Admiral (Gromov), commander-in-chief of the Russian Navy,  has  confirmed the deal. He said the Russian Defense Ministry  entered into a direct business contract with a Japanese company.  The trading company in Tokyo which arranged the submarine deal  was set up three years ago. The company has four employees, and  has a factory which is a joint venture with North Korea. About  one year ago the company began buying up Russian locomotives and  rails to sell as scrap iron.    The company said the submarine deal this time was proposed  by  its North Korean partner last September, and it was asked to  guarantee payment to Russia. The company said it had been asked  by a Russian firm if it would buy submarines for scrap iron.  This being the situation, the company said it believed the  submarine deal had nothing to do with armaments.    The president of the trading company said the submarines and  warships are purchased for use as scrap iron. He said he does  not understand why this has become such a big issue. If North  Korea had intended to use it for military purposes, it could  have made a direct request to Russia to sell a submarine. He  said Russia would be willing to do this for the right price.    NHK has learned more about this scrap iron business which  involves four countries in the Far East -- over decommissioned  submarines from the days of the arms race in the Cold War. Old  submarines are purchased for $60 per ton (by the Japanese  company). The submarines are dismantled and turned into scrap  iron in North Korea. The scrap iron is then sold back to the  Japanese trading company for $130 per ton, including labor costs  and other expenses. The company then sells the scrap to China  for around $170 a ton -- the international market price. The  company makes a profit of $40 a ton, and North Korea obtains  about $70 per ton in hard currency.    The people involved said this was a straight-forward deal in  scrap iron. Was it true of the submarine which was delivered to  North Korea? The submarine in question was commissioned by the  Russian Pacific Fleet in the 1960's, and was decommissioned six  years ago. Russia says the old weapons and equipment were  removed.    Military commentator Kensuke Obata said the submarine has  been underwater for more than five years, and, as such, should  be almost impossible to put it back into use as a submarine. He  said because it is made up of top quality iron, it could be a  source of earning hard currency from third countries -- if the  submarine is dismantled by cheap labor. Obata said this is the  only way for the submarine to be of any value in his opinion.    The collapse of the Soviet Union has forced North Korea to  depend for its crude oil supply on China. Iron has become the  only metal that can be exported to China in return. Labor is  cheap in North Korea, and there is a large number of obsolete  submarines in Russia. The economic boom in China has sharply  increased the demand for iron there. The deal was made possible  by the domestic situation in each of these three countries.    Meanwhile, MITI's Export Division said it is now looking  into  the matter because it is possible the deal violated the Foreign  Exchange Law and the Foreign Trade Control Law which prohibit  mediation in arms deals.</p>

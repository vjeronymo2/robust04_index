			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GREAT FRIED POTATO REFORM  </P> <P> By the end of this year more than 18,000 McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's  restaurants in the United States will be serving french fries cooked wholly in  vegetable oil, instead of their customary mixture of beef tallow and oil. With  this single step, long urged by nutritionists and health-conscious consumers, a  traditional junk food will lose much of its junk, leaving a more nutritious  dish that contains 45% less saturated fat.  </P> <P> Yes, American arteries will be better for that. But now to the question that  burns in the minds of millions who enjoy those french fries just as they are:  How will they taste?  </P> <P> They worked on it -- McDonald's spent eight years on research -- and now they  say they have the answers. The taste will be "preserved," a McDonald's official  says. We'll see.  </P> <P> But greasy goodness aside, the three major chains do deserve credit for  responding to changing public concerns. Saturated fats, like beef tallow,  contribute significantly to heart disease and other ailments. But fats of this  kind also add a flavor and texture that explains much of the appeal of certain  prepared foods. That's why the challenge was to find substitutes that would  approximate the taste consumers like.  </P> <P> The great fried potato reform is part of a revolution in the fast-food world. A  lot of chain restaurants are now offering grilled chicken instead of fried, for  example.  </P> <P> Fast-food restaurants serve billions of meals each year. Efforts to make those  meals healthier -- without losing all the fun -- deserve approval.  </P></p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Why Sandinistas are killing Sandinistas: The economic background to rebellion THREE YEARS after the electoral defeat of the left-wing Sandinista FSLN party in Nicaragua, the changes brought about by President Violeta Chamorro are becoming increasingly apparent. The potholes in the roads are as bad as ever, but the streets are filled with new American and Japanese cars, the capital has its first traffic roundabout, and a new, gaudily-painted cathedral has appeared on a plot of derelict land where cows once grazed. But the question on many people's minds in Nicaragua this weekend, as the country reflects on the recent confrontations between the army and left-wing Sandinista rebels, is whether the centrist government of President Chamorro can last until 1996, the end of its six-year term. Last Wednesday, a rebel group seized the northern town of Estel and cut the Pan-American highway. General Umberto Ortega, the Sandinista head of the army, ordered his troops to crush the rebels, killing 41 of them and capturing 104 more. But the group which seized the town had not set out to topple the government. Its demands were economic  - primarily drawing attention to the alarming deterioration of economic conditions for the urban and rural poor in a country struggling to recover from almost two decades of civil war. The election of Mrs Chamorro in 1990, on a platform of peace, reconciliation and prosperity, led to the disarming of 20,000 US-backed Contra rebels, the demobilisation of 80 per cent of the armed forces, and the formation of what was widely viewed as a transitional government. The FSLN, which had ruled the country since 1979 after overthrowing the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, was allowed to keep control of the armed forces under the leadership of Gen Ortega, the brother of the FSLN leader Daniel Ortega. This has been a simmering source of conflict both with the US and with Mrs Chamorro's erstwhile political allies in the UNO coalition, which she headed against the Sandinistas in the elections. Most of her UNO partners have now opted to go into opposition, including her vice president, Dr Virgilio Godoy, leaving her dependent on the support centrist parties and her erstwhile foes, the Sandinistas. The taps of US economic aid have only been opened grudgingly, to the exasperation of her ministers, who have performed an economic miracle in balancing the budget and stabilising the currency. But this has been achieved only at the cost of drastically cutting social services set up by the Sandinistas and sharply curtailing bank loans to small farmers and businesses, with a resulting slump in agricultural and industrial output. Unemployment is estimated to exceed 50 per cent of the workforce. The attack on Estel was the boiling over of discontent which has been simmering for more than a year. Around 1,500 rebels, in over 50 different groups, are now estimated to be active in the north of the country. Most are peasant farmers who have had extensive military training either in the Sandinista army or in the Contra ranks. Some have found they now have a common cause and operate together, while some groups are fighting one another. This week's government action was the swiftest and most violent military action in the country since the 1980s. The difference is that Sandinistas are now killing each other. Gen Ortega has proved his constitutionalist credentials by standing firmly behind the government, but the FSLN is deeply divided. Many of its militants, and even some of its leaders, are sympathetic to the rebels' demands, if not to their methods. One wing of the party, backed by the trade unions and peasant farmers' leaders, wants the FSLN to withdraw its parliamentary support for President Chamorro's cabinet. Most of the UNO parties are already boycotting the parliament, or voting against the government. Withdrawal of FSLN support for the centrist coalition would paralyse the government and precipitate a constitutional crisis. If the political centre collapsed, only one institution capable of keeping the extremes apart would remain  - the army under General Umberto Ortega.</p>

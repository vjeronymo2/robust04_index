			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt In the current German interest rate hiatus, with the Bundesbank waiting to see what happens on the monetary, economic and political fronts, the eyes of the bond market are fixed on the US. Although Friday's US data proved positive for the financial markets, concern over the timing and impact of the next US interest rate rise remains to the fore. The main domestic news last week was the easing of west German inflation to 2.8 per cent, bringing it closer to the central bank's 2 per cent goal, and the recommendation by the main economic research institutes that interest rates should not be cut significantly.

This makes it even more determined to rein back money supply growth to a rate more consistent with low inflation. Until M3 slows down more sharply, those who believe there is no more scope for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates in the current cycle will be strengthened in their views. Even so, some voices still argue that another cut in the discount and Lombard rates, which have been static since May, is probable.

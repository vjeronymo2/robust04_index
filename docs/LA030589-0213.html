			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ALEMANY WHIPS CHAMINADE, 22-3  </P> <P> On paper, Chaminade High figured to play Alemany close Saturday in the second  round of the Westside baseball tournament.  </P> <P> Four Eagles starters returned from last year's Southern Section 2-A Division  playoff team, and, although Alemany plays in a larger division, the team is  coming off a sub-par season. And that was with ace left-hander Joey Rosselli,  who is out for at least a month because of a broken hand.  </P> <P> Shows how much weight paper carries.  </P> <P> Alemany broke open a 2-1 game with a seven-run fourth inning and went on to a  22-3 win over visiting Chaminade.  </P> <P> In the sixth, the Indians nearly doubled their fourth-inning output, scoring 13  runs. Beauchemin and Jeff Ordana hit home runs in the inning. DAVID SALKIN Simi  Valley 8, Millikan 7 -- Simi Valley Coach Mike Scyphers notched his 200th  career victory as the Pioneers upset the second-ranked team in the Southern  Section 5-A in a second-round game of the El Segundo tournament.

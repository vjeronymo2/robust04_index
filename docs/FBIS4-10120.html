			<p>BFN     [Text] The president-in-exile has not given an official  answer on the new plan proposed by the United States for an end  to the crisis. The president-in-exile's spokesman specified that  the government's position will be known this week. Reacting to  the initiatives undertaken in Port-au-Prince attempting to apply  Article 149 of the Constitution, spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau  stated that the problem of democracy is not a question of  applying some article of the Constitution, but to neutralize  those who constitute an obstacle to democracy. Mr. Martineau  also rejected the calls for resignation by some opponents and  even some supporters of the president-in-exile. He answered  Clarence Renois' questions:    [Begin recording in Creole] [Martineau] The U.S. plan to  solve the crisis is still being studied. Before long, I suppose  that President Aristide will give an answer, his opinion on this  plan.    Concerning the people who are in Haiti -- the political  parties that want to refer to Article 149 -- there is one thing  we would like to point out to them and I believe they already  know: Article 148, 149, 250 or 3000, will not solve the crisis  in Haiti because the crisis in Haiti does not lie there. The  president's absence is not voluntary. It is an absence which  came after a coup d'etat. That is the first thing they should  know. I believe they know that. The second point to consider is  that no matter the article they refer to, and no matter how they  try to replace the president -- the unconstitutional way they  would like to do it -- it will still not solve the crisis.  Because the crisis is simply because Haiti, instead of being a  country, a republic, has become a drug warehouse where people  are killing people, manhandling people as they please. This  crisis cannot be solved with articles. Haitians who favor  democracy must stand up to change things so the country then has  peace and with peace, it can rebuild itself.    [Renois] Mr. Martineau, some supporters and opponents of  President Aristide asked the president to resign in order to  allow a solution to the crisis. Does President Aristide take  into account those considerations? Does he take into account  those positions. What does he intend to do?    [Martineau] No. I suppose those people should know who  should resign under these conditions. I think the people who  are killing people should resign. I think if those people can  ask President Aristide to resign, they should first ask the  Haitian people if they have changed their vote. Are they giving  the Haitian people the right to say yes or no, whether they  changed their 16 December vote? That is what they ought to do  if they have the courage. I think there is a sort of cowardice  when President Aristide is asked to resign and at the same time  one kowtows to the military who are murdering people. I think  those people know exactly who should resign under these  circumstances -- people who are killing, who are selling drugs  and who are manhandling people -- those are the people who  should resign. In Haiti there should not be a resignation of  peace, but rather a resignation of the pressure tactics of sorts.    [Renois] Mr. Martineau, it appears then that there is a bit  of Indian wrestling going on between President Aristide's  legitimacy and the authority of the current government or the  military who overthrew him. In the end, it harms the Haitian  people, since sanctions have been imposed. What is now being  done by the government-in-exile to effect an improvement of the  situation? Are there some steps being taken at that level?    [Martineau] Certainly some steps are being taken at that  level. Meanwhile, do not forget that a president in any country  is an advocate of the Constitution. Do we have a Constitution  or do we not? No matter the compromise that can be reached,  should those compromises violate the Constitution? In Haiti,  everyone violates the Constitution, except one group, the group  that favors democracy. The most stupid thing is that they are  asking this group to resign. In this case, what is the future of  elections, of the Constitution in Haiti? Every time a president  is elected, if the military does not want him, they overthrow  him and they assert that everything must change. Well! Some  things must change in Haiti. But, it is not the Constitution,  it is not the law. It is force, selfishness, and thievery that  must change in Haiti.    [Renois] A final question Mr. Martineau. Does the  government-in-exile hope the situation will change in favor of  President Aristide so he can return to power?    [Martineau] It is not something that should change in favor  of President Aristide. It must be in favor of the Haitian  people. Yes, we hope that things will change and we hope that no  matter what happens, the Haitian people will win. [end  recording].</p>

			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The rising yen means pain for a supplier: Michiyo Nakamoto visits a silent factory that used to hum for Sanyo Year-end is a quiet time for factories in the Japanese countryside as brightly polished machinery lies idle, awaiting the start of work in the new year. But these days, the silence that surrounds the factory of Sanritsu Electric at Tokushima, on the southern island of Shikoku, is not limited to the holiday season. Since October, the 170 employees of the factory have been forced to stay away, although they are still on the payroll and receive 90 per cent of their wages. The factory, which has supplied Sanyo Electric with consumer electronic products for 26 years, was suddenly told in August that Sanyo would no longer be ordering products from Tokushima. Production of compact disc/radio/cassette players, which the Tokushima plant had supplied, was to move to Singapore. Two months later, Sanritsu's Tokushima factory was out of orders. Sanritsu's plight reflects the difficulties facing Japan's electronics manufacturers amid the yen's sharp appreciation last year. Japanese electronics makers have been moving production overseas so as to take advantage of lower labour costs overseas but many of the larger companies have tried to avoid closing domestic factories by moving low-end products abroad and keeping the manufacture of higher value-added products in Japan. Where this is not possible, Japanese corporate etiquette calls for consultations with the factory's labour unions and a plan to make gradual the pain of job losses. Such consideration towards Sanritsu might have been expected, particularly from Sanyo, which has a 20 per cent stake in its supplier. Yet that does not seem to have happened at Tokushima. Sanyo will not comment but the apparent suddenness and clumsiness with which Sanyo handled the closure suggest that the yen's rise had been so rapid and sharp that the company had no scope to devise a smoother disengagement. 'We were completely taken by surprise,' says Mr Junichi Nakatsuma, chairman of the Sanritsu branch of the National Metal and Machinery Workers' Union. But employees at Tokushima had known for some time that things were not what they used to be. In autumn 1992, Sanyo had warned Sanritsu that output would fall. Production of CD/radio/cassette recorders had been halved from 1,000 units a day at their peak to 500 by summer 1993. There was talk of restructuring and, last spring, the factory had to close for 40 days. However, Sanyo had said earlier last year that it would order a new product from the factory in September, so 'we thought work would be available,' Mr Nakatsuma says. Sanritsu employees see that Sanyo needs to lower its prices to stay competitive, which means moving production beyond Japan. 'It will be a huge burden on Sanyo to continue production at Tokushima,' says Mr Hiroaki Nakmura, head of the factory. Mr Nakatsuma agrees. With larger makers lowering prices, Sanyo has little choice, he says. The union leader believes Sanyo decided to move production abroad once a competitor had begun to produce a new product - a multiple CD stacking player which Sanyo was also planning - in China. But he still holds Sanyo responsible for the grim future Sanritsu employees face. 'For 26 years, we have been a manufacturing plant for Sanyo, even though we are an independent company,' Mr Nakatsuma says. 'Everything we did had to be approved by Sanyo and it was difficult for a company partly owned by Sanyo to get work from another company. We were completely dependent on Sanyo.' Most of the equipment on Sanritsu's spartan factory floor has been leased from Sanyo and the signs on the walls proclaim Sanyo slogans. In a small town such as Kawashima, site of the Sanritsu factory, there is little alternatives work. Many of the suppliers to large electronics, automotive and paper companies have already moved to deal with falling output, for instance through temporary closures. Many of Sanritsu's employees at Tokushima have worked for the company for more than 20 years. 'Closure of the factory is a matter of life and death for them and we don't feel Sanyo has taken enough responsibility in that respect,' Mr Nakatsuma says. The discord highlights the difficulties Japanese companies face in trying to cut the umbilical cord that ties them to their suppliers, particularly those in which they have an equity stake. When they realised what was happening, Sanritsu's labour unions went into action. Pressure was put on local politicians, who in turn put pressure on the labour ministry. Outside Sanritsu's factory are large placards calling on Sanyo to keep the factory alive. The bad publicity forced Sanyo to offer a concession. It said it was willing to bring part of its production of CD/radio/cassette recorders back to Japan so as to keep Tokushima going for two years. The production volume, however, requires a cut in the workforce from 170 to 60, and Sanyo wants to choose the fortunates. But Sanritsu's largest labour union refuses forced redundancies, leaving negotiations stalled. The workers want more time to allow the plant to seek work from other electronics groups. 'We are asking for a gradual shift to independence,' a union leader says. He has no doubts: 'Sanyo must take responsibility for that.'</p>

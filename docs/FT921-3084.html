			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (19): Wheat controversy - Food Self-sufficiency ONCE AGAIN, an issue that is central to Nigeria's attempts to reach food self-sufficiency has become an object of intense debate and speculation this year: whether the government will lift the import ban on wheat and wheat flour in advance of the transition to civilian rule next January. Import bans on wheat, maize, rice, vegetables, roots and tubers, combined with devaluation and price liberalisation, have been critical over the past six years in radically boosting domestic food production to about 20m tonnes of grain equivalent food staples. New varieties of disease-resistant and high yield cassava, better investment in roads and rural infrastructure and wider applications of fertiliser have also had a tremendous impact on food self-sufficiency. Taken together, these factors, combined with good rains throughout 1991, produced a record crop of food staples. Some agriculturalists are now beginning to talk about the serious possibility of limited exports of cassava, fruits and vegetables. Few doubt the positive impact the import bans have had on boosting incentives to farmers and fundamentally changing the dietary habits of Nigerians who, in 1983, consumed 3m tonnes of food imports worth about Dollars 2bn. The ban on maize, a crop which does particularly well in Nigeria, has been successful with production now estimated at about 1.8-2m tonnes annually. Locally produced rice continues to be about 20-30 per cent more expensive than international prices, which has stimulated about 150,000 tonnes of smuggling annually. But milled rice production has expanded to about 570,000 tonnes, quality and processing techniques are improving and costs are falling. No such progress has been made in wheat. The ban remains an object of nagging controversy and threatens to overshadow the considerable gains of the past five years Western donors believe the government is now facing up to what they describe as the 'failure' of the wheat ban and have already conceded it is costing the economy dear. The ban was designed to stimulate domestic production of wheat and to encourage Nigerians to substitute bread for other staples. For the past five years huge sums of money have been poured into the wheat farmers of the northern and middle belt of the country, who represent an influential political lobby. Government officials maintained wheat production had more than doubled to about 250,000 tonnes. Now, however, senior officials in the ministry of agriculture admit maximum production is 60,000-90,000 tonnes annually as a result of poor yields and an unfavorable climate. The high cost of subsidies and unstoppable smuggling of wheat and flour has forced the government to re-examine the economic costs and benefits of the wheat ban. Smuggling is draining the economy of millions of dollars of foreign exchange and the benefits in terms of jobs and incomes of a productive milling industry. According to the US, which supplied 1.5m tonnes of wheat before the ban and has been putting pressure on the government to rescind the policy, smuggled imports of wheat and wheat flour increased from 350,000 tonnes in 1989-90 to 480,000 tonnes in 1990-91. The US argues this figure will increase to 550,000 tonnes in 1991-92 and that Nigerian wheat output slumped to 30,000-50,000 tonnes last year. The local production cost - N6,000 a tonne - is almost two and a half times the international price of Dollars 130-Dollars 140 a tonne. Not surprisingly, the price of a loaf of bread - about N20  - is more than double the price in neighbouring Benin and Cameroon, whose bakeries provide the bulk of smuggled imports. Cameroon, for example, imported 310,000 tonnes of wheat last year for a country with a maximum domestic demand of 150,000 tonnes. The flour millers, too, who have a combined capacity of 4m tonnes a year, have been putting pressure on the government to rescind the ban and ensure the value added from milling and baking is restored to the Nigerian economy rather than given to its neighbours. Last year, the National Association of Flour Millers, faced with a shortage of locally available wheat, the high cost of smuggled imports and capacity utilisation of less than 10 per cent, presented a plan to the government. The plan called for an official import quota of 500,000 tonnes, with allocations given to each mill based on existing capacity. A levy of N1,000 a tonne would be raised on all imports and the total, about N500m, put into an Agricultural Development Fund to stimulate local wheat production and provide extra resources for the sector. Millers argue this policy would boost local industry, provide hundreds of jobs and produce bread at lower prices. Relaxing the import ban on wheat will be difficult for a government which believes that imported wheat is highly subsidised and has stressed the dangers of a developing country relying on imported foods. However, western donors who support the millers plan say it is time the government concentrated resources on promoting food crops which are profitable and have a comparative advantage, such as maize, rice and cassava, and on boosting exports of livestock, cocoa, rubber and cotton. The wheat import ban is no longer viable, they say, and is draining the sector of money which could be more wisely invested. Furthermore, as import bans raise local food prices they also dampen demand for more expensive food items such as meat, chicken and eggs. If food production is going to keep pace with a population of about 90-100m growing at more than 3 per cent a year, greater attention and resources must be given to the development of small-scale, low-cost private irrigation and tackling other problems including severe environmental degradation; inadequate use of fertiliser; low levels of investment; appropriate technological dissemination and better research and extension. The tremendous gains in food production over the past five years have laid a foundation for Nigeria's goal of food self-sufficiency. But it may be that absolute self sufficiency is not the most economic way to exploit the considerable energies of Nigeria's farmers.</p>

In a statement to MENA, al-Tarifi said today that the  Israeli  forces have arrested 1,000 Palestinians since the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque massacre in Hebron while announcing the release of 800  Palestinian detainees.    Al-Tarifi denounced the repressive Israeli measures, noting  that the Palestinian people have been living under a security  cordon imposed on them for 10 days now and that schools and  shops are closed as a result of the curfew imposed on the West  Bank and the Gaza Strip.    He said that the Palestinians could not perform Friday  prayers last week in al-Aqsa Mosque, where thousands usually  pray especially during the month of Ramadan, due to the  arbitrary Israeli closure of al-Aqsa Mosque to all worshipers  and visitors.    He added that a mood of despair and disappointment prevails  among the Palestinian people in the occupied territories and  even among the Palestinians of 1948 [Israeli Arabs].    He stressed that the resumption of the negotiations process  with Israel should take into account the new developments,  because the Israelis have always spoken about guarantees of  their own security but the recent massacre shows that it is the  Palestinian people who need protection.    He said that the Israeli settlers are the ones threatening  the peace process, not the Palestinian organizations.    Al-Tarifi, who resides in Jerusalem, came to Cairo to meet  with Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who earlier today  ended a one day visit to Cairo.</p>

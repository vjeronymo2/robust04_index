Let us hear Ben-Ya'ir's explanations:    [Begin Ben-Ya'ir recording] The government hereby declares  that the following groups are terrorist organizations:    1.

The Kahana Hay movement, whose key activists today are:  Binyamin Kahana, David Axelrod, and Yequti'el Ben-Ya'aqov.    This decree applies to the aforementioned terrorist  organizations, as well as to any group of people acting to  attain the same kind of goals which the aforementioned  organizations acted to attain and with means similar to those  used by the aforementioned organizations, even if they are  called by other names or monikers either on a permanent or a  temporary basis. This decree will also apply to splinter groups  or combinations of the aforementioned organizations. [end  recording] [passage omitted]    The cabinet decided to outlaw these movements after  examining  various pieces evidence. In view of the fact that this decision  curtails basic democratic liberties, such as the freedom of  association and freedom of movement, the attorney general  reiterated several times that the cabinet is in possession of  evidence with regard to the dangers posed by these movements.  [passage omitted]    The meaning of the decision is that anybody supporting these  terrorist organizations, either verbally or financially, will be  liable for imprisonment and that the property of these  organizations may be confiscated. The attorney general went on  to say that the police commissioner is entitled to order the  closing of places where activists of these organizations  assemble. The decision is based on Article 8 of the Antiterror  Act.    As said a few minutes ago, the cabinet has decided that the  Kakh and Kahana Hay movements are terrorist organizations  according to all the legal definitions of the nature of a  terrorist organization and are as of this moment declared  illegal.</p>

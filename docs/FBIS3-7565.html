			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Intensifying Friction Between Japan and the </F> United States Over Air Services"]    [Text] The Transport Ministry has notified the United  States it will cut the extension period of licenses for seven  air routes to Japan operated by U.S. airlines, which expired on  26 March, by extending them until 9 June instead of 31 October  as requested.    This is a countermeasure against a similar move taken by the  U.S. Department of Transportation. Last December, the U.S.  department cut the extension period of licenses for six air  routes operated by Japanese airlines from one year to 179 days,  extending them until 9 June. The six air routes, whose opening  was approved in a 1989 Japan-U.S. interim agreement, include a  Tokyo-Washington route operated by Japan Air Lines [JAL] and a  Tokyo-New York route by All Nippon Airways. A Transport  Ministry official said: "It is unlikely the United States will  revoke permission for Japanese airlines to extend their service  to the United States beyond 9 June, but based on the principle  of reciprocity, Japan has also set the expiration date at 9  June."    The U.S. Department of Transportation gave notice it would  "postpone" approval of a regular service between Sendai [in  Miyagi Prefecture] and Hawaii, which JAL had been planning to  inaugurate on 17 March. The notification was unusual in that it  was made on 15 March, just two days before the opening of the  service. The postponement did not mean the "rejection" of  approval. But, because JAL was not allowed to operate regular  flights on the route, it immediately asked the United States to  allow it to fly a charter flight to carry passengers who had  already booked seats on the scheduled flight.    A Transport Ministry official said: "The U.S. postponement  of approval apparently violates the 1989 accord." Nevertheless,  the two sides have begun attempts to reduce the other's rights  and interests in a feud over air services. A Miyagi Prefectural  Government official said: "We do not know why, but the U.S.  notification came so abruptly and it caused us much trouble."  After notification, the prefectural government canceled a visit  to Hawaii by the governor, which was planned to promote friendly  relations between Sendai and Honolulu. This is an unfavorable  development in light of exchanges between Japan and the United  States.    It is believed the United States has begun to take a  hardline  attitude as a strategy to assume the advantageous position in  negotiations with Japan on beyond rights (which allow U.S.  airlines to extend their routes beyond Japan to third  countries). The two nations have long confronted each other  over the interpretation of beyond rights. Japan asserts there  is a great imbalance between its rights and interests over air  services and the United States,' saying beyond rights, which  were approved in 1952, are unequal and that a 1959 agreement  established a framework in which the United States can freely  increase its transportation capacity.    On the other hand, the United States claims it can exercise  free and unlimited rights, including beyond rights, for flights  to Kansai International Airport in Osaka scheduled to open in  September. In this way, it has begun to apply pressure on Japan.    There is a great gap in assertions between the two  countries.  In aviation talks, Japan has been urged to make concessions  while it has failed to obtain compromises from the United  States. Even if it obtains concessions, Japan will not be able  to use them effectively because of Japanese airlines' low  management ability. This makes it difficult to resolve the  aviation dispute. Nevertheless, it is not desirable for Japan  and the United States to adopt tactics to reduce the other's  rights and interests. The two nations should treat rights and  interests over air services in such a way that they will be able  to engender beneficial effects on both sides.    Japan and the United States will be able to reach an  agreement on the number of air routes between the two countries,  a precondition in settling the aviation dispute, if they  consider passengers before anything else. Japanese airlines  need to enhance their competitiveness so people will choose  them. On the other hand, the United States should take  seriously the fact it has friction over aviation with not only  Japan, but also many other countries; and, France and Thailand  have scrapped their aviation agreements with the United States.</p>

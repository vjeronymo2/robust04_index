			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Irish Life buys AGF life assurance arm for Pounds 23.5m Irish Life, the UK subsidiary of the Dublin-based life assurance, pensions and investments group, has acquired City of Westminster Assurance, the life assurance business of AGF Holdings (UK), for Pounds 23.5m. The purchase, which includes City of Westminster Assurance Society, takes under its wing 40,000 policyholders who generated a premium income of Pounds 8.5m in 1992. Irish Life also announced it intends to apply early next year for a licence to operate from the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin. Once granted, an IFSC licence would bring a number of tax advantages and increase sales in the UK and overseas. In 1992 Irish Life had a 0.5 per cent share of the UK life assurance market, providing 15 per cent of its premiums. Mr Jean Pierre-Paumier, UK chief executive of AGF, said the French company was selling its life assurance business to strengthen its profitable non-life UK business, which provided 97 per cent of business.</p>

Two departments that used to train specialists to service  nuclear reactors on surface vessels and submarines have thus  been combined and transformed into a department for nuclear  power installations. The experienced instructors in it will  train specialists for the nuclear electric power plants of  Ukraine.    The refitting of the teaching laboratory, which has unique  simulators of the control panels of operational shipboard  nuclear power installations, will soon begin under the  supervision of department chief Captain 1st Rank Nikolay  Peregudov. Experienced specialists--representatives of the  Ministry of Nuclear Power of Ukraine--will be assisting in this  work.</p>

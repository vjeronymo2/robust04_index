			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / International Company News: Compaq Computer cuts PC prices by up to 22% Compaq Computer has lowered US prices on a broad range of personal computer products by up to 22 per cent in an attempt to gain market leadership. Competitors are expected to follow suit, sparking a new round of price cuts. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq chief executive, aims to overtake IBM and Apple Computer to make Compaq the world market leader in PCs by 1996. Compaq already sells more PCs in the US than its competitors. The price cuts come as the PC industry is entering its strongest buying season, from September to December. Intel, the leading microprocessor supplier to the PC industry, has aggressively reduced the prices of its highest performance chips over the past few months. Desktop PCs based on Intel's latest Pentium chips will be widely available in the US for about Dollars 2,000 this Christmas, Intel predicts. The market is growing as US consumers seek the latest multimedia PCs for home use. Defying predictions of a slowdown in the PC market, US shipments increased 23 per cent in the second quarter, according to Dataquest, a market research firm. 'Many industry insiders expected a slowdown in the second quarter, but shipments continued to increase despite the fact that price cuts are looming,' said Mr Philippe de Marcillac, principal analyst of Dataquest's PC research group. Compaq Computer outstripped all competitors in the US market in the first half of the year, according to Dataquest. The company sold more than 1m PCs for a 13.4 per cent market share. Apple Computer took 10.8 per cent of the market, and Packard Bell 9.9 per cent. IBM slipped to fourth place with 7.9 per cent of the US market, measured in units sold. With Compaq lowering its prices, it would be increasingly difficult for IBM to catch up, analysts said. However, IBM is overhauling its PC operations to become more competitive. Apple Computer's new Power Macintosh products were selling more slowly than expected, the Dataquest analysts said, but strong sales of the company's laptop computers lifted unit shipments in the first half.</p>

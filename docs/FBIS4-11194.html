			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 24 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- The Salvadoran  presidential elections ended at 1700 local (2300 GMT) today, the  Supreme Electoral Tribunal [TSE] reported.    The elections, which began at 0700 (1300 GMT), were  characterized by voter apathy and low turnout, the extent of  which has not yet been estimated.    The TSE called upon all 2.7 million citizens eligible to  vote  to do so and installed 381 voting centers in 262 municipalities  throughout the entire country.    Once the polling stations closed, the TSE immediately began  receiving the vote count certificates at the official vote  counting center located in a luxury hotel in San Salvador.    The TSE authorities announced this afternoon that the first  preliminary report will be announced after 30 percent of the  votes cast are counted.</p>

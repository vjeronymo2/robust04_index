			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Credit Suisse profits surge 57% despite downgrading CREDIT SUISSE, still smarting from the loss of Moody's triple A rating in January, has reported a 57 per cent surge in 1991 net income to SFr848m (Dollars 556m), raised its dividend and forecast higher profits in the current year. Mr Robert Jeker, chief executive of Switzerland's third largest bank, said the 'very satisfactory operational performance' re-established the long-term earnings trend and showed that 1990's profit slump was an exception. 'We foresee a further increase in profits this year,' Mr Jeker said. However, he warned that the very high level of provisions for bad debts in 1991 - SFr1.1bn, 61 per cent above the previous year's figure  - was likely to persist this year because of weak economic conditions in Switzerland and elsewhere. Mr Jeker insisted that the downgrading of Credit Suisse's long-term debt by Moody's was having no influence on the group's business. 'All analysts know that our bank is solid and one of the best in the world,' he claimed. Last year, group total assets rose 4 per cent to SFr155.6bn and shareholders' equity rose 2.5 per cent to SFr8.4bn before the planned allocation to reserves of SFr240m from 1991 earnings. Mr Jeker said the group's capital adequacy provisions were SFr2bn in excess of the Swiss legal requirement. Capital problems centre on CS Holding, the company set up in 1989 to hold Credit Suisse and most of its financial and industrial affiliates. The Swiss Supreme Court has ruled that CS Holding must meet bank capital requirements for all its subsidiaries. CS Holding plans to spin off up to 20 per cent of the shares of Credit Suisse to help raise its capital reserves. The restoration of the Credit Suisse dividend, to SFr23 per share after last year's reduction to SFr20 per share, will also help. Net interest income of the Credit Suisse group rose 14 per cent to SFr2bn and commission income jumped 21 per cent to SFr1.5bn as investment fund operations were buoyant. Trading income soared from SFr213m to SFr1.3bn, nearly a third of it coming from interest rate instruments, mainly via the London subsidiary, Credit Suisse Financial Products. Mr Jeker said Credit Suisse's international operations contributed 34 per cent of last year's gross profit compared with only 18 per cent in 1989. 'Even if we cannot extrapolate from this trend, it is nonetheless a strong indicator that business is thriving in deregulated financial centres in countries where market and operating conditions are optimal,' he said.  --------------------------------------------------       SWISS BANK RESULTS 1991 (SFr million)                   (consolidated)  --------------------------------------------------                   UBS     SBC     Credit Suisse Net profit       1,216   1,032         848 Total assets   249,291 206,800     149,676 Loss provisions  1,329   1,454       1,136  --------------------------------------------------</p>

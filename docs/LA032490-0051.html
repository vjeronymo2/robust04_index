			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> EXXON TO HIRE 600 TO BUILD OIL FACILITIES  </P> <P> Exxon Co. USA will hire 600 workers, many from Ventura County, to build new  onshore and offshore oil-processing facilities in Santa Barbara, the company  announced Friday from its Thousand Oaks production office.  </P> <P> The Ventura County Contractors Assn. applauded the announcement as a  much-needed boost to the county building industry, which says that there have  been fewer local projects because of growth controls in cities throughout the  county.  </P> <P> "That will have a very positive effect on our industry," said Steve Blois, a  Ventura contractor who is association president.  </P> <P> The distance from Ventura to Santa Barbara is no deterrent for construction  employees, he said.  </P> <P> "Work's work. They'll drive," Blois said.  </P> <P> Construction on the project, now in its second phase of development, is  expected to begin this fall.  </P> <P> Exxon signed a subcontract agreement Friday with Ebasco Constructors of Santa  Ana, which agreed to hire most workers from Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis  Obispo counties. Because Ventura has far more construction workers than the  other two counties, the force will come predominantly from Ventura, Exxon  spokesman Brian Dunphy said.  </P> <P> Exxon has already completed one phase of construction on the project, which  includes two new offshore platforms and a gasoline- and oil-processing plant  onshore. The onshore facilities, where the 600 will be employed, will be about  20 miles west of Santa Barbara in Las Flores Canyon, between Refugio State  Beach and El Capitan Ranch Park.  </P> <P> The two platforms, named Harmony and Heritage, will be farther north and  farther out to sea than Hondo, Exxon's only operating platform in the Santa  Barbara Channel. Their metal frames are in the water now, and their upper level  decks will be constructed in Texas and shipped next year.  </P> <P> Dunphy said the two platforms and the processing plant should be operational by  1993.  </P> <P> However, before the first oil is pumped, the project will be subject to  scrutiny by Santa Barbara County officials, who will ensure its compliance with  county permit restrictions.

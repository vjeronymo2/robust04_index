			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Finns learn to live with sacrifices: Economy faces painful truths COMPILE a list of the ailments inflicting west European economies right now, and it will soon be apparent that few countries are in a worse condition than Finland. 'We have lost our eastern market, our western market and our domestic market,' says Mr Tarmo Valkonen, the head of forecasting at the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy. Record unemployment, massive foreign debt, international recession, huge banking losses, and the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union are the key symptoms and causes of a crisis which has seen GDP shrink by 10 per cent over the last two years - more than it did in the depression of the 1930s. As if things were not bad enough, the Finns have had more bad news in recent days. Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading commercial bank, has predicted negative 1993 GDP growth of 0.5 per cent, reversing last autumn's forecast of 1.5 per cent growth. The Ministry of Finance has also just scaled down its previous forecast of 2 per cent growth to zero, partly because of continuing recession in many key export markets. 'We are in an acute crisis, the worst crisis in decades. And the recession elsewhere in Europe is making matters worse,' said Mr Sixten Korkman, director-general of the Ministry of Finance. Finland is paying the price for its over-dependence on a single export market - the former Soviet Union - and over-reliance on one particular sector - forestry. However, it is also undergoing a painful period of readjustment after the boom years during the 1980s when the property and share markets became grossly over-heated. A total of 18.6 per cent of the workforce is now out of work and many economists predict the figure will exceed 20 per cent before it starts to fall. The worst hit sectors have been construction, manufacturing and retail. Falling tax revenues and high unemployment pay-outs have sent debt soaring. Foreign debt will rise to FM250bn (Dollars 42bn) this year, while net interest payments on it will reach FM27bn. For 1993 alone the state's net borrowing requirement is estimated at almost FM80bn, pushing up state debt at the year end to nearly 50 per cent of GNP compared to just 16.5 per cent at the end of 1991. The fear of further aggravating the debt burden means the centre-right coalition government has so far ruled out any package to stimulate the economy. 'There is nothing to hand out, just sacrifices,' said Mr Iiro Viinanen, the finance minister. Confirming this, the government this week announced a new FM9.3bn savings package for 1994 to ensure state spending does not exceed target. The government is pinning all its hopes on export-led recovery, and on that score at least, there is cause for optimism. The 30 per cent drop in the value of the markka that has resulted from two devaluations over the last 16 months has led to a dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of Finnish industry. Last year exports grew by 9 per cent, and this year they are predicted to rise by 11 per cent. But even here, there is reason for caution, with demand weakened in the country's main export markets, such as Germany, Sweden and the UK. The government, led by prime minister Mr Esko Aho, appears to be under no immediate threat, partly because there is no concensus about alternative courses of action. Nevertheless, business leaders have recently become uncharacteristically outspoken in their criticisms. Mr Pertti Voutilainen, the head of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki implied a lack of decisive political leadership when he said recently that he did not know the prime minister's opinions on the European Community, nuclear power policy, or the country's banking difficulties. The government was able to get FM20bn in additional support for the banking sector several weeks ago but not before parliament rejected a broader package which would have done more to instill confidence in the country's financial system. The turnround in the Finnish economy should finally become apparent next year, when 2-3 per cent growth is predicted. Apart from the stimulus of higher exports, the country is now in a lower interest rate phase which is expected to lead to higher investment. One surprising thing is that the pain has been endured with little outcry. Some put that down to the national temperament. 'Everybody is slightly ashamed,' says Mr Olli Kivinen, political columnist on Helsingin Sanomat, the leading Finnish newspaper, 'They took part in the casino economy of the 1980s and now they are willing to suffer for it.'</p>

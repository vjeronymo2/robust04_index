Al-Zahhar: If this police force is here to serve  the community, we will receive it willingly, but if it becomes  the hands of Israel to establish a tyrannical regime in this  area, I believe that they will do what Israel wishes. The  people will endure no more tyrannies. They have resisted the  occupation since 1967 and paid a high price -- thousands of  years of imprisonment, thousands of martyrs. We seek the  elimination of any kind of occupation. [passage omitted]    Cymerman: Will Hamas take part in the general  elections for the autonomous entity?    Al-Zahhar: [passage omitted] Hamas will not take  part in the elections and will not assume the role of opposition  in the Palestinian autonomous entity. Hamas will continue to  resist the Israelis' presence by all means.</p>

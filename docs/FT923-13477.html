			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of Bahrain (5): Cheap power sets the pace - Aluminium Industry THE aluminium industry in the Gulf is fast coming to rival the trendy status of the cement industry in the region - a development which, apparently, no self-respecting state can be content without. Bahrain set the pace by establishing its Alba aluminium smelter in the early 1970s. Dubai followed with its own smelter a few years later. Iran began work on one this year, and the Saudis are still investigating whether they can build an aluminium plant with the help of one of their offset investment programmes. Even Qatar is said to be thinking of joining the fray. The compelling logic behind these moves is cheap power, derived particularly from the region's huge supplies of gas. 'Our energy costs are not quite as low as those from, say, a Canadian hydroelectric plant  - but they are not much more expensive,' says Mr Gudvin Tofte, chief executive of Alba. Moreover, although Bahrain has only about 10 years' worth of oil reserves left, gas supplies are expected to last another half century. The rash of Gulf smelters also reflects the fact that environmental opposition to setting up big aluminium plants is far less of an impediment in the industry-hungry Gulf than in Europe or North America. For such reasons, Mr Tofte sees no reason for Bahrain's smelter to fear its new local competitors - 'it won't matter,' he says. 'Particularly with the shutdown of aluminium capacity in Europe.' Where other regional smelters could pose some threat, though, is to Bahrain's downstream aluminium sector; the government has high hopes that this will suck in foreign investment and offer just the sort of labour-intensive growth the island needs to hire job-seeking Bahrainis, who now make up about 85 per cent of the up and downstream industry's workforce. The more Gulf countries which can offer potential investors the advantage of a smelter on their doorstep, the more thinly spread any downstream investment will be in Bahrain. But the island has had some early post-Gulf war successes. Reynolds, the US metals group, has committed itself to a Dollars 40m (or so) joint venture with local investors to build an aluminium foil plant, and Alcoa, the US aluminium giant, is also planning a smaller aluminium bottle closure plant on the island, also with local investors. Local downstream industries are also seeking to expand - to head off regional rivals, and to absorb the new supplies of metal coming from Alba's expansion programme. 'It's a question of survival,' says Mr Mahmoud al-Soufi, general manager of the Bahrain Aluminium Extrusion Company, one of the island's four main first-tier downstream operations. 'To be competitive we have to expand, be more efficient and start recycling metal.' By October, a month ahead of schedule, Alba expects to have completed its Dollars 1.5bn plan to raise production capacity to 460,000 tonnes a year. The smelter, which is 77 per cent owned by the Bahrain government, 20 per cent by Saudi Arabia and 3 per cent by Breton Investments, a German company, will then be considerably the Gulf's largest, and the third biggest single-site smelter in the world. Dubal, Dubai's smelter, also completing an expansion, now produces 240,000t a year. The Iranian smelter (being designed and built with help from Dubai) is expected to come on stream in 1994 with output of 220,000 tonnes later rising to 350,000 tonnes. ABOUT half of Alba's present output of 250,000 tonnes a year is absorbed locally; once the expansion is complete industries in the area are expected to purchase about 150,000t tonnes of ingots. The remainder will earn Bahrain in the region of Dollars 600m a year in export sales at present prices. Most of the domestically-consumed metal will go to Bahrain's four main downstream operations: the 51 per cent government-owned Bahrain Aluminium Atomiser Company; the private Midal Cable company; the state-controlled Balexco and the Gulf Aluminium Rolling Company (Garmco), owned jointly by Bahrain and a string of other Gulf governmental shareholders. Each, now, is either considering or finalising expansion plans. Perhaps the most ambitious of these will be at Balexco; late last month it concluded agreement with Finleader, the Italian group, to build a new extrusion and recycling plant in an investment worth about Dollars 35m. The joint venture company, in which Finleader will have a 49 per cent interest, will be called Gulf Aluminium Industries Company. It will nearly treble Balexco's original design capacity to about 18,000 tonnes a year. Balexco, which was established in the 1970s to provide building materials for the Gulf's then booming construction sector, has seen this market dwindle with the recession of the mid-1980s; it has only begun to recover in the last year or so. Its Finleader joint venture is designed to enable Balexco to start manufacturing large transportation and structural extrusions, using the Italian company's marketing arm to attack the European market. Balexco is also well ahead with plans to join Samsun, the South Korean group, in a joint venture to produce aluminium wheels, possibly with two local private investors. The wheels would be largely for export to the US and Europe, in a five-year investment plan likely to cost about Dollars 24m. Balexco is also going ahead with projects to make small, high added-value aluminium accessories such as door knobs, and to upgrade its 15-year-old original plant. The company turned in a Dollars 2m profit in 1991, on turnover of Dollars 33m. Down the road from Balexco, at Bahrain's Sitra industrial area, Garmco is also looking to raise output from its rolling mill to 110,000 tonnes a year by 1995, from the present 65,000 tonnes, in a Dollars 75m investment provided largely by its main shareholders, the Bahrain, Saudi and Kuwaiti governments. Qatar, Oman, the Gulf Investment Corporation (a GCC-owned investment vehicle) and Iraq also have holdings in the venture. Garmco's intention is to shift focus - from selling mainly construction products into the competitive furnace of the US and European markets - into developing higher added value can-stock and lithographic plates to the Middle and Far Eastern markets. After expansion, Garmco expects to be producing 30,000 tonnes of can-ends and tabs and up to 10,000 tonnes of lithographic plates. It also hopes to raise profitability, from levels about which - given its private, sovereign shareholders - it is now silent, by boosting output with a minimal increase of 60-70 workers.</p>

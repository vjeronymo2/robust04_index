Sinev; </F> UDC 546.799.3]    [Abstract] Quantitative data on the rates of  oxidation-reduction reactions of U, Np, and Pu in organic  solutions of tributyl phosphate (TBF) are needed for mathematic  modeling of redox processes in the extraction technology of  spent nuclear fuel, as well as having independent scientific  interest. Tetravalent uranium as a reducing agent for Pu and Np  ions is used widely and has many advantages, one being the  possibility of conducting the reaction in both aqueous and  organic phases, but at the same time the capability of U(VI) of  being extracted with TBF is a main cause of the non-productive  consumption of U(IV) owing to its oxidation with nitric acid in  the TBF phase. Various attempts have been made to study the  kinetics of U(IV) oxidation with nitric acid in TBF, and it has  been established that this reaction is autocatalytic. After an  induction period the reaction becomes first order and its rate  is little affected by the concentration of nitric acid in TBF.  In the present work a differential equation was developed for  this reaction. Activation energy for the first stage was  determined to be 65.3 kJ/mole. The reaction mechanism includes  parallel flowing slow stages of interaction of UOH[.sup]+3[/]  ions with HNO[.sub]2[/] molecules and U[.sup]+4[/] ions  with nitronium perchlorate.

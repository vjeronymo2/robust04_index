			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 21, IRNA -- The students and staff of  the Qom Theological Centre felicitated the leader of the Islamic  revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali Khamene'i here Saturday [21  May] on the occasion of 'Id-ul-Adha and deplored the unislamic  attitude of Saudi rulers.    "Although Muslims feel bitter about the Saudi regime's  banning of the disavowal of polytheists rally, as was evident in  your valuable remarks, it is a matter of regret that a  government which styles itself as servant of holy shrines  obstructs such rally at the centre of monotheism and  revelation," read the message.    It hoped the Saudi regime would realize its folly of  following the dictates of Zionism and arrogant powers,  especially the criminal U.S., and next year would allow pilgrims  to stage the disavowal of polytheists rally which is a basic  part of the "Abrahmic Hajj".</p>

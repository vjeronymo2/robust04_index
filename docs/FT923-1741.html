			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Salvesen sells oil offshoot for Pounds 28.5m CHRISTIAN SALVESEN, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire group, has sold its oilfield technology subsidiary for Pounds 28.5m to BJ Services Company, of Houston, Texas. The Aberdeen-based Salvesen (Oilfield Technology) had a net book value of Pounds 15.8m and made operating profits of Pounds 3.3m in the year to March 31, which the group described as a difficult period in the North Sea oil business. Mr Chris Masters, Christian Salvesen's chief executive, said: 'The sale is in line with our strategy of focusing on a limited number of activities where we have a demonstrable and maintainable competitive edge.' The proceeds will be used to reduce gearing, which stood at 35 per cent in March. The consideration is being satisfied by a Pounds 15m 90-day loan note and the balance in cash. The disposal comes at a time when companies in the offshore supply business face increasing competition for work as oil companies cut costs.</p>

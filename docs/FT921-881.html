			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Housing figures give Dow only brief boost Wall Street FURTHER signs of recovery in the housing market helped provide a boost to US stock markets early yesterday, but a rush of late sellers left leading indices slightly lower at the end of trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 1.57 off at 3,259.39 after waves of selling in the final half-hour had wiped 14 points off the index. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, moving in similar fashion, lost 1.36 at 407.52, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks ended just 0.80 up at 619.48. New York SE turnover came to 192.6m shares. Although prices opened weaker, the market judged the morning's economic data as a positive influence on sentiment and by late morning the leading indices had moved into the black. The clear good news was the 9.3 per cent rise in February existing home sales. The 0.1 per cent decline in February durable goods orders was disappointing, although a closer examination showed that non-defence orders rose for the third successive month, which some analysts said was evidence of a revival in the industrial sector. Airlines remained under pressure after Tuesday's heavy profit-taking. Delta was hardest hit, with trading delayed due to an order imbalance on the sell side as the second analyst in two days lowered his earnings estimate on concern about falling passenger-mile yields. When business resumed, Delta fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 3/4 . Federated Department Stores, the retailing group which emerged from bankruptcy last month, moved forward Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 15 3/8 after County NatWest upgraded its rating from a 'hold' to an 'accumulate'. On Tuesday, Federated said it would soon launch its computerised inventory system to improve co-ordination between suppliers and vendors. Commodore International jumped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 14 3/8 after the company was cleared of any tax liability under a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service on all major issues relating to Commodore's tax litigation between 1981 and 1986. On the Nasdaq, Microsoft rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 128 1/2 in the wake of its acquisition of Fox Software. American Mobile Systems dropped Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 4 5/8 after its president was said to have been suspended and an investigation opened into the unauthorised transfer of Dollars 4.1m out of company accounts. Canada BANK AND real estate issues rebounded as the Toronto market began shaking off nervousness over Olympia &amp; York's financial difficulties, and gold shares rallied from recent weakness. The composite index picked up 14.5 to 3,452.3 and rises led falls by 318 to 244 after volume of 35.1m shares.</p>

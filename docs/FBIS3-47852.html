			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Negotiations on North Korean Nuclear Issue and </F> Counterattack by U.S. Conservatives"]    [Text] Former cabinet members of U.S. Republican  administrations leveled acute criticism at the Clinton  administration's negotiations with North Korea. Research  organizations of the U.S. conservative camp and some major  newspapers presented issues concerning the Clinton  administration's attitude in negotiations with North Korea. This  is indeed a noteworthy phenomenon.    Expressing doubt also on North Korea's attitude, former  cabinet members of the U.S. Republican administrations showed,  in particular, a sensitive response to the issue of suspending  the Team Spirit exercise. They stressed strong defense of the  ROK from the threat of a southward invasion by North Korea and  maintained that the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command exercise is  an indispensable course for defense. They are worried even more  about North Korea's conventional military power. This being the  case, they advise that the ROK-U.S. joint military exercise  should be maintained and the ROK's defense capabilities should  be strengthened to defend the ROK from any attack -- nuclear or  conventional.    Should one assess their opinions as merely the "Hawks'"  theory? The seriousness of the problem, however, is that judging  from the current trend of the U.S. press, their logic is not  regarded merely as the opposition harping on the Clinton  administration's foreign policy. Emphatically pointing out the  strengthened conventional military power in the Asian-Pacific  region, Japan's suggestion to reconsider its own nonnuclear  policy, and China's weapons exports, they went so far as to  recommend implementation of a security-first policy in the  Asian-Pacific area, instead of a foreign policy of attaching  importance to economics, which may only touch off trade disputes.    If we accept their allegation even in part, we would come to  realize the seriousness of the security situation in the  Asian-Pacific area. Thus, they pointed out that significant  political and economic relations should be open to North Korea  only when it takes concrete steps to reduce its threat to the  Korean peninsula and the surrounding areas. They even proposed a  plan to promote trade relations between the United States and  China with a view to encouraging China to participate actively  in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and in removing  North Korea's military threat.    It is indeed alarming that the U.S. conservative camp,  including former cabinet members of U.S. Republican  administrations, began to launch a counterattack as the third  round of North Korean-U.S. talks are about to take place. This  is even more true in view of the differences in views revealed  among intelligence organizations within the Clinton  administration, including the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency,  the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. State Department.  The U.S. intelligence organizations assess that North Korea has  already manufactured one or two nuclear bombs, even though of  crude condition, or the date of manufacture is imminent. The  U.S. Department of State, however, disputes this assertion.    As the situation is in disorder in the United States, which  is carrying on nuclear negotiations with North Korea, it is  quite natural for our government, which is maintaining a joint  cooperation system with the Department of State, to be cautious.  What if North Korea, while dragging out nuclear negotiations,  nearly completes the manufacture of nuclear weapons and then  initiates the work of hiding them in deep underground tunnels?  How should we cope with a threat of attack by conventional  weapons after suspending the Team Spirit exercise?    The more serious problem is that even after the exchange of  special envoys is realized, the envoy [from the North] may  possibly propose the Koryo confederal system. In this event, is  it desirable that we declare the suspension of the Team Spirit  exercise to him as a partner? Indeed, this is a difficult  problem. We have no other words than our hope that the North and  the South make appropriate judgments regarding the situation.</p>

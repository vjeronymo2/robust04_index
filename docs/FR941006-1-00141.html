			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Proposed Packaging Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA is proposing to amend its regulations to establish safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions of use for iron-containing products by requiring that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all such products that contain 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be packaged in nonreusable, unit-dose packaging. FDA tentatively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concludes that the use of iron and iron salts in products at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potencies at or above 30 mg iron per dosage unit is not safe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (and, therefore, is not GRAS) unless the food to which it is added,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or the drug which contains it, is packaged in a manner that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate to prevent unintended ingestion by children. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while iron and several of its salts will continue to be listed as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GRAS under 21 CFR part 182 for use as dietary supplements and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under part 184 (21 CFR part 184) for use as nutrient supplements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to add &sect;170.55, which will require unit-dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> packaging when iron or iron salts are used at a level of 30 mg or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more per dosage unit in dietary supplements. Section 170.55 will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also apply to approved food additive uses of iron salts in foods  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for special dietary and nutritional uses. Unit-dose packaging of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drug products that contain 30 mg or more of iron per dosage unit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required under proposed &sect;310.518(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rationale for requiring unit-dose packaging for iron-containing products with 30 mg or more iron per dosage unit.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is proposing to require unit-dose packaging for iron-containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs and supplements with 30 mg or more iron per dosage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit to ensure that the use of these products is safe. FDA's tentative conclusion to use 30 mg per unit-dose as the threshold  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for requiring unit-dose packaging is based on its consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a number factors including: (1) The amount of ingested iron  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that can cause pediatric fatality; (2) the amount of ingested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron that can cause significant iron poisoning; (3) the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of dosage units associated with pediatric fatalities; (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the types and potency of iron-containing products associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric iron poisoning fatalities; (5) information on how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iron products are sold; and (6) the citizen petitions that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted to FDA. These factors pointed to the use of 30 mg per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit-dose as a threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the toxicity of any iron ingestion is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to the total amount of iron ingested and absorbed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (section I.B. of this document). Ingestion of 250 mg iron per kg  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of body weight (2.5 g total iron for a 10 kg child) is typically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be a lethal dose of iron. However, there have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports of fatalities from ingestion of lesser amounts (less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.5 g) of iron, and the available data bear this out. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, Table 5 shows that several pediatric fatalities have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been associated with ingestion of approximately 1 g of iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the amount of iron that can cause serious adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects is given as 60 mg/kg (section I.B. of this document).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a 10 kg child this translates to 600 mg of iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA recognizes that there is variability among individuals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with respect to the lethal dose of iron. Because of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability, and because of the variable size and age of children  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at risk, FDA tentatively concludes that, to protect the wide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range of susceptible children, it is necessary through packaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures (unit-dose packaging) to limit pediatric access to iron-containing drugs and dietary supplements at potencies that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably expected to provide 1 g of iron. Restricting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric access to this amount of iron by packaging measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will substantially reduce the potential for a fatal or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant iron poisoning outcome should an accidental pediatric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingestion of iron-containing products occur. As discussed above,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of the time and effort needed to access products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in unit-door packaging, the likelihood that young  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> children will be able to ingest a lethal amount of iron will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly reduced, thereby reducing the likelihood that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be seriously injured or die.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the 37 case reports of iron poisoning fatalities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available, the average number of dosage units ingested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pediatric victim was 39 tablets or capsules, with a range of 5 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 98 (Table 2). FDA notes that ingestion of 39 tablets or capsules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at potencies of 25 to 30 mg iron per dosage unit is sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a potentially lethal dose of iron (i.e., approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,000 mg) to a young child.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Hualon Project: Grounds for delay - OCTOBER 1990 The Irish Republic announces a deal with Hualon to set up a IPounds 45m textile plant at Gillogue in Limerick. MARCH 1991 After visiting Taiwan, Mr Des O'Malley, the Republic's industry and commerce minister, cancels the project, following allegations of stock fraud by two of the three brothers who run Hualon. APRIL 1991 Oung Ta-ming, who heads the Hualon group, and Oung You-ming, chairman of its textiles division, are charged with breach of trust in a stock scandal that brings down a Taiwanese cabinet minister. SEPTEMBER 1991 Oung Ta-ming and Oung Yi-ming, chairman of another Hualon division, are charged in Taiwan over irregular land deals. 1992 Talks open between Hualon and Northern Ireland, and re-open between Hualon and the Republic, on the possibilities for an aided textile plant. OCTOBER 1992 Oung Ta-ming convicted on stock scandal charges, which are upheld on appeal to the high court. He appeals against a 2 1/2 -year sentence to the supreme court. Oung You-ming had already jumped bail to Malaysia. Oung Yi-ming's conviction on land deal charges is quashed. 1993 The Republic again backs away from the Limerick project, this time because it believes it is not economically viable. The British government agrees to back a proposal by Hualon for a Pounds 157m textile plant near Belfast with Pounds 61m aid. JULY 1993 The European Commission announces an investigation into the legality of the aid package. MAY 1994 The commission clears the aid, in spite of expert objections that a market does not exist for Hualon's products and that it would not increase net employment. JUNE 1994 Contract due to be signed.</p>

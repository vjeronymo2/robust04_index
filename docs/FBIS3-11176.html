"The program cannot be  fictitious; that is why it must be rational, feasible, and  practical so that it can be implemented after the elections."    Lula expressed his feelings on 16 March after lunching with  Maceio Mayor Ronaldo Lessa (PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]),  who is one of the possible vice presidential candidates for his  ticket. He clearly stated that he does not agree to the  inclusion of those topics in the program: "I do not know  whether this has to do with a government program -- it could  deal with legislative policy or the Constitution -- but I  believed it to be democratic to include them in the program that  is to be discussed."    The candidate also stated that he will not accept party  impositions in this respect. "Not even Lula can impose a  program on society, nor can the PT impose a program on Lula," he  stressed. "The program has to contain what the government plans  to do."</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / UN aid flights to Sarajevo resume United Nations aid flights to Sarajevo got into full swing yesterday for the first time in nearly three weeks, despite Saturday's sniper attack on trams in the city centre in which one civilian died and 11 were injured. The resumption of the air bridge marked a success for the UN's mediation efforts, after several days in which it has been accused of bias and ineffectiveness by both Bosnian government and Bosnian Serb officials. UN officials said about 20 aircraft flew to Sarajevo yesterday, bringing desperately needed supplies to a city where food stocks were threatening to run out in less than a week. The UN's humanitarian operation, vital to sustain the city's 300,000 inhabitants, was disrupted after the Serbs, angered by an air attack last month, started firing on flights. General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander, sought to mend relations with Bosnia's Moslem leadership by denying, in a newspaper interview, that he would ever ask for air strikes against the government side. stressed that the Bosnian government was the legitimate leadership of a UN member country which had been the victim of aggression. He also indicated that last week's killing of 16 Bosnian Serb soldiers and four nurses by government troops was now viewed as an ordinary military action and not an atrocity, as the UN had initially alleged.</p>

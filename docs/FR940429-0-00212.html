			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has found that an excepted family contribution of zero is an appropriate standard for showing that an institution serves students with a disadvantaged economic background. Therefore, no change will be made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that institutions which ask guaranty agencies to verify data should be required to list the guaranty date and type of loan as well as the information required by &sect;668.17(d)(7). Another commenter suggested that the institution should request the information from the Secretary rather than from the guaranty agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that the guaranty agency will be able to identify the loans in question with the name and social security of the borrowers involved and that it is unnecessary to provide the guaranty date and loan type. The Secretary notes that only Federal Stafford and Federal SLS loans are currently included in the calculation of the cohort default rate. The Secretary also believes that it is appropriate for requests for confirmation of errors to be sent to the guaranty agency rather than the Secretary. The guaranty agencies have the data which the institution is challenging. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter argued that the Secretary should have a time deadline for issuing decisions on appeals of cohort default rates filed by institutions and that the institution should win the appeal if the decision is not issued on time. Another commenter suggested that the institution should not be subject to a sanction if a new reduced cohort default rate is issued for the institution during the appeal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary is committed to issuing decisions on appeals from institutions within a reasonable time. Many of the changes made to these regulations will contribute to this effort. However, the Secretary does not believe that it is appropriate to allow an institution to avoid responsibility for its default rate because a decision is not issued within a specified time. The Secretary also does not believe that an institution should automatically be able to escape responsibility for its high default rate one year by delaying the completion of its appeal until the next year's lower rate is released. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked the Secretary to allow institutions to submit cohort default rate appeals by facsimile rather than by mail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary has found that cohort default rate appeals frequently involve numerous documents involving detailed listings of information. Facsimile transmission may well result in blurred documents. In these circumstances, the Secretary will continue to require appeals to be submitted by mail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions. Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters noted that the Secretary proposed to eliminate the provision of the regulations that required that, in calculating the cohort default rates, the Secretary would exclude any loans which, due to improper servicing or collection would result in an inaccurate calculation of the cohort default rate. The commenters objected to this change on the grounds that they believe that this change is contrary to Congressional intent in enacting the new law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary believes that it is clear that Congress intended to limit the issue of allegations of improper loan servicing in regard to cohort default rates to appeals from the calculation of such rates. The Secretary notes that the Technical Amendments of 1993 changed the language of sections 435(a) and 435(m)(1)(B) of the HEA to limit consideration of improper loan servicing allegations to appeals. Prior to the amendments, the HEA stated that improper servicing would be considered in calculating the cohort default rate. The Technical Amendments of 1993 eliminated this language and added a new subsection 435(a)(3) to specifically allow certain schools with high default rates to appeal those rates based on allegations of improper loan servicing. There is no support for the commenters claim that Congress intended the Secretary to consider allegations of improper loan servicing before rates are calculated and during the appeal process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters urged the Secretary to require guaranty agencies to allow institutions to review the default rate data prior to submittal of the data to the Secretary and to work with the institutions to ensure correction of the data before the Secretary publishes the list of institutional cohort default rates. Some commenters argued that publication of rates without such a process violated due process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary notes that a recent decision of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Career College Association  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. Department of Education,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> C.A. No. 92&hyph;1345&hyph;LFO (March 22, 1994) rejected the claim that pre-publication review of cohort default rate information was required. However, the Technical Amendments of 1993 amended the HEA to provide institutions an opportunity to review and correct errors in the information provided by the guaranty agency to the Secretary for calculating cohort default rates. This amendment is not effective until October 1, 1994 and the Department intends to issue regulations to provide this opportunity shortly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters argued that a whole new structure for cohort default rates should be developed. According to these commenters, there are significant errors in the cohort default rate information and the courts have found that the Secretary's calculation of such rates is improper. Some commenters said that the Secretary should make every effort to ensure that default rate information is accurate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

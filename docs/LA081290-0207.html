			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAYDAY CALLS SURROUND RADIO TOWERS;  </P> <P> ZONING: THE LANDOWNERS ARE APPEALING ORANGE COUNTY'S APPROVAL OF THREE  306-FOOT-HIGH TRANSMITTERS ON A FORESTED MOUNTAINTOP.  </P> <P> Larry Booth, a burly man given to blunt talk and dress cowboy boots, used to  get fiery-eyed when he talked about his fight with county planners.  </P> <P> These days he has trouble holding back the tears when he describes the dream  home he and his late wife planned to build high in the tranquil Santa Ana  Mountains off Black Star Canyon Road near the Riverside County border.  </P> <P> Booth, 46, a city of Anaheim employee, and his wife Mea, who was 38 when she  died of a heart attack three weeks ago, tied up most of their savings in the  land they bought in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Four months later, unknown to them and neighboring landowners, the county's  zoning administrator approved plans for the construction of three 306-foot  commercial radio towers 500 feet from where Booth planned to build his house.  Then this spring, the Planning Commission OKd a 5,000-gallon underground fuel  tank and an electric generator for the site.  </P> <P> The permit allows the transmitters, which will broadcast a new Spanish-language  AM radio station, KSRT, to remain in position for at least eight years. Station  owners say their Federal Communications Commission license for the last  available radio frequency in Southern California is contingent upon finding a  suitable antenna site, and the only one they can find is near Booth's property.  </P> <P> But Booth, several other landowners and a contingent of environmentalists  dispute that claim and charge that the decision to grant the permit was made in  a climate of political favoritism. On Wednesday, they will appeal the permit to  the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "I'm continuing on with this because she wouldn't want me to quit," Booth said,  referring to his late wife. "I lost my best friend, (but) I still love the  area. The land is important to me. . . . All you hear now is the wind and the  birds up there."  </P> <P> Also expressing concerns about the tower will be a representative from  Cleveland National Forest. Suzanne Olson, a spokeswoman for the Trabuco Ranger  District, said forestry officials have no jurisdiction over county land but are  worried about the tower's potential impact -- both visual and environmental --  on surrounding federal property.  </P> <P> Carl Corey, who oversaw land-use in Cleveland National Forest until he retired  this year, is blunter. "We would not allow that sort of thing to happen on  national forest land," Corey said, adding that the federal parkland is one of  Southern California's most pristine natural areas.  </P> <P> "Having a tower that's over 300 feet with flashing lights and that is painted  garish colors is definitely not natural," he said.  </P> <P> County planning officials say that they sympathize with Booth but that he is a  victim of circumstances and the county zoning ordinances that govern their  decisions.  </P> <P> Booth was not notified of the hearing in September, 1988, at which the Orange  County Broadcasting Co. was first granted a permit for the towers. County  planners say that although he bought his property four months earlier, Booth's  name had not shown up on official tax rolls upon which the county relies for  making notifications.  </P> <P> County officials say they tried to contact other landowners in the area, but  the notices, they concede, might have been sent to outdated addresses. With no  one objecting to the towers during several public hearings, Zoning  Administrator Robert White said he had no basis to deny the permit.  </P> <P> White also notes that a majority of the Planning Commission reviewed and  concurred with his decision when they approved a diesel fuel generator to power  the station last May.  </P> <P> Planning Commissioner Thomas Moody was the only dissenter in the 3-1 vote.  Commissioner Roger D. Slates abstained after environmentalists contended that  he was absent too often from the hearings to vote.  </P> <P> As a concession to potential homeowners, White said, planning commissioners  decided that the antennas would have to be moved after eight years if new homes  were built on the adjoining land. Only one house now stands on neighboring  property.  </P> <P> Opponents of the towers doubt that the antennas will ever be moved if  construction occurs. What is more, they say, the county could face costly  litigation if it eventually tries to force the towers off the land.  </P> <P> For his part, Daniel Villanueva Jr., president and part owner of Orange County  Broadcasting Co., contends that his station will provide a service to the  county's 400,000 Latino residents.  </P> <P> At Planning Commission hearings last spring, Villanueva and other company  representatives assured Booth that the station's underground diesel fuel tank,  which will be upstream from Booth's property, will be well fortified. They also  contend that the towers will be compatible with the surrounding mountain peaks.  </P> <P> "There's all kinds of transmissions up there," Villanueva said. "You name it,  everybody's up on that ridge."  </P> <P> Forestry officials, however, restrict communication towers to five peaks so  they are not spread out over the mountains. Further, they limit the height of  antennas in the Trabuco area of Cleveland National Forest to 120 feet, thus  avoiding the need for blinking red lights and brightly painted towers, which  the Federal Aviation Administration requires for tall structures.  </P> <P> In addition, Olson said, new applicants are required to use propane gas rather  than diesel fuel because it is less of a fire hazard and not as potentially  hazardous to ground water.  </P> <P> Former Orange County Planning Commissioner Shirley Grindle, who has also taken  up Booth's cause, contends that the county can revoke the original permit for  the towers because it was granted on the basis of misinformation.  </P> <P> A map submitted with the application showed an easement for the radio facility  on Booth's property, which he says he has never granted. In addition, the map  does not show that a county road crosses the property precisely where the  applicants propose to place guy wires for the towers.  </P> <P> Grindle contends that the applicants have received preferential treatment  because they are prominent Latino businessmen whose support would be important  to the future political aspirations of Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose  district includes the mountainside.  </P> <P> Villanueva and his brother, James, who is also a part owner of Orange County  Broadcasting, are the scions of Daniel Villanueva Sr., a wealthy and well-known  Spanish-language television executive. The partnership also includes Fernando  Niebla, a Republican political insider who owns Infotec Development Inc., the  largest Latino business in Orange County.  </P> <P> Campaign disclosure records show that Infotec contributed $600 in money and  $550 worth of help for a fund-raiser to Vasquez's 1988 supervisorial campaign.  </P> <P> Villanueva denied that his group had received any special treatment. He  acknowledged that the map he submitted with his application contained mistakes  but blamed them on a consultant who prepared it and said he later corrected the  errors.  </P> <P> "We went there and filled out an application like any Joe off the street,"  Villanueva said. "To say that we are a power is grossly incorrect."  </P> <P> Grindle said she met with Vasquez several weeks ago to seek his help but that  the supervisor encouraged her to try to settle the dispute.  </P> <P> "I'm very disappointed in Gaddi. I've always considered him to be fair and able  to see both sides," Grindle said. "But the reasons he and his staff have given  me for approving the project just don't hold water. . . . I think Gaddi has  lost sight of the terrible injustice that's been done to the small guy."  </P> <P> Vasquez said he has not decided yet whether he will vote for or against the  towers, and he denied that he has played any role other than to listen to  Grindle's concerns. He acknowledged that he discussed the permit briefly with  Niebla at a social function, but he said he never tried to influence the  Planning Commission's decision on the permit.  </P></p>

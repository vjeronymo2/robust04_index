The city of Garden Grove is  providing relocation assistance, in either lump sums or rent subsidies, to  those who are displaced.  </P> <P> Program funds are used to provide not only housing facilities but food,  clothing, counseling and other services for those who need shelter for up to  three months.  </P> <P> Other Orange County facilities scheduled for renovation starting this week  include the Interval House, Midway City; Fullerton Interfaith/New Vista  Shelter, Fulllerton; El Modena House, El Modena, and the Anchor House in San  Clemente.

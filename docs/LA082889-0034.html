			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> The wannabe "Mrs. David Letterman" is at it again. Margaret Ray, 37, was  charged last week with trespassing on the grounds of Letterman's New Canaan,  Conn., home, marking the fifth time she has been caught there. The talk-show  host told police to send her away with a warning, but court officials later  said Ray should be arrested and officers caught up with her at the New Canaan  train station. She was jailed on $10,000 bail and could be in big trouble,  since she was ordered to stay away from Letterman's home as part of her  conviction for trespassing there in 1988. Ray's obsession with Letterman  surfaced in 1988, when she was caught driving his Porsche to New Jersey. She  had identified herself to a toll collector as Mrs. David Letterman and  introduced her 3-year-old son as David Jr. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

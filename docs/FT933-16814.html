			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Australian pessimism over jobs THE Australian government admitted yesterday it had little chance of cutting deeply into record dole queues before the end of the decade. Mr Kim Beazley, employment minister, said there was only a slight chance of the jobless rate falling to pre-recession levels of 6 per cent by the turn of the century. More than 1.6m jobs would have to be created in the next few years. A small rise in exports, however, has given the gloom-ridden Australian economy a breather. The current account deficit in May fell to ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1bn), seasonally adjusted, from the previous month's ADollars 1.7bn shortfall. While the performance was not startling, the jittery market reacted favourably to the near-target outcome. The Australian dollar closed half a cent higher against the US dollar; during the previous two months there had been massive selling of the Australian currency following higher than expected deficits. The current account deficit for the 11 months to May was ADollars 14.3bn, and the outcome for the year is expected to be near the budget forecast of ADollars 15bn.</p>

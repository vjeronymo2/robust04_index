			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Management: Poet in the boardroom / Interview with Gertrud Hohler, Germany's outspoken 'powerfrau' and a non-executive director at Grand Metropolitan Gertrud Hohler can surely be forgiven for sounding a touch smug. Three years ago she seemed poised to take over as head of communications at Volkswagen, Europe's largest car group. But in an about turn which obviously still rankles today the company's supervisory board ignored the wishes of the then chief executive Carl Hahn and blocked her appointment to the DM500,000 (Pounds 200,000) a year post. 'They didn't like the idea of Hahn bringing a woman to such a senior job,' says the 52-year-old literature professor turned management guru. Not surprisingly, Hohler has been a more than normally interested observer of this summer's industrial espionage allegations against VW's Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, an episode widely seen as a public relations disaster for the car giant. 'Piech (VW's chief executive) has behaved in a thoroughly warlike way,' she suggests, agreeing with those who say that the VW chief has had no public relations policy, veering from injured silence at one moment to ill-thought aggression at another. Hohler has long been a familiar figure on the German corporate scene, but her international profile was raised last November when she became a non-executive director of Grand Metropolitan, the UK-based food and drinks group. GrandMet was specifically looking for a foreigner and she was chosen after a search by headhunters. Hohler's outspokenness, in itself unusual in Germany, is not the only way in which she differs from the ranks of Germany's management gurus. She is a woman, moreover, and one taken seriously in the higher echelons of the German business world where the female sex is not well represented. She is also a former poetry prize-winner, professor of literature at Paderborn University and author of a book on the poetry of Rainer Maria Rilke. She has subsequently written around a dozen books on management issues (the latest one is entitled Rules of the Game for Winners), and for three years worked as a close adviser to the board of the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank. She has had her own television shows and has advised leading politicians, and was tipped once as a possible member of Chancellor Kohl's cabinet. This cross-over into commercial life is again highly unusual in Germany; it is almost unheard of for someone with a liberal arts background to make a business career in Germany, where a doctorate on engineering or business economics seems to be the sole passport to a management position. In an environment where Edzard Reuter, chief executive of Daimler- Benz, Germany's biggest company, stands out simply because he is a member of the Social Democratic party rather than the conservative Christian Democrats, Hohler provides a rare dash of corporate colour. This has been acknowledged by the city of Aachen which honoured her with its prized 'Anti-Deadly Seriousness' award. Critics of the Hohler style - and there were believed to be many in the conservative environment of the Deutsche Bank - say that her contribution to the problems facing German managers is insubstantial and light-weight. They point out that for all her promise she has never quite held on to the position within the German political or industrial establishment which her well-publicised talents would appear to justify. Tall, striking and often sporting the 'Powerfrau' outfit of bright red jacket and striped shirt, Hohler now runs a one-woman communications consultancy in Berlin. But it is her vantage point in the boardroom of a UK company - where she is a double rarity as a woman and foreigner - which is perhaps most intriguing. A specialist on corporate culture, she says she has been pleasantly surprised at what she has learnt at Grand Met about the way the British business world runs. 'British people tend to think that Germans are stiff and unfriendly, but the reverse holds true as well,' she remarks. 'Germans have this idea of a formidably formal upper-class business community. This impression is reinforced by the formal way English people dress. 'This is true, but what has really astounded me is the mixture of formality with a relaxed approach to doing business. They (the British) laugh more than Germans and board meetings are less structured, without the deadly seriousness which surrounds board meetings in Germany. 'But this doesn't stop meetings being disciplined and effective. That English people should be so nonchalant without being in any way less effective is difficult for Germans to grasp. There is an extremely quick reaction to problems and mistakes. For example, in Germany the tendency is to cover problems up in the hope that they will go away, to think that if we don't notice the press won't notice either. 'Perhaps the biggest difference is in the attitude to profits. German managers have the reputation for being hard-nosed businessmen but in reality they are nervous about making money. In public they excuse themselves by saying 'yes we want to make a profit but we are nice people as well, really'. For British managers there is absolutely no contradiction between morality and profit.' Hohler clearly feels herself much more at home at Grand Met than at Deutsche Bank (she is legally bound not to talk about her time there), although last week's unexpected promotion of George Bull to the position of chief executive of the UK company suggests that boardroom life in Britain can be every bit as mysterious as in Germany. Her main asset in the British boardroom, she says, is that 'I am much closer to the consumer than my fellow directors', adding that she is probably the only member of the board who has recently been shopping in a supermarket. 'Top managers tend to become a little isolated from reality,' although she thinks this is less true for British businessmen than for Germans.</p>

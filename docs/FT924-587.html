			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Airbus clinches Dollars 3.3bn Singapore Airlines contract THE European Airbus consortium yesterday clinched a Dollars 3.36bn (Pounds 2.2bn) order from Singapore Airlines (SIA) for 20 of its latest A340-300 long-range widebody airliners, ending one of the toughest years in the aircraft maker's 20-year history on a positive note. After fighting off a strong challenge from Boeing, Airbus said SIA had signed a contract involving firm orders for seven A340-300s and options for 13 more. The deal included the cost of spares and spare engines, SIA said. The aircraft will be powered by CFM 56-5C4 engines jointly made by General Electric of the US and Snecma of France. The announcement coincided with certification of the A340 yesterday by the European Joint Airworthiness Authorities, grouping 18 countries, after an intensive flight test programme. The US airworthiness authorities are expected to certify the aircraft in the next two months. The SIA contract has partly offset the blow to Airbus earlier this month when Northwest Airlines, its biggest single customer, cancelled firm orders for 74 aircraft, comprising 24 A340s and 50 narrow-body A320s. SIA says it intends to use its new A340s, which will be delivered between 1996 and 1998, to carry 271 passengers in three classes on long-distance routes such as Singapore-Paris that do not justify the larger Boeing 747-400 jumbo. The A340 will enter commercial service for the first time next spring with Lufthansa of Germany and Air France. It has the longest range of any commercial airliner in the world, flying up to 9,000 miles with a full payload on 16- to 17-hour non-stop flights. The European Airbus consortium, whose partners are British Aerospace (20 per cent), Aerospatiale of France (37.9 per cent), Deutsche Aerospace (37.9 per cent) and Casa of Spain (4.2 per cent), reached a preliminary agreement with SIA for the A340 order in August 1991. SIA had originally planned to buy McDonnell Douglas MD-11 three-engine airliners, but decided to switch to Airbus because it said the MD-11 did not meet its range and payload requirements. However, SIA delayed completing the deal with Airbus partly because of concerns about the A340's long-distance capabilities. This encouraged Boeing to bid for the SIA deal with its new 777 twin-engine widebody airliner. But after some adjustments to the aerodynamics of the A340, Airbus appears to have satisfied SIA's range and payload requirements. The European consortium is now stepping up its challenge to Boeing's dominance of the large long-distance airliner market with the four-engine A340 and its sister aircraft, the twin-engine A330. The SIA deal was regarded as particularly important because the airline is one of world's most profitable, and is based in one of the few markets which has continued to show sustained growth during the air transport industry recession.</p>

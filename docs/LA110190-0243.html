			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HUD'S PIERCE MISLED PANEL, STUDY REPORTS  </P> <P> Former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. directed federal grants to  political friends and later misled Congress about his involvement,  congressional investigators said today.  </P> <P> Their report stopped short of concluding that Pierce committed perjury before a  House panel or that he and others at the agency violated criminal laws.  </P> <P> It said those questions would be left to the special prosecutor now  investigating Pierce.  </P> <P> An attorney for Pierce said the report was politically motivated and contained  "spurious allegations."  </P> <P> The report, the result of a House subcommittee's 16-month investigation of the  Reagan Administration's Department of Housing and Urban Development, said  Pierce concealed the extent of his involvement in the steering of federal  housing grants.  </P> <P> "At best, Secretary Pierce was less than honest and misled the subcommittee  about his involvement in abuses and favoritism in HUD funding decisions," the  report said. "At worst, Secretary Pierce knowingly lied and committed perjury  during his testimony."  </P> <P> The report was released by the House Government Operations Committee, whose  employment and housing subcommittee investigated the scandals involving  favoritism, mismanagement and political abuse at HUD.  </P></p>

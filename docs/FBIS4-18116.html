			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DW"-signed report: "Bavarian Police Intensify Contacts </F> With Neighbors"]    [Text] Munich -- According to Bavarian Interior Minister  Guenter Beckstein (Christian Social Union -- CSU), the Bavarian  police can now cooperate directly with the security authorities  of Bavaria's eastern neighbors, the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  and Hungary -- through a partner who speaks foreign languages  and can be reached by phone. This is an enormous improvement  over the existing situation, for instance in fighting the  smuggling of cars.    So far, four to six ministries, the embassies, and other  authorities had to be used in prosecuting offenses beyond  borders, Beckstein said yesterday after speaking to his  Hungarian colleague Imre Konya.    The CSU politician said that establishing an international  investigation pool is an objective to be put into practice in  the medium term. Only through access to other countries' car  registration data can international car smuggling gangs be  stopped.    Stolen cars are mainly taken across the eastern borders.  Beckstein estimates that this is true for 50 percent of the  150,000 cars reported stolen in Germany last year. The cheaper  cars went to Romania, the more expensive ones to the former  Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus.    At the Bavarian borders, 15,688 foreigners were seized for  trying to cross the border illegally. This figure is 22 percent  higher than last year. At the border with the Czech Republic  alone, 13,191 persons were discovered; in addition, border  police arrested 4,256 persons that were smuggled into the  country, which is an increase of 89 percent over 1992. A total  of 1,698 people were arrested for smuggling foreigners into the  country (126 percent more than in 1992).    Of the 29,378 persons arrested at Germany's borders last  year, 65 percent were seized by Bavarian border authorities.  The interior minister considered this to be a proof of the  particularly "intensive investigation work" done by Bavarian  border police.</p>

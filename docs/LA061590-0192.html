			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOOTNOTES;  </P> <P> SOCCER OFFICIAL'S CRITICISM OF PENALTY MOLLIFIES U.S. PLAYER  </P> <P> U.S. midfielder Eric Wynalda of Westlake Village said today that he felt  vindicated by remarks made this week by the International Federation of Assn.  Football's general secretary.  </P> <P> In discussing the performances of World Cup referees, Josef Blatter told the  Associated Press that Wynalda should not have received a red card for a foul in  the United States' opening game here last Sunday against Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> The expulsion not only forced the United States to play the final 38 minutes of  that 5-1 loss with only 10 men, but Wynalda also was disqualified from playing  in Thursday night's 1-0 loss in Rome to Italy. Wynalda also was fined $7,000.  </P> <P> Blatter said Swiss referee Kurt Roethlisberger was "clearly too harsh" when he  sent off Wynalda for shoving a Czech player in the back. Wynalda said it was  retaliation for earlier incidents.  </P> <P> "A yellow card would have been sufficient," Blatter said.  </P> <P> "That statement doesn't make what I did all right," Wynalda said. "It was a  learning experience for me. But FIFA's position does make me feel a lot  better." RANDY HARVEY  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRIVERS USE OF SHORTCUTS  </P> <P> Your article on cut-through traffic ("Drivers Seeking Shortcuts Raise Hackles  in Suburbia," Aug. 20) was certainly timely. This problem threatens to destroy  neighborhoods as we have known them by replacing quiet, relatively safe streets  with de facto thoroughfares for commuting drivers who are insensitive to the  unfair burden they place on fellow citizens.  </P> <P> In our large Santa Monica neighborhood we have spent over two years building  support for a "neighborhood protection plan" consisting of physical measures  such as stop signs, restricted turning during rush hours and attractive  planters at the end of some residential streets. Plaqued by unacceptable levels  of cut-through traffic currently, and faced with 70,000 additional car trips  per day that will be generated in the near future by three adjacent projects,  residents are willing to accept some inconvenience for themselves if they can  enjoy the benefits of reduced traffic, and be assured that emergency vehicles  can still reach our homes.  </P> <P> But such plans pose some problems for city governments. They can no longer  surreptitiously use residential neighborhoods to absorb commercial traffic.  They must confront the problem of excess traffic directly with street  improvements, signal synchronization and ride-share programs.  </P> <P> Your article doesn't mention the most important tool in neighborhoods'  anti-traffic arsenal -- insisting that new projects not be built until  developers and governments protect neighborhoods from the additional traffic  that the projects will generate.  </P> <P> Recently, Santa Monicans and residents of Mar Visa joined together to oppose  approval of the "Airport Project," more than 1 million square feet of  commercial space which spelled disaster for Centinela and all the streets  around it. Our success in defeating the project was the result of hundreds of  volunteer hours: analyzing environmental impact reports to debunk faulty  traffic analyses; demonstrating that the financial projections were overly  optimistic and misleading; distributing lawn signs to raise public  consciousness; collecting signatures on petitions, etc.  </P> <P> JENNIFER L.

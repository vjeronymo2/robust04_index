			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YELTSIN, TAKING STOCK OF U.S., TOURS NYSE  </P> <P> Maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin today visited the heart of American  capitalism -- the New York Stock Exchange -- to get a firsthand glimpse of the  inner workings of the American economy.  </P> <P> The Soviet lawmaker toured the trading floor with John Phelan, the chairman of  the exchange. Phelan showed Yeltsin, through the help of an interpreter, how  the countless video machines on the exchange floor spew out stock quotes and  keep tabs on the latest market information.  </P> <P> "He seemed quite interested in the mechanics of the system," said Sharon  Gasmin, a spokeswoman for the exchange.  </P> <P> During Yeltsin's 15-minute tour, the Soviet politician expressed surprise at  the number of women working on the floor of the exchange.  </P> <P> Yeltsin's trip to Wall Street occurred a day after a meeting with reporters, a  helicopter tour of the city and a walk in Central Park, where he shook hands  with smiling New Yorkers.  </P> <P> Before answering questions, Yeltsin, who wore a red Soviet flag pin in the  lapel of his suit jacket, said he was impressed with the capital of the  capitalist world.  </P> <P> "New York is not a series of gravestones with slums in between, but rather the  buildings represent a high level of artistic achievement," he said.  </P> <P> Yeltsin kept up his image as a thorn in Mikhail S. Gorbachev's side by  contending that the Soviet economy is in the worst shape in decades and that  the leader is moving too slowly in implementing reforms.  </P> <P> For the economy to recover from its malaise, Moscow would have to step up the  pace of reform dramatically and seek assistance from the United States, he  said.  </P></p>

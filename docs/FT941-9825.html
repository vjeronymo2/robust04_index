			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Dangers of great expectations: Tony Jackson asks if the investment plans of UK industry are failing to take account of low inflation and interest rates UK business, it seems, has a problem with investment. Inflation may be beaten and money cheap, but managers have not adjusted to the fact. Before they will sign up for a new machine or a new factory, they demand the same high return on their investment as in the old days. As a result, they risk underinvesting and being caught unprepared by economic recovery. So, at any rate, says Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Investment intentions, he said on Wednesday, are 'worryingly weak'. Companies still look for returns of 17 or 20 per cent, and may be missing opportunities as a result. Two professors from the London Business School made the same point in the FT on Wednesday. 'Our contacts with companies,' Elroy Dimson and Paul Marsh wrote, 'suggest that many have not responded sufficiently to falling inflation and lower real interest rates. As a result, their managements are demanding an excessive return from new investment projects.' The statistics seem to back this up. One obvious measure of investment in machinery is the home order book of the UK engineering industry. This is still shrinking, and is now almost 30 per cent smaller than in 1990. The output of the construction industry continues to dwindle as well. Granted, the CBI's regional survey this week reported planned increases in spending on plant and machinery almost throughout the UK. But the survey also pointed to sharply lower investment in buildings. Most companies said they were investing not to expand, but to improve efficiency. And the chief factor limiting investment was - yes - 'inadequate return'. On the face of it, this is curious. The apparent conquest of inflation means UK interest rates are historically very low. The stock market is also very high, since investors have been switching out of cash into equities. A company looking to invest is thus offered the cheapest money for a generation, in the form either of a loan from the bank or cash from shareholders. The collapse of inflation alters the sums in another way. Typically, companies will calculate the return required on an investment in two parts: the basic return, and a premium on top to reflect the risk of the investment going wrong. The figures will normally be worked on a real (ie, inflation-adjusted) basis, so falling inflation does not change the sums directly. But inflation is a business risk in itself, since it leads to high and unstable interest rates and a stop-go economy. If stable prices represent lower risk, they also logically allow lower real rates of return. But if the behaviour of companies seems irrational, it is not very surprising. Inflationary psychology is hard to learn and equally hard to forget. When inflation first took hold in the 1970s, portfolio investors persisted for years in buying UK government bonds on yields below inflation, because they could not believe inflation would last. The same now obtains in reverse. After more than two decades of inflation, business people are slow to accept that the dragon is slain. The stock market may seem to think so, but portfolio investors have less to lose. If inflation revives, they can simply sell the shares. A company committing itself to a new plant with a 10-year payoff does not have that luxury. One of the UK's leading industrial companies, GEC, says its real target rate of return remains unchanged at 20 per cent. Mr David Newlands, GEC's finance director, says: 'Clearly, if you got to the position where inflation really was defeated, you'd have to adjust your sights downwards or miss opportunities. But I don't think there is enough evidence yet that inflation is really dead.' Besides, some quoted companies say, their cost of capital is ultimately determined by the stock market. The market may be high at present. But history suggests equities' behaviour is largely independent of the level of inflation over longer periods, such as five years. Mr Alan Spall, ICI finance director, says: 'Inflation is only one of a huge number of elements in the equation. The fact that inflation has come down doesn't at all mean that our hurdle rates have come down as well.' In addition, some companies show signs of taking rates of return on investment more seriously than before. This is a sensible response to the low-growth, highly competitive 1990s. In the boom years of the 1980s, there was a better chance that an ill-judged investment would be bailed out by economic growth. Indeed, inflation itself may have led to careless investment decisions, since continuously rising prices had a way of covering up mistakes. In fairness to the stock market, it is worth pointing out that some City commentators take a less gloomy view of what is happening to capital investment than industry itself. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at the brokers James Capel, says: 'I think we're beginning to see the conditions fall into place for quite a strong expansion of capital investment.' First, he argues, official figures show that corporate profits have recovered from the depths of recession more sharply than expected, and certainly faster than in the early 1980s. At the same time, dividend payments have adjusted to lower inflation. 'So there's been a phenomenal bounce in companies' retained earnings,' Mr Skeoch says. 'In the postwar years, that's been a necessary condition in the UK for a revival in capital investment.' Second, though the level of investment may still be flat or even falling, it remains strong by historical standards. Business investment as a proportion of GDP is now a little over 12 per cent. Throughout much of the 1960s and 1970s, it was significantly lower. But if the City is sanguine, it is largely alone. The Treasury and the Bank of England appear to be uneasy. The CBI is about to undertake a survey of its members, asking how they go about their investment appraisals and whether their habits are changing. Conventional wisdom says the hesitant UK recovery, hitherto led by the consumer, needs to be backed by business investment if it is to be sustained. On the showing so far, it would not do to count on it.</p>

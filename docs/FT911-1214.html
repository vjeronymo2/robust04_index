			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Lothian capped MR IAN LANG, Scottish secretary, yesterday used capping powers for the first time under the community charge in Scotland to reduce poll tax bills for people in Lothian region, which includes Edinburgh. He said the budgeted spending by the Labour-controlled council - which levies the highest poll tax in Scotland - was 'excessive and unreasonable' and should be cut by Pounds 25m.</p>

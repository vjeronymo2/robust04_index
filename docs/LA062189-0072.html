			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW AND USEFUL: QUICK FLAMES A CINCH FOR BARBECUE FANS  </P> <P> Back-yard barbecuers may be interested in Fire Flakes, nontoxic dry pine chips  coated with paraffin that are billed as an alternative to starting the barbie  with liquid charcoal lighters. The new curly wood flakes don't give off smelly  fumes or add chemical taste to food.  </P> <P> The bright orange chips are easy to use. Just take two handfuls and place them  in the barbecue under the charcoal. Then ignite. Unlike most starters, Fire  Flakes light the charcoal from underneath and typically take 15 minutes to help  produce a strong fire, said company manager C. H. (Chuck) Aydelotte.  </P> <P> Developed by March Industries of Fresno, Fire Flakes was purchased early this  year by the Ortho Consumer Products Division of the Chevron Chemical Co. The  product now is being distributed in the West and Midwest. An 18-ounce box, with  a suggested retail of $2.19, can start 10 barbecue fires and can be used with  any type of charcoal grill.  </P> <P> In the Los Angeles area, Fire Flakes can be found at Albertsons, Alpha Beta,  Boys, Hughes, Lucky, Vons and Vons Pavilions markets. For information on stores  in your area that carry Fire Flakes, or for a free sample, write to Fire  Flakes, 2445 S. Gearhart Ave., Fresno, Calif. 93725.  </P> <P> Helmet for Bikers  </P> <P> For mountain bicyclists, there's a lightweight safety helmet from Giro Sport  Design Inc., the California company that developed the Prolight soft-cover  cycling helmet and the Aerohead helmet for use in time-trial competitions.  </P> <P> The Hammerhead, the new mountain biking helmet, has an aerodynamic design  similar to Prolight. But Giro has added a thin, flexible polymer outer shell  for more protection. "The slick covering prevents dings to the helmet and  eliminates the possibility of fabric covers getting caught in branches when  cutting through the brush," a manufacturer's representative explained.  </P> <P> The Hammerhead weighs 8.5 ounces and features nine air vents. Its polished  shell is red and white. It retails for $79.95 and is available in sizes XS, S,  M and L. It can be purchased at Giro's 1,200 national distributors. For a  dealer near you, call the company's toll-free number, (800) 543-4476, or write  Giro Sport Design Inc., 2880 Research Park Drive, Soquel, Calif. 95073.  </P> <P> Handy Music  </P> <P> Looking for an unusual way to entertain and perhaps educate your children? You  might want to try Musical Hands, gloves that play notes of the scale when the  fingers are tapped or pressed on a hard surface. At $22.95 per pair, postpaid,  they're certainly cheaper than a piano.  </P> <P> "This toy stimulates a child's creativity as they produce musical tones right  from their own fingertips," said Matthew Hesser, executive vice president of  the Musical Hands distributing company in Torrance.  </P> <P> The gloves, made of yellow and blue vinyl, are hand sewn and can be adjusted to  fit most children ages 7 and older. Musical Hands are powered by six watch-size  batteries, which are included with each pair, as is a song instruction booklet.  To order, write Majon International, 23135 Samuel St., Suite 7, Torrance,  Calif. 90505; phone (213) 791-1005. LYNN SIMROSS  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY WORKERS PROTEST PROPOSED PARKING FEE  </P> <P> Dozens of county employees demonstrated Thursday to protest a proposal to  charge workers for parking in the Civic Center area -- parking that they now  receive for free.  </P> <P> Representatives of the Service Employees International Union, Local 660,  released a plan they said is more "consistent" with meeting clean air  requirements than the plan the county has said could be adopted July 1.  </P> <P> The county, like other large employers, is required to adopt a plan to reduce  traffic congestion to help clean up the air in the Los Angeles Basin.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District approved the county's plan  several months ago but employees say it will actually increase traffic in the  Civic Center area. A spokesman for the county could not be immediately reached  for comment.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" by Carol Pui-yee Lai] </F>   [Text] Xi Yang's heavy 12-year jail sentence was due to the  personal intervention of the Chinese Communist Party general  secretary and President, Jiang Zemin, according to reliable  sources in Beijing and Hong Kong.    The Ministry of State Security had originally suggested that  Xi's sentence be limited to a maximum of two years. Jiang  overruled the proposal last month. The main reason for this,  according to analysts in Beijing, was to maintain the current  policy of tightening control over Hong Kong and foreign  journalists in China.    Senior Chinese officials in Hong Kong and Beijing had  expressed resentment over the relatively lenient treatment given  to Leung Wai-man, the Hong Kong Express reporter who publicised  a leaked advance copy of a speech by Jiang in 1992.    Yesterday, Hong Kong reporters announced they would  selectively boycott Chinese press events launched or funded by  the Beijing government until the end of next month.    Xi was convicted at a secret trial last month of stealing  "state secrets" about internal policies on interest rates and  gold. His appeal was rejected last Friday. Eastern Express can  reveal the series of twists and turns Xi's case took since his  detention last September.    Yu Pun-hoi, the chairman of the Ming Pao Group, explored a  variety of channels to secure Xi's release. These included  meetings with a senior Chinese leader, Bo Yibo, and the State  Security Minister, Jia Chunwang. In early October, a deputy  head of Beijing's Municipal State Security Bureau told Ming Pao  that Xi had made "mistakes" in covering news. There was no  indication that he had committed a criminal offence at the time.    The official suggested MING PAO should do three things: Keep  a low profile; reject any assistance from the British-Hong Kong  Government, foreign countries, local political groups or media  groups; and make an open apology to the Chinese Government.    Louis Cha, the former chairman of Ming Pao, was receiving  similar advice at the same time from Zhou Nan, the director of  the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (XINHUA) in Hong Kong.    Yu, the chairman, made a public apology over the case on  October 10, 1993. Yu also sought assistance from Bo Yibo, the  former vice-chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, through  his personal connection with his son, Bo Xicheng.    The Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau, after its  investigation, completed its initial report on Xi's case at the  end of November. It concluded that Xi had made mistakes but  also said that Xi was not connected to any "economic and  political crime." That report led to a heated debate within the  Ministry of State Security. One faction argued that Xi should  be judged "in accordance with the law".    In the wake of Leung Waiman's case, this faction argued that  Hong Kong journalists should not be granted any leniency and  insisted that Xi undergo full legal proceedings so that "justice  should be seen to be done." The State Security Ministry, faced  with internal divisions and requests for leniency from several  senior Chinese officials, came up with three proposals for  settling the Xi case.    One was to give a strong warning to Xi and send him back to  Hong Kong.    The second was to take Leung's case as a precedent and ban  Xi  from entering the mainland for three years. Leung was released  and allowed to return to Hong Kong in 1992.    The third proposal was to hand Xi over to the judicial  organs  with the instruction that he be sentenced to two years in prison  with eligibility for parole.    In December, the ministry submitted its report on the Xi  investigation to Jiang Zemin. In the meantime, the message that  Xi would be treated leniently had already been relayed to Ming  Pao through XINHUA, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, and  the Ministry of State Security. But Jiang, after apparently  sitting on the Xi file for three months, suddenly handed down an  instruction last month that Xi's case should be treated severely.</p>

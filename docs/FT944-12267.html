			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Moscow in IMF talks over pegging rouble to the dollar The Russian rouble could be stabilised early next year if Moscow and the International Monetary Fund can agree a plan to peg the currency to the dollar, cut inflation and reform the country's fiscal system. The plan, being discussed by the fund, would be the boldest step since Russia's first attempts in 1992 to promote a market economy. However, the proposals carry the risk of a far more costly currency collapse than occurred last month, when the rouble fell nearly 25 per cent against the dollar in one day, and the central bank was forced to pump in foreign exchange to support it. Under the plan, Russia would be able to use IMF funds to support the rouble against speculative movements in the currency markets. Mr Konstantin Kagalovsky, the retiring Russian executive director of the IMF, said the plan depended on agreement by the fund to provide between Dollars 14bn and Dollars 16bn (Pounds 8.5bn and Pounds 9.8bn) to support market reforms in Russia next year. This would be by far the largest amount paid out to any country over such a limited period. The funds would be in the form of a standby loan of Dollars 6bn; an additional Dollars 2bn tranche of a reconstruction loan (Russia has already received its limit of Dollars 3bn from the original loan); an issue of special drawing rights worth about Dollars 2bn; and a stabilisation fund of Dollars 6bn. Such funds, especially the reconstruction facility and the SDRs, are controversial and will require delicate negotiation by Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director. His proposal to extend the reconstruction facility and an issue of special drawing rights to developing countries and economies was rejected at the IMF Madrid summit last month by a majority of the fund's members. Mr Kagalovsky added that the stabilisation fund would need to be paid to Russia to be used, under agreed conditions, as Russia saw fit to support the rouble once it had been 'pegged' to an exchange rate against the dollar. This would mark a departure from the IMF's normal approach which is to promise support for the currency but not to pay it to the country in question. Bankers believe the rouble would be pegged at perhaps Rbs3,500-3,700 to the dollar. Polish visit cancelled, Page 2 Currencies, Page 34</p>

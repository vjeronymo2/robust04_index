			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / BAA says failure of fifth terminal will cost 14,000 jobs Failure to build a fifth terminal at London Heathrow would cost 14,000 jobs, BAA, which operates the airport, said yesterday, Daniel Green writes. A decision to proceed with the Pounds 900m terminal would create 6,000 jobs and protect 8,000 others, the company said in a lobbying document it submitted to the government. A public inquiry is expected to begin in 1995. If planning permission were granted in 1997, the first stage of the terminal would open in the year 2002.</p>

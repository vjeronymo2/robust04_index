			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 27 KYODO -- The Social Democratic Party  (SDP) [Social Democratic Party of Japan -- SDPJ] edged gingerly  toward a grand alliance with its onetime archenemy Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) in intensifying political maneuverings  Monday while the coalition of caretaker Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata remained on the sidelines.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met separately with the heads  of the LDP and the tiny New Party Sakigake, a splinter party  from the LDP, in efforts to consolidate its standing in forming  a new cabinet following Hata's resignation announced Saturday.    Murayama and LDP President Yohei Kono agreed to seek  election  of a new premier Tuesday, and both parties later ruled out an  extension of the term of the current 150-day regular Diet  session, which expires Wednesday.    Murayama and Kono also concurred in jointly taking "heavy  responsibility" for breaking the current political standoff in  order to pave the way for an early creation of the new  government.    Kono proposed a trilateral meeting with Murayama and  Sakigake  head Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary for Hata's  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, for a breakthrough pact.    The meeting could lead to a crucial tripartite coalition to  form the new ruling camp, political analysts said.    The Monday meeting between the SDP and Sakigake heads  produced a joint call for a "dove" or soft-line government based  on their agreed policy outline.    Takemura, leery of what he believes to be the high-handed  leadership of Shinseito and Komeito in the coalition, made clear  his party has no plan to reconcile with the group, urging  Murayama to head the new government.    Meanwhile, the minority coalition, which lost its grip on  power when Hata stepped down after only two months in office,  played a wait-and-see strategy, turning down the SDP's overture  for a meeting between Murayama and Hata.    In a meeting of the party top brass, the coalition confirmed  its policy of waiting for the SDP's initiative for fresh talks  on policy agreement before any high-stakes meeting between the  party heads.    The SDP's policy-making board, on the other hand, endorsed  the joint policy platform with Sakigake and called on the  coalition to make a formal response to its proposal for the  Murayama-Hata talks by 11 a.m. [0200 GMT] Tuesday.    If the coalition remains cool to the SDP's proposal, the  Socialists will discard efforts to strike an alliance with the  coalition and start whole-hearted negotiations with the LDP,  insiders said.    Murayama underscored the possibility of an accord with the  LDP, saying at a meeting of SDP members of the House of  Councillors, "if there is no room for talks with the coalition,  we should seek (another) way for creating a government."    Neither the SDP nor the LDP, however, is monolithic about  forgetting their long history of bad blood and antagonism to  join hands.    A group of liberals in the SDP called "Democrats" urged the  party leadership to reject the LDP's call for alliance and start  reconciliation talks with the coalition.    Within the LDP, a growing number of party members are  tilting  toward a partnership with the SDP, party sources said.    "Consensus within the party is materializing for a  trilateral  coalition (with the SDP and Sakigake)," said Koichi Kato, a  senior LDP lawmaker.    But a group led by former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe  made a renewed call for talks with the coalition for a possible  new conservative alliance.</p>

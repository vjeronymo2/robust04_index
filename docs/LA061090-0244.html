			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A DAY AND NIGHT WITH WARREN BEATTY  </P> <P> Boss:  </P> <P> Here are the notes from my interview with Warren Beatty. As I said, even though  the two hours he promised me turned into nine hours and a Chinese dinner, I  didn't really get a chance to ask him many of the questions I'd prepared. He  took the interview away from me in the first minute and by the time I got it  back, it was midnight and my mind was as weak as the batteries in my tape  recorder.  </P> <P> I'm not complaining about the assignment. Beatty, as advertised, is good  company: bright, thoughtful, funny and as openly excited about his life as  anyone I've met. At times, he would lapse into reverie about the great people  he's known in film and politics -- even journalism -- and talk about the upside  of fame as if he'd won it all in a lottery.  </P> <P> Of course, he will only talk about himself in the abstract. He will not go on  the record on any subject where he would appear critical of someone, or reveal  some tidbit about a relationship. He keeps up on the gossip about himself, I  can tell you, but he isn't about to contribute to it. At least not on the  record. By the end of the evening, he had told some of the greatest Warren  Beatty stories I've ever heard, but only after he'd reached over and turned off  my tape recorder.  </P> <P> The reason the interview got away from me -- other than the fact that he's kind  of a take-charge guy -- is that I prepared for the wrong things. Having seen  the Barbara Walters interview, which consisted mostly of them agreeing on how  badly the interview was going, and reading the recent Rolling Stone piece, in  which his answers to questions about his virility and image included pauses  that lasted as long as a gall bladder infection, I decided to take the high  road and focus on his attitudes about filmmaking, Hollywood and his own career.  </P> <P> For more than 20 years, he's been one of the ultimate Hollywood insiders, a  double-threat power player in the sense that he can tie up important projects  as both an actor and a producer, and he's a Hall of Fame limousine liberal.  </P> <P> What I didn't know was that he had been preparing for the interview longer than  I had. In fact, he'd been working himself up for it for three years, ever since  Sunday Calendar published a story about the making, marketing and swollen  budget of "Ishtar." I didn't write that piece, as he knew. But there I was.  </P> <P> "Before we start, let me ask you a question," Beatty said, as soon as we had  closed the doors in a small cutting room of the Hollywood studio where he was  doing some final tweaking of the sound track of "Dick Tracy." It was about 3 in  the afternoon. "May I write a letter to the Los Angeles Times that you would  print?"  </P> <P> It sounded like a trick question, and it was. Sure, we'd print his letter, I  said. "But why don't you just tell me what's on your mind and maybe it could be  incorporated into this story?" Did I get an earful! That "Ishtar" article had  formed a lump in his throat the size and flavor of a camel and he was using me  to dislodge it. He was also angered by a rumor whispered to him by one of his  publicists that he'd better give us a better interview than he had given  ABC-TV's Barbara Walters or he'd end up on our cutting room floor.  </P> <P> "To me, (the Walters interview) was funny," he said. "But I hate it when  somebody says, 'Well, he didn't talk to her.' I talked to Barbara Walters at  length about a myriad of crap. . . . Do you think I sat for the 15 or 20  minutes the way they used it? The frustrating thing is you sit there and go  through the serious stuff and then it's not what (they use)."  </P> <P> There's the irony, huh? I went in planning to talk only about the serious stuff  and suddenly I'm Father Kerrigan in "The Exorcist," covered with the green curd  of the devil's breath. But as harsh as all this seems when it's played back,  there wasn't an uncomfortable moment in the entire day. Beatty's attack had a  specific target -- entertainment journalism, particularly as practiced in his  hometown newspaper -- but his approach was intellectual, reasoned, almost  fraternal (you'll recall he played a journalist in "Parallax View" and "Reds").  The Beatty graciousness we'd heard about ("Would you like something to drink?"  "Is that chair comfortable") was evident at all times.  </P> <P> But the camel had to come out.  </P> <P> "The Los Angeles Times doesn't seem to take itself as seriously as the paper of  record for a place that is the cultural engine in several fields of the  country," Beatty said. "Calendar doesn't know if it wants to be a cultural  section or a business section so it mixes the two. . . . It seems that (the  newspaper) thinks that what sells, sells."  </P> <P> Beatty said the media's routine reporting of things like box-office grosses,  film budgets and production problems demeans the actual films, and that while  they may make good business stories, they shouldn't be published in the  cultural pages where readers and potential investors will get the idea that the  only measure of success is the bottom line. He went farther, saying that  box-office reports are promoting bad movies: "People see that one movie is  making more money than another and think, well, maybe that's a better movie."  </P> <P> Beatty says that "money" stories can both heighten and lower interest in movies  for reasons unrelated to the movies themselves, and -- here comes the camel --  he cites "Ishtar" as one of the victims. Beatty does not acknowledge that  "Ishtar" -- directed by Elaine May, produced by him, and released by Columbia  Pictures in the spring of 1987 -- was any kind of creative failure. He calls  the film a "nice little comedy that cost too much money" and blames both the  studio management and the media for killing it before it reached the theaters.  </P> <P> "You cannot make a movie today that has any visibility for it and not be  supported by the studio," he said. He made his strongest comments about former  Columbia chief David Puttnam off the record, but he let this much stand:  "(Puttnam) never talked to the director, he never talked to me, he never saw  the movie. He just said, 'This is not going to work.' You know, the movie was  previewed three times before all that negative publicity was unleashed on it,  and each of the previews were great. I have never had a more successful  preview. And your own critic gave it a good review."  </P> <P> True, but there weren't many good reviews. Most critics panned it.  </P> <P> "How could they not? After all that (negative publicity), how could they like  it? You can't laugh at a $40 million movie."  </P> <P> Beatty said that he and Dustin Hoffman foresaw the problems coming on "Ishtar"  and offered to defer their salaries (reportedly $5.5 million each) in order to  keep the cost of production down, and that Columbia declined. The Times was not  the first publication to cover "Ishtar's" production problems in Morocco, but  it was "the most vicious," according to Beatty, and because of the paper's  influence, it caused a negative backlash with critics elsewhere and with people  in the film community.  </P> <P> Although he does not like to have press people on the sets of his movies, he  said he "opened" "Dick Tracy" to deter speculation. "I'm scared to have a  closed set now," he said. "The only way you can combat the negative rumors is  to invite anyone in."  </P> <P> "Ishtar" and the larger subject of cultural reporting took up the first three  hours we were together and then became the leitmotif for the rest of the day.  Even though the conversation -- that's what it was, not an interview -- took  some interesting side roads through his film and political past, and his  attitudes about today's Hollywood versus the one he found when he arrived 30  years ago, virtually every subject spun from his current fixation on America's  swing to the right, which he partly blames for the Decline and Fall of American  Journalism.  </P> <P> "Movies have gotten tamer, politics have gotten tamer, everything's gotten  tamer," he said, at one point. "And I'll tell you something else. In actual  political analysis, journalism has gotten tamer. Much tamer. It's a  catastrophe! They're not very tame about trying to uncover sexual peccadilloes  of people and things like that, but getting down to what's really happening in  the country, it's very tame."  </P> <P> That last reference includes the media flashfire that incinerated his friend  Gary Hart's political hopes during the last presidential primary campaigns.  Beatty stumped for Hart, as he did years earlier for Bobby Kennedy, Hubert  Humphrey and George McGovern, and he thinks the media speculation over the  relationship between Hart and model Donna Rice may have cost the country a  great leader.  </P> <P> Certainly, he is sympathetic to any public figure whose sex life becomes more  important to the public than whatever it is that made him a public figure in  the first place. He accuses the media of loading up with demographic research,  then pandering to the majority's worst instincts.  </P> <P> "Not only does (this approach of discussing sex) reduce me as a human being, it  reduces the writer as a human being, and it reduces the reader as human beings.  Do we all want to be reduced? Is that what we want?"  </P> <P> Not me, and true to my word, I did not ask him about his sex life. But the  Beatty Legend is there and to identify him as someone who makes movies is like  identifying Casanova as a guy who worked in a library. Beatty won't discuss any  personal relationship -- "never have, I won't now, I don't intend to" -- but  the smile says everything when you suggest that there are worse things than  being thought of as intelligent, stimulating and sexually indefatigable.  </P> <P> "Oh, oh, oh, yeah. It could be a lot worse," Beatty said.  </P> <P> "I mean, if you have to have an image, this one's not bad," I offered.  </P> <P> "Listen, I've been famous since 1960 and . . . and . . . I've been lucky."  </P> <P> Beatty's image was formed almost immediately when he got to Hollywood in 1960  to play the high school heartbreaker in Elia Kazan's "Splendor in the Grass."  Kazan was a director noted for his work with such emotionally mercurial and  sexually charismatic actors as Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando and James Dean,  so all eyes were on Shirley MacLaine's little brother. The movie was a critical  success and Beatty's star has not really dimmed since, even though he has done  only 18 films altogether, and just four in the last 15 years, including "Dick  Tracy."  </P> <P> Less than half of his films can be regarded as socially, critically or  commercially important and of the five films he's produced, only three --  "Bonnie and Clyde," "Shampoo" and "Reds" -- tapped into any of the serious  social issues in which he has been personally interested. The only one of those  he directed was "Reds."  </P> <P> Those are great movies and it says something about Beatty's appeal that he has  remained one of Hollywood's most prized actors despite his light workload. But  the question is begged: For someone as hypercritical of others in the media,  why hasn't he done more -- through his own medium of movies -- to address some  of the social problems he's complaining about?  </P> <P> He thought for a while and spoke very slowly.  </P> <P> "Well, the answer to (that) is I think I will (make more of those movies) and  I'm slow. It takes me a long time to develop things and I think about them a  long time. I've been developing a movie about Howard Hughes quite a long time.  I developed 'Reds' for a long time. There's a movie I've been working on that  deals with some of this stuff. . . . But when you're asked why don't you work  harder, I think the answer is I ought to work harder and I ought to work  faster, but I don't."  </P> <P> He then drifted into another explanation that seemed to raise a second  contradiction.  </P> <P> "I think your whole life is not made up of making movies. . . . You have  another side to your life, your own personal exist  </P> <P> ence. And if you're not totally self-indulgent and self-concerned, you have a  political side of your life in which you relate to the society you live in. I  don't know that movies have to be as articulate about your society views as you  would be if you just went ahead and said what you think."  </P> <P> Other than speaking out for political candidates, Beatty has been notoriously  mum on other subjects. When Paramount released the $33 million "Reds" in 1981,  some right-wing publications attacked Gulf &amp; Western, the studio's parent  company, for financing it. Beatty did no interviews, prompting others to scold  him for hanging Gulf &amp; Western out to dry.  </P> <P> "I felt that people didn't understand the nature of it and actually there was  nothing I could do by running around proselytizing for it," he said. "I always  had doubts that a movie about a communist who dies at the end, a movie about a  dream that seemed to be not working, a movie that was 3 1/2 hours long, would  (have a big audience)."  </P> <P> Beatty said the communications revolution has made the speed with which  information can be moved more important than the information itself, and the  result is a lot of bad info being taken seriously. He blames Ronald Reagan, the  Great Communicator, for failing to warn the nation about the downside of the  new technology, in the way Eisenhower warned of the dangers of the military  industrial complex when he left office 30 years ago.  </P> <P> "Because you can't cut down on the technology, there has to be a lot more talk.  I've decided that it's stingy of me not to participate in that talk. . . . It's  self-defeating, non-contributive and ultimately antisocial not to participate."  </P> <P> So he's making himself more available as "Dick Tracy" approaches, and if people  want to ask him about his sex life or his image, he'll wait them out with  pauses. If you want to know what's really on his mind, you get these passionate  speeches about what's going wrong with the world and your part in it. And if  you listen long enough, the subject of gossip comes up because it's played such  a big part in his life.  </P> <P> Knowing his background as a confidante to Bobby Kennedy and other major liberal  Democrats during the late '60s and early '70s, you have to wonder how much of  his current anger is fueled by memories of a period that was not only more  dynamic politically and socially, but for him personally. He admits that as a  young actor, it was a heady experience getting to know people like Kazan,  Michelangelo Antonioni, Francois Truffaut (who put him up to doing "Bonnie and  Clyde"), Jean Renoir, Clifford Odets and David O. Selznick. As he drifted into  politics, he got to know his political heroes too -- the Kennedys, Eugene  McCarthy, Stuart Symington, Abraham Ribikoff. And through politics, he met his  heroes in . . . journalism.  </P> <P> "It was a great (expletive) time," Beatty said, excitedly. "I was ecstatic that  I had access to newspapermen at that time. I had access to Arthur Krock, Walter  Lippman, James Reston, Izzy Stone. These amazing people, this amazing period."  </P> <P> It's an even more amazing time looking back, and when I wondered out loud what  it must have been like to have been in Bobby Kennedy's inner circle during that  intoxicating, ill-fated 1968 campaign, there was a real moment. Beatty put his  feet up on a table, crossed his arms and sighed loud enough to leave a skid  mark on my tape. He paused several seconds, his eyes misted over, then he began  softly: "It's funny. When I see those people from those years, you couldn't pay  me enough money to do movies (that would) take me away from that involvement. .  . . It's very different, it's the real thing."  </P> <P> Beatty's artistic contributions to that tumultuous period of the late '60s and  early '70s were "Bonnie and Clyde," which came to be regarded as a metaphor for  America's restless youth, and the 1974 "Shampoo," a social comedy about sexual  and political self-indulgence in 1968 Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The release of "Bonnie and Clyde," which was produced by Beatty and directed by  Arthur Penn, is one of the great success stories in Hollywood history. Warner  Bros. had no faith in the movie and when it was panned by critics at the New  York Times and at Time and Newsweek magazines, the studio pulled it from  release. Beatty recalled the unusual review he got from Jack Warner when he and  Arthur Penn showed him the rough cut at his house. They had been warned that if  Warner went to the bathroom during the screening, they knew they were in  trouble. Beatty said that by his count, Warner rated "Bonnie and Clyde" "a  three-piss movie."  </P> <P> "He said, 'How long was that picture?' At that time, it was about two hours and  10 minutes. He said, 'That's the longest damn two hours and 10 minutes I've  ever spent."'  </P> <P> Beatty stumped for his movie with critics and when Pauline Kael weighed in with  a 9,000-word New Yorker review extolling "Bonnie and Clyde" as a breakthrough  in film art, both her and Beatty's careers were elevated. Other critics --  including those who'd panned it earlier for the news magazines -- reconsidered  and Warner re-eleased it to great commercial success, followed by nine Oscar  nominations. (A decade later, Beatty recruited Kael to work for him as a  production executive, but the relationship was severed soon after and Beatty  said they haven't spoken since.)  </P> <P> Because the studio had no faith in "Bonnie and Clyde," Beatty was given a  greater percentage of the gross profits than he would normally get and the  movie made him rich. He had taken roles earlier because he was broke, but  suddenly he was free to do as he wanted, and mainly, that was to get involved  in the political campaigns of liberal Democrats.  </P> <P> Although he acted in four films (and two very good ones: "The Parallax View"  and "McCabe and Mrs. Miller"), it was six years before he would produce again.  That was "Shampoo" and though Beatty seems more enthusiastic about that film  than any other he's done, he again faced a disinterested studio chief.  </P> <P> "I remember after the first preview of that movie, the head of the studio put  his hand on my knee and said, 'Look, they can't all be good. So you just go on  to the next one.' The very next night we ran it again in Beverly Hills and the  roof went off. They loved it and we didn't change a thing."  </P> <P> "Shampoo" starred Beatty as a philandering hair dresser who can't commit  himself to anything but satisfying the swarms of sexually exercised women  around him. The film is extremely political at its core, one of the most  telling films of the sexual revolution, but it was the assumption that Beatty  was playing himself that dominated much of the analysis.  </P> <P> "I think they thought it was somehow sexually self-advertising in an arrogant  way," he said.  </P> <P> Beatty loves the movie. "It's a great film, it's as political as you can get  and it's outrageous. . . . There was a real revolution, a cultural and sexual  revolution, that 'Shampoo' tapped into."  </P> <P> Since "Shampoo," Beatty has had one monster commercial hit -- "Heaven Can  Wait," which he co-wrote (with Elaine May), co-directed (with Buck Henry) and  produced. Beatty agrees with Pauline Kael, who called it a "piffle," but  Academy members anointed it with nine nominations. "Reds," while not a  financial disaster, had the trouble Beatty predicted for it at the box office,  but ran up a total of 12 Oscar nominations and made Beatty the only person  besides Orson Welles to receive four nominations -- writing, directing,  producing and acting -- for one movie. Beatty won that year for best director;  "Chariots of Fire" won for best picture.  </P> <P> "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Shampoo" were part of a political Golden Age in  Hollywood, a period of about 12 years where issues-oriented filmmakers  flourished. It was an accidental gap, according to Beatty, "a little period  between the loss of studio bullying and the advent . . . of heavy television  marketing. . . . It was a period where you could make a movie that could grab  the attention span of the public and not have to do it in a week. A picture  would come out in a very small number of theaters, then move to greater number  and by the time you got to (wide release), people had some understanding of the  subject. . . . The period came to a close when people got serious about it and  said, 'Hey, we've got to get some demographics, some research.' "  </P> <P> The upshot: Today, movies are opened in 1,500 to 2,500 theaters, supported by  massive TV ad campaigns, and the opening is like a presidential election.  Studio executives know by Saturday morning whether a new release is going to be  a hit or not, and can either yank their advertising to cut their losses or up  their budgets to fan the fire. Movies that are difficult to sell don't have  much of a chance.  </P> <P> "They're like fast food hamburgers," Beatty said. "They sell a lot of them. The  movie business is very successful and you hope that the success of those  hamburgers will finance more original dishes. But more often than not, I'm  afraid it just finances more hamburgers."  </P> <P> Dinner wasn't on the schedule for this interview, but it got to be about 8:30  and Beatty suggested we go out to Ginza Sushiko, a Japanese restaurant on  Wilshire Boulevard. It is, he said, the most expensive restaurant in Los  Angeles. He and Madonna had gone there recently and the bill came to about $450  . . . at the sushi bar!  </P> <P> "Would the Los Angeles Times think you were compromised if I took you there?"  he said.  </P> <P> "Not if I pick up the check."  </P> <P> We ended up at the Mandarette Chinese Cafe on Melrose Avenue instead. (The  check came to $56; it's on my expenses.) The Mandarette, an unpretentious  corner restaurant featuring home-cooked Chinese food, is one of Beatty's  frequent late-night haunts and neither the waiters nor the other diners paid  much attention to us.  </P> <P> The dinner subject, we decided, would be "Dick Tracy." The movie had barely  come up during the first five hours, but we had just arrived at the restaurant  when he got a telephone call from Madonna. She had just finished a concert in  Toronto where she had performed under the threat of being arrested for lewdness  and she called to tell him about it.  </P> <P> Somehow, the subject of gossip came up again and -- click! -- the tape recorder  was turned off. There followed some marvelously ribald tales of the "here is  what you might have read and here is what actually happened" variety. This was  a double-feature for me; I hadn't even heard some of the rumors that the true  stories were dispelling.  </P> <P> Finally, sometime after 11, on the ride back to the studio and during 30  minutes or so in the parking lot, we got around to discussing what he had in  mind in making "Dick Tracy," a movie that -- whether you like it or not (and I  do) -- will meet Pauline Kael's definition of a "piffle."  </P> <P> "People had come to me over the years with 'Dick Tracy' wanting me to act in  it. I could not imagine doing it because I didn't think I looked like Dick  Tracy. Then I realized nobody looked like him, thank God, and that I could play  him as well as anyone could."  </P> <P> For a long time, "Dick Tracy" was in development at Universal where such  directors as John Landis, Richard Benjamin and Walter Hill had been involved at  one time or another. Landis got Beatty interested in it and years later -- with  Landis out of the picture and Beatty in possession of the rights -- the project  ended up at Disney. It was Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg and his  boss, Michael Eisner, who had originally put "Dick Tracy" into development at  Paramount.  </P> <P> Beatty said he did not want to direct "Dick Tracy," and only decided to do it  after being turned down by so many others, including Bob Fosse and Martin  Scorsese. Scorsese had actually agreed to do it at one time, Beatty said, but  he moved on to some other projects and lost interest.  </P> <P> "Finally, I just said, 'I've got to do this movie now and the way to do it is  to just go ahead (and direct)."  </P> <P> Without admitting that either instance was premeditated, Beatty said he got Al  Pacino to play the part of Tracy's archenemy Big Boy the same way he got his  friend Jack Nicholson to play Eugene O'Neill in "Reds": by asking them for  their advice on who to cast.  </P> <P> First, Nicholson: "I called Jack and said, 'I've got to get an actor to play  Eugene O'Neill and it's got to be somebody who leaves not a shadow of a doubt  that he could take Diane (Keaton) away from me.' He said, 'Well, you have no  choice. There's only one person.' "  </P> <P> Then Pacino: "I saw Al in a restaurant and I said I want to get somebody to  play this part. 'Who's a good idea?' He said, 'Well, let me think about it.' He  called me later in the day and said, 'What are you really thinking about? If  you're really thinking that, why don't you just say it?' I said, 'Well, OK, I'm  really thinking that.' He said, 'Then let's talk.' "  </P> <P> Beatty doesn't spend a lot of energy trying to oversell "Dick Tracy." He said  he did it for fun and it worked out that way. He talks about the fun of  matching Madonna with Stephen Sondheim songs, of watching Al Pacino and the  others chew up his comic book scenery, of the elegance that Dick Van Dyke, who  plays Mayor Fletcher, brought to the set.  </P> <P> But he may soon begin exercising his more serious side. There is that unnamed  project dealing with unnamed social issues, and, of course, his long-planned  biography of Howard Hughes, a man whose appetites for the company of famous  women was, according to the gossip of his day, more than a match for the  appetites of Warren Beatty, according to the gossip of his.  </P> <P> How long can he wait? Beatty is 53 and the subject of rumors that even on "Dick  Tracy" close-ups were reshot by his friendly director to make him look younger.  Not true, he said. "You try to look as good as you can, I guess, but I didn't  reshoot one close-up. I didn't reshoot anything on this picture."  </P> <P> He said his physical condition has often been a point of attack. "When I was  finishing 'Reds,' the story went out that I had gained 70 pounds in the cutting  room. . . . I weigh the same now as when I played high school football. I think  I'm in slightly better shape."  </P> <P> In any event, Beatty isn't in a hurry to meet anyone's expectations except his  own. Sorry, but this life belongs to him.  </P> <P> "There are certain things that had to get done by me and I did some of them.  And there are certain things that I have to get done now and I hope I'll be  able to do them. There are a lot of things in my life that have nothing to do  with movies. . . . There's so much to do and only so much time to do it in."  </P> <P> Or, to put it another way, so many women, so little . . . No, I promised.  </P></p>

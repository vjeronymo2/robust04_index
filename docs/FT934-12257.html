			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Strong Asian demand for Sweden's Dollars 1bn FRN offer THE Kingdom of Sweden's Dollars 1bn offering of global floating rate notes (FRNs) dominated a busy day of issuance in the international bond market. Other issuers were reported to be closely watching Sweden's three-year issue, the first sovereign global FRN offering, with a view to deciding whether to follow suit. Joint lead managers Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan said a significant portion of Sweden's deal had been placed by the end of the day. Strong demand from Asia and the Middle East compensated for a relatively disappointing response from Europe. The notes were kept in syndicate overnight to allow time to place them in the US. The notes, which were priced at the re-offer to yield nine basis points below three-month London interbank offered rate (Libor), are expected to be freed to trade today. Asian investors were also strong buyers of the Dollars 500m five-year Eurobond offering from Urban Mortgage Bank of Sweden, according to lead manager Nomura. UMB is well-known in Japan as a result of its bond issues in the Samurai market, the domestic Japanese bond market for foreign borrowers. The bonds were priced to yield 68 basis points over the when-issued US Treasury due 1998 and the spread remained unchanged during official trading hours. However, some traders said the spread widened to 73 basis points in the after-market. Treasury Corporation of Victoria tapped the pent-up demand for high-yielding Canadian dollar paper with its CDollars 250m offering of 10-year Eurobonds. There has been little new issuance in the EuroCanadian dollar sector in the run-up to Canada's general election. TCV was thought to have swapped the proceeds of the issue into Australian dollars. However, the lack of arbitrage opportunities in the Canadian dollar market might limit further issuance in this sector, syndicate managers said. Volatility in the swaps market was also hampering the first Eurobond issue from Trans Tokyo Bay, the Japanese government-guaranteed agency. The issuer is thought to be looking to raise Dollars 200m through an issue of 10-year Eurobonds and swap the proceeds into yen. IBJ is arranging the deal. Elsewhere, strong international demand enabled Reliance Industries, India's largest private sector company, to increase its six-year Euroconvertible bond issue to Dollars 140m from an original Dollars 125m. Reliance achieved a coupon of 3.50 per cent, at the bottom end of the indicated range of 3.50 to 4 per cent, and a conversion premium of 12.06 per cent, at the top end of the indicated range of 8-12 per cent. Lead manager Morgan Stanley said the issue had been oversubscribed 10 times. The bonds were trading at 106 1/2 -107 1/2 yesterday, well above their issue price of par.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to well-informed sources, who spoke to  AL-BILAD, the existence of "Jordanian Afghans," cannot be ruled  out. But there are only a handful of them. They fled  Afghanistan to Kenya among a group of other Arabs who have  recently sought refuge in Africa.    Led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, an Egyptian medical doctor, this  group is seeking entry into southern Sudan from Kenya.  Al-Zawahiri has been to Nairobi a number of times in an effort  to find a place for Arabs forced to leave Pakistan. Khartoum  has balked at accepting them.    Over the past three months, there has been a mass exodus of  "Arab Afghans" who have taken Pakistan's threats to expel them  seriously.</p>

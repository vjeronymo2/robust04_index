			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Defining politics as "the ability to decide who gets how much of what, when and  where," Congressional Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy (D-D.C.) urged blacks to work  within both major political parties to accomplish their goals rather than  concentrating all their energies and loyalties on one party. Fauntroy, a  non-voting delegate from the District of Columbia, addressed the annual  Southern Christian Leadership Conference during a panel discussion in Atlanta.  "We must adhere to our permanent political principles, not to any permanent  political parties," Fauntroy said.  </P></p>

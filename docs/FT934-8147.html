			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / OFT revokes alarm companies' licences THREE COMPANIES selling burglar alarms lost their consumer credit licences yesterday after complaints about high-pressure selling and customers being frightened into buying. Sir Bryan Carsberg, OFT director-general, said some of the business practices used by the companies were 'abhorrent'. The Office of Fair Trading said Advanced Security Systems (which previously traded as Property Watch UK), as well as Vector Security and Vector Homelinked Security, were not fit to hold the licences. The three companies are all run from the same office in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, and have overlapping directors. The two Vector companies, which turn over a total of about Pounds 3.5m a year, are to appeal. They continue to operate through newspaper advertisements, mail order and for cash. Advanced Security Systems, the only one of the three companies to employ salespeople, closed voluntarily six months ago after the OFT had investigated evidence from Trafford Borough Council's trading standards department following complaints. The OFT said former employees had testified that some sales presentations had been conducted in an atmosphere of fear. It said salespeople would tell potential customers that burglars put chip pans or kettles on the stove to be able to throw boiling fat or water over anyone who disturbed them. It added that newspaper cuttings and photographs of assaulted elderly people and children and vandalised homes were used in selling. Some salespeople were found to have offered householders a security survey which was then used to persuade them to install alarms, the OFT added. Some presentations were dragged out - in one case for more than nine hours - to wear down sales resistance. Mr Alan O'Brien, co-owner and manager of the companies, said yesterday there had been only 26 complaints in more than 11,000 sales over four years. Advanced Security Systems had employed salespeople on a basic wage, plus car, with the bulk of earnings coming from commission. People wanting credit were passed on to an independent and reputable finance company. He had been 'horrified' to hear of 'sales misdemeanours', which he said were confined to 'five or six salesmen only' operating in Greater Manchester. Sales training had never included the methods described by the OFT. The group employed about 100 people at peak but the two Vector operations now have about 25, including installation engineers. No credit is now offered. Mr O'Brien said the companies would appeal 'because although we don't need to sell on credit, we would like the dignity of getting our licences back'.</p>

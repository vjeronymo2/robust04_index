Those disruptions in the telephone lines were caused by  a lack of electricity for the various stations, according to a  company spokesman.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified spokesman in Creole] The  problem was mainly in exchange number 45 which is a channel to  which other satellite exchanges, such as exchange numbers 46,  55, 49, are connected. Whenever this exchange has a problem,  the other exchanges cannot function either.    [Reporter Francois] What kind of problems did exchange  number 45 have?  [Spokesman] It is a secret that no one in the telephone company  has the same difficulties as everyone else because of the  electricity problem in the country. It is a power problem due  to the rapid decay of the company's generators, which are by  definition some spare generators now working an average of  almost 24 hours a day. Therefore the generators get worn out  very quickly and break down easily. We had a problem with the  generator which caused exchange number 45 to break down. This  caused the other exchanges to break down. As soon as the  problem was identified, the technicians spent the night working.    The service was reestablished as quickly as possible and is  working now at almost 100 per cent. [end recording]    [Announcer] The general manager of the telephone company,  Mr.  Pierre Lissade revealed other difficulties that the company is  currently facing: fuel problems, difficulties in purchasing  spare parts. Let us listen to Mr. Pierre Lissade:    [Begin Lissade recording] We do not just have problems with  the exchanges. We also have repairs because we are in the rainy  season. The repair work has increased. If we maintain the  exchanges without keeping up the repair work, the customers will  not pay. We are already struggling to make the service  acceptable since we have great difficulties getting spare parts  and we have a saturation of the exchanges. We are struggling,  however, to maintain acceptable service. We have about $90  million frozen and we must live with the means that we have.  [end recording].</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Observer: Car numbers OK. So Honda's decision to sever its links with Rover might make life more difficult for BMW, Rover's new owner. But don't underestimate what attracted BMW in the first place. Its 3, 5 and 7 series meld perfectly with Rover's 2, 4, 6 and 8 series . . . Sounds like a perfect fit rather than a calculated gamble.</p>

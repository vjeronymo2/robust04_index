			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Arts: A 'Matter' of moment - Concert For the South Bank's 'Meltdown' jamboree, the dire new Butler/Pruslin opera last Wednesday might have been a burn-out. On Sunday, however, it recovered for a sensational finish, with the British premiere of Louis Andriessen's massive De Materie ('Matter'); the determinedly public terms of Andriessen's magnum opus answered ideally to the 'Meltdown' brief - accessible to non-specialist ears, powerful as music-theatre, but still uncompromisingly new. This Dutch composer has just turned 55. Like many another, he passed through serialism to something else, inspired by the example of American minimalists but not much like them. Though his work has enjoyed some currency among even British avant-garde circles - where it made itself noticed by its roots in jazz and 'street music', its abrasive colours and attack, its rigorously formal patterns - it was always caviar to the general. De Materie (1984-88) was conceived, however, almost from the start as a large music-theatre piece, and in 1989 Robert Wilson staged it with eclat. We heard it in the Queen Elizabeth Hall as a concert work. Its four movements stood up admirably as a quasi-symphonic whole, but the Wilson component might have been a bonus; most of the score is big-boned and stark, without chamber finesses, and visible human detail would have filled out its severest spans. For the 'Matter' of its title really invokes the 'materiality' of the human spirit - historical, communal and personal; and Andriessen has used human documents both as blueprints for his structures, pre-planned at 25 minutes each before he wrote the notes, and as texts. The first movement begins with 144 shattering chords from the orchestra (shrill at the top, with dirty snarls far below: very Andriessen) which prove to evoke ship-building in in newly independent, industrious Amsterdam. On the same chords the chorus chants part of the Dutch declaration of independence from Spain (1588), and later a catalogue of ship's-carpentry tools, after a solo tenor delivers a manifesto by an atomist philosopher of the time. The proportions of the second movement, which sets mystical-erotic words from the Seventh Vision of the poetess Hadewijch, are mathematically derived from the dimensions of Rheims Cathedral. The third - 'De Stijl', a gigantic boogie-woogie fantasy - is mapped upon the dimensions of a Mondrian painting. The fourth and last is an elegiac pavane: for a long time nothing but plangent alternating chords, then a lyrical descant on a sonnet by Willem Kloos, and at last Madame Curie's touching messages to her deceased husband. But the heart of the whole sequence lies in the 'Hade-wijch' movement, where Andriessen uses a ballad of his own as cantus firmus for a serenely beautiful construction: a long chorale for vibrato-less strings leads to a rapturous soprano solo (here Susan Narucki) with a sweetly inconsolable close. That, at least, should compete with Gorecki, Tavener and Arvo Part for popularity beyond the 'classical' norm. The whole work, nonetheless, has a gritty, imposing integrity that makes it a kind of landmark amid the current wasteland of uncertain experiments. Reinbert de Leeuw conducted the Asko and Schoenberg Ensembles in it to sure effect.</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS GET CALL AND WIN;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: UMPIRE CHANGES MIND IN NINTH INNING, ENABLING L.A. TO BEAT REDS IN  10TH, 7-6.  </P> <P> In this era of baseball players whose wallets outweigh their hearts, an  interesting thing happened at Riverfront Stadium Friday night.  </P> <P> The Dodgers won in a game decided by a conscience.  </P> <P> Umpire Terry Tata gave the Cincinnati Reds an apparent 7-6 victory in the  bottom of the ninth inning by calling Eric Davis safe on a two-out play at home  plate.  </P> <P> But a split-second later, realizing that Davis had been blocked from the plate  and tagged by Dodger catcher Mike Scioscia, he changed his mind.  </P> <P> And even as the Reds were racing from the dugout in celebration, he changed his  call. His outspread arms returned to his side. A single fist with an  outstretched thumb was raised. Davis was called out, and the game was sent into  extra innings.  </P> <P> After a lengthy disturbance by angry Red Manager Lou Piniella, the resurrected  Dodgers scored in the 10th inning on Alfredo Griffin's two-out single for a 7-6  victory before a crowd of 34,697.  </P> <P> "This game was stolen from us," said Todd Benzinger, the Cincinnati first  baseman whose double had apparently scored Davis.  </P> <P> Piniella said: "The umpire called the runner safe, and all of a sudden, he  changes his mind? I've never seen that in my life, and I've been in major  league baseball since 1969."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had never seen anything like it either, but from a different  perspective.  </P> <P> "It took a lot of courage to do what Terry Tata did," Scioscia said. "A lot of  courage."  </P> <P> Tata said the decision, which he later learned was supported by replays, was  simple.  </P> <P> "My mechanics were screwed up, I called the play too quick," he said. "I  realized the guy never touched the plate, and I changed the call right away.  And as long as I don't wait too long, I can change a call.  </P> <P> "The important thing was, I got it right."  </P> <P> The play developed on Benzinger's two-out double to right field with Paul  O'Neill on second base and Davis on first. O'Neill scored easily to tie the  score at 6-6, but the relay throw from Hubie Brooks to Lenny Harris to Scioscia  stopped Davis.  </P> <P> In winning their season-high sixth straight game, moving within 8 1/2 games of  the National League West-leading Reds while climbing above .500 for the first  time since June 1 with a 34-33 record, the Dodgers displayed some of their own  courage:  </P> <P>  -- Griffin's game-winning line drive to left field came on a one-and-two count  that featured five foul balls against loser Randy Myers, who had not allowed a  run in 19 career appearances against the Dodgers. Griffin's hit followed an  infield single by Eddie Murray and a walk by Mickey Hatcher.  </P> <P>  -- The game was rescued on the pitching mound by rookie Jim Poole in the  bottom of the 10th after Mariano Duncan had hit a one-out single against  reliever Jim Gott.  </P> <P> Poole replaced Gott and, after falling behind Luis Quinones, three and one,  threw two good pitches to strike him out. Poole was so excited, he thought the  game was over and leaped off the mound in exultation. When he came to his  senses, he was replaced by Tim Crews, who earned the save for winner Jay Howell  by retiring Billy Hatcher on a grounder to shortstop Griffin.  </P> <P> "That was totally bush," Poole said of his display. "It was like, 'Oh no. The  rookie has just made a big mistake.' "  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Kirk Gibson claimed ignorance Friday concerning published speculation that he  might soon be traded to an American League team, possibly the Detroit Tigers.  "I don't know anything about any of that," he said. "I have not talked to  (Dodger vice president) Fred Claire in weeks. And I will not speculate on  speculation."  </P> <P> Gibson admitted that he understood why his name would arise. "This time of  year, a lot of people are being scouted, a lot of names are coming up, and you  know my circumstances as well as I do. So I can see why I would be one of those  names." Gibson, who is eligible for free agency after this season, would not  comment on speculation that he would prefer to return to Detroit, where he  played for nine seasons before joining the Dodgers in 1988. "It's not my place  to talk about any of that," he said.  </P> <P> Gibson will be more involved in a trade than most players because the team that  acquires him will need to sign him for a contract extending past this season,  or risk losing him. Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda said he has heard nothing about  an impending Gibson deal. But his concern about the need for a fifth starter,  whom the Dodgers hope to acquire by trading Gibson or another veteran, is well  known.  </P> <P> Gibson said his strained right groin felt better Friday, and he hoped to take  batting practice today, with a return to the lineup by the end of this six-game  trip next week.  </P></p>

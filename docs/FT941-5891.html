			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Heseltine sets out economic manifesto Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterday called for radical new thinking on the roles of the government and the private sector in promoting growth. Delivering the annual Stockton lecture on the theme of obstacles to future prosperity, Mr Heseltine set out what amounted to a personal manifesto on the future of Britain. In a wide-ranging speech, he repeatedly stressed the limits on the powers of government, the crucial role of the private sector, and the constraints on the use of taxation or borrowing to promote investment. He was also critical of bureaucratic over-regulation in the European Union, which he claimed had led to an 'over-protected, over-centralised community suffering from 'Eurosclerosis'. The speech will inevitably be seen as an attempt by Mr Heseltine to keep open the option of a further bid for the Conservative party leadership if Mr John Major, the prime minister, is forced to step down before the next election. Mr Heseltine's endorsement of fiscal conservatism, his stress on the role of the private sector, and criticisms of the EU will appeal to rightwingers who have recently begun to offer him support. Many on the right would prefer to see Mr Heseltine in Downing Street than Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, who is regarded as too interventionist and too sympathetic to the EU. Mr Heseltine's friends have let it be known recently that he remains a candidate for Number 10, in spite of his defeat in the 1990 leadership election and the heart attack he suffered last year. However, Mr Heseltine was careful to offer his support to Mr Major, who he described as 'the first of the European leaders' to seek a solution to the EUs structural problems. His comments also amounted to a stinging rebuke to Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, who is regarded by her supporters as an effective critic of the EU. Mr Heseltine said the world faced great opportunities as a result of the collapse of communism, liberalisation of world trade, and the information technology revolution. But he said 'new techniques and thinking' were required to overcome obstacles to growth.</p>

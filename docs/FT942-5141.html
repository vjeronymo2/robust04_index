			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts (Openings): Royal Court Theatre The Royal family comes to the London stage on Saturday when Sue Townsend's theatrical and updated version of The Queen and I, her novel about a deposed monarchy transplanted to a council estate, arrives in the main auditorium of the Royal Court (previews from tomorrow). Doon Mackichan plays Princess Diana. In the Theatre Upstairs, from Thursday, there is blood, guts, and violence from the Roman playwright Seneca. His Thyestes, adapted here by Caryl Churchill, combines macabre gore and stern moralising.</p>

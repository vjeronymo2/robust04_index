			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Afghans continue fighting to win the peace: Kabul's ruling mujahideen are still beset by the divisiveness that hampered their struggle against the former regime THREE months after taking power, Afghanistan's ruling council has even less control over the countryside than did the government it deposed. The Islamic fundamentalist mujahideen, backed by a military triumvirate, are beset by lawlessness and the same bitter divisiveness that hampered their 14-year struggle for power against the former Moscow-backed regime. Bandits still routinely loot vehicles in the countryside. Night-time sentries in Kabul are as likely to train a grenade launcher at a stranger as simply to ask for identification. Last month, minority Shia and ethnic Pushtun mujahideen fought a five-day battle on the capital's south side leaving more than 100 dead. Recently, radical mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar fired rockets on Kabul, killing 50 people. 'Kabul under the old government controlled 29 provincial capitals and all the major supply routes. What does Kabul now control?' asked an Asian diplomat in Kabul. There are signs of a government trying to begin governing. On Monday - three months after his appointment - the new prime minister, Mr Abdul Saboor Fareed, arrived in Kabul and took his oath of office. The president, Berhannuddin Rabbanni, is also in office, chairing the 51-member ruling civilian council. A campaign has begun to expel armed rebels from the capital. A rise in confidence is suggested by a strengthening of the Afghan currency, which has doubled in value to 650 to the dollar since former President Najibullah fell in April. The regular Friday prayers have become the most democratic arena Afghans have seen for years, with fired-up devotees shouting critical questions at mujahideen leaders standing at the pulpit. However, the impression is of a government plagued by blood feuds and disorder, struggling to transform itself from a guerrilla army. The ruling council appears to be respected by most mujahedin commanders. But power is largely held by a strategic alliance of the former rebel commander, Mr Ahmad Shah Masood, who is defence minister; Mr Abdul Rashid Dostam, a powerful militia general whose defection triggered Mr Najibullah's fall; and General Abdul Momen, the de facto military commander of Kabul. Mr Masood is viewed as the single most powerful person in Kabul. But because Afghan society demands consensus and honour, he must tread lightly. He is said to spend most of his time trying to bridge discord among the various armed ethnic and political groups in the capital. Mr Momen is in charge of an operation intended to rid Kabul of armed mujahideen. Pursuing the assignment with zest, his convoy of tanks has rolled around Kabul, lowering muzzles at obstreperous mujahideen commanders. However, his less than tactful approach upsets some mujahideen. One complained: 'I didn't fight 14 years of jihad (holy war) to be ordered around by a communist.' Mr Dostam is the triumvirate's most controversial member. From the mid-1980s, he commanded a mercenary army which, bankrolled by Mr Najibullah, fought the war's most brutal battles against the mujahideen. When he and Mr Momen defected, Mr Najibullah was finished. The most vocal opponent of Mr Dostam has been the radical leader Mr Hekmatyar, a Pushtun. Mr Fareed's delayed arrival was a result of Mr Hekmatyar's refusal to allow his man in the capital until Mr Dostam's militiamen left. Mr Dostam's departure is unlikely, since Mr Masood probably needs him to hold back Mr Hekmatyar. For now, Mr Hekmatyar, believed to hold a huge arsenal of US and Saudi-supplied weaponry, wanders the countryside in a convoy, biding his time.</p>

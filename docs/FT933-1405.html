			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / University chiefs split on funding THE COMMITTEE of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which represents 102 universities, yesterday failed to agree on a new funding system for higher education which would make graduates pay towards the cost of their tuition. Instead, the university leaders tried to increase pressure on the government by saying that higher education must continue to expand and that a decision on raising extra funds was 'inescapably a political one'. The announcement followed the Labour party's postponement earlier this week of a document on extra university funding and the refusal by Mr John Patten, education secretary, to commit himself to a new source of funding. The vice-chancellors suggested that nobody was prepared to take political responsibility for making students pay. Mr Patten yesterday claimed that Labour's 'entire credibility' over education is at stake following its decision to delay publication of the discussion document. The paper, which was already in the hands of university vice-chancellors, was distributed to journalists by Mr Patten. He said Labour was in 'chaos' over education and called on Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, to resign. Speaking after the committee's annual meeting at Leicester University, Dr Kenneth Edwards, the committee chairman, said: 'If the government is unable to provide sufficient funds for further expansion of higher education, some schemes involving a contribution by students once their earnings have reached an adequate level seems inevitable.' A report by the consultancy London Economics identified four options: a graduate income tax, loans to cover flat-rate tuition fees, loans for living costs, or 'top-up' fees varying between universities.</p>

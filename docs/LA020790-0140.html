			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> IAN LONG PLAYS HERO'S ROLE FOR NEWPORT HARBOR  </P> <P> Center Ian Long made two free throws with one second remaining to give Newport  Harbor High School a 63-62 victory over Saddleback Tuesday night. The outcome  kept his team in a first-place tie with Estancia and Corona del Mar in the Sea  View League with one game remaining.  </P> <P> Long was fouled after grabbing an offensive rebound and his team trailing,  62-61. Long, a 260-pound center who is being recruited by several Division I  colleges to play football, showed he's adept in a pressure situation by calmly  making both shots.  </P> <P> "I couldn't hear while I was shooting," Long said. "When I made the first one,  the pressure was off because I knew the worst we could do was overtime. I knew  if I made the second one, the game was over and I would be the hero."  </P> <P> Saddleback (15-10, 4-5) overcame a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter by  scoring 28 points and held a one-point lead with 12 seconds remaining. Newport  Harbor (17-7, 6-3) missed the front end of four one-and-one free-throw  opportunities in the final two minutes.  </P> <P> "We took a chance and started fouling them in the fourth quarter and it worked  for a while," Saddleback Coach Pat Quinn said. "This game was indicative of our  season."  </P> <P> Reserve Huy Nguyen scored 11 of his 16 points in the second half to lead  Newport Harbor, missing only one shot. Nguyen was the leading scorer and most  valuable player on Newport Harbor's junior varsity team last season.  </P> <P> "Our last four games have been like this," said Bob Sverum, Newport Harbor's  first-year coach. "We tried to give it away, but Ian came through."  </P> <P> In other Sea View League games:  </P> <P> Estancia 53, Tustin 52 -- Torrey Hammond made a 10-foot jump shot with seven  seconds remaining to give Estancia (15-8, 6-3) a come-from-behind victory.  Estancia trailed, 52-49, with 37 seconds remaining when Hammond made two free  throws to cut the deficit to one point. Tustin (18-6, 5-4) called a timeout  with three seconds remaining but Phuong Tran's three-point shot bounced off the  remain at the buzzer.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar 72, University 53 -- Warren Johnson and John Paulson each had 16  points and Jeff Jackson added 10 to lead host Corona del Mar (15-9, 6-3). Klaus  Perwas had 29 points for University.  </P> <P> In the Academy League:  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran 85, St. Michael's 38 -- Brad Pluckhan had 22 points, 10 rebounds  and eight assists and Rob Hasty had 20 points for visiting Cal Lutheran (10-7,  6-3).

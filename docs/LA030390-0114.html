			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE A COMER IN PCS, KAYPRO FILES UNDER CHAPTER 11  </P> <P> Kaypro Corp., once synonymous with portable personal computers but hobbled in  recent years by a long string of misfortunes, has filed for protection under  Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.  </P> <P> The Solana Beach-based firm, which will continue to operate and sell computers,  is a victim of highly competitive market conditions, faulty components that led  to costly warranty repairs and ongoing management problems. Its bankruptcy  filing comes only two weeks after it named management consultant Roy Y.  Salisbury as chief executive.  </P> <P> Buoyed by its once-popular portable Kaypro personal computer, the firm's sales  skyrocketed to $119.6 million in 1984 from $5.5 million in 1982. But it has  since been buffeted severely. Last month, it announced a 1989 loss of $19.4  million on sales of $21.8 million, losses that brought its accumulated deficit  in recent years to $44.1 million.  </P> <P> Kaypro's largest unsecured creditor is founder and Chairman Andrew Kay, who is  owed $7.3 million, according to a preliminary petition filed Thursday in U.S.  Bankruptcy Court in San Diego. As financial problems mounted and banks steered  clear of the company, Kay lent Kaypro cash to pay some of its bills.  </P> <P> Sales of the Kaypro portable computer, which was based on the now-outdated CP/M  operating system, began to erode in the mid-1980s with the rising dominance of  the DOS operating system incorporated in International Business Machines'  personal computers and their clones. Kaypro replaced the old portable with new  models using the DOS system that sold well for a while but failed to make a  profit.  </P> <P> The company is a shadow of its former self, with payroll having been whittled  to 44 employees from 526 as of October, 1987. The company is also considering  subleasing its Stevens Avenue plant and office facility in Solana Beach. Kaypro  also said it is considering having its computers made offshore in the  Netherlands.  </P> <P> New chief Salisbury declined to single out one factor that brought the company  to its current straits. Over the years, the company has cited inventory  writedowns and the high price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for  its problems.  </P> <P> In its bankruptcy court petition, Kaypro gave only a partial listing of  liabilities and assets. The most complete listing available is balance sheet  data filed with Kaypro's fiscal 1989 earnings statement that shows assets of  $5.6 million and liabilities of $21.8 million, said Charles Clark, a consultant  for Kaypro.  </P></p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Exchange rate gains behind rise at BOC BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, reported a 13 per increase in first quarter profits, helped by gains on translation into sterling. The company said that while the increase was in line with expectations, the quarterly comparison would not be indicative of trends during the remainder of the year. Pre-tax profits for the three months to December 31 rose from Pounds 80.1m to Pounds 90.8m on sales up 9 per cent at Pounds 776.8m. Earnings per share rose 11 per cent to 11.81p. Using constant exchange rates, BOC said its operating profit after interest would have increased by only 6 per cent instead of the reported 12 per cent increase to Pounds 89.7m. The health care division improved sharply, with operating profit rising 42 per cent to Pounds 32.5m on sales up 27 per cent at Pounds 152m. BOC said this improvement followed aggressive restructuring, a more regular sales pattern than last year and the benefit of dollar exchange rate movements. In the gases division, operating profit edged ahead from Pounds 72.7m to Pounds 73.8m on sales up 8 per cent to Pounds 545.3m. The increase in operating profit in North America was partly offset by a fall in operating margin and profit in Europe. The company warned that the expiry of the patent protection for Forane anaesthetic pharmaceutical would begin to affect the health care business during the year. Mr Patrick Rich, chairman, said there were few signs of better trading conditions. 'We are fairly optimistic about prospects in the US, but in some parts of the world the conditions deteriorated further during the first quarter.'</p>

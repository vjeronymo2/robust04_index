			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: MOST INNOCENT OF MEDICINES COULD IMPAIR MOTORIST  </P> <P> The officer was convinced the elderly woman who had run off the side of the  road was drunk. She couldn't walk a straight line, her speech was garbled and  she seemed confused. He arrested her on a charge of DWI (driving while  impaired) and took her in for a breath test.  </P> <P> To everyone's surprise she passed the test with flying colors -- no alcohol in  her system. But she was still impaired, not from illicit drugs, but from the  medicine her doctor had prescribed, a combination of a nerve pill and an  antidepressant.  </P> <P> Millions of people who would never think of drinking and driving are out on the  roads endangering themselves and others because of something as simple as an  over-the-counter (OTC) allergy medicine or cold remedy.  </P> <P> Law enforcement agencies in this country are finally beginning to recognize  this problem. In California police can pull you over for "driving under the  influence" even if you haven't had a drop of alcohol. Physicians, pharmacists  and patients have generally underestimated the impact of both prescription and  OTC medications on motor coordination and driving ability. Many people confuse  impairment with drowsiness. But it may be difficult to tell when you are  impaired.  </P> <P> Someone who has had a few beers may feel all right and still be a hazard behind  the wheel. Equally, an older person who takes flurazepam (Dalmane) to get to  sleep may not realize she is weaving in traffic the next day.  </P> <P> A Dutch study found that the antidepressant amitriptyline (Elavil) at normal  doses "had a more detrimental effect on driving performance than the  intoxicating dosage of alcohol."  </P> <P> In another test, police officers who took a therapeutic dose of the popular  anti-anxiety agent diazepam (Valium) had difficulty keeping their cars in the  proper lane.  </P> <P> How can you tell if your medicine will affect your driving ability?  Unfortunately, warnings about this problem are often buried in the fine print  on the package of an OTC medication. Many consumers overlook cautions and  warnings or fail to take them seriously.  </P> <P> Many prescription antianxiety agents and antidepressants have warnings to avoid  driving, but doctors may sometimes fail to impress their patients with the  danger.  </P> <P> Before you get in your car, review every medication you take.  </P></p>

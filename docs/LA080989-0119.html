			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ROSE ACCUSER ADMITS GIVING INFORMATION TO FEDS ON TAX EVASION  </P> <P> One of Pete Rose's chief accusers in baseball's gambling probe said today that  he has given federal investigators testimony directly linking the Cincinnati  manager to a conspiracy to evade income taxes.  </P> <P> Paul G. Janszen, his voice cracking at times and tears welling in his eyes  during a news conference, repeated many of the allegations against Rose, who is  accused of betting on his own team.  </P> <P> For the first time, Janszen acknowledged providing FBI and Internal Revenue  Service agents information that could subject Rose to an indictment for  allegedly conspiring to defraud the U.S. government.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Columbus, Ohio, legal maneuvering continued as baseball's lawyers  asked a federal judge to compel Rose lawyer Roger J. Makley to answer questions  regarding Rose's legal defense.  </P> <P> Janszen, who claims to have run Rose's bets to bookmakers:  </P> <P> * Said he saw documents indicating that Rose bet on baseball throughout the  1988 season.  </P> <P> * Denied he prompted baseball's investigation, saying he was contacted by the  commissioner's office after someone else gave information.  </P> <P> * Repeated that Rose never, to Janszen's knowledge, became involved in cocaine  deals, despite allegedly asking how much he could make on them.  </P> <P> * Repeated that Reds pitcher John Franco knew about Rose's debts with a Staten  Island bookmaker nicknamed Val.  </P> <P> * Said other Reds players, whom he would not identify, knew of Rose's alleged  gambling before charges became public.  </P> <P> * Said Rose lawyer Rueven J. Katz knew of the alleged gambling problems as  early as March, 1988.  </P> <P> Janszen served four months in a halfway house after pleading guilty to  falsifying his 1985 federal income tax return and failing to report income from  steroid sales.  </P> <P> "I don't know if he'll ever understand it, but in a weird way, I feel I'm  helping him," Janszen said. "If I have one regret, that regret is that I was  not man enough to walk up to Pete Rose . . . to say to him: 'That's it. No  more.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Gonna Get Me'  </P> <P> Janszen said that each time he brought up the dangers to Rose, the Reds manager  said: "They're not gonna get me. They can't get me. I have good attorneys."  </P> <P> Rose has said that when he learned Janszen was involved in drug-dealing, he  stopped associating with him. Janszen denied that, saying: "Pete Rose knew that  from the beginning."  </P> <P> Janszen, who began cooperating with the government in March, 1988, and with  baseball this February, claimed Rose's alleged gambling was well known in the  Reds clubhouse.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of players who probably knew, and I knew of some that had direct  knowledge of what was going on," he said. "It's kind of difficult for them to  step forward, don't you think, to take Paul Janszen's side against the Reds."  </P></p>

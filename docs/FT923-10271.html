			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: General Dynamics to axe 5,800 jobs GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor, plans to cut around 5,800 jobs at its Fort Worth, Texas, division by the end of 1994, writes our Financial Staff. The company said yesterday the cuts were a response to falling defence expenditures and a drop in the production rates of its F-16 fighter aircraft. The Fort Worth division currently employs around 20,000 people. Production rates for the F-16 were up to 30 a month at one stage, but are now down to 16 a month. General Dynamics - where Mr Warren Buffett, the investor, has just acquired a 14.9 per cent stake - has been contracting its business generally recently. It has been selling certain operations, such as its Cessna jet division, reducing capital expenditures and buying in its own shares.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aydyn Mekhtiyev report under the "Diplomacy" rubric: </F> "Russian Peacekeeping Is Not for Baku. Ankara Is Still Against  Equal Responsibility Principle"]    [Excerpt] Parliamentary hearings held in Baku 22 April  were devoted to a discussion of a new variant of the Russian  plan for a peaceful settlement of the Armenia-Azerbaijan  conflict. Although no final decision on the question being  discussed was made, the view of the majority of parliamentarians  was one: the document presented by Russia does not defend the  sovereign rights of Azerbaijan while, as one of the speakers  stated, "it actually reserves for the Armenian side the right to  continue the occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's  territory." It is well known that should the Russian plan be  approved, the Azeri Army would have to retreat 10 to 20 km from  currently held positions, which would then mean leaving 35  percent of the country's territory out of the Azeri Government's  control. Naturally, Baku officials affirm the unacceptability  of such an approach to resolving the conflict. President Geydar  Aliyev thinks that so far Moscow is not holding a sufficiently  principled posture in the matter of settling the problem. He  made such a remark while meeting in Baku on 23 April with Sergey  Baburin, coordinator of the "Russian Path" deputy group, who  arrived there in the capacity of Russian Federation State Duma  delegation head.    The unanimity with which the parliamentarians and the  republic's government reject the Russian peace plan in its  present variant is primarily attributed to fears about  introducing Russian troops to Azerbaijan territory. The men in  Baku think that the very presence of Russian troops in the  region of conflict would hardly secure a stable cease-fire. The  republic's diplomatic circles believe that the persistence with  which Moscow proposes that the peace plan be approved is  dictated first and foremost by the desire to take over complete  control of the Azerbaijan-Turkey border, restoring thereby its  military control over this Transcaucasus republic. Naturally,  not only Azerbaijan but also neighboring Iran and Turkey do not  conceal their worry over this kind of preparations by Moscow.  [passage omitted]</p>

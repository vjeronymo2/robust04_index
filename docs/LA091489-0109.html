			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MAYOR UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> LEGAL ISSUES;  </P> <P> IN OPTING FOR CIVIL ACTION, HAHN CHOOSES TO FOLLOW WELL-WORN PROSECUTORIAL PATH  </P> <P> In deciding to take civil, rather than criminal, action against the mayor for  failing to accurately disclose his personal investments, City Atty. James K.  Hahn on Wednesday took a relatively well-worn prosecutorial path.  </P> <P> Violations of the California law requiring officials to disclose their economic  interests in publicly available documents are almost never the source of  criminal action.  </P> <P> In Mayor Tom Bradley's case, the civil action could lead to fines in excess of  $200,000.  </P> <P> Hahn also took a conservative route in deciding not to pursue criminal or civil  conflict-of-interest charges against Bradley in the case of Far East Bank,  which employed the mayor as its $18,000-a-year special adviser while serving as  a repository of city funds.  </P> <P> Hahn said the chief obstacle to a prosecution in the Far East case was that the  key witnesses -- namely Bradley and City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg -- denied  that the mayor brought any pressure to bear on Rittenberg or other city  officials on behalf of the bank.  </P> <P> Hahn said "it is apparent" that a telephone call from Bradley "did influence"  the treasurer to deposit $2 million with the bank. But he said he could not  prove that the mayor "intended that influence" -- an element that is required  to prove a conflict-of-interest law violation.  </P> <P> The conflict-of-interest law states: "No public official . . . shall in any way  attempt to use his official position to influence a governmental decision in  which he knows or has reason to know he has a financial interest."  </P> <P> Violation of the law -- part of the same 1974 Political Reform Act that  requires officials to disclose their economic interests -- places officials at  risk of either criminal or civil liability.  </P> <P> Hahn said Bradley clearly had a financial interest within the meaning of the  law. But he said the mayor and the treasurer both related in extensive  interviews that the mayor had only asked about the treasurer's relationship  with the bank and had not tried to influence the treasurer to place deposits  there.  </P> <P> Making a criminal case without direct evidence of the mayor's intent to  influence the treasurer would have been a tough sell to a jury, and one that no  prosecutor would relish.  </P> <P> "That is not to say that there is 'no evidence' of wrongdoing," Hahn said in  the report, "but it is only to say that, given applicable standards of proof,  insufficient evidence exists to prove a violation of law."  </P> <P> Making a civil case would have been easier because the civil standard of "clear  and convincing" proof is less rigorous than the criminal standard of proof  beyond a reasonable doubt.  </P> <P> However, Hahn said he concluded that there was insufficient evidence even for a  civil suit in the Far East case.  </P> <P> Said an aide, Deputy City Atty. Edmund Fimbres: "It would have been unethical  to file charges unless there was a reasonable possibility of conviction. . . .  There was no reasonable possibility -- criminally or civilly."  </P> <P> Fimbres, a member of the city attorney's Bradley investigative team, said this  view was held by each of the five lawyers in the group.  </P> <P> Although Hahn's decision not to file criminal charges against the mayor was  earlier reported by The Times and surprised no one, some prosecutors who were  not involved in the case said they were taken aback by his decision not to file  a civil conflict-of-interest lawsuit in the Far East case.  </P> <P> "In civil cases, you just cock your head and say, 'something's not right here,'  " said one experienced prosecutor, referring to the easier standard of proof in  such cases. "It seems to me that the evidence (of a conflict-of-interest law  violation) is sufficient -- just looking at what I've read in the newspaper. I  just don't understand them overlooking what seems so obvious on its face."  </P> <P> This prosecutor spoke on condition that he not be identified.  </P> <P> Others said they regarded Hahn's decision as one that might have gone either  way.  </P> <P> "I think it's a close question," said Robert M. Stern, former general counsel  of the state Fair Political Practices Commission.  </P> <P> Still others were reluctant to comment at all. "It's hard for somebody who is  not either there or very well informed . . . to be confident in second-guessing  the city attorney," said UCLA law professor Daniel Lowenstein, principal author  of the Political Reform Act.  </P> <P> Lowenstein, Stern and other prosecutors all noted that such cases often turn on  nuances.  </P> <P> What is clearest is that a prosecutor has wide discretion in deciding whether  to pursue such litigation.  </P> <P> Hahn referred to this when he said, "The mayor clearly stepped into that gray  area of the law between factual innocence and a chargeable offense."  </P> <P> In deciding to pursue a civil suit, rather than a misdemeanor criminal charge  against the mayor for failure to disclose all of his investments, standards of  proof also came into play.  </P> <P> Fimbres said the office decided that it could not prove that the mayor intended  to deceive anyone -- a necessary component of the criminal charge.  </P> <P> By proceeding civilly, the city attorney needs to prove only that the mayor  omitted six of his substantial investments in stocks and bonds through  negligence.  </P> <P> This is expected to be relatively easy to show since it was the mayor's  personal practice to prepare his own disclosure statements.  </P> <P> The mayor amended his statements last August to include the six investments.  </P> <P> Although the amendments came under pressure -- they were made in the midst of  inquiries from the state Fair Political Practices Commission -- prosecutors  said they were inclined to view them nonetheless as factors indicating that  Bradley lacked criminal intent.  </P> <P> Omissions from economic disclosure statements are routinely referred to the  Fair Political Practices Commission, which typically holds administrative  proceedings in pursuit of $2,000-per-violation fines, and sometimes files civil  suits.  </P> <P> It is unusual, although far from unprecedented, for a city attorney to file a  civil suit for non-disclosure, and in doing do, Hahn trod a middle ground.  </P> <P> Rather than cite the section of the law that carries $2,000 fines, Hahn relied  on a section that requires the official to pay fines matching the amount of the  investments he failed to report.  </P> <P> In Bradley's case, the Hahn aide said, he did not know what the mayor's total  exposure might be, because Bradley's investments are disclosed only in dollar  ranges, such as $10,000 to $100,000. However, the aide said the mayor could be  liable for fines of more than $200,000 for the six omissions cited in the suit.  </P> <P> A Times review of Bradley's amended statements of economic interest showed more  than 100 errors in reporting items that could be worth $2.2 million.  </P> <P> Hahn said that he was referring his report to other agencies -- including the  district attorney's office and the state attorney general's office -- that  could also file charges in the case.  </P> <P> However, charges by other agencies appear unlikely.  </P> <P> "We're going to have somebody read the report, but I don't expect anything to  happen," said a prosecutor in the district attorney's office, who asked not to  be named.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office has responsibility for filing felony charges.  The city attorney's office handles misdemeanors.  </P></p>

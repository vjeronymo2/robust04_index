			<p>BFN     [Text] Ventersdorp June 7 SAPA -- The Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] would have to  continue its struggle "and even intensify it" following the  rejection of the AWB's request for amnesty for right-wingers  sentenced or awaiting trial, the AWB executive council said on  Tuesday. The council was reacting to amnesty legislation  announced by Justice Minister Dullah Omar on Tuesday.    It said in a statement the AWB had extended a hand in a  "reasonable attempt to bring about peace in our beloved  country". "We offered to call a halt to our struggle pending  negotiations on a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] if they showed  good faith by granting unilateral amnesty for all rightists,  those sentenced and awaiting trial. This is, however, clearly  excluded in Mr Omar's statement. It is now apparent to us they  are not interested in the hand extended to them. They have  treated our offer with contempt and have rejected it out of  hand," the statement said.    It added: "The rejection of our reasonable offer means that  our struggle must continue and even intensify."</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 21  February carries two reports on the response to possible  terrorist threats by foreign embassies, particularly the U.S.  Embassy.    The first report, written by Khalid Dawud, appears on pages  5-8. The 3,000-word report has a compound headline: "ROSE  AL-YUSUF Uncovers Secret Meetings of the Foreign Communities;  U.S. Security Patrols To Protect 12,000 Americans From  Extremists; A Meeting in the UK Embassy: The British Did Not  Panic; The German Embassy: Translating the Extremist Statements  So That the Germans May Decide for Themselves; The French  Embassy: These Are Internal Affairs."    Beneath the headlines, the magazine publishes two miniature,  mostly unintelligible, photocopies of presumed U.S. Embassy  documents. The first it describes as "security instructions  issued by the U.S. Embassy Security Office to the members of the  community." The other, on which the words "USIS Cairo" is  discernible in boldface, is described as "an invitation by the  U.S. Embassy for a meeting of the U.S. community and journalists  to discuss the statement issued by the extremists."    The reports start out by saying:    "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo has convened two meetings of the  U.S. community in Cairo to ask them to raise their security  awareness and remain alert because `the situation may change.'    "The first meeting was held at the embassy headquarters in  Garden City last Sunday. The second was held at the American  School in al- Ma'adi on Tuesday amid strict security measures  and with a request by officials of the Embassy Media Office that  nothing be published about what takes place in these meetings.    "What is peculiar is that the number of Americans who cared  to attend the first embassy meetings did not exceed 50-60  people. This means that the embassy is more afraid than the  community. Furthermore, many of those who came to the meeting  were journalists who were eager to get a briefing about the  situation.    "U.S. Embassy Security Official Robert O'Brien, who headed  the meeting, said: `This place is safe to live in, but this  situation may be about to change.' Despite his assurances that  the embassy does not advise U.S. nationals to leave Egypt or not  to visit it, he pointed to the seriousness of the three recent  terrorist statements, signed by the Islamic Group-Egypt."    The report summarizes the statements recently issued by the  Islamic Group and goes back to the remarks made to the U.S.  community by the U.S. Embassy security official, this time  identified as "O'Brien Lee."    It says that the U.S. official "expressed particular concern  over the second statement by the Islamic Group, `because it was  the most specific' regarding the threat against foreigners."    The U.S. official added "that they (the terrorists) will not  have any credibility unless they carry out their threats, which  is particularly worrying."    The report cites the U.S. official as warning U.S. nationals  to be alert to changes in their environment, avoid calling  attention to themselves, and alter their daily routines.    The report says: "The meeting also brought the revelation  that the Americans, even prior to the latest terrorist threats,  were running `vehicled patrols' involving 11 roving cars  carrying patrols of U.S. security men in al-Ma'adi and downtown."    The report then discusses the reactions of the UK, German,  and French Embassies to the threat.    UK Press Spokesman Martin Day is cited as saying that, "Of  course, these threats have to be taken very seriously." Day  notes that a meeting of representatives of the UK community in  Egypt was held "last week." The purpose of that meeting was "to  inform the community of the content of the recent statements by  the extremists." The report cites Day as saying that "most  community members have not yet panicked because they know that  the situation so far is reassuring."    Moving on to the German reaction, the report says that "a  German Embassy employee said that what is going on now is a `fax  war' and that this is part of a clear strategy that the  [extremist] groups are following to cause panic." German  Embassy officials have met German teachers and businessmen  living in Egypt to brief them on the latest developments. The  embassy also translated the extremists' statements and provided  the community with it so that "they can decide for themselves  what has to be done," the report notes.    The report then says that the French Embassy, caring for a  community of 5,000 French nationals, remains "the most reserved"  of all embassies. A press spokesman for that embassy expressed  a desire "not to comment on Egyptian domestic affairs." The  report cites the spokeswoman that "even if meetings were held of  the French community, this would be an internal matter." The  report cites, without elaboration, that "similar instructions"  have been issued by the Italian Embassy.    The report concludes by saying: "The atmosphere in the  foreign embassies and communities is one of wait and see.  Either the security forces will succeed in their daunting task  of eradicating terror, or the terrorists will manage to stage  renewed attacks. Any operations, small or big, will simply  cause panic and instability, a matter that will harm the  ordinary people even more than the government."    A 1,300-word unattributed report entitled "How is the  Protection of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo Organized?" appears on  page 8 of the same 21 February issues of the Cairo weekly  magazine ROSE AL-YUSUF. The report begins with a description of  the U.S. Embassy's security arrangements:    "The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is open for only five days a  week.  But the Regional Security Office, located on the sixth floor of  the ugly cement building, is manned 24 hours a day by 30 Marines  and 300 Egyptian security men, who are positioned in various  parts of the embassy.    "Not all the Americans working at the embassy are equal.  This is particularly true for those who are allowed to move  between the ninth and 15th floor of the new cement building,  where the most important embassy offices are located, including  the yet empty ambassador's office, still waiting for the new  ambassador.    "The Security Office is responsible for the following:  contacting Egyptian police and other security organs; providing  advice to the ambassador on all matters of security; providing  protection to all distinguished U.S. visitors; making  investigations on behalf of U.S. legal authorities on background  matters; making investigations into matters of terrorism, crime,  and espionage; supervising the embassy's local 300-strong  security force; running the security and alarm systems at the  embassy; supervising the Marines; providing information about  the security background of the employees and their revenue  ['a'idatihim; a possible misprint of 'a'ilatihim, meaning  families]; supervising the emergency plan in the event that the  embassy is in danger; protecting all classified material;  supervising security arrangements for U.S. residential quarters;  and providing information for the U.S. business community on  security-related matters, an effort coordinated by the U.S.  State Department."    The report then notes that the Marine unit in the embassy is  "one of the largest in the world" and that its personnel "are  stationed in eight different positions in various parts of the  embassy and at the gates."    The local security force, however, is responsible for  protecting the main embassy gates and the residential quarters,  and runs 11 car patrols in al-Ma'adi and the downtown areas  around the clock.    The report notes that the Security Office has four stages of  alert--white, yellow, orange, and red--corresponding to the  intensity of the danger involved. The report says that "the  embassy advises everyone to be on yellow alert."    The report then cites the U.S. State Department's travel  advisory about Egypt and concludes by saying that "the U.S.  Embassy in Cairo has asked U.S. nationals visiting Egypt or  residing in the country to raise their security alertness and to  avoid calling unnecessary attention to themselves or their  activities."</p>

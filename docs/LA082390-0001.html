			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> YOUR HOME MAY BE THEIR CASTLE, TOO;  </P> <P> COEXISTING WITH WILDLIFE JUST A MATTER OF TOLERANCE  </P> <P> Although the ubiquitous Southern California bulldozers chase many critters away  forever, other wild animals stay on, somehow managing to survive, even thrive.  In fact, most of the survivors, while retaining their wildness, also learn to  take advantage of living close to man.  </P> <P> Skunks often nest in basements, even between walls, and rattlesnakes rest under  plants or on rocks in the back yard. Raccoons sneak in through cat doors and  snack on feline food, while coyotes make meals of the felines themselves.  </P> <P> Reactions of human co-habitants range from "Oh, how cute, let's feed it" to  fright, horror -- even lethal action. The reactions depend not only on the  sentiments of the people involved, but also the species of wildlife.  </P> <P> Some creatures, such as rattlesnakes, almost always evoke a negative response,  while others elicit mixed or sympathetic feelings. Many of the species regarded  as nuisances are the very ones that thrive in our midst.  </P> <P> "Coyotes, raccoons, skunks, starlings, sparrows and pigeons are preadapted to  man-modified habitats," says Douglas Bolger, a graduate student in biology at  UC San Diego. "They have evolved in an environment like that created by man."  </P> <P> Although few people yearn for a world without wild animals, most city folks  don't know what to do when confronted with rabbits in the ranunculus or bats in  the belfry. Guided by common sense and tolerance, most North County residents  can peacefully coexist with the remaining wild creatures.  </P> <P> "For the past four years, the Humane Society of the United States has been  conducting seminars on humane solutions to problems with urban wildlife," said  John Grandy, the society's vice president for wildlife. "The seminars have  become remarkably popular, because everyone has problems."  </P> <P> The Humane Society will publish a book on the subject this fall. In the  meantime, Grandy and local experts have both philosophical and practical  advice.  </P> <P> "We first try to impart tolerance, since many of the problems are attitudinal,"  Grandy said. "People, like the king of England, think their home, including  their yard, is their castle -- where they have the inalienable right to do  whatever they want. They want to plant corn in the middle of a family of  raccoons and not have the raccoons eat it."  </P> <P> Instead, he recommends that people learn to think like the animal they're  trying to control and look for compassionate solutions.  </P> <P> "The first reaction does not have to be lethal," Grandy said. "That should be a  last resort."  </P> <P> Project Wildlife, a rescue group, is often called when a wild animal appears at  the patio window. Volunteers such as Ray West, the group's education chairman  and vice president for communications, will first ask if pet food is left  outside overnight.  </P> <P> "That's usually the key," he said. "Almost all these animals are nocturnal and  forage for food after dark. If they find an easy source, they come and get it.  The answer then is not to leave the pet food out."  </P> <P> The critter in question will quickly realize this source of food has dried up  and search elsewhere. People who deliberately feed wild animals cause even more  problems, he said.  </P> <P> "The animals become dependent," West said. "This may even cost a young animal,  one which is learning its hunting skills, the opportunity to develop."  </P> <P> The feeding usually backfires because the animals hang around and become bolder  than normal. A Poway family discovered this phenomenon after watching a coyote  give birth. Fascinated by the daily drama as the mother raised her young, they  started putting out food. They were less fascinated when the grown litter began  showing up on their lawn in broad daylight, looking for food.  </P> <P> The family contacted the city of Poway, which in turn called in an  extermination company. The company recommended that the coyotes be captured in  leg-hold traps and shot. Project Wildlife rescuers persuaded the city that far  better alternatives existed. Their advice: If the family stopped feeding the  coyotes, the coyotes would go away. This common-sense, humane solution solved  the problem in less than two months.  </P> <P> "Just as we discourage people from feeding wild animals, we also discourage  them from taking animals out of the wild and trying to raise them," West said.  "For one thing, each species needs a specific diet. Also, if an animal becomes  imprinted on people, it can never safely be returned to the wild."  </P> <P> Like all the rescue groups in the county, Project Wildlife rehabilitates sick,  young and injured animals with the goal of returning them to the wild. But  sometimes that is impossible. How can a barn owl -- captured as a baby and fed  a steady diet of bologna, bacon and hamburger -- be released? Malnutrition  permanently deformed its talons and feet and left it unable to hunt, or even  perch. What about the bobcat that was neutered and declawed and lived in an  apartment? It now exists in a limbo somewhere between tame and wild.  </P> <P> There is also the opposite reaction to contact with wild animals. Instead of  wanting to take animals home, some people simply want to kill them. A  surprising number of the animals that rescue groups encounter have been shot,  poisoned or otherwise deliberately hurt.  </P> <P> Most people, however, are willing to do anything within reason to get along  with their wild neighbors. Diana Aguirre of Wildlife Center has a number of  suggestions for controlling "nuisance" animals:  </P> <P> * For skunks nesting under a house, install a one-way dog door, so the skunk  can get out but not back in. In the meantime, close up all other openings.  </P> <P> * To keep birds and other creatures out of a chimney, cover the top of the  chimney with a chimney cap.  </P> <P> * To prevent birds from crashing into plate-glass windows, put up hawk  silhouettes to scare them away.  </P> <P> * Keep cats inside, especially at night, so they don't become easy prey for  coyotes.  </P> <P> (This will also save small, wild creatures from felines. Bolger says the  usually dynamic relationship between prey and predator is upset by what he  calls a "subsidized predator," one that is fed by humans and can kill wildlife  at its leisure.)  </P> <P> * Put fiberglass or metal strips around trees so opossums cannot climb up and  eat the fruit.  </P> <P> * Put up small fences or wrap chicken wire around stakes pounded into the  ground to keep rabbits from devouring a garden.  </P> <P> * If pigeons and starlings befoul cars parked under trees, either park  elsewhere or trim trees in late fall. "Trimming at that time will make the  trees less habitable for the birds during nesting season," said Aguirre. Also,  it's better for the trees themselves, because they're dormant at that time.  </P> <P> While pigeons and starlings may be an irritant, few creatures evoke the fear  and dread that rattlesnakes and bats do. In San Diego, they also have a few  fierce and knowledgeable defenders.  </P> <P> Contrary to popular opinion, rattlesnakes (the only indigenous poisonous snake  in the county) present only a minor problem, said Richard Plock, president of  the Herpetological Society of San Diego. Even when bitten, most people recover  completely if they receive prompt treatment. About 10 people die a year from  snakebites in the United States, and most were either handling or otherwise  fooling around with the snakes, according to Plock.  </P> <P> "Some people think that all rattlesnakes want to do is lie in wait and bite,  but that's not true," he said. "The only reason a snake strikes is because it  feels trapped or that it is being attacked. Given the opportunity, it will get  away from people."  </P> <P> When residents find rattlesnakes in their yards, Plock said, they should either  leave them alone -- on the assumption they are only resting and will move along  if allowed an escape route -- or follow this procedure: Turn a large garbage  can on its side, push or chase the snake into the can with a long broom, place  the cover on the can and release the snake elsewhere.  </P> <P> Rattlesnakes play a beneficial role in nature, but they are often killed by  people who come upon them, along with other helpful, nonpoisonous snakes that  are mistaken for rattlers. Plock says gopher snakes (which help control the  rodent population, as do rattlesnakes) are most often the victims of mistaken  identity.  </P> <P> Bats also have their defenders, such as Martin Schuler, one of a small group of  volunteers involved in the San Diego Bat Conservation group.  </P> <P> "It's important to understand that bats have a place in the scheme of things,"  Schuler said. "They eat 500 to 600 insects in an hour and consume five or six  times their body weight in one night."  </P> <P> He cites two reasons for fear of bats: rabies and misunderstanding. At dusk,  when bats come out to feed, they swoop down to catch insects. People sitting  around a campfire or on their porch swing often assume the darting creatures  are after them, not bugs.  </P> <P> "As for the fear of rabies, people need to know that if they find any kind of  dead or sick animal, they should leave it alone," said Schuler, who has studied  bats for 20 years. "If you find a nocturnal animal crawling around during the  day, it's important to realize that that's abnormal behavior and that the  animal is probably sick or hurt. Any wild animal which will allow people to  come near it or to touch it has something wrong with it."  </P> <P> The group's volunteers will pick up grounded bats and give advice on getting  them out of spaces where they're not wanted. They will also advise people on  how to attract bats and their insect-controlling skills.  </P> <P> "People who have bats around say they have no insects," Schuler said. "People  who have lots of insects around may want to try to attract bats by putting up  bat houses."  </P> <P> Still, most people are more interested in controlling wildlife than attracting  it. In the vast majority of cases, this can be accomplished by taking care not  to create a desirable habitat for an undesirable species. The last non-lethal  resort should be humane trapping, wildlife advocates say. Although the Humane  Society and other animal welfare groups discourage trapping and the relocation  of wildlife, sometimes no alternative exists.  </P> <P> A variety of cage or box traps, such as those used to capture feral cats, are  available. Typically, these are designed so that a trap door closes as soon as  the animal enters the chamber. The Humane Society recommends that animals be  released within their home range if at all possible.  </P> <P> Humane trapping is one of the methods used by Critter Control, a national  company with offices in San Diego County. While most pest-management companies  still rely on extermination, Critter Control uses ecologically sound methods  whenever possible.  </P> <P> Critter Control's Jim Byers said the company was started several years ago,  partly in response to budget cuts that curtailed state and local governments'  abilities to deal with wildlife complaints. Besides removing animals, Critter  Control repairs damage and installs devices such as chimney caps to keep  wildlife from returning.  </P> <P> Attitude changes advocated by the Humane Society's Grandy could make trapping  even less necessary.  </P> <P> "To me, it's more important to have animals than a picture-perfect yard," said  Grandy. "The alternative is sterility, life without the song of a bird and the  yip of a coyote."  </P> <P> He notes that there is very little left in Southern California that could be  called natural and asks if "freeways, pollution and pesticides are natural?"  </P> <P> To keep what remains wild and natural, humans must create corridors for  wildlife, said Ted Case, a biology professor at UCSD. Isolating wildlife in  fragmented canyons has caused extinction, he said. "In order to preserve what's  left, we shouldn't just be setting aside little pieces; we need to leave  connections."  </P> <P> Barbara Bamberger, conservation coordinator for the Sierra Club, says it is not  too late to create such wild corridors in North County. The alternative is the  loss of an increasing number of species.  </P> <P> "Species become extinct before we even know what effect their loss will have,"  Bamberger said. "It's like the human body -- when you take away an arm, the  body still works, but not as well."  </P></p>

(SNARK) -- The highest danger  faced by Georgia today is radicalization of political forces in  the republic, declared at a press-conference today Zurab  Zhvania, the general secretary of the most influential party  Georgian Civil Union. He spoke against all kinds of "street  actions" as forms of political struggle.    Representative of the party, founded by Eduard  Shevardnadze's initiative, stated that demonstrations and  meetings may ultimately result in creation of absolutely  different forces which may attempt to revive old communist  principles in the country. Therefore the oppositional parties  and the Civil Union have to join their efforts in construction  of a free and powerful Georgia, emphasized Zurab Zhvania.</p>

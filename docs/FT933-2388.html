			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Fashion: A crash course in fashion on a grant - Sasha Jensen, a third year at Warwick University, offers some tips for first-time students on looking good on a tight budget IF YOU have won a place at university this October the words budget, budget and budget will probably be echoing in your head. This is, after all, probably the first time you will be officially in charge of your own life. Apart from the precious pounds you will spend on books, accommodation and food, there is the matter of your wardrobe. Clothes should be suitable for the life you lead - and student life normally consists of going to and from lectures, playing lots of sport and socialising in any and every pub you can find. Thus you need to find some cheap but good-quality buys that will stand you in good stead during your stay in academia. The essentials are jumpers, jackets, track suits, tops, a decent pair of shoes and some jeans - and you ought to be able to find all this for a maximum of Pounds 100. Marks and Spencer is an excellent first stop for the bargains essential to every budget-conscious student. The M &amp; S unisex 'warmhandle' shirt (Pounds 29.95) is a thick, brushed cotton shirt which will keep the cold air away on a wind-swept campus. It comes in red, black or a colourful Mexican-style stripe. To match this there are jeans for men and women for Pounds 19.99 available in all colours. Its lycra-jodhpurs (Pounds 19.99) are the basis of many a female student wardrobe as they can be teamed with almost anything: the unisex M &amp; S T-shirt (Pounds 7.99) or a round-neck ribbed top at Pounds 13.99 which comes in black, white or lime. Look out also for a nice patterned wool/silk-mix jumper (Pounds 35) in colours such as cream, lime and peach. Young women heading straight for the disco after lectures should snap up the M &amp; S crushed velvet, suede-look leggings - they are stunning in dark brown, beige and black (Pounds 19.99) and would match the wool/silk jumper or the arrow cuff and collar shirt (Pounds 19.99) which comes in white or blue. The menswear department is always worth looking through - best buys I spotted include striped rugby tops for Pounds 19.99 or a good black and red checked shirt at Pounds 25. To see you through three years you will need good quality shoes. For girls there is the classic leather penny loafer in black or red-brown at a reasonable Pounds 25.99, or the more dressy but less practical suede loafer with a slight heel (Pounds 25). Boys could step out in M &amp; S's heavy work-boots (Pounds 45), loafers in black and brown (Pounds 29.95) and a reliable brogue at Pounds 29.95. A really warm coat is vital. M &amp; S has two types of fleece jacket which will shelter you from colds, flu and bankruptcy: a navy blue zip-jacket with checked collar at a mere Pounds 35 or a blue and green check jacket which zips at the front at the same price. All students should make their way to a Levis store - a sturdy pair of jeans is a must for college and Levis offers a 10 per cent discount to those who can produce their library or student card. Levis has a new range of jeans that might pass for casual trousers, which helps to explain the price. The unisex 417 (Pounds 50) comes in saddle, blue, green, ecru and black. It has a hugging fit but can be worn in a baggy style. To match this there are short-sleeved, ribbed grandad tops in black, red, white and cream at Pounds 20.70. The most interesting trouser design is the Bedford cord (Pounds 50.50) which is close fitting and looks like a cross between a cord and a jean. Students who are really pushed for money should head for Flip in Long Acre, Covent Garden, London. It is one of the cheapest places for T-shirts and jeans, partly because most of the clothes it sells are second-hand. You can find some second-hand Lee and Levis jeans for Pounds 15 downstairs. Upstairs there is an array of second-hand jackets, waist coats and jeans going even cheaper - from Pounds 10. Flip sells new clothes, too: grandad tops for Pounds 16.99, T-shirts starting at Pounds 4.99, long sleeved T-shirts at Pounds 9.99, track-suit bottoms for Pounds 22.99 and a fluffy sweat-shirt top with a hood for Pounds 25.99. Just two doors up from Flip is Longpoint Bay, where you can rummage around for stylish bargains. The sweat jean-jacket Pounds 42.50 is shaped like the classic jean-jacket, which means you can dress it up or down, with jeans or trousers. If you are bored with the usual sweat-pants look Longpoint has its own 'jogging trousers' which have a trouser-like effect because of the smart zip that sits in the side of the leg. Colours for the jacket and joggers are navy, bottle green, red, and grey. To match these there are some long-sleeved button-up tops for the girls, in grey and white (Pounds 22.99), and some button-up long-sleeved polo shirts with ribbed cuff and collar in navy, red black, and bottle-green (Pounds 29.95). The unisex roll-neck polo top is a little number everyone could use  -it can be worn with almost anything and is a sure way to keep warm in student digs when winter arrives. Colours include mustard, crimson, cream, black and navy. There is also an array of over-dyed jeans (Pounds 36.95) in all sorts of colours, including blue, red, and green. Another good port of call for budget shopping is the Next chain of stores. The women's checked 'weekend' shirt at Pounds 29.99 is colourful and thermal. The button-through V-neck jersey-top (Pounds 19.99 in black or rose) can be worn either to the college disco or the daily seminar. For boys there is a cotton striped rugby shirt in blues or red and green (Pounds 29.99), or a heavy-knit polo-neck which comes in aqua and a light cream. If anyone, male or female, wants a really cosy jumper then the menswear section is the place to look. Next's ribbed neck and cuff sweater (Pounds 34.99) is famous for its wonderful rib stitching. If you want a heavier jumper then the chunky-rib turtle-neck fits the bill - it is available in navy or stone for Pounds 29.99. Next also has some nice sweat-shirts at Pounds 29.99 in blue and green. Two other chains that women should look at are Oasis and River Island. The Oasis Bohemian-print ankle-length skirt with lace-up top to match is an outfit that is fashionable but flexible because it can be worn in the evening or the day. There is a long white shirt which you can mix and match with anything. River Island has lots to offer the poundless student. There is a pinafore dress with black and cream dot print (Pounds 39.99), a black button-through flared skirt with white stitching (Pounds 16.99), some black lycra leggings at (Pounds 9.99) and a grey, ribbed, cropped jersey top (Pounds 16.99). Choose just a few of these items and you have yourself a wardrobe to take you though winter, spring and summer - all for under Pounds 100.</p>

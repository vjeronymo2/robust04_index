			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Pounds 900m corporate boost for Lloyd's Lloyd's of London has attracted more than Pounds 900m from investors taking advantage of the first chance in the insurance market's 305-year history to be protected by limited liability. Twenty-five 'corporate members' backed by institutional and private money will be able to contribute Pounds 1.6bn in capacity for the 1994 underwriting year, Lloyd's said yesterday. It added that resignations by Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market - are expected to be less than half the number this year than last. The figures suggest that Lloyd's may be able to offer total underwriting capacity for 1994 of Pounds 10bn compared with Pounds 8.8bn last year. Final numbers will be prepared by the end of next week. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said corporate capital would allow Lloyd's to take advantage of 'greatly improved trading prospects' and enhance the professional standards of the market. The corporate money has been generated following recommendations in a radical business plan published by Lloyd's last April to introduce corporate capital without the requirement of unlimited liability imposed on individual members in the past. The amount supplied is towards the upper end of Lloyd's estimates of Pounds 500m to Pounds 1bn. Under the rules of the scheme, members can underwrite twice the level of capital they hold. Only about Pounds 800m of the Pounds 904m raised will be pledged in 1994, giving a total underwriting capacity of Pounds 1.6bn. The shortfall reflects money for which there was no room on preferred syndicates, held back for the 1995 year and to pay the management and administration expenses of the corporate vehicles. The corporate members include 12 quoted investment trusts which have raised a total of Pounds 804m in capital, with Pounds 280m coming from London Insurance Market Investment Trust (Limit) alone. Nine private corporate vehicles have raised Pounds 87m, with Pounds 27m from Lomond, formerly Murray Underwriting, and just Pounds 1.5m from each of the two smallest vehicles. Four further corporate members will supply a further Pounds 13m. A number of other corporate members were marketed during the autumn but collapsed through lack of support. Provisional estimates show that just 958 Names have resigned and will not be underwriting in 1994 compared with 2,308 one year ago. This leaves 19,537 active underwriting Names for the year. The increase in total underwriting capacity reflects a combination of lower resignations, and the introduction of both corporate capital and Members' Agents Pooling Arrangements, which spread the commitments of Names more widely across syndicates.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO IS JOINING THE MARKET?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   Capital raised Quoted investment trusts                                (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- London Insurance Market Investment Trust                    280m CLM Insurance Fund                                           86m Angerstein Underwriting Trust                                67m HCG Lloyd's Investment Trust                                 65m New London Capital                                           60m Delian Lloyd's Investment Trust                              51m Masthead Insurance Underwriting                              40m Premium Underwriting                                         33m Syndicate Capital Trust                                      32m Finsbury Underwriting Investment Trust                       30m Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust                              30m Hiscox Select Insurance Fund                                 30m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Other Vehicles  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Lomond (formerly Murray Underwriting)                        27m Navigators Corporate Underwriters                         19.25m Camperdown Corporation (St Pauls)                            14m Hiscox Dedicated Corporate Member                            10m Absa Syndicate Investment                                   6.5m Wentworth Underwriting                                        5m Kiln Cotesworth Corporate Member                           2.25m Yasuda Lloyd's Corporate Member                             1.5m MICAL                                                       1.5m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- In addition to these other vehicles, there are four further corporate members which will supply, in aggregate, Pounds 13m of capital  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

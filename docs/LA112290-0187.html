			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES / DAN STANTON: ANGLER DONATES 23 1/2-POUND SHEEPHEAD TO MUSEUM  </P> <P> Bob Oyama of Long Beach has donated another fish to the Cabrillo Marine Museum.  </P> <P> Oyama, who was fishing for yellowtail Monday aboard the Matt Walsh at the  rockpile, sent his bait toward the bottom and hooked the largest sheephead of  the year.  </P> <P> The fish was netted and placed in a bait tank.  </P> <P> Oyama has donated fish to the museum on several occasions.  </P> <P> The male sheephead weighs 23 1/2 pounds and is on display at the museum in San  Pedro. Its brilliant orange and black coloring lights up the display tank.  </P> <P> Shauna Rose of West Los Angeles, on her first tuna trip aboard L.A. Harbor's  Outerlimits, landed a 61-pound tuna despite a reel malfunction.  </P> <P> Using a small mackerel for bait, Rose, 21, made several casts toward some tuna  that were chasing chum-line bait.  </P> <P> After getting a strike and battling the fish for several minutes, the side  plate on her reel parted.  </P> <P> Captain Gary Norby was standing by and handed Rose the line. At that point the  only thing to do was hand line the fish in with 30-pound test line.  </P> <P> Another angler handed Rose a glove and she continued to hand line. After 30  minutes, the fish was gaffed.  </P> <P> Rose said: "I did not want to give in to the fish even though I may have some  line burns. It was the largest fish I ever had caught."  </P></p>

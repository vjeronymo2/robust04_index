			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tel Aviv, 11 Mar (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev on his arrival in Tel Aviv today told  journalists at Ben Gurion international airport that the aim of  his mission in Israel and later in Tunis was to promote the  resumption of the peace talks beteen Israel and the  Palestinians. He said that Russia supports the demand made by  the Palestine Liberation Organization for the deployment of  international forces on the occupied territories as a condition  for the continuation of the talks after the mass murder of  Palestinins by a Jewish settler at al-Khalil [Hebron] mosque on  25 February. Explaining the reasons for this position, the head  of the Russian foreign policy department said that "we must also  provide additional security, and we support an international  presence" in these regions.    Regarding the development of the peace process in the Near  East A. Kozyrev stressed the need for further progress toward a  solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict with a view to "making an  attempt to stick the separate pieces together into a single  whole and not allow negative points to prevail."    Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin, who welcomed  Kozyrev at the airport, stated: "We shall be pleased to listen  to what Kozyrev has to say in support of our proposals.  However, the ideas that we have already heard from Russia will  not in our opinion help to advance the peace process."    In this connection, local political circles are noting in  particular that Yitzhak Rabin, the head of Israel's Government,  had on the previous day, on 10 March, rejected Russia's  initiative on convening the Madrid peace conference on the Near  East anew for the purpose of unblocking the Arab-Israeli talks  and had also expressed his emphatic opposition to the deployment  of international peacekeeping forces in the occupied territories.    The head of Russia's foreign department will today hold  talks  with his counterpart Shi'mon Peres and Prime Minister Yitzhak  Rabin, and will then leave for Tunis where he will have a  meeting with Yasir 'Arafat, the chairman of the PLO Executive  Committee.</p>

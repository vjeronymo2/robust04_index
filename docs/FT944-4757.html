			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Warning on car lease VAT Government plans to allow car leasing companies to reclaim value added tax on their car purchases for the first time will distort the car market and depress new car sales next summer, accountants Grant Thornton said yesterday. The draft legislation, which is open to further amendment until March, removes the disadvantages which car leasing companies - which account for about 800,000 of the 2.4m company cars on the road - have suffered when leasing to private individuals and VAT-exempt companies, such as banks and building societies, which are unable to recover the VAT they pay. If the leasing companies are allowed to recover the 17.5 per cent VAT private individuals and financial sector customers will no longer be forced to pay 'VAT on VAT' - both on the vehicle purchase and the lease company's charges. Accountants and organisations involved with the leasing industry, such as the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association and the Finance and Leasing Association say, however, that the legislation will give an advantage to the leasing sector compared with the outright purchase of vehicles by companies.</p>

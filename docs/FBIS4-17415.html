			<p>BFN     [Text] Commander in chief of the joint NATO force in  northern Europe, General Garry Johnson, currently on a visit in  Lithuania, said NATO is ready to increase its aid to the armed  forces of the Baltic states. The aid will include both material  assistance and consultations provided by specialists in various  fields.    On Friday the NATO official was received by chairman of the  Lithuanian parliament, Ceslovas Jursenas. The guest said that  NATO member states are aware of and understand the concern of  the Baltic states over their national security. This concern  became ever more grounded owing to the unstable political  situation in Russia.    In his turn, Ceslovas Jursenas said that Lithuania would  feel  more safe when Russia withdraws its troops from Latvia and  Estonia. He appealed for NATO's support so that a pullout of  Russian troops and the demilitarization of the Kaliningrad  reagion would be accomplished sooner.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Italy's Triple-A rating faces downgrading ITALY, one of the biggest borrowers in the international capital markets, has had its top Triple-A debt rating placed under review for a possible lowering by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency. Moody's said a downgrading would affect about Dollars 22.2bn (Pounds 12.5bn) of foreign currency debt. It said yesterday: 'The large Italian deficits have contributed to raising the level of public sector debt to a point that is now slightly higher than gross domestic product . . . and reflects the continuous growth of public expenditures'. The servicing of this debt imposed a serious constraint on economic policy and was leading to a greater use of financing from external sources, the agency said. The review will take two months. If Italy is downgraded, any Italian company with a Triple-A rating will also be downgraded. Moody's has placed the debt ratings of state-controlled Cariplo, IMI and Crediop under review also. It added that Italy's failure to deal with the burden of its accumulated imbalances could impair the government's stated goal of stable integration in the European Community. The Triple-A rating is not only a matter of national pride but is significant to many investors and would increase Italy's cost of raising funds in foreign markets.

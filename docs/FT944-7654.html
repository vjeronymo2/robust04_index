			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / International Company News: Improved Saab-Scania boosts profits at Investor Investor, the central holding company of Sweden's powerful Wallenberg empire, saw pre-tax profits surge to SKr2.28bn (Dollars 311m) in the first nine months, after a strong performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit. The result, which compares with a SKr156m profit in the same 1993 period, came after Saab-Scania rebounded to a profit of SKr2.18bn after financial items, from a SKr362m loss. Saab-Scania's performance has been driven by higher sales and earnings from its Scania truck and bus division. These offset falling sales and increased losses at Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence. Investor, which apart from Saab-Scania has strategic holdings in leading Swedish companies such as Astra, Ericsson, Stora and Electrolux, said the value of its investment portfolio on September 30 was SKr28.9bn, down 1 per cent from the start of the year after adjusting for net changes. The group expanded its portfolio through the purchase of its Export-Invest stablemate earlier this year. The result included SKr710m in capital gains and SKr477m in dividend receipts. Shares were sold for a net SKr852m. The group's net worth amounted to SKr40.5bn, or SKr203 a share, on September 30 against SKr37.5bn, or SKr206, at the start of the year. Net debt has fallen to SKr4.61bn from SKr4.85bn. Saab-Scania saw sales climb to SKr22.2bn from SKr17.6bn, while operating income after depreciation soared to SKr2.32bn from SKr108m. The star performer was Scania, where sales jumped 34 per cent to SKr18.8bn and operating income after depreciation rose to SKr2.45bn from SKr311m. Sales of trucks and buses rose 28 per cent to 23,500 units, helping the division to lift its share of the west European truck market to 12.9 per cent from 11.7 per cent. Orders rose 61 per cent in volume terms, to 29,100 trucks and buses. Saab Aircraft &amp; Defence was dragged to a deeper operating loss of SKr242m from SKr227m, mainly because of lower sales of commercial aircraft. Saab Aircraft, which manufactures Saab 340 and Saab 2000 regional airliners, saw sales drop to SKr881m from SKr1.35bn, while orders fell to SKr395m from SKr667m.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Lira weakens The lira yesterday fell to a record low on the the foreign exchanges amid continuing uncertainty about the survival of the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and his government, writes Philip Gawith. The lira finished in London at L1,038 against the D-Mark, from L1,034. Analysts are now predicting that the lira could fall to L1,050, or even L1,100. Market activity was quiet, as the Thanksgiving holiday in the US on Thursday spilled over into a long weekend. The dollar traded in a very narrow range to close at DM1.5589, from DM1.5582, and Y98.765 from Y98.435. Sterling had a stable day, despite lingering political uncertainty. It finished at DM2.4339, from DM2.4366, and at Dollars 1.5631 from Dollars 1.5621. A magazine opinion poll showed 53 per cent of Italians felt Mr Berlusconi should not resign over the corruption probe, but currency markets proved less sentimental. While there were no fresh developments to push the lira lower, sentiment clearly remains nervous. Investors appear to be troubled not so much by the prospect of another Italian government falling, as by what this would mean for managing the budget deficit, and pensions reform. Although some analysts believe the lira could fall as low as L1,100 against the D-Mark, others believe the downside is more limited. Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said he was 'disinclined to raise his L1,050 forecast.' He said the bank's volume analysis suggested its customers already had long D-Mark positions against the lira. The scope for further selling was thus fairly limited. 'I would not want to overdo the gloom, but it is very difficult to see the lira making significant headway, even in favourable political circumstances,' said Mr MacKinnon. The Belgian franc weakened slightly after a newspaper article, attributed to Swiss Bank Corporation, predicted a 10 per cent depreciation of the Belgian franc over the next year. The franc weakened to BFr20.6 against the D-Mark, from BFr20.58, before recovering to close at BFr20.57. SBC distanced itself from the article, describing it as a 'hypothetical interpretation of scenarios'. The house view is a largely unchanged exchange rate over the next year for the franc against the D-Mark. A suggestion in the article that the Belgian and Luxembourg francs - currently at parity under a monetary agreement - would decouple on January 1, was denied by the Belgian and Luxembourg finance ministers, as well as the Luxembourg treasury director. Mr MacKinnon at Citibank said talk of the franc devaluing was 'baloney. The Belgian central bank will go through hell and high water to maintain the link with the D-Mark.' He said that the currency markets were also fairly immune to capital flows, with market uncertainty more likely to show up in bond prices, rather than the currency. Short sterling futures lost ground after the release of the CBI monthly trends survey showed the proportion of manufacturers planning to raise prices rose again this month. This prompted speculation that interest rates may rise again after the next monthly monetary meeting on December 7. The March 1995 contract settled at 92.99, from 93.07, and three month LIBOR rose to 6 1/8 per cent from 6 per cent. In its daily operations, the Bank of England cleared a Pounds 500m shortage at established rates.</p>

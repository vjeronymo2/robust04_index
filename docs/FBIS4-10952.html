			<p>BFN     [Text] Official sources told EL OBSERVADOR that the  government will soon undertake a "deep reorganization of the  foreign service," promote the merger of the Foreign Ministry  with the Foreign Trade Directorate, and emphasize the position  of itinerant ambassador.    President Lacalle said in Rome that Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] countries need to contact a public relations firm  in Europe and the United States to make the region known abroad.    Regarding the foreign service's reform, the sources said  changes are needed in order to gain "efficiency and more  dynamism," adding that the present structures do not help create  an effective presence for the country abroad.    The sources said the presence of a permanent ambassador is  necessary in countries like Italy, Spain, or France, adding that  the diplomatic coverage of countries like Poland could be made  through an area ambassador who might even reside in Uruguay.  That ambassador could be informed by agents in the respective  countries and then schedule regular and efficient visits.    The sources said the new system will permit an important  reduction of costs in residences, and the money could be used to  raise the salaries of diplomats living in Montevideo, whose  incomes are usually lower than when they are abroad.    President Lacalle, as well as Foreign Minister Abreu, have  spoken in the past about the need to reform the foreign service.  The minister even insisted that the service's economic and  commercial character should be emphasized.</p>

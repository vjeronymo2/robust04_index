			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> POLITICAL CHANGES ABROAD CREATING HEAVY DEMANDS FOR U.S. AID;  </P> <P> BUDGET: OFFICIALS SEE APPEALS FROM PANAMA AND EASTERN EUROPE COMPETING WITH  OTHER DEFICIT BURDENS.  </P> <P> Just as a domestic budget squeeze tightens in the United States, the sudden  political changes in Panama and Eastern Europe are unleashing appeals for  sharply increased U.S. foreign aid -- appeals that the United States may not be  able to satisfy.  </P> <P> "The democratization of Eastern Europe is welcome politically, of course, but  it's a very disastrous situation from a budgetary viewpoint," said a key  Administration strategist who has been keeping tabs on the problem. "There's a  serious question of how you manage it all."  </P> <P> Rep. Dave McCurdy (D-Okla.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee,  said Congress will be more willing to vote aid to Panama, now that U.S. forces  have deposed Manuel A. Noriega as that country's dictator.  </P> <P> But, McCurdy fretted, "put this on top of aid to Poland and Hungary and the  Philippines and El Salvador and environmental restoration and drug interdiction  and the savings and loan associations, and that is a heck of a burden."  </P> <P> Although the amounts proposed for individual countries are relatively small,  the overall increase -- which easily could amount to between $1 billion and $2  billion a year -- will intensify frictions between the White House and  Congress.  </P> <P> The increased demand comes as the White House is preparing to submit to  Congress its fiscal 1991 budget, which it has already squeezed substantially to  reach the target specified by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.  </P> <P> As a result, a growing number of lawmakers are beginning to question whether  President Bush will be able to keep his campaign promise to avoid a tax boost.  "I wonder if he is going be able to get away with saying 'Read my lips' much  longer," McCurdy said.  </P> <P> In broad policy terms, there is little doubt that the United States can afford  the extra money. Even a $2-billion increase is not very much in a $1.2-trillion  budget.  </P> <P> Charles L. Schultze, a Brookings Institution economist, noted that U.S.  spending for the Marshall Plan, which helped restore European economies during  the four years just after World War II, amounted to 4.7% of this country's  total output -- the equivalent of $240 billion today, or $60 billion a year.  </P> <P> Also, Alan J. Stoga, economic analyst for Kissinger Associates of New York,  pointed out that, while the United States footed the Marshall Plan bill alone,  today's aid to Eastern Europe is being financed "primarily by the Germans, the  French, the Italians and the British."  </P> <P> "The United States is contributing only a small part," he asserted.  </P> <P> What is more, some analysts here are expecting Washington to reap a massive  "peace dividend" from sharply reduced defense spending as tensions between the  West and East subside. The newly available money could far outstrip any extra  costs from increased aid.  </P> <P> But critics pointed out that the "peace dividend," while always possible in  theory, has traditionally proved elusive in practice. And even if the savings  materialize, they probably will come too late to ease the budget squeeze for a  year or two.  </P> <P> The coming year's budget fight is expected to be fierce enough, even without  the extra strain caused by demands for more foreign aid.  </P> <P> Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee  that handles foreign aid issues, already has pledged to hold the foreign aid  budget hostage unless the Administration relents on proposed domestic spending  cuts. House strategists said that they expect Obey to maintain his earlier  stance, even with aid to Eastern Europe and Panama at stake.  </P> <P> Administration officials said that with events now moving rapidly, the White  House has not had sufficient time to draft its own counterstrategy. Planners  conceded they are not even sure how much the total tab will be.  </P> <P> Aid that Congress already has approved for Poland and Hungary alone will cost  nearly $1 billion in the next three years, about double what the Administration  had budgeted. Estimates for the likely aid needed by Panama range between $200  million and $1.5 billion.  </P> <P> The rest of the East European package is likely to be small, but experts said  the United States could end up having to provide some added aid to Mexico or  other Latin American debtors if the situations there worsen. The Middle East,  too, could flare up next year.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, foreign policy experts argued that the outlays will be necessary,  both to ensure success in the world's fledgling democracies and to maintain  U.S. leadership in global affairs.  </P> <P> Congress has cut foreign aid spending sharply in recent years as lawmakers  scrambled to save domestic programs from the budget ax. State Department  planners said that many smaller countries where the United States could make  some gains have been cut out entirely.  </P> <P> Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul A. Volcker, traditionally a  hard-liner in urging Congress to hold spending down, has argued that spending  to maintain American leadership is worth even the price of higher taxes.  </P> <P> "The costs are within our capacity," Volcker argued in a column in the  Washington Post last weekend. "It is the costs of withdrawal from leadership  that are truly incalculable."  </P> <P> Robert Z. Lawrence, a Brookings Institution economist, agreed. "This only  indicates how niggardly our situation is because we aren't able to fulfill our  foreign needs," he said. "I don't see that any one of these things is  potentially large enough to break the bank."  </P> <P> Virtually all sides agree that the increased demands posed by the global  movement toward democracy are likely to make the budget process more difficult,  no matter what the outcome. Stoga, of Kissinger Associates, said the most  glaring problem for the moment is that no one in Washington seems to have a  strategy to cover the need.  </P> <P> "It seems to me what ought to be happening -- but isn't -- is that we need to  sit back and say: 'Hey there's something going on here, and we ought to plan  for it,' " Stoga said. "The risk is that we could do it piecemeal, which is the  way we are doing it."  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Moody's to add Spain to offices in Europe MOODY'S Investors Service, the US rating agency, has extended its European operations with the creation of a subsidiary in Spain, writes Richard Waters. The agency, which already has operations in London, Paris and Frankfurt, has maintained its practice of opening offices from scratch rather than forming joint ventures with local agencies, a method favoured by its rival, Standard &amp; Poor's. The move was prompted in part by legislation which will make securitisation easier for Spanish borrowers, said Mr Jan Konstanty, managing director of Moody's in London.</p>

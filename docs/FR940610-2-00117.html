			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) LSI informed the Department that the Bankruptcy Court had entered an order on March 31, 1994, that approved the $6 million dollar payment by LSI to the Master Trust. Subsequently, the Department was informed that on April 14, 1994, LSI emerged from bankruptcy protection and that in connection with such emergence, LSI made the $6 million payment to the Master Trust that is a condition, as set forth in Section II(c), of this exemption. In this regard, such condition provides that LSI pay ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;the $6,000,000 in a single lump-sum payment in cash to the Master Trust, not later than sixty (60) days following the later of (1) the date of the order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the payment, or (2) the date the grant of this exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' In the opinion of LSI, since the condition of the exemption states that the payment be made no later than a specified date, that LSI's payment of the $6 million dollars before the publication of the final exemption complies with the condition for grant of the exemption. The Department agrees with the position as expressed by LSI; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) LSI commented on the language concerning the condition of the exemption, as set forth in Section II(g), which states that ``the terms of the Lease, as modified by the First Amendment, are at least as favorable to the Master Trust, the Plans, and their participants and beneficiaries, as those which could have been obtained by the Master Trust in an arm's length negotiations with an unrelated third party under similar circumstances.'' With respect to the language in this sentence from Section II(g), the Department wishes to correct a typographical error in that the word, ``negotiations,'' written in the plural should read ``negotiation,'' in the singular. Accordingly, the Department has made this change in the language of Section II(g) in the granted exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further in the language quoted in the paragraph above from Section II(g), LSI points out that the I/F's opinion regarding the transaction, including the Lease of the Property, is that the overall transaction, taking into account all of its provisions including the $6 million dollar payment, is equal to or superior to transactions that could be negotiated with unrelated third parties. To the extent the inclusion of the language in Section II(g) referring to ``under similar circumstances'' is intended to include the other term of the overall transaction, LSI states that the condition is accurate as it relates to opinions provided by the I/F. The Department concurs with LSI's position; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) LSI requested modification of the language in Section II(k) which provides, in part that, ``LSI has either paid directly or reimbursed the Master Trust for any fees, other than trustee and investment management fees, incurred with respect to the ownership of the Property by the Master Trust.'' In the opinion of LSI the quoted language in the sentence above implies that the Master Trust has paid no fees in connection with ownership of the Property other than trustee or investment manager fees. LSI believes that this language is over broad, because it is not limited to those fees incurred in connection with the transactions. For this reason, LSI suggests adding after the word, ``incurred,'' the phrase, ``in connection with the transactions.'' The Department has no objection to LSI's proposed modification, and accordingly, has amended the language of Section II(k); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) LSI proposes clarification of the language of Section II(l) which states that ``LSI has filed Forms 5330 and paid the excise taxes with respect to the Lease of the Property for the years 1987&hyph;1989 and will file Forms 5330 and pay the excise taxes for the period after December 31, 1989, and before the effective date of this exemption.'' Because the effective date of this exemption is September 10, 1990, LSI believes that this provision should be revised to clarify that the excise taxes for the period after December 31, 1989, must be paid within sixty (60) days of the date the grant of this exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For this reason, LSI suggests adding before the words, ``will file,'' the phrase, ``LSI not later than sixty (60) days after the date the grant of this exemption is published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' The Department has no objection to LSI's proposed modification, and accordingly, has amended the language of Section II(l); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) LSI requests modification of the language in the third sentence of paragraph number one in the Summary of Facts and Representations in the Notice which states that, ``In addition, LSI is a major source of ready-mixed concrete and precast concrete products and is a leading importer of cement and clinker.'' In this regard, LSI has brought to the Department's attention a more current description of LSI's business. Accordingly, LSI requests that the sentence be amended to read ``In addition, LSI is a leading producer of cement, ready-mixed concrete, sand and gravel, crushed stone, and construction materials.'' The Department has made the requested change to the description of LSI; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) LSI requests modification of the representation in the fourth sentence in the fourth full paragraph of paragraph number six of the Summary of Facts and Representations which states that, ``It is represented that the royalty payments actually made by RMC have exceeded the minimum guaranteed royalty amounts for the years 1989 through 1992.'' In this regard, LSI has informed the Department that the date 1992 should be corrected to read 1991. The Department has made this change as requested by LSI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As the Department concurs with the requested the modifications and clarifications to the language of the proposed exemption, such changes are hereby incorporated into the exemption, as granted. Accordingly, after giving full consideration to the record, including the comments by interested persons and the responses of the applicant, the Department has determined to grant the exemption, as described herein. In this regard, the comments submitted to the Department have been included as part of the public record of the exemption application. The complete application file, including all supplemental submissions received by the Department, is made available for public inspection in the Public Documents Room of the Pension Welfare Benefits Administration, room N&hyph;5507, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption refer to the Notice published on March 8, 1994, 59 FR 10832. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Angelena C.

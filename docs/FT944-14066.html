			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Observer: Perfect fit Who is Colin Emson, the man mentioned in yesterday's FT who helped think up ingenious ways for Big Business to fund the Conservative party without having to declare political donations in their accounts? Old stagers in the City who can remember the good old days when the marginal rate of tax was 98 per cent and the Labour party wanted to squeeze the rich till the 'pips squeaked', also fondly remember the firm of Emson &amp; Dudley, apparently named after King Henry VIII's tax collectors. Emson used to compete with the likes of Godfrey Bradman and Roy Tucker to think up clever schemes to minimise the tax bills of the rich and famous. Nice to see that Emson's expertise was put to good use.</p>

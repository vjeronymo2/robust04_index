			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed FY 1995 wage index, 86.4 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all prospective payment hospitals (4,778 hospitals) would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience a change in their wage index value of less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.0 percent. Approximately 5.2 percent (283 hospitals)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would experience a change of between 5 and 10 percent, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.4 percent (469 hospitals) would experience a change of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 10 percent. The following chart shows the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> projected impact for urban and rural hospitals. (The totals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this chart exceed the number of hospitals in our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> database, as our projection includes new hospitals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals that for other reasons are not included in our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage file.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s50,6,6  -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Percentage change in area wage index values <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Number of hospitals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Rural  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Urban <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Decrease more than 10 percent  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 188  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 196  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Decrease between 5 and 10 percent  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 26  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 94  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change between ^5 and +5 percent  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,099  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 2,679  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increase between 5 and 10 percent  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 44  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 119  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increase more than 10 percent  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 67  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 18  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Occupational Mix Adjustment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its March 1, 1994 report, ProPAC recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary develop methods to collect more timely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital wage data by occupational categories and to adjust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HCFA wage index for occupational mix (Recommendation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The HCFA wage index reflects variations in the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor; that is, it includes the effects of variations in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix of occupations as well as the price of labor. ProPAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the wage index should reflect only variations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the price of labor, which are beyond the hospital's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control and are not otherwise accounted for by adjustments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the prospective payment system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Previous ProPAC studies on the effect of adjusting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index for occupational mix using data collected from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California hospitals found that a wage index adjusted for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational mix would redistribute funds from urban to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rural hospitals. Within urban areas, the occupational mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment would redistribute funds from large to small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals. Within rural areas, the occupational mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment would increase the wage index values of all bed-size groups. ProPAC also reanalyzed the California data to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examine the impact of an occupational mix adjustment on wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> index values based on hospital-specific labor market areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ProPAC currently believes that the implementation of revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> labor areas, including nearest neighbor labor markets, would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially improve payment equity among hospitals if an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational adjustment was developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not convinced that an occupational mix  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment would improve the accuracy of the wage index, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we have discussed most recently in the August 30, 1991 final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule (56 FR 43222). Currently, the wage index measures the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overall costs of labor. If the wage index were to measure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the price of labor, then a set of occupational weights would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have to be developed to determine a standard occupational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix. Hospitals would not be compensated for a mix of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees above the standard, while hospitals with a mix of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees below the standard would be overcompensated,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to their cost of labor. If we were to adopt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital-specific labor market areas in conjunction with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational mix adjustment, one concern would be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of occupational weights to every prospective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment hospital in the country. Application of one set of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational weights to every prospective payment hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would conflict with the intended purpose of hospital-specific labor markets, which is to make the wage index more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsive to local conditions. We cannot envision a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set of occupational weights that could be applied to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prospective payment hospitals in an equitable manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Last year, ProPAC suggested that we convene a working  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group made up of representatives from HCFA and the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry to try to improve the timeliness and accuracy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wage data. HCFA assembled such a discussion work group  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and presented ProPAC comments concerning the equity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting a method to collect data to assist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development of an occupational mix. The discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> workgroup's consensus was that the data required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implement the proposal is not currently available and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood of obtaining such data would be minimal. There  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seems to be little support among hospital industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives for developing a system that in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opinion clearly creates additional reporting burdens with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unproven or minimal impact on the distribution of payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, at this time we are not proposing any changes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the collection of data to be used in developing an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupational mix adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Mar 04, BNS - Artur Laast,  minister-counsellor at the Estonian Embassy in Moscow, at a  press conference today said there was strong hope that the talks  between Estonia and Russia will continue despite recent  indications of the contrary.    Laast told reporters in Moscow he would rather not try  predicting the decision the government in Tallinn is going to  make on the issue, but he added there was "a strong feeling that  the talks will go on."    The Estonian diplomat quoted an interview by Alexandr  Udaltsev, the senior official in charge of relations with the  Baltics at the Russian Foreign Ministry, in which Udaltsev said  his country may return to the deadline of Aug. 31 for pulling  out its troops from Estonia, if Estonia abided by the conditions  several times repeated by Russia. Laast underlined that Russia  has not finally given up the deadline, but is just stipulating  this date as connected with certain conditions.    Laast dismissed as ungrounded the accusations by some  Russian  diplomats that Estonia had promised to pay 23 million U.S.  dollars to build houses for the repatriated Russian military.  He said that this money could have been only provided to  Estonia by Western countries, which, however, don't want to  finance the building of houses for officers in active military  service.    The Estonian diplomat further said there had been no backing  down by his country on the two other issues which Russia says  had prompted the decision to review the deadline. Laast added  that the first of these issues -- giving up mutual claims for  the value of the army property left behind, and for damages  inflicted by the presence of troops, respectively, had been  virtually settled and was not even worth to be spoken about any  longer.    Neither have there been any changes in Estonia's position on  the second issue, that of the presence of retired Russian  military in the country. The dispute, he said, exists over  principles that are contradicting Estonia's citizenship law.</p>

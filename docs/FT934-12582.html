			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Long haul for Air France It is tough being an Attali twin: frere Jacques departs the EBRD amid criticism he has spent too much money; frere Bernard resigns as chairman of Air France for trying to save too much. The latter Mr Attali's plans to cut costs were modest in relation to the scale of Air France's problems, yet they were still sufficient to provoke the implacable opposition of the unions. His departure in such circumstances will only compound the challenges confronting his successor. Air France is woefully over-staffed and deeply in loss. This may not have mattered much while the government remained indulgent and Europe's aviation industry cosily cartelised. But Air France's rivals threaten to turn the competitive screw as the industry liberalises. British Airways, which is benefiting from a lower cost base following sterling's devaluation, is fast encroaching into the French market through TAT. Even the lacklustre Lufthansa has more resolve in pressing ahead with cost-cutting and privatisation. Its link-up with United could develop into a powerful threat to Air France. A consummation of the proposed Alcazar alliance between four European airlines would also buffet the French carrier badly. How the French government tackles this conundrum could develop into a fascinating clash between traditional dirigisme and new-found pro-market rhetoric. Air France boasts some attractive international routes and readily saleable assets. This may enable the government to privatise the carrier - but at a price determined by a broader view of the airline's prospects. That underlines the case for firm action by the government now.</p>

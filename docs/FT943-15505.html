			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Diouf makes a vigorous start to FAO reform - John Madeley talks to the new director-general of the United Nations' food and agriculture agency Mr Jacques Diouf of Senegal, the first African to lead the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, is planning the most radical shake up of the agency since it was formed in 1945. The FAO is both the largest UN agency and largest international organisation dealing with food and agricultural issues. Six months after taking over as its director-general, Mr Diouf called for urgent action to tackle the serious food problems in Africa and for FAO to be re-invigorated, 'making it more effective in a renewed war on hunger and malnutrition'. With a two-year budget of Dollars 673m, the agency has come in for criticism for its bureaucracy and for basing professional staff mostly at its Rome headquarters. But after years of little change, staff are heading out of Rome, meetings are being cut and some Dollars 40m of the budget has been re-allocated to field-orientated programmes for 'food security and preventive measures against pests and diseases', says the new director-general. He wants more of the FAO's money to be used to help increase the availability of food in areas where it is short, with the emphasis on sustainable production. A 'war on hunger' needs to waged, Mr Diouf stresses, especially in 78 low-income, food-deficit countries, 45 of them African. 'Governments of developing countries will have to adopt efficient policies and programmes to foster agricultural production. They need to re-allocate the means to invest in agriculture and rural development,' he says. But production is only part of the problem, Mr Diouf points out, calling for 'a frontal attack on poverty to be be launched to allow the rural poor to have the income needed to buy food'. He has urged international financing institutions to redirect their funds in favour of the agricultural and rural sector in the form of investment for basic infrastructure. As part of the FAO shake up, a special programme to support food security in food-deficit countries has been launched, with a new department of sustainable development being set up, together and a technical co-operation department to 'enable FAO to be more responsive to the needs of its members', says Mr Diouf. A new division has been set up to deal with with the advancement of women 'who,' the director-general points out, 'produce well over 50 per cent of the developing world's food'. In addition a new Agriculture and Economic Development Analysis Division has been established to improve the agency's analysis of macro- and micro-economic issues. Nearly 200 of FAO's 1,500 Rome-based experts are being relocated to Third World national offices, which are also being reinforced with local expertise  -'a new approach to the problem', claims Mr Diouf. He warns that a food crisis is emerging in eastern Africa, with 34m people threatened by famine, and that 'the situation is worsening dramatically in some parts of the sub-continent. 'We should act in such a way as to avoid the regular occurrence of famine, due to drought in particular, and make sure that we deal with the problem of water management,' he says. 'In Africa, we have to ensure that the 5,100bn cubic metres of water from rivers that go to the sea every year are controlled and used for the benefit of the agricultural producer. Without water control, there is no production'. FAO intends to launch projects, Mr Diouf says, that will show that even where there is drought 'we are able to have adequate protection'. 'We will prepare bankable projects for the infrastructure needed, and hope that through this process, and also by convincing governments of water management, adequate resources will be invested'. With global population projected to rise by 50 per cent in next 30 years, Mr Diouf points out that land availability per person is already declining 'and will decline further. There is less land for more people, and a tendency for farmers to move to marginal lands. Some areas will be used more intensively. If there is no technological breakthrough that allows the population to produce more yet preserve the value of the land, there is no solution'. He believes that alongside policies to ensure that population growth rates are lowered through the improvement of the economic conditions, 'we in agriculture have the responsibility to ensure that there are technologies which are more efficient, yet respect the environment. That is the only way'.</p>

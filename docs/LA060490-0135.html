			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: ACTOR DE NIRO COULD SPORT WALESA'S MUSTACHE  </P> <P> IS ROBERT DE NIRO, the legendary "actor's actor," preparing to portray another  legend of our time, Lech Walesa? Nobody has signed on the dotted line and De  Niro's asking price is now way up there, but a team of Warner execs did jet to  Poland to buy up all rights to Walesa's story. And Lech, although bemused by  all the Hollywood types in their Armani suits, is said to be enthusiastic about  the idea of De Niro playing him for the screen. If Lech's story gets De Niro  and a green light from Warner, it would begin shooting early next year in  Poland.  </P> <P> I HAVE been unable to speak to the principals in the domestic fracas of late,  but the hot skinny is that Donald Trump is now trying to break down Ivana's  resistance with his "charm" and get back on her good side. Recently, Mrs. Trump  went almost three weeks without even speaking to her estranged mate. (I gather  this is a matter of self-preservation because when they do speak, he upsets  her.) I'm told Donald recently made an attempt to be affectionate and asked:  "Will you still love me when I don't have any money?" Ivana reportedly snapped:  "Yes. I already DID love you when you didn't have any money, remember?"  </P> <P> Ivana made a quick trip to Czechoslovakia over the Memorial Day weekend with  her father and son Donny. Upon return, she was furious to learn that Donald had  not even seen their two younger children during the three-day holiday.  </P> <P> TOM HANKS was not working on "Bonfire of the Vanities" on the Memorial Day  Saturday, but his wife, Rita Wilson, was. She plays a literary publicist who is  at a party with principal actors Bruce Willis and F. Murray Abraham. Both  Rita's character and Rita herself are visibly pregnant. The Hanks' real-life  baby is due in August. Director Brian De Palma shaved off his beard to play a  cameo as a guard in this same night's filming. It isn't that he likes to act,  but it was the only way he could direct a 360-degree, fluid-motion Steadicam  shot that goes on for five minutes without a cut. Said to be the longest moving  shot in movie history, the camera follows Bruce Willis from an underground  garage, along corridors, through a kitchen, up an elevator and finally into a  formal dinner party at the Winter Garden in the World Financial Center.  </P> <P> ARE THE Vic Damones (she's Diahann Carroll) unraveling for good? . . . Is it  true that fur-wearing is going to make a comeback in a reaction against the  anti-fur demonstrators? (That's what the fashion editors seem to think.) . . .  Say it isn't so -- Andrew Dice Clay will play the lead in the 20th Century Fox  movie "Gossip Columnist."  </P></p>

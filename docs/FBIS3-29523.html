			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, Feb. 18 (YONHAP) -- The Taiwanese  Government has decided to impose high temporary anti-dumping  tariffs on Korean- and Japanese-produced polypropylene.    The newspaper LIENHEPAO here reported in a dispatch from  Taipei Friday that Taiwan Finance Ministry's tariff rates  committee on Thursday decided on the tariffs ranging from 110.67  to 6.57 percent on the ground that the polypropylene exported by  South Korea and Japan has had a serious effect on the Taiwanese  industry. This is the second Taiwanese anti-dumping tariffs on  Korean products since diplomatic ties broke up between the two  countries in August 1992. Last year, Taipei slapped  anti-dumping tariffs on polyethylene cases exported by South  Korea.    The report said that the anti-dumping tariffs will be  imposed  on Korean and Japanese polypropylene as decided by the committee  as soon as the decision is approved by the administration, a  rather perfunctory procedure. About 20 South Korean and  Japanese industries are subject to the assessment of the  tariffs, the paper added.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 The 9 February agreement between Israel and the PLO on measures  to implement the Gaza-Jericho plan has been received warily by  many mainstream Palestinians, both within the PLO and inside the  occupied territories.  Apart from those PLO officials directly  involved in the negotiations, monitored mainstream comment since  the announcement of the agreement has ranged from open criticism  to cautious neutrality.  PLO leaders have launched an effort to  rally mainstream support for the accord, but many Palestinians  will withhold judgment until they see its practical consequences.                            END SUMMARY     Within some PLO leadership circles, announcement of the agreement  evidently rekindled both anger over PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat's  tight control over the negotiating process and concerns that he  is making too many concessions to Israel because he has staked  his political future on the success of the Oslo agreement.  According to press reports, 'Arafat was unable on 13 February to  muster a quorum for a meeting of the PLO Executive Committee,  several of whose members have reportedly already been boycotting  committee meetings since the signing in September 1993 of the  Declaration of Principles negotiated with Israel in Oslo (London  Al-Sharq Al-Awsat, 13 February).  Three committee members (out of  a nominal membership of 18) indicated explicitly their  dissatisfaction in recent statements appearing in the Jordanian  press:      --In a statement reported by the daily Al-Ra'y on 14 February,  Sulayman al-Najjab confirmed that he refused to attend the  Executive Committee meeting called for 13 February "to protest  the manner in which the Executive Committee was treated."  According to Al-Ra'y, al-Najjab charged that committee decisions  concerning negotiations "were not respected" and specifically  that the Cairo agreement violated committee decisions.  Al-Najjab  went on to call on the Executive Committee to reject the  agreement and to charge that the PLO leadership is conducting  negotiations "without any terms of reference or any clear  negotiating plan that is committed to the Palestinian  understanding of the Oslo agreement."      --'Abdallah Hurani also called for rejection of the Cairo  agreement according to a report appearing in Al-Ra'y on the 15th.  Apparently referring to the 13 February Executive Committee  meeting, Hurani branded as "illegal" any committee meeting held  without a quorum.  The report said that Hurani called on  Palestinians in the territories to engage in "assertive and  vigorous popular action" to "call a halt to these concessions"  [to Israel] and also called on the PLO leadership to "rethink"  its position on the Oslo agreement.      --Samir Ghawshah, though somewhat equivocal, complained about  both the Cairo agreement and the nature of PLO deliberations in  an interview.  The Cairo accord, he said, is "not ideal," an  "incomplete step," and "not a positive start for the resumption  of negotiations on various issues."  Elsewhere in the interview,  he called the agreement a "possible step" but "not a step that  responds to the minimum level of our demands."  Perhaps referring  to Egyptian efforts to bring about the agreement, Ghawshah said  that the Palestinian delegation in Cairo was subjected to  "tremendous extortions," even though it "resisted some of them."  Nonetheless, he added, the delegation "could not impose its  concept of the agreement in a manner that meets the minimum  [Palestinian] demands."  Referring to an Executive Committee  meeting held prior to the Cairo accord, Ghawshah described the  meeting as "incomplete"--apparently an allusion to boycotting  members--and said that "many arguments took place." (Amman Al-  Dustur, 16 February).      Editorial Coolness      The leading East Jerusalem Palestinian daily Al-Quds was  strikingly reserved in its assessment of the Cairo agreement.  Perhaps hinting at resentment of alleged Egyptian pressure, an  editorial on 11 February said that the accord "was drafted with  considerable help from our Egyptian brothers" and that its  implementation "will require tireless and continuous efforts."  Both conflicting Israeli and Palestinian interpretations of the  Oslo agreement and the continued deterioration of conditions in  the territories, Al-Quds argued, "have cast a dark shadow over  any positive expectations during the past weeks."  Although it  acknowledged that the Cairo agreement "has somewhat restored  momentum to the negotiating process," the paper warned that "this  momentum has not yet been translated into reality."  Citing the  "theoretical nature" of the agreement, it said that "any optimism  regarding the future would be premature" and that experience "has  taught the Palestinian people realism."  In a remarkably passive  conclusion, Al-()uds said that "it is better for one to wait, be  patient, and expect surprises."      PLO Seeks To Rally Support      In apparent recbgnition of mainstream Palestinian skepticism, PLO  leaders directly involved in the negotiations have sought in  recent days to justify their actions.  Most notably, Executive  Committee member Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh offered a detailed defense of  the Cairo agreement and appealed for popular Palestinian support.  In an interview with Jordan Television--probably visible in much  of the West Bank--'Abd-Rabbuh said that the agreement "has been  an extremely important step" that "resolved a number of major  issues."  He promised that [Israeli] "withdrawal will take place  and the dawn of Palestinian independence will soon arrive."  PLO  leaders, he said, "are aware that there is a feeling of  frustration" among many Palestinians, and he acknowledged that  "so many issues [remain] that require extensive negotiations."  Nonetheless, he argued, "there is no such thing as a perfect  solution" and critics of the accord do not understand "how much  bargaining it took" to achieve it.  "The most dangerous thing in  this process, ' he warned, "is to lose patience," adding elsewhere  in the interview that "quick solutions will not be sufficient and  will be dangerous to our future."  Palestinians, he argued, will  get "better guarantees for our future" by reaching "solutions  achieved through determination, patience, and perseverance" (12  February).      Implications      In the near term, 'Arafat has probably gained both time and  maneuvering room through the Cairo agreement.  He was able to ram  the Oslo agreement through a disgruntled Executive Committee last  September, and there is thus far little indication that the most  recent grumbling of committee members cut out of the  decisionmaking process will compel him to modify the PLO  negotiating position.      Nonetheless, long term implementation of any agreement with  Israel, including the establishment of an effective Palestinian  autonomy regime in the territories, will likely require more  active mainstream support than is evident in the cool reception  of the Cairo  agreement.  While concrete signs that  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord is under way would  doubtless boost support for the PLO and the peace process,  'Arafat and his inner circle, who are effectively controlling  Palestinian policy toward the peace process, have been less  successful to date in bolstering confidence in their leadership  among many mainstream Palestinians.

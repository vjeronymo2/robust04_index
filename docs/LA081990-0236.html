			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CBS TO THE RESCUE  </P> <P> I just wanted to congratulate CBS for its terrific series "Rescue 911." Not  only is it extremely informative and educational, but it is thrilling to watch,  some factors I hope won't lead to its cancellation.  </P> <P> Annette Mason, Inglewood  </P></p>

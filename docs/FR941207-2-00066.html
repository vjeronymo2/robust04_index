NRC has made a determination that events involving an actual loss or significant reduction in the degree of protection against radioactive properties of source, special nuclear, and by-product material are abnormal occurrences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report to Congress is for the second calendar quarter of 1994. The report identifies the occurrences or events that the Commission determined to be significant and reportable; the remedial actions that were undertaken are also described. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This report addresses seven abnormal occurrences (AOs) at NRC-licensed facilities. Five involved medical brachytherapy misadministrations, one involved a medical teletherapy misadministration, and one involved a medical sodium iodide misadministration. Four AOs were reported by the Agreement States as of August 3, 1994. Two involved medical brachytherapy misadministrations, one involved a radiation burn received by an industrial radiographer, and one involved a lost well logging source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The report also contains updates of seven AOs previously reported by NRC licensees and five AOs previously reported by Agreement State licensees. Three ``Other Events of Interest'' are also reported. One involved a deliberate coverup of an error in a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical administration at an NRC licensee, one involved an Order Suspending License and Demand for Information at an NRC licensee, and one involved an overexposure of an industrial radiographer at an Agreement State licensee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A copy of the report is available for inspection or copying for a fee at the NRC Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW. (Lower Level), Washington, D.C. 20037, or at any of the nuclear power plant Local Public Document Rooms throughout the country. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of NUREG&hyph;0090, Vol. 17, No. 2 (or any of the previous reports in this series), may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Post Office Box 37082, Washington, DC 20013&hyph;7082.

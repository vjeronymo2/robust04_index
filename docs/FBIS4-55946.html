			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 23 (CTK) -- The recently emerged  bloc of the Democratic Party (DS) and the Party of Slovak  Entrepreneurs and Tradespeople (SPZ) has asked the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH) to form an "equal" coalition so that  not a single right-wing vote is lost in the autumn elections,  the two parties' chairmen announced today.    This call for coalition talks, which will be held on  Saturday  [28 May], actually means a refusal of the KDH offer which opened  its list of candidates to politicians from small right-wing  parties. Electoral polls have shown that only the KDH of the  fragmented Slovak right could cross the five-per-cent barrier in  the elections scheduled for September 30-October 1. The KDH has  been refusing the right-wing coalition.    "We shall try to form a united coalition of the  right-of-the-  centre parties," DS chairman Pavol Hagyari stated. He said he  could not rule out that the DS-SPZ bloc would enter the  elections independently, probably as one legal entity for which  5 per cent are sufficient, not seven as in case of a coalition.    However, SPZ chairman Vladimir Randa called the cooperation  a  "pre- and post-electoral bloc of two independent parties." The  Slovak right must make up its mind by the end of July when the  list of candidates must be submitted.</p>

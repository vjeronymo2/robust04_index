			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> END NEARS FOR DANCE DROUGHT;  </P> <P> BALLET: BEGINNING TUESDAY, THE BOLSHOI WILL BE AT THE SHRINE WHILE THE  AUSTRALIAN BALLET MAKES ITS FIRST APPEARANCE IN THE SOUTHLAND SINCE 1971.  </P> <P> Local balletomanes have endured a pointe-less summer since the Joffrey departed  at the end of May. But all that changes on Tuesday, when two major classical  ensembles open Southern California engagements: the Australian Ballet at the  Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa and the Bolshoi Ballet at  Shrine Auditorium in downtown Los Angeles. Each has announced its casting.  </P> <P> Last seen locally in 1971, the Melbourne-based Australian Ballet is bringing  two programs of Franco-Russian repertory staples: the two-act "Giselle," Serge  Lifar's ensemble showpiece "Suite en blanc" and David Lichine's caractere romp,  "Graduation Ball." For modernist contrast, there's also Jiri Kylian's intense  "Return to the Strange Land" and the West Coast premiere of "Catalyst" by  company member Stephen Baynes.  </P> <P> Back after a three-year absence, the Moscow-based Bolshoi will dance the local  premiere of Yuri Grigorovich's full-length historical epic "Ivan the Terrible,"  as well as two more familiar Grigorovich works and a program of Bolshoi  highlights.  </P> <P> Bolshoi principals include a number of artists prominently cast in 1987 -- most  notably Ludmila Semenyaka, Alexei Fadeyechev, Nina Ananiashvili and Yuri  Vasyuchenko. In addition, Gediminas Taranda (absent in 1987 but pictured on  that tour's posters and souvenir programs) and Los Angeles' own Michael Shannon  are scheduled to dance during the engagement -- but not Irek Mukhamedov, who  recently joined England's Royal Ballet.  </P> <P> Major casting for both engagements is listed below. Performances are at 8 p.m.,  except as indicated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bolshoi Ballet casting  </P> <P> Tuesday: "Ivan the Terrible" (Grigorovich/Prokofiev): Alexander Vetrov (Ivan),  Alla Mikhalchenko (Anastasia) and Gediminas Taranda (Prince Kurbsky).  </P> <P> Aug. 8: "Ivan the Terrible": Yuri Vasyuchenko, Ludmila Semenyaka and Mark  Peretokin.  </P> <P> Aug. 9: "Ivan the Terrible": Alexei Fadeyechev, Maria Bilova and Taranda.  </P> <P> Aug. 10: "Romeo and Juliet" (Grigorovich/Prokofiev): Nina Ananiashvili  (Juliet), Vasyuchenko (Romeo), Peretokin (Tybalt) and Alexander Petukhov  (Mercutio).  </P> <P> Aug. 11 at 2 p.m.: "Romeo and Juliet": Semenyaka, Yuri Posokhov, Vetrov and  Mikhail Sharkov.  </P> <P> Aug. 11 evening: "Romeo and Juliet": same cast as Aug. 10.  </P> <P> Aug. 12 at 2 p.m.: "Romeo and Juliet": same cast as Aug. 11 matinee.  </P> <P> Aug. 14: "Swan Lake" (Grigorovich/Tchaikovsky): Semenyaka (Swan Queen) and  Fadeyechev (Prince).  </P> <P> Aug. 15: "Swan Lake": Mikhalchenko and Vetrov.  </P> <P> Aug. 16: "Swan Lake": Ananiashvili and Fadeyechev.  </P> <P> Aug. 17: "Swan Lake": Nina Semizorova and Peretokin.  </P> <P> Aug. 18, 2 p.m.: Highlights program, including a complete "Petrushka" (with  Yuri Klevtsov, Natalia Arkhipova and Petukhov), and excerpts from "Spartacus,"  "Swan Lake," "Legend of Love," "Le Corsaire," "The Golden Age," "Don Quixote"  and "Paquita."  </P> <P> Aug. 18, evening: Highlights program, including "Petrushka" (with Sharkov,  Bilova and Andrei Melanyin), plus excerpts from, among other ballets, "La  Sylphide," "Flower Festival at Genzano" and "Paquita."  </P> <P> Aug. 19, 3 p.m.: same casting and repertory as Aug. 18 matinee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ballet casting  </P> <P> Tuesday: "Catalyst" (Baynes/Poulenc): Lisa Pavane, Roy Wilson, Robert Marshall,  Jayne Beddoe, Paula Baird, Greg Horsman.

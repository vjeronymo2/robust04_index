			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Observer: Volvo's latest spin Pehr Gyllenhammar's latest industrial power play - merging Procordia with Volvo - brings the restless, iconoclastic Swedish industrialist back into the limelight after a time in the shadows. Some observers had thought that his decision 15 months ago to hand over the chief executive's job at Volvo to Christer Zetterberg, seven years his junior, indicated he was moving into semi-retirement. However, nothing could have been further from the truth as Zetterberg has found to his cost. The planned merger is just the latest of Gyllenhammar's grand corporate ideas for Volvo. The 56-year-old Gyllenhammar was always keen on seeing Procordia under Volvo control ever since a meeting in September 1989 with the then state-owned food and pharmaceutical company's chief executive Soren Gyll. At a two-day seminar at the vineyards of Sweden's state monopoly Vin and Sprit in southern France, where the then finance minister Kjell-Olof Feldt was also present, the seeds of a Volvo/Procordia deal were sown. However, Sweden's ruling Social Democrats had ideological doubts over selling a state company to Volvo. Instead it was agreed the state and Gyllenhammar would form a joint partnership. But, as Volvo's boss makes clear in a recent book of conversations, he never accepted this was the end of the matter and expected sooner rather than later that Procordia would find its way into Volvo's hands.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Survey of Germany (16): Tug of peace intensifies - Thomas Mayer warns of higher inflation and a weaker D-Mark WITH the arrival of autumn, hopes have been falling that Germany's present economic malaise - which was the result of an excessive increase in the cost of labour - could be overcome by a concerted effort of all groups of society. Instead, the country is bracing itself for another round in the fight over distribution of income between capital and labour, and the eastern and western regions. The remnants of Germany's famous social consensus are likely to be destroyed by powerful interest groups, impervious to the appeals of the political establishment. Social consensus between workers and employers was the secret force behind west Germany's post war economic miracle. This consensus was forged in the hardships after the war, which could only be overcome if frictions in society were minimised. The post-war social consensus came under attack for the first time in the 1975. The domestic social conflicts arising from a more aggressive union policy coincided with raw material producing countries' claim for a larger share in world income and the subsequent 'oil crisis'. At the same time, the German political climate deteriorated as the post-war generation began to challenge the social order created by the older generation. The result of these conflicts was two recessions (1975 and 1982), a period of volatile and high inflation, high fiscal deficits and, at the political level, a bout of terrorism. The problems of the 1970s were eventually overcome by an armistice between labour and capital - that cooled the disputes over income distribution - and by integrating the rebellious generation into the political establishment. There followed a period of relative stability in the 1980s, with steady but mediocre growth, low inflation, strong exports and low fiscal deficits. Although the appearance of peaceful labour relations had been restored, the strong social consensus between capital and labour of the 1950s and 1960s had been lost. Instead, there was collusion among special interest groups at considerable cost for the economy at large. As companies benefited from a long upswing and accumulating profits during the 1980s, German managers, who had been under no strong pressure to distribute profits to share-holders, agreed more readily to union demands. Unions, who are represented in the supervisory boards of large companies, in turn tended to be more peaceful and to support management's corporate expansion plans. This cosy relationship between unions and management came at the expense of shareholders and average workers. The former had to accept more modest returns on their investment while the latter had to cope with rising structural unemployment as unions were bidding up wages. In 1990, unification shocked a west German economy where the dominance of special interest groups had led to severe procrastinatIon. Instead of rejuvenating it, as many optimists had hoped, the unification shock pushed it into overheating and subsequent collapse. The accession of the eastern states to the Federal Republic brought a limited increase in the national capital stock, but a large increase in the labour force. Market forces would have depressed wages relative to profits in response to the drop in the capital-labour ratio. But this would have undermined organised labour's position in unified Germany and possibly shifted the distribution of income against it. Thus, unions strongly resisted downward pressure on wages. Instead of allowing wages in west and east to converge towards a new equilibrium (with west German wages probably somewhat lower and east German wages higher than before), unions succeeded in quickly pushing east German wages up to western levels. When the Bundesbank failed to accommodate wage inflation with an easy monetary policy, profits and investment plunged and the economy went into recession. The unions' success in pushing up east German wages was made possible by a weak political and industrial leadership and a rigid organisation of Germany's labour market. Especially at the beginning of the restructuring process, unions had to deal with the old managers from the former GDR who were often on their way out. Moreover, the managers of the largely state-owned companies were working under a 'soft-budget constraint', that is, they could agree to excessive wage increases well knowing that in the end the government - and not their bankrupt companies - would foot the bill. Nor did politicians resist excessive wage increases. Eager to win east German votes, they avoided taking a stance against the idea of a quick convergence of east German wages to west German levels. Last but not least, as wage contracts were negotiated separately for west and east Germany and, as they were generally binding in each region, arbitrage was reduced: an east German worker who wanted to work in west Germany could not offer to work at a lower (eastern) wage to compete with west German job holders. With the recession, the Government tried to ease wage pressures and to defuse the fight over the distribution of income by invoking Germany's legendary social consensus. But the strategy to reduce peacefully the conflict of interests between capital and labour by forging a 'solidarity pact' failed. What was possible in a society turned upside down by defeat in World War Two proved to be elusive in a country in the grip of powerful groups determined to defend their vested interests. As the employers in the metal industry recently admitted when they took the unprecedented step of ending the existing wage contract by year-end, there is now little alternative to the containment of wage costs through open confrontation. With numerous elections due next year, economic policy is unlikely to give much guidance. Thus, should employers and unions fail to correct past wage policy mistakes, financial markets will enforce a decline in pan-German real wage growth through higher inflation and a decline in the Deutschemark's real exchange rate.

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Danish central bank sees few problems in Emu ECONOMIC and Monetary Union (Emu) in the European Community will cause no significant problems for Denmark, according to the annual report from Denmark's Nationalbank (central bank), writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The Danish economy currently meets all economic convergence criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty, the bank said. Loss of sovereignty when Emu is completed will be more formal than real, said the bank, as Denmark's monetary policy is already tied to developments in the leading member countries of the European Monetary System. It will mean that the country has to devolve sovereignty in this area of policy, but in exchange the Nationalbank will gain influence over future EC policy instead of having to follow the decisions taken by others, as at present, said the bank. Denmark has already achieved the benefits which will arise from the establishment of Emu, it added.</p>

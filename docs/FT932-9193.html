			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Production resumes at Hyundai HYUNDAI MOTOR, South Korea's largest vehicle maker, yesterday resumed normal operations after production was disrupted by a two-week strike at its main subcontractor for bumpers, writes John Burton in Seoul. Hyundai said that it lost almost Dollars 200m in sales due to delays in the production of 20,000 cars as a result of the industrial action at Apollo Industrial, which also supplies headlamps and crash pads. The government last week ordered a police raid against Apollo to arrest the trade union leaders that were leading the illegal strike. The union this week agreed to end the strike if its leaders were released.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S SET TO BE A POINT OF LIGHT  </P> <P> Foster Webster, clad in his trademark coveralls, calmly swept up freshly mowed  grass at the curb of his California bungalow in Oakwood, as if this were any  other day.  </P> <P> The activity swirling around him suggested otherwise, particularly the sight of  Secret Service types in shirt sleeves and ties peering over fences and checking  out the neighbors. A temporary telephone trunk line had been strung hastily  above the street and a big, red fire truck had rolled up, unannounced, to check  Webster's house for fire hazards.  </P> <P> The President of the United States is to drop in on the 72-year-old,  semi-retired janitor Monday and personally deliver a "Point of Light" award for  Webster's work on the Oakwood Beautification Committee.  </P> <P> The group was formed about a year ago at the suggestion of the Los Angeles  Police Department, which was frustrated in its efforts to clean up the  crime-ridden streets in the Oakwood area of Venice. Drug dealing in broad  daylight and shootings between gangs by night had made it one of the city's  more dangerous neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Relations with the police were marked by years of hostility. Some residents  complained of what they perceived as sporadic, heavy-handed sweeps through the  area that had little lasting impact on crime.  </P> <P> Webster, a World War II veteran who bought his Venice home in 1962, is a  founding member of the committee. He said he was first approached by Borden  Olive of the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission. "I told him we need  to organize something concerning drug abuse and the way the people are letting  the community run down," Webster said.  </P> <P> The son of a farmer who raised corn and cotton, Webster was reared in Waco,  Tex., where he began working at 14, after the eighth grade. "My philosophy of  life is work," Webster said emphatically, leaning forward on a plastic-covered  chair in the living room where George Bush will meet with him and the rest of  the Beautification Committee board. "I have never been unemployed."  </P> <P> Webster was a psychiatric aide at a veterans' hospital in Waco, and held a  similar job with the Veterans Administration in Westwood until his back was  injured in a traffic accident in Santa Monica and he was forced to take a  disability retirement. He went on to do janitorial work in commercial buildings  on the Westside, which he still does part time.  </P> <P> The coveralls are part of a solution to his back pain, Webster said. Wearing  pants with a belt hurts, he explained, though he will forgo the uniform and don  his Sunday best to greet the President.  </P> <P> Webster, who sent his two daughters to school out of the neighborhood, said he  tried to be involved in another citizens' group, but found they only wanted to  complain, not improve things. He concedes that some members of his community  resent the success of the Oakwood Beautification Committee, but he was intent  on bringing them in to work for the common good. "Our goal is to fight drugs  and not to fight people," he said.  </P> <P> Asked what he does for fun, Webster repeated what he said he told his wife:  "Honey, at my age, the fun days is over." He said he derives pleasure from  church activities and visiting with relatives on holidays.  </P> <P> "He's not a rah-rah type," Police Lt. Jerry Szymanski said. "He's a quiet  leader (who) doesn't need to stand out from the rest but is always there for  support."  </P> <P> According to Szymanski, crime is down perhaps 44% since the police's Oakwood  Task Force has been concentrating its resources, including foot patrols, in the  area bounded by Rose Avenue, Electric Avenue, California Avenue and Lincoln  Boulevard. Szymanski, who heads that force, said his officers have become part  of the community and relations have never been better.  </P> <P> Police nominated the Beautification Committee to the White House, which was  looking for a "Point of Light" that George Bush could personally deliver.  </P> <P> One component of the committee's plan, which they said Bush will inaugurate, is  the posting of signs with the word DOPE in a circle with a diagonal line  through it. The caption reads: "Buyers and dealers BEWARE. Your license plate  numbers are being reported to police."  </P> <P> Committee spokesman Grant Hudson said that when the group got started this  would have been considered a risky statement to make. Though some in the  community have criticized the group for not immediately soliciting help from  veteran community activists, Hudson said the group had to build slowly because  people were afraid of retribution if their names were associated with a  fledgling crime-fighting effort.  </P> <P> As it is, Hudson said, he has been threatened. One woman's car windows were  smashed and shots were fired through another man's window. Now that the  multi-ethnic group is cohesive, everyone is welcome, Hudson said. The group's  coming-out party was a "Taking Back the Streets" march last month, attended by  City Atty. James Hahn and Venice Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. Both have worked  with the group from the outset.  </P> <P> Longtime community activist Pearl White said she is one who fears that the  group's true agenda is to gentrify the neighborhood for high-income whites and  force poor people out of an area of wildly escalating property values.  </P> <P> Hudson, a renter, said his involvement stemmed from frustration over  neighborhood conditions that nearly prompted him to move "to get out of this  hell hole. . . . People are getting involved in it because they will not  tolerate the living conditions here."  </P> <P> Foster Webster is one of those people. He noted that government housing built  for low-income families has been abused by people who live there and who treat  it as a gift instead of their home. "Some people have chances and don't want  them," he said. "Nobody can keep you from having what you want."  </P> <P> Webster also insisted that the committee is not trying to push people out, only  to stop drug dealing. One of the things he said he likes best about the  committee's work is the respect he has gained from the drug dealers themselves,  who now politely move on when he asks them to.  </P> <P> And, although a few eggs were hurled at the 300 marchers last month, Webster  said one drug dealer called out to him: "You all are going to march us off  these streets, aren't you?"  </P> <P> That's the plan.  </P></p>

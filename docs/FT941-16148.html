			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Editor resigns after clash with Berlusconi: Media magnate tries to bend newspaper to his political ambitions Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's media magnate, has received a setback to his political ambitions following the resignation yesterday of the editor of one of the country's most respected newspapers. Mr Indro Montanelli, veteran editor of the Milan-based Il Giornale and a pillar of Italian journalism, said he would set up a rival paper after growing conflicts with the Berlusconi family. Il Giornale, which loses money heavily, was until recently owned by Mr Berlusconi.

Il Giornale has, however, retained its strong support for Mr Mario Segni, a former Christian Democrat who is also trying to rally the political middle ground. Matters reached a head at the weekend, when an uninvited Mr Berlusconi attended a meeting of Il Giornale's journalists and apparently linked new investments to raise profitability to a change in the paper's tone. Interviewed by Corriere della Sera, the leading Milan daily, soon afterwards, Mr Montanelli said Mr Berlusconi had committed a 'colossal gaffe' and that a split was now inevitable. Speaking of Mr Berlusconi, Mr Montanelli said: 'He thinks he is a cross between Churchill and de Gaulle, and he really believes it.'</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> YUGOSLAVIA ACTS TO DEFUSE THREAT OF ETHNIC WARFARE  </P> <P> Parliament today moved to defuse mounting ethnic and political tension and  warnings of impending civil war by naming a Croatian reformer to the country's  collective presidency.  </P> <P> A crucial parliamentary debate on whether Yugoslavia remains a federation or  becomes a looser alliance was then postponed until at least November.  </P> <P> The two moves indicated that the country's quarreling political leaders have  decided to put off, at least for now, a showdown in their power struggle over  Yugoslavia's future.  </P> <P> Deputies loudly applauded a conciliatory speech by outgoing President Borisav  Jovic, a Serb who holds the annually rotating chairmanship of the collective  ruling body.  </P> <P> "All bridges have not been burned. There are still possibilities for the crisis  to be overcome," Jovic said after Stjepan Mesic, a Croatian, was named to the  presidency.  </P> <P> Communist-ruled Serbia staunchly opposes the confederacy plan pushed by  Slovenia and Croatia.  </P> <P> Under it, Yugoslavia would become a loose alliance of sovereign states. There  would be no central rule or national capital, and each state would decide how  it would deal with each other on an individual basis.  </P> <P> Serbia calls for a "modern federation" that would keep central rule in  Belgrade, the capital of the country and Serbia.  </P> <P> Deputies from Serbia -- the largest republic and Croatia's traditional rival --  had earlier blocked the election of Mesic, charging that he is a Croatian  nationalist who seeks independence for his republic.  </P></p>

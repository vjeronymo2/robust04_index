			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Germans step warily into the front line: No dramatic action expected despite constitutional court ruling on military When President Bill Clinton was asked in Berlin yesterday about the prospect of German soldiers taking part in military exercises outside the Nato area, he could scarcely contain his glee. 'I am completely comfortable with this decision,' he declared, commenting on the judgment of the German constitutional court in Karlsruhe. He could certainly imagine German troops taking part in the Gulf War. Why? 'Because of the leadership of Germany, because of the conduct of Germany, because of the role Germany has played in the creation of Europe,' he said. Germany did not merely have the largest population in Europe, it had been 'the leader in pushing for the integration of Europe', he added. His sheer enthusiasm left his host, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, visibly discomfited. It even caused him to produce a rare phrase in English. 'We will decide on a case by case basis,' he hastened to say. 'You must not think this will create a mood of 'Germans to the front'.' The irony of the decision is that it has been greeted with far more caution within Germany - at both ends of the political spectrum - than among her allies. In the first place, there remains great political caution about the circumstances in which German troops can and will be used in future to support United Nations missions around the world. Secondly, there are considerable doubts about just how ready the Bundeswehr - the German armed forces - is to mount such operations. Mr Wolfgang Schauble, the parliamentary leader of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats, and a leading campaigner for 'out-of-area' operations to be approved, was delighted yesterday at the political victory for the German government. He was also adamant that it would not have dramatic consequences. 'We have no intention of dreaming up as many missions as possible for the Bundeswehr to take part in,' he said. 'All our friends and partners in the world can be sure that Germany will deal with this question very carefully - for the next century, at least,' he added with a wry smile. Asked if Germany might have participated in the Gulf war, if the constitutional court ruling had been given then, he said it might have been legally possible, but not necessarily politically feasible. 'That was only one month after unification,' he said. 'It would have been too soon.' He argues that the importance of the move is that Germany can now behave like a normal ally within the Nato alliance, and increasingly, within the context of the European Union's common foreign and security policy. 'We are ready to take up our responsibilities as well as our rights,' he said. Although the court decision is on the face of it a setback for the opposition Social Democratic party (SPD), its leader, Mr Rudolf Scharping, was almost equally enthusiastic - because it has clarified the legal 'grey area' in the constitution. 'The legal framework is now clear within which the politicians have to act,' he said. That would reassure German soldiers, and give clear guidelines for the debate on Germany's future foreign and security policy. It also denied the government the 'free hand' it had sought in sending troops outside the Nato area, by insisting on separate parliamentary approval for every operation, he said. In the near future, the Bundeswehr is scarcely well-prepared for comprehensive out-of-area operations, although it can certainly provide very useful logistical support, according to Dr Holger May, head of the Institute for Strategic Analysis in Bonn. 'On the one hand, the Bundeswehr has the third largest air-lift capacity in the world,' he said. 'We are one of only three Nato allies (the others are the US and Netherlands) who can provide missile defence with Patriot missiles.' On the other hand, there are clear disadvantages from having always planned German operations on the assumption of operating close to home. The German air force, for example, urgently needs to increase its logistical range, because it has never expected to operate away from domestic servicing and repair facilities. In the early 1970s, the Bundeswehr scrapped its military field bakery, and its capacity to provide drinking water for troops in the field: both would have to be recreated. And the military medical corps would have to be considerably expanded if one international exercise were not to deprive the rest of the Bundeswehr of virtually all its doctors. 'It is certainly not true, as some people at the defence ministry are saying, that we cannot organise a mission out of area before the year 2000,' Dr May said. 'That is nonsense. But it makes the case clearer than ever that we could never go it alone. 'We are going to have to make up our minds where our priorities lie. We will have to make it clear to ourselves, and to our public opinion, that it is in Germany's interest to get involved in something.'</p>

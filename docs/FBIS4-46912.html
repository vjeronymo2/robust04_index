			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Pachegina: "Crime Has Decreased in </F> Ingushetia: Law-Abiding Citizens Will Live in the New Capital"]    [Text] A report from the Ingushetian Ministry of Internal  Affairs, presented for the attention of Ruslan Aushev, president  of the republic, on the results of the department's work in the  first three months of this year, notes a 20.1 percent decrease  in the indicators for the rise in crime, as compared with the  1st quarter of last year. This figure, the police emphasize,  includes the indicator for the number of serious crimes, reduced  by 33.9 percent, attempted homicides (27.2 percent), aggravated  assault (12.5 percent) and theft of state property (17.9  percent). Side by side with this, complains the republic's MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs], it has not succeeded in  achieving positive results in reducing the number of crimes  involving theft of personal property and possessing and selling  drugs. To the chagrin of the republic's organs of internal  affairs, in the period being analyzed there was a sharp increase  in the number of motor vehicle accidents on the roads of  Ingushetia, in which 60 people died and 75 were injured.  Notwithstanding the 33.3 percent reduction in the indicators in  the 1st quarter, juvenile crime is a particular worry for the  staff members of the Ingushetian MVD. The conclusions of the  departmental report contain proposals on improving the work of  GAI [State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate] and the management of the  republic's motor transport enterprises, and on educational work  among young people. On the initiative of the Ingushetian MVD,  the republic is discussing the problem of building correctional  institutions, which, in the opinion of representatives of the  organs of law and order, should contribute to more harmonious  relations between the people of the republic and the law.    At the same time, Ingushetia is preparing to build a new  capital for the republic, an on-going building project which  will be approved at the end of this June. The local press is  presently carrying on an animated discussion on the name of the  city, and planning-surveying work has already begun, six  kilometers southwest of Nazran, on the banks of the Sunzha. The  administrative-cultural and housing complex of the capital, for  50,000 inhabitants, includes the settlements of Sunzhu and  Ekazhevo. Right now in Nazran, a commission of architects from  the North Caucasus is considering five plans, submitted to the  government of Ingushetia, for the future city. According to NG  information, the government of the republic has focused its  choice on the design of the Russian Scientific Research  Institute of Urbanistics. Valeriy Kim, its director, feels that  urban construction in Ingushetia should take into consideration  the heightened seismicity of the region, as well as the special  features of the foothill landscape. The dominant architectural  features of the future capital, according to the design of the  Scientific Research Institute of Urbanistics, will be the great  mosque, the orthodox temple and the presidential palace. Open  spaces around each of the objects, small streets with unique,  truly Caucasian buildings, mountain slopes within view of the  city -- this is how the architects envisage the new capital of  Ingushetia. To NG's question to an associate on the staff of the  president of the republic, as to whether a penitentiary would be  included in the plan for the capital, it was said that by the  time the city is built on the banks of the Sunzha (construction  is slated for completion in 10 years), crime will be completely  eradicated in Ingushetia, and the need for this type of service  will fade away by itself.</p>

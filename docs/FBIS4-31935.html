			<p>BFN     [Text] Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian  Television, following yesterday's six-party discussions about  the future of Hungarian radio and television, today issued the  following statement:    In response to the 15 June announcement by Prime Minister  Peter Boross, I am glad that the appointment and relief of the  leaders of Hungarian Television will be the result of a  six-party agreement. I consider it natural that the next leader  of Hungarian Television should take over after a thorough  economic and legal examination. I am at the disposal of any of  the examining organizations.    Budapest, 16 June 1994    Signed: Dr. Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian  Television</p>

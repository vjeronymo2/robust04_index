			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Train franchise companies could get incentive payments COMPANIES that win franchises to run train services could qualify for incentive payments to meet punctuality and reliability targets, Roland Rudd writes. The scheme is included in draft objectives for the franchising director which the government published yesterday. The director is Mr Roger Salmon, a former director of the merchant bank NM Rothschild. He will be able to use part of his budget on the incentives, which could be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Salmon will be responsible for deciding who will run the franchises created under the rail privatisation proposals, and will control subsidies to lossmaking services. Railtrack, which will be responsible for the running of the the track and signalling, could also qualify for bonuses if it reduces costs. Mr Salmon has been asked to outline a franchising programme by the end of January. He will become responsible from April for paying subsidies, but they will no longer be paid in an annual lump sum. Subsidy will be attached to specific train operations, to prevent British Rail from cross-subsidising bids for franchises. When assessing bids from BR, Mr Salmon has been asked to take into account its record in providing services and the transfer of risk. The government is keen to transfer the financial risk associated with running a franchise from the public to the private sector. BR will only be able to bid for a franchise when there are no credible alternatives from the private sector.</p>

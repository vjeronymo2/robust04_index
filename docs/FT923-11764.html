			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Press in the dock THE PRESS Complaints Commission has again failed to cover itself in glory. A few weeks ago this voluntary body for the self-regulation of the British press met in haste. It decided in accordance with what it regarded as the prevailing winds that it had to issue a statement about intrusion into the private affairs of Princess Diana. A bit of wrist-slapping followed. Yesterday it met again, this time to talk, so it was said, about privacy - but not, heaven forfend, about the past few days of media reports and allegations about Mr David Mellor's private life. It seems that the prevailing winds have changed. The commission decided that 'in the case of politicians, the public has a right to be informed about private behaviour which affects or may affect the conduct of public business.' It thus provided an afternoon delight for the editors of Britain's tabloids, a quick piece of work that amended clause 4 of the code of conduct that the commission exists to uphold. A strict reading of the clause suggests that what has been written about the 'minister for fun' is outside the code. This presented no difficulty to a commission sorely afraid of its press-appointed members. It has simply excluded politicians from the protection of the code. The remedy for this is to demonstrate that not every quarry falls to the popular pack. Mr Mellor should stay in office, difficult though this may be in the light of the daily revelations about his private life and that of his family. There remains, however, another issue, for which a different remedy must apply. This is the accusation made by Mr Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, that during the election campaign a cabinet minister telephoned in a list of names of women with whom, it was falsely alleged, Mr Paddy Ashdown was involved. This story of an attempted smear is an extremely serious charge. If Mr MacKenzie has made a sustainable case he should name the guilty minister - or shut up.</p>

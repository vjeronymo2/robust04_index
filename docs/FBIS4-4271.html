			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 29 (XINHUA)--Northeast China's  Liaoning Province has channeled billions of renminbi yuan toward  fighting against air and water pollution.    As one of China's major heavy industry bases, Liaoning has  many industries that cause serious pollution, including the  metallurgy, chemical, paper-making and mining sectors.    To raise sewage disposal capacity, Liaoning plans to invest  two billion yuan to launch the "clean water" project, which was  initiated in 1992.    A pollution control program was framed to tackle industrial  pollutants in the province's main rivers and all reservoirs.  According to the program, some 157 enterprises in the province  would put about one billion yuan into building 218 sewage  treatment projects.    When they go into operation, these projects will be able to  handle additional 300 million tons of waste water every year.    Early in 1988, the province carried out a "Blue Sky" project  to curb air pollution in the region, which involved 14 cities,  35 counties and 3,800 enterprises, with a total investment of  770 million yuan.    All aspects of the project were completed and went into  operation in June 1990. During the ensuing three-year period,  nearly 20,000 boilers and furnaces were upgraded and 200  projects for industrial pollution control were completed.    Shenyang city, once labelled by the world environmental  protection organization as one of the ten most seriously  polluted cities in the world, began to issue licenses for  airborne emissions in 1991.    So far, air pollution in the city has been brought under  control. Ash and smoke content in the air has dropped remarkably.</p>

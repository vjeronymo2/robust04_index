			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 15 Mar Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Between the Japanese and U.S. Governments there are  now emerging subtle differences of views on interpretation of  the agreement on opening up of the cellular phones (portable and  automobile phones) market, and this can be a new seed of trouble  in the Japan-U.S. friction. The U.S. Government talks loudly  about "achievements," insisting that "the Japanese Government  has given a de facto guarantee on the use of U.S. company-made  cellular phones," and ignoring the Japanese Government's  refutation that "we have not given a guarantee." The United  States indeed is poised to press for adoption of a similar  framework of agreement in the Japan-U.S. framework talks.    The main point of the Japan-U.S. agreement on cellular  phones  is that the Japanese Government has agreed to help Japan Ido  Corporation fulfill its pledges to U.S. Motorola Company,  including the establishment of 159 ground stations, using "all  available measures." The seed of trouble is the difference  between Japan and the United States over the interpretation of  this expression -- "all available measures."    It looks clear that the Japanese Government wants to avoid  giving much meaning to the expression, and Vice Foreign Minister  Kunihiko Saito insists, "All this means is to do something like  conducting, on a regular basis, checks on degree of progress  being made in dealings between the private companies." But on  the U.S. side, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor openly  praised the accord as "the first step in result-oriented  agreements." It is apparent that the U.S. Government interprets  the accord as "containing in effect the government guarantee"  regarding progress made in market access.    In fact, there was a fierce tug of war on this expression.  One of the officials who took part in negotiations said, "In  Japan's original draft, a limited expression of 'measures within  the scope of law' was used." But at the strong resistance of  the United States, Japan was forced to swallow the expression  "all available measures." This shows how the United States was  determined to get its way whether the other party wanted it or  not.    Some ranking government officials are concerned about the  United States' firm attitude lest "the automobiles and auto  parts, which is one of the three priority areas in the economic  consultations, should become the next target. Private auto  manufacturers are now moving toward presenting "voluntary  targets to purchase U.S.-made products," but the officials are  concerned lest the U.S. Government should ask the Japanese  Government to provide de facto guarantee on their performance as  done in the recent agreement on cellular phones.    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] is  already alarmed, insisting, "This area is different from the  telecommunications. The government issues few permits and  licenses in this area, hence has little room to interfere." But  in the framework talks, confrontation between two nations  continues -- as the United States wants to have certain future  targets set as "objective criteria," while Japan stands by the  position it will not accept anything other than a yardstick to  measure the degree of the past market access. As such, there is  the possibility that the method the U.S. Government used in the  negotiations this time will become a "bridgehead," based on  which the United States will push for Japan's compromise. The  next move by the United States can be one which will put Japan  into real anguish.</p>

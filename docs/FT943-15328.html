			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Travel: From rags to riches in the high Alps - The unique Ladin mountain scenery and culture Head north from Verona and the transition from lowland Italy to the Alps begins at once. The hot plains crumple into mountains and valleys; the air becomes sharp and clear. The cypress trees and vines are eclipsed by pines. Geraniums line the balconies and gothic script appears on white-washed walls. There is an onrush of gemutlichkeit. Gemutlichkeit comes as a bit of a surprise in Italy. I have always associated that particular brand of cosy hospitality with the Germans, but perhaps it is more an alpine thing. Admittedly, part of the Dolomites used to be German - until the end of the first world war the South Tyrol, as the name suggests, used to be part of the Austrian empire - and so the German influence has probably had its effect; but the Italian speakers in the mountains above Venice have a similar way. It was mid-evening on a cold September night by the time I found my way into the Val di Fassa in the high Dolomites, but there was time for a bite before the band struck up and the assembled company started to sing along to the accordion music. Auto-suggestion had me ordering a beer, although I discovered that the usual drink thereabouts is wine. I joined in the spinning top games and sang along for a bit. I have not been that keen on singing since I was asked to stop in a music lesson at school, but it was a friendly crowd, mainly Italians and Germans, and it was easy to join in. The Dolomites are a ragged interface between the two languages. This is true both of the original inhabitants and of the tourists that you now see in the resorts. Surprisingly, there is another, uniquely alpine language wedged between them in the high Dolomites. Ladin descends from the tongue of the original, Celtic inhabitants of the Alps, mixed with colloquial Latin and left to crystallise for centuries. The Ladin people of the Dolomites were marginalised by the main European nations, as they were elsewhere in the Alps (the fourth language of Switzerland, Romansch, is related to Ladin). They were squeezed into five of the highest and remotest valleys. Tax collectors and bishops' envoys were sent to visit occasionally, but generally the inhabitants were left to lead a poor existence as farmers. The last two generations, though, have seen more change than the previous centuries. Like so much of the Alps, these high Dolomite valleys have been transformed from one of Europe's poorest regions into one of its most prosperous. The farm plots have been sold off to provide holiday villas and second homes and the cowherds have become builders and hoteliers. With the exception of Cortina, the Dolomites are not that well-known to the British, but have been discovered by the Italians and the Germans, who arrive in their bus-borne hordes. September is between seasons: the summer walking is just about over and the snow has not yet arrived. It was odd to be in a ski resort out of season. Even the noises were different without snow to damp them, although the river still roared in the valley bottom. The nights were already cold and there was a familiar skiing pleasure in emerging from the stua (a Ladin adaptation of the German word stube, the hearth of their hospitality) into the night air for an evening walk. The mountains stood out strong and white in the moonlight high above the valley floor. Instead of the typical triangular alpine peaks, the Dolomites are vast stacks of white limestone that stand in clusters like craggy teeth. The off-season is quite a good time to see the Dolomites. The colours of autumn are exquisite, and the mountains looking their best. In the long, angled light of sunrise and sunset they glow an extraordinarily vivid pink. To my mind the Ladin mountains - the Sella, Marmolada and Rosengarten - are some of the most beautiful in the Alps. In times past, before the tourist hordes arrived, Ladin life was governed by saints' days and the seasons of cattle herds. Summer was spent gathering hay on the high slopes and cutting wood in preparation for the long winter. When the cold weather came, the villagers withdrew to the valley floor. Here they stayed in small clusters of buildings scattered a mile or so from one another. Each has a tall, white-plastered, communal house for four or five families, surrounded by a collection of barns, one for each family. The hay was kept upstairs in the barn, providing insulation for the cattle and easy accessibility when it was pitch-forked down to them as feed. Ladin proverbs tell of life's rhythms: rain on St George's day is supposed to bring another 40 days of winter. In Val Badia, another Ladin valley, I stayed in a small town called San Cassiano. Once again the welcome was courteous and hospitable. San Cassiano sees some fairly well-heeled travellers, so there was less singing and more subdued chat in the bar. The Ladins were lamenting the lack of television time they were permitted in their own language, and told of the problems of political self-determination (their valleys are divided between different districts of Italy). I took a day's walk up into the high meadows, where the richest grass grows and where the villagers take their cattle for the summer. The path followed an old route to a tiny chapel just below the massif. Each year on the first or second weekend in June, the villagers carry a statue of Jesus on the cross and place it above the altar in the chapel. I set off with a slow and steady mountain plod, climbing gradually though the pine forest and along the switchback paths. The ground was steep; it must have been hard climbing for the farmers, loaded up with provisions. At intervals there were crucifixes at the roadside, the stations of the Calvary, placed so that walkers could pause for breath at the same time as offering devotions. When I reached the high pastures, the meadows were dotted with wooden barns where the hay was stored and dried. High mountain grass makes the finest hay because it is free of fertilisers and full of flowers, among them arnica. An old farmer who was clearing up before the winter explained that it was very good for rheumatism. He looked spritely enough. It has become popular to have treatments in a bath of the grass in some resorts; there is even an EU-sponsored project to investigate its efficacy. The farmer told me that when he was young he came up here for the hay-making season. It was their summer holiday in a way. After the evening meal, understandably cooked in separate kitchens, everyone would get together in one barn and tell stories, before burying themselves in the hay to go to sleep. There were a lot of tourists now, he said, perhaps too many. Remembering how hard the climb had been, I said that it must be a difficult walk for him now, but he laughed and said that he drove a pick-up truck nowadays. He asked if I had come up on the chair-lift? It seemed unjust suddenly to discover that I had been labouring uphill almost directly beneath a chair-lift. James Henderson travelled to Verona with Meridiana, which flies daily from Gatwick (reservations: 071-839 2222). A car was loaned by the Italian hire-firm Maggiore (UK agent: Trans-Hire, tel: 071-978 1922). Small cars start at about Pounds 210 for a week's hire, all-in.</p>

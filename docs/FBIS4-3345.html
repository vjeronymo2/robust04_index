			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 19 (XINHUA) -- With IBM, Compaq and  other world big-name computer businesses biting into the  burgeoning China market, China's largest computer enterprise has  mapped out a blueprint to vie for a larger share both of the  home and the world markets.    According to Vice-President Li Qin of the Beijing Legend  Computer Group Corporation, the corporation sold a total of more  than 27,000 microcomputers, or seven percent of the Chinese  market, to rank top among the country's computer enterprises and  companies.    He said that his corporation will strive to raise its sales  volume to 45,000 to 50,000 sets, or some ten percent of the  domestic market.    Almost all of the world's well-known computer manufacturers  and companies are betting on the Chinese market, the potentially  largest single market of the world. They have virtually ignited  a battle for a share of the China market, Li said.    He added that many Chinese computer undertakings have been  forced out of business as their foreign counterparts keep  encroaching.    His Legend group has to outpace or at least follow closely  the development tempo of the home market, if it is to survive  the ever tougher market competition, the vice-president stressed.    Official statistics show that the sales volume of computers  in China last year was up 80 percent over 1992, but the market  share for Chinese-made computers declined, standing at 37.8  percent of the total.    Li disclosed that his corporation will undertake drastic  changes this year, as it has laid down a package of bold reform  measures designed to help institute an operating set-up that  will reflect market fluctuations.    The corporation will, to the fullest extent, bank on  high-tech advantages to renew its product models as fast as the  world market alters. Meanwhile, it will tap both the visible  and invisible resources brought in by its brand-name products  and the credible image that the company enjoys, according to Li.    To respond to the market more promptly, the corporation will  this year improve its purchasing and selling channels as well as  the form of credits and loans. It will also cut down the  delivery time from more than three months to less than a month.    The vice-president said that his company expects to bring 10  percent off the cost of computers by speeding up working capital  turnover and reducing expenditure, so as to make Legend brands  more competitive in terms of pricing.    To cater to the diversifying needs of the domestic market,  the Legend group has been engaged in developing high-quality and  inexpensive new models while promoting its already first-class  brand names.    Li said that his company will spare no efforts to improve  the  current agency system. At least some 200 agents will be added  this year to help form a national distributing and marketing  network characterized by branch companies, occupational agents  and regionally-stationed agents.    Meanwhile, the legend group will spend five million yuan to  raise the number of maintenance centers from 31 to 70, scattered  across the country. The guarantee period will also be extended  from one year to three years so as to provide better after-sale  service for all customers.    The vice-president said that the corporation will earmark a  further 10 million yuan for publicity to make both the company  and its brands better known.    According to him, the corporation has reformed its  management  regime and re-organized its leadership, giving all departments  autonomy in personnel matters, budgeting and policy-making.    He said that nine out of ten general managers of the  corporation's 43 branches are in their thirties.    According to Yang Yuanqing, a branch manager, Legend brand  computers have outplayed their national cousins in sales volume  for two years running. The corporation now produces one tenth  of the world's total output of major computer components.    The assets of the Legend group has grown from a mere 200,000  yuan in 1984, when it was established, to more than 400 million  yuan, and it has set up -- at home and abroad -- 20 branch  companies, two research and development centers, one  experimental factory, two production bases and one training  center, Yang said.    A poll last year showed that the Legend group was among the  five microcomputer manufacturers best received by Chinese  customers, the only one from China.    Vice-President Li Qin said that the Legend group, joined by  the country's other big computer businesses, has vowed to  develop a series of "Chinese" computers in an attempt to  vitalize China's fledgling computer industry.    "The banner of China's computer industry shall after all be  held up high by the Chinese, and the development track of  China's computer industry will eventually be opened up by the  Chinese too," Li noted.</p>

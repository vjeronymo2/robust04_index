			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre The curtain falls after about thirty seconds of The Tempest at the Bristol Old Vic. Prospero has ambled on in civvies, slipped into the magic gear, and wants to prove he can create a sea-storm from degree zero. Why not just start? Andrew Hay's production, like many Tempests, shackles itself to the idea that because the play deals with the nature of theatrical fiction ('Our revels now are ended . . .'), it is necessarily dramatic. In fact, the play works best as a small chamber piece, a meditation on redemptive art, and forgiveness. Derek Jarman's unmatched 1980 film, all whispered hints and guesses at the play, set the action in the half-light of Prospero's imaginings. Here at Bristol, Mick Bearwish's monochrome design is an open tilted pentangle, fit for a magus, with matching floor-plan. It works best from the upper galleries, not ground level. Through the pentangle, a raised, curtained area serves as home to the apparitions and sprites. But the action fails to create energy within this promising empty space. It needs to be sharper, more focussed, and better deployed. The opening storm scene, instead of being a riot of confusion, is a tame cotillion of courtiers edging along a gangplank, taking turns to speak. This is far from Ariel's description, 'I flamed amazement.' The closing reconciliation scenes have the air of an awkward photo-call with no one in charge. There are thematic problems in the relation between Prospero (Ewan Hooper) and Miranda (Sally Mais); he is perpetually choleric, and she testily assertive, straight from Personal Growth therapy. Her character's strength has subtler springs; the daughter who speaks up to Prospero is not the same girl who is scared of Caliban, who gives herself to Ferdinand, and who is wide-eyed at the New World. When Hooper is telling her his life story, he bows and defers to her; this looks wrong on stage. Coleridge knew that Ariel and Miranda, too much alike, should be kept apart; this Miranda rivals Caliban for chutzpah. Elsewhere a lacklustre court has Richard Mayes' fine, solemn Gonzalo and Freddie Lees' super, Yorkshire Trinculo as exceptional extremes, with Sebastian (Simon Walter) as a free radical. However, the production finds a great resource, which should be more prominently used, in Ariel (Paul Brennen), Juno (Maria Sherry) and Iris (Tim Kirkus). Sherry and Kirkus dance an erotic body-sculpture for the wedding masque, suspended over the stage; and all bring a physicality to the Old Vic Company. Good ambient music from John O'Hara keeps the magic afoot, and under-used animation projected onto gauze screens gives the production welcome diversity. But at present this is not the play which Shakespeare's editor, Warburton, described as 'the noblest Effort of that sublime and amazing Imagination.'</p>

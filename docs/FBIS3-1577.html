			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Tian (7806 3944): "Wang Dan Is Forced by </F> the Authorities To Withdraw Invitations Issued to 200 Democratic  Activists To Attend His Beijing Birthday Party"]    [Text] Wang Dan, leader of the student-led democratic  movement in 1989, celebrated his 24th birthday yesterday.  However, following the mainland authorities' intervention,  nearly 200 people who had taken part in the democratic movement  in 1989 and who received invitations could not attend his  birthday party. They were replaced by Wang Dan's former  schoolmates, relatives, and family members who had nothing to do  with the 4 June Incident. If this gathering had been realized,  it was believed it would have been the largest meeting of  democratic activists who have been banned by the Beijing  authorities since the 4 June Incident.    A democratic activist who was invited to Wang Dan's birthday  party said: The authorities attached great importance to the  "mass gathering of democratic activists" for fear that Wang  Dan's birthday party would develop into a political rally.  Departments concerned interrogated Wang Dan after learning that  heavy-weight democracy activists who had been arrested by the  CPC in the 4 June Incident -- such as Zhou Duo, Liu Xiaobo, and  Bao Zunxin -- were included in the list of nearly 200 guests to  whom invitations had been sent, as well as other people involved  in the democratic movement in 1989.    A friend of Wang Dan said: The day before yesterday, CPC  departments concerned talked to Wang Dan for a whole day to try  to persuade him to reset the guest list for his birthday party,  otherwise Wang Dan would bear all the consequences. However,  Wang Dan said the party was a form of celebrating his birthday,  and as a citizen, he was entitled to make any choice.    During the one-day talk, the departments concerned stressed  that the mere gathering of these people was politically tinted  and that he could not but acknowledge this fact. They told Wang  Dan: You now have only two choices. The first is to change the  list of your birthday party guests; none of the people involved  in the 4 June Incident may attend. The second choice is to  cancel the birthday party, and everything must be handled in a  low-key manner. At last, Wang Dan said that he was willing to  cancel the invitations to nearly 100 "sensitive figures."  Instead, he celebrated his 24th birthday with about 30 former  schoolmates, relatives, and good friends.    It was understood that Wang Dan was very careful in setting  the invitation list. For example, Wei Jingsheng, the democratic  fighter who was released not long ago, and a number of even more  sensitive figures were not included on the list.    A Beijing scholar said: It is no surprise that the CPC has  taken this move, and Wang Dan should have been psychologically  prepared for it right from the beginning. For the CPC, this is  the eve of the opening of the plenary sessions of the National  People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese  Political People's Consultative Conference, and so foreign  reporters -- particularly those from Hong Kong and Macao -- have  arrived in Beijing one after another. If this party had not  been stopped promptly, similar gatherings might have been many  times, and then the authorities might find them more difficult  to control. Hence, this incident also helps test the extent to  which the CPC can put up with democratic activists. Wang Dan's  birthday party was held in a restaurant on the opposite side of  Hotel (Merdia) in the western suburb of Beijing.</p>

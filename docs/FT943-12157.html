			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / IMF acts fast to woo Kuchma The encounter between Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, and Mr Leonid Kuchma, the new Ukrainian president, in Kiev today will be remarkable in two respects. The visit, two weeks after Mr Kuchma's election victory, suggests the IMF - belying its careful image - is prepared to move quickly where Ukraine is concerned. Mr Kuchma's decision to make an IMF meeting one of his first acts in office is also a signal that Ukraine, which over the past three years has gained a reputation as one of the most economically backward republics, may have begun to appreciate the importance of economic reforms and links with western financial institutions. IMF representatives caution that no agreements are scheduled to be signed but senior Ukrainian officials hope it could be a turning point. If Kiev undertakes three fundamental reforms - liberalisation of its exchange rate, an austere budget and continued monetary discipline - IMF officials say that within the next few months Kiev could receive a Dollars 700m (Pounds 452m) systemic transformation loan. That agreement could pave the way for Ukraine to receive the Dollars 4bn in financial assistance offered at the Group of Seven meeting in Naples. 'The opportunity to reach an agreement with the IMF is greater now than ever before in Ukrainian history,' said Mr Volodymyr Kuznetsov, one of the president's senior economic advisers. 'We have a consensus on the necessity to conduct market reforms. Our new president has the political will which (ex-president Leonid) Kravchuk lacked. The only question is speed.' Mr Oleh Havrylyshyn, the Ukrainian associate director at the IMF who was an outspoken critic of the economic policies of the Kravchuk government, says 'the IMF has been discussed more often in Ukrainian government circles over the past two weeks than it had been over the past two years.' 'There's a sense throughout the country that there is a new opportunity for reform,' he said. 'Ukraine now has the chance Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary seized three years ago although, because of the economic deterioration over the past three years, Ukraine now faces a much more difficult task.' However, Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, a former cabinet minister and one of Ukraine's most zealous advocates of market reforms, warns that Mr Kuchma's economic programme will be largely shaped by appointees to his administration. He said Mr Kuchma could also face fierce opposition from the conservative parliament. 'From the standpoint of the fund, Ukraine is a priority,' an IMF official said. 'There is no delay and we are interested.' Western diplomats in Kiev said the IMF has been under political pressure to reach an agreement with Ukraine, whose stability is seen as a keystone to recovery in the region.</p>

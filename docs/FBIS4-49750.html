			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Lu Ti (7627 6611): "China's Progress </F> in Secretly Building Aircraft Carrier"]    [Excerpts] Military Expenditure Increases by 10  Billion Yuan for Mysterious Use    At the Second Session of the Eighth National People's  Congress, which was held in March this year, budgeted military  expenditure increased by 20 percent over last year to 52 billion  yuan. Everyone knows that the CPC has cut 1 million troops from  the Army over the past several years, and it is alleged that the  cuts will continue this year, but military expenditure has  greatly increased at the same time. Where is the money going?  The CPC's official explanation is that they will greatly  increase remuneration for officers and men, and, in particular,  increase wages and benefits for senior military officers to  allow high wages to sustain honesty, solve the problem of  servicemen's living conditions, tackle the phenomenon where  servicemen's living standards are lower than civilians as a  result of economic reform, and upgrade servicemen's social  status, which is far lower than before.    In fact, the above-mentioned explanation is a superficial  reason. This 10 billion yuan cannot all be spent on "improving  the standard of living of servicemen." A large portion of the  money will be used to fund research and the manufacture of an  aircraft carrier. [passage omitted]  <H5>  Neither Affordable Nor Technologically Viable </H5>   Construction of an aircraft carrier involves combining the  most advanced modern science and technology. Crucial problems,  such as ship-borne aircraft, antisubmarine technology, and air  defense radar, are the weak links of military technology in  China, and judged from current standards, it seems that a  breakthrough will not come easily. Therefore, although China  can produce 10,000-ton cargo ships, it cannot build an aircraft  carrier.    In its attempts to buy one, China has already contacted  several countries, and a case widely known to the international  community was the negotiations to purchase one from Ukraine.  After the disintegration of the Soviet Union, Ukraine, one of  the former republics, told the CPC it was willing to sell an  unfinished aircraft carrier to Beijing. Tian Zhen, president of  China's Naval Command College, led a delegation to bargain with  Ukraine, which had asked for $2.4 billion. For a "Kuznetsov"  class aircraft carrier, which has strong attack ability and good  self-defense capability, this price should be considered fair to  the Chinese Navy, which still does not have the ability to build  and organize an integrated task force, this type of Soviet  aircraft carrier, which has a very strong combat ability in  itself, is perhaps more suitable than a U.S. aircraft carrier.    But they failed to sign an official contract on the deal in  the end. Minister of defense, General Chi Haotian, said during  a trip to Malaysia that this was because China's defense budget  did not have the money to buy it. Price was perhaps one reason,  but the main reason, according to sources, was that Russia  refused to provide the electronic equipment needed for the ship.  During a trip to the United States, Ivan Plyushch, chairman of  the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, was asked about the sale of the  aircraft carrier "Varyag" to the Chinese Navy, and he  categorically denied the deal. The issue of purchasing an  aircraft carrier has subsided since the denials by both sides.  <H5>  Purchase of a Retired and Damaged Australian Ship at Low </H5> Price    After the negotiations with Ukraine ran aground, China  contacted the Australian military and bought a small, retired  aircraft carrier from them. Because it was bought at the price  of "scrap steel from a dismantled ship," the price was ideal.  Not only was this ship very old, but it was also weak in combat  ability, and hence, was dumped at Guangzhou's Huangpo Military  Academy, for the viewing pleasure of naval officers and  personnel specializing in research on aircraft carriers, and for  the first time a real aircraft carrier had been provided by  China's military to relevant personnel for technological  research. For communist China's research personnel, who had  only seen pictures of such a huge vessel, this retired  Australian ship was first-hand teaching material.  <H5>  Internal Exhibition of Defense Weapons Frustrates People </H5>   The lack of knowledge of aircraft carriers within the  Chinese  military can be illustrated by the following incident.    In November 1990, a military museum in a western suburb of  Beijing held an internal "exhibition of the most advanced  defense weapons," and the organizers were the General Staff  Headquarters and the State Commission of Science, Technology,  and Industry for National Defense. The exhibition was only open  to senior military officers, industrial circles, and important  political figures.    During the exhibition, a model of an  aircraft carrier and models of an carrier-led task force  attracted a large number of visitors, among them Air Force  Commander Wang Hai and Navy Deputy Commander Li Jing, as well as  Ding Henggao, Xie Guang, and Ye Zhendai, who are respectively  minister and vice minister of the State Commission of Science,  Technology and Industry for National Defense. The visitors  learned that the construction of a carrier-led task force not  only required various technologies, but also a handsome amount  of money. Even the construction of a task force led by a  medium-sized Soviet "Kiev-class" aircraft carrier would require  more than 5 billion yuan.    A guide at the exhibition gave a detailed explanation of the  aircraft carrier concept and the necessary support facilities;  afterwards, the visitors, who included the most senior military  officers in communist China, realized that the construction of  an aircraft carrier is never simple and that it was a far cry  from the current technology level possessed by Communist China.  <H5>  "Walking on Two Legs" </H5>   To buy, no money; to build, no technology. Facing this  reality, the CPC decided to "walk on two legs," that is, on the  one hand, continue contacts with foreign arms dealers, negotiate  the purchase of an aircraft carrier and supporting weapons and  facilities, and buy little by little; on the other hand, muster  military experts, scientists, and technologists to tackle "key  problems" in researching and manufacturing an aircraft carrier.  <H5>  CPC's Ultimate Goal Is To Build Aircraft Carrier Itself </H5>   Since the 1980's, in the area of weapons purchases, the CPC  has obviously laid emphasis on facilities related to aircraft  carriers. As early as 1985, the Chinese Navy bought the "DUUX-5  Sonar" from France, and used it in its nuclear-powered ballistic  missile submarines and research on carrier-based antisubmarine  technology. In 1986, Communist China purchased "towed array  sonar" from the United States; and in 1988, it approached the  Italian military in an attempt to buy a comprehensive sonar  combat system and multifunctional control board from the Italian  Navy. The above-mentioned activities were all carried out  before the CPC formulated its long-term plan to develop an  aircraft carrier, and this shows that from the every beginning,  the CPC has inclined to build a series of aircraft-carrier-type  weapons and equipment itself and has strengthened research in  this area.    According to information disclosed by sources, in the  process  of manufacturing a series of weapons and equipment for aircraft  carriers, the weakest technological links facing the CPC are  early warning aircraft and air-to-air refueling.    During the Gulf war, the United States' E-2C early warning  aircraft successfully directed Saudi Arabian fighters to shoot  down two Iraqi Mirages in just 10 seconds. This U.S. early  warning plane has since become a model for similar kinds of  aircraft, and the CPC has frequently hinted at its interest in  this kind of aircraft to the U.S. Government and military. But  because of the significance of the matter, which is too  sensitive, and out of global strategic considerations, the  United States has never agreed to the CPC's requests.    With no way to go, the CPC approached Britain, saying it was  interested in buying the "Nimrod" anti-submarine early warning  aircraft, which was still under research. Research on "Nimrod"  has already cost the British Government 900 million pounds, and  the test results still fail to satisfy the military. Mrs.  Thatcher became angry and ordered a halt to the testing, and  went to the United States to buy readily available early warning  planes. Then, the CPC came and said it was interested in buying  the plane, and the suggestion was undoubtedly a chance for  Britain to revive the project, which made the British Government  and arms manufacturers extremely happy. But the matter has been  stalled for several years, and there is still no result. If an  agreement cannot be reached, perhaps the reason stems again from  the CPC's "political considerations," and it seems that the  intensifying political row in recent years between China on the  one hand, and Britain and the Hong Kong government on the other  hand, has caused the CPC drop its intention to purchase.  <H5>  Aircraft Carrier Overall Planning Group Drafts Overall Plan </H5>   In order to meet the need of the overall plan to develop an  aircraft carrier, a few years ago, the CPC founded a group to  take charge of the development of an aircraft carrier; the group  was headed by Liu Huaqing, a former commander of the Navy and  vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, and included  senior naval officers, such as Navy Commander Zhang Lianzhong  and Deputy Commander Xing Yongning.    According to information revealed by internal circles, at  present, the group has decided to use the Chinese-built J-8 II  fighter planes as ship-borne aircraft and the J-6 as an  air-to-air refueling aircraft. The J-8 II, after its successful  landing on a simulated deck at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987,  has been chosen as one type of ship-borne aircraft, however,  according to information, the CPC is carrying out research on  another type, which is lighter and has all-weather capability  and more advanced avionics, to replace the J-8 II in the future.  Although the J-7 fighter bomber, which is equipped with  British-made "Spey" engines and navigational systems, the  "Yingji 8" air-to-surface guided missiles, and the "C-101"  anti-submarine guided missile, was a new product of the Xian  Aircraft Company in 1987, the CPC authorities only list it as a  naval "shore-based aircraft" and do not consider it a ship-borne  aircraft; this indicates that the military probably has a better  type of ship-borne aircraft under research or being built.   <H5>    CPC Begins Propaganda for Building Aircraft Carrier </H5>   The military disclosed that not long ago, the first "naval  work meeting" since the founding of communist China was held in  Beijing, where the senior level reviewed naval policy and fixed  the Navy's development strategy for the 1990's and the early  21st century. Within that plan, the development and construction  of an aircraft carrier was set as the main military goal of the  early part of the next century.    Recently, in order to support the arrangements of the senior  level, relevant magazines on the mainland have carried articles  on aircraft carriers to show support from "public opinion."  HAIYANG ZHISHI [Ocean Knowledge] specifically opened a column  on the issue of "China's aircraft carriers" to discuss the  necessity of building China's own aircraft carriers; HANGHAI  [Navigation] said that "letters and submissions come from every  corner of the country" "suggesting the construction of China's  aircraft carrier." This is to show the people's extensive  support for the CPC's plan to build an aircraft carrier. A  person in charge of propaganda for national defense in communist  China wrote down his wishful thinking: "If we buy an aircraft  carrier from a foreign country, we will have to pay $4-5  billion, and this is obviously impossible. However, if everyone  in China gave 4 yuan, then 4.4 billion yuan could be collected  from across the country, and this could build a 40,000-ton  medium-sized aircraft carrier for the Navy, as well as a task  force which could fight." This may be the true reason why the  CPC has carried out propaganda. Once again it wants to  appropriate military expenditure from the people in a disguised  form.  <H5>  "Century-Transcending Personnel" Are Being Trained </H5>   On the other hand, the training of senior officers for an  aircraft carrier is busily underway. The diary of the commander  of the North Sea Fleet, now no longer viewed as classified  information, shows that at Lushun Naval Base in April 1987,  "today, naval airmen will practice landing and taking off on a  simulated aircraft carrier flight deck." "Chief test pilot Li  Guoqiang has spent the past two years preparing for this  project."    In 1988, Guangzhou's Naval Shipping Institute opened a  "class  to train flying teams for the fleet," to make plans to train  senior personnel such as captains. The president of the  institute, surnamed Yao, said that the selection of a captain  for an aircraft carrier from among the ranks of excellent pilots  was a brand new concept, as well as one which was unprecedented  in the naval academies. The future captain of an aircraft  carrier could not just know about ships and not about flying.  Yao, who is a rear admiral, confirmed that this unprecedented  method had been proposed by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the  Central Military Commission, and had won unanimous consensus  among those in charge of the Navy.    As an expedient measure before an aircraft carrier is  available, the CPC began work in 1988 to build a naval base on  Yongxing Isle, one of the Xisha Islands, and this will reduce  the voyage from the mainland to the Nansha Islands [Spratlys] by  half, to 600 km. Although the naval base on Yongxing Isle is  mainly designed to strengthen sovereignty over the Nansha  Islands, if the CPC really has its own aircraft carrier by the  early part of the next century, then Taiwan, across the Strait,  will be the first to feel the repercussions, and perhaps this is  also one reason why the CPC is so eager to build a carrier.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The Panhellenic Socialist Movement  (PASOK) government's course in the past two and a half months is  a target of bipartisan criticism in the Greek press.    Writing in the 30 December Athens center-left daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA, Nikos Kiaos blames Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou for lacking a central policy, despite claims during  his electoral campaign that PASOK was ready to govern and,  hence, possessed solutions for the problems he inherited.  Initiatives in the domestic field, according to Kiaos, have  lacked the needed essential coordination. Measures have been  taken "helter-skelter," resulting in the submission of only a  few bills to the Chamber of Deputies. While low-key tones and  consensual solutions were stressed in the first few weeks of  government, in a departure from past acrimonious politics,  governmental initiatives have indicated a return to "partisan  patriotism" at times worse than the former New Democracy (ND)  Government's excesses, Kiaos contends. While this occurred in  the field of public transportation and in the armed forces  appointments, the economy is the sector where the lack of a  specific program has become most apparent, he notes. The  government had announced a dialogue with the various social  classes, setting the middle of January for the implementation of  the measures to be adopted. Kiaos believes the deadline will  pass without significant results, for the interlocutors of a  "weak and unstable" government remain inflexible. Foreign  policy is another sector that is deeply affected. The Skopje  problem remains unresolved and Greece is taking over the EU  [European Union] presidency at a time when relations with its  partners are "particularly poor." Kiaos' proof of the lack of  coordination is that Papandreou neglected to meet with either  the minister of foreign affairs or his deputy before they  traveled to Brussels on 20 December, where the former was to  deal with the Bosnian situation and the latter participated in  the meeting of EC foreign ministers. While the government has  only been in place for a brief time, this short period has been  sufficient to give an indication of its future, unsatisfactory  course, Kiaos concludes.    The lack of governmental coordination is discussed in an  article in the 24 December right-of-center Athens daily  ELEVTHEROS TIPOS. The article focuses on the disagreement  between Minister of National Economy Yiorgos Yennimatas, who  advocates an "immediate and drastic" cut in interest rates, and  Bank of Greece Governor Yiannis Boutos, who "categorically"  opposes such a move, arguing that Yennimatas' positions "do not  take into account the real economic situation." The article  also stresses the personal side of the disagreement, pointing  out that the two officials are on "different wave lengths"  within PASOK and that Yennimatas was displeased with Boutos'  appointment at the helm of the Bank of Greece. Furthermore, it  contends that Yennimatas is being "undermined" by other party  "heirs apparent," as well as certain--unnamed--close Papandreou  aides intent on his replacement. Finally, the article cites Bank  of Greece sources as stating that Yennimatas is under pressure  from a number of state-owned bank governors to lower the  interest on government bonds to allow them to reduce interest on  deposits, and hence on loans to commercial and private entities,  with a view to increasing their own profit margins.</p>

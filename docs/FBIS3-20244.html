			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Silvio Berlusconi at a news conference; place </F> not given -- live]    [Text] You can see that the figures are constantly being  updated. This is why we are waiting before we express our  definitive reaction and satisfaction. We are waiting for these  figures to become certain and final. We all hope they will be  similar to the ones we know already. To tell you the truth, I  hope that in the end we shall have even better figures. Given  the enthusiasm of people and the consensus we have had so far, I  think these figures will get even better.    I think we can already reach some conclusions. We started,  very frightened, many months ago. We made the decision to take  part in the elections three months ago. The situation was  completely different. There was the organized team of the Left,  which was about to come to power. They were convinced they had  power already. We saw before us an uncertain future, a future  for our country which was leading to something resembling a  regime, something which would have not been true democracy and  true freedom. We then decided to participate, naming the  alliance between Forza Italia, the League in the north, the  Christian Democratic Center, the Union of the Center, some  friends among the Radicals, and the National Alliance in the  center and in the south the Freedom Alliance. Since we wanted to  work in a different way in order to respond to Italy's real  problems, we added the name of Good Government. It is now the  Freedom and Good Government Alliance.    I think that -- considering these figures -- we can already  say that the Freedom Alliance has already reached its most  important goal: to give our country a future of democracy and  freedom.</p>

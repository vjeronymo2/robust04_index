			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Net income up 2% at Sandoz in first half Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceu-ticals, nutrition and chemicals group that has just acquired Gerber Food Products of the US for Dollars 3.7bn, raised net income 2 per cent in the first half to SFr1.01bn (Dollars 760m). Operating income grew a faster 7 per cent to SFr1.36bn on sales up 2 per cent to SFr8.2bn, 8 per cent higher in local currencies. But the net financial result tumbled from a SFr79m profit to a SFr90m loss because of price declines of securities held. Sandoz expected sales trends in leading markets to remain favourable in the second half and operating income to 'continue its upward path'. Gerber would be consolidated from August 25. Mr Raymund Breu, Sandoz finance director, said the baby food group would add Dollars 410m to group sales and Dollars 70m to operating income this year. At net income level, it would have no effect this year or in 1995. Group volume growth was 4.6 per cent in the first half, with a 10 per cent rise from agricultural chemicals, 5 per cent from construction and 4 per cent from both pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions. Prices were squeezed, so the improvement in the operating margin from 15.9 per cent to 16.5 per cent came from volume and cost improvements. Sales of the pharmaceuticals division were down 1 per cent to SFr3.59bn, reflecting government enforced price cuts in some countries and the strong Swiss franc. Sales of the nutrition division soared 29 per cent to SFr1.15bn, largely as a result of acquisitions last year. Sales in the chemicals and environment sector were flat at SFr2.76bn, with gains in agriculture and construction offsetting an 8 per cent slide in chemical sales, especially those to textile and paper makers.</p>

			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: LSE being denied a 'unique' opportunity Sir, What a tragedy for London if County Hall is sold for conversion to a hotel and leisure centre rather than used to rehouse the London School of Economics. And what an uninspiring desperate vision of London Michael Heseltine, the environment minister, and Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the London Residuary Body, seem to have to allow the proposed sale to proceed. If London is to hold its own in Europe it needs to strengthen and revive its education facilities. Every Londoner would benefit from the enhanced stature and improved facilities of the LSE relocating to County Hall. It is a unique opportunity for the school to establish itself as the leading European school of social and political science. It will be a contribution to a city straining under the pressure of tourists. On planning grounds alone, hotel and leisure use with attendant coaches should not be permitted. Is this an attempt by Taylor and Heseltine to burn the oil wells? And how does this square with Heseltine's pronouncements that the use of Somerset House should be non- commercial? Gideon Nellen, Nellen &amp; Co, 19 Albemarle Street, London W1</p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Arts: Billy Budd - Theatre Royal, Glasgow Unlike the hapless Captain Vere, who leaves his crew becalmed and mutinous after trying to engage the enemy when they are out of range, Scottish Opera chose its moment well. The appointment of a new Music Director is always an important one and the timing on this occasion was particularly felicitous. On the day when he was due to make his return to the company as guest conductor in a revival of Billy Budd Richard Armstrong was named as Music Director at Scottish Opera with effect from July next year. It is an appointment that places experience before novelty. During his long tenure at Welsh National Opera Armstrong built up an extensive and wide-ranging repertoire which should serve his new company well. In short, he knows about being in charge of opera in general, and Billy Budd in particular, as this revival reminded us. If memory serves right, he is a less full-bloodied interpreter of Britten's score now than he was at the time when he conducted it at Covent Garden; but the cumulative power of the opera was amassed scene by scene, and it is a special virtue in any conductor that he should allow so many of the words to be heard. The chorus and orchestra supported him superbly. Whatever the present financial tribulations at Scottish Opera, Armstrong will be taking over a company in very reasonable artistic shape, as capable of sighting an operatic success and bringing it successfully to battle as any other in Britain at the moment. If this Billy Budd never quite became an electric evening, it was nonetheless a performance true to Britten's intentions and with a few pertinent human touches of its own. The production, originally by Graham Vick, dates from l987, but has held together well as a company effort. There is the feeling of a real community on board ship, led by seasoned artists such as Eric Roberts's Mr Redburn and Gordon Sandison's Mr Flint, while younger singers like Iain Paton as the Novice and Quentin Hayes as Donald are also offered chances, well taken. The three principals looked every inch their roles. The innocent eagerness as well as the youth and energy of Billy Budd were nicely caught by Simon Keenlyside, who managed to suggest better than any other singer I have seen in the role a naive unawareness of the dangerous currents swirling around him. As Vere, Nigel Robson was particularly good at what one might call the 'Pears' aspects of the role, withdrawn, bookish, refined. Both sang well enough, though Keenlyside wants a little of cutting brightness to the tone, and the only potential disappointment of the evening was that the Claggart, Gidon Saks, was having to take things easily in vocal terms. When he is fully restored to health, he should make a terrifying Master-at-arms, not least because he is a head taller than everybody else, a towering demon, whose revelation of his own 'depravity' within wins for this character too an unexpected measure of sympathy. All were believable human beings. Indeed, the production's only serious imposition is to have the aged Vere on stage from time to time, a silent observer of events. But perhaps this is understandable if Billy Budd is to be a classic tragedy in the Grecian mould, with Vere the tragic hero forced to condemn the innocent and live on in the knowledge of his own guilt. For Britten never quite gets him centre-stage as he should.</p>

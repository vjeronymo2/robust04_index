			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that the  NATO operation against Serb positions, which attacked Gorazde in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, constitutes an important warning to the  Serbs. Expressing the hope that the Serbs will understand this  warning and withdraw from the areas surrounding the city, Cetin  said: If they do not withdraw, it is certain that the  operations will continue.    In a statement to TRT, Cetin recalled that since the onset  of  Serbian attacks around Gorazde, Turkey has advocated adopting  measures. Turkey wanted NATO to take action against Gorazde,  which was declared a secure area by the United Nations, just  like in Sarajevo, Cetin remarked. He added: It was, however,  the United Nations that was supposed to decide and make a  request on this subject.    Cetin recounted that following the UN Secretary General's  assessment yesterday, the United Nations applied to NATO and  asked for a limited operation around Gorazde. He continued:  Within the framework of a previously adopted decision on the  matter, NATO was ready to undertake this operation. It made a  decision quickly and conducted an air operation against certain  military targets around Gorazde. This is an important warning.  The Serbs should understand this. The Serbs must cease being a  country that disrupts peace in front of the whole world and that  continues attacks. I hope they will heed this warning and  immediately withdraw from positions they are occupying around  Gorazde. Otherwise, it is certain that the operations will  continue.</p>

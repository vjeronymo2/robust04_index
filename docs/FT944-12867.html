			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Japanese party disbanded A symbolic step in the reform of Japanese politics was completed yesterday when the party that triggered the current upheavals disbanded itself to prepare to merge with Opposition allies. The Japan New Party of former prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa chose the occasion of its first national convention since its birth in May 1992 to announce its disbandment. Mr Hosokawa, a former member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, founded the JNP out of repugnance for the complacency encouraged by the comfortable links between the bureaucracy, politicians and business. That theme has since become central to the political reform movement, and to the eight other potential members of the new opposition party, who are expected to follow the JNP's example and ritually close down over the next month or so. The new party is expected to be created in December. Opposition parties are now attempting to close ranks, in another attempt to put pressure on the LDP and eventually push it out of power.</p>

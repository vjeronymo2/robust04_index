			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: ANA tumbles to Y17bn in first half ALL Nippon Airways (ANA), the Japanese airline, reported a 39 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y17.35bn (Dollars 141.6m) for the first half to end-September, as total passenger volume rose, but the load factor fell on domestic routes. Sales for the half year rose 2.4 per cent to Y424.9bn, with passenger volume on expanding international routes rising 16.6 per cent, while the volume on domestic routes was 1.5 per cent higher. The slowing of the Japanese economy and attempts by companies generally to cut transportation expenses led to a fall in the domestic load factor from 75.0 to 70.2, while the international load factor edged higher from 69.8 to 70.4. ANA has tapped its cash reserves to fund expansion, as the country's securities markets are still frail and managers reluctant to lift borrowings. For the full year, ANA expects profit margins to remain under pressure, and sees a pre-tax profit of Y17.5bn, down 22 per cent, and an after-tax profit of Y3bn, down 60.5 per cent.</p>

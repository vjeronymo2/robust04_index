			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Filling the aisles by selling them cheap: Guy de Jonquieres examines Sainsbury's price offensive and change of direction J Sainsbury, Britain's largest supermarket chain, yesterday shook the food retailing sector by unveiling a two-pronged strategy to deal with what it admitted were big - and possibly long-lasting - changes in the country's grocery market. The group's most dramatic step has been to intensify industry competition by lowering the prices of 300 popular own-label lines. It has also signalled a longer-term shift by admitting that its core UK grocery business will expand more slowly. It said it would seek more growth from other types of retailing, at home and overseas. Mr David Sainsbury, chairman, said that although the company planned 23 new stores this year, 'we won't be able to get the sales increases in percentage terms that we have had in the past'. Capital spending totalled Pounds 431m in the first half, and the group expects to become cash-positive in the next two years. Mr Sainsbury said the latest price cuts could force a response from manufacturers, as well as other retailers. The prices of manufacturers' branded products would 'have to come down very significantly to compete'. Sainsbury's claims that 150 of its best-selling own-label lines are already 23 per cent cheaper on average than comparable branded products sold by Kwik Save, the leading discount chain. Some observers were surprised at the vigour of Sainsbury's initiative, since its first half sales and profits suggest that it has been little affected by discount competition. But Mr Sainsbury said an opportunity to expand own-label sales had been created by rivals' decisions to switch their marketing emphasis from quality to low prices. Sainsbury's move reflects growing confidence in the strength of its brand. Its own-label lines account for 57 per cent of its packaged grocery sales, the highest of any UK supermarket chain. The shift of approach follows a reassessment of strategic priorities in the year since Mr Sainsbury became chairman. His management style is more open and less autocratic than that of his predecessor, his cousin Lord Sainsbury. He is also more ready to acknowledge doubts in the City about the prospects for grocery retailing. 'Clearly there are worries. Anyone who said there was not an issue about discounters, about warehouse clubs, about how far development can go, would not be living in the real world.' He saw similarities with conditions in the late 1970s, when food retailers were mauled by cut-throat price competition. 'We're clearly now back in a period when people are again talking about discounting and price wars.' He believed the problems were due chiefly to the economic cycle, not to a permanent change in consumer psychology. However, he saw little evidence of rapid recovery and said Sainsbury's was ready for a long period of severe price competition. One option was to expand its chain of 10 Savacentre hypermarkets, which sell clothing, food and household products at small discounts. The company had originally considered building 15 such stores but now believed there was scope for 25. Mr Sainsbury claimed to be unworried by the threat from US warehouse clubs, such as Costco, which last month defeated a legal attempt by Sainsbury's, Tesco and Argyll to prevent it opening outlets in Britain. He said warehouse clubs relied on a 'fragile' trading formula, and Sainsbury's had learned much about competing with them from Shaw's, its US supermarket chain. One lesson was that other retailers could match the clubs' price advantage by buying their products more cheaply in bulk 'multi-packs'. But irrespective of conditions in the UK market, Mr Sainsbury said 'the logic of the business' would drive Sainsbury's to become more international in the next five years, with a strong emphasis on expansion in the US. That trend stemmed in part from the prospect of slower growth and reduced investment needs in Sainsbury's UK grocery business. Though Mr Sainsbury dismissed suggestions that the UK market was in danger of saturation, he said the annual rate of store opening would not exceed this year's level and might well fall later in the decade. Though the speed of international expansion would depend on finding the right opportunities, as much as 20 per cent of group turnover could come from overseas by the end of the decade, compared with 11 per cent last year. Its experience with Shaw's had convinced Sainsbury's that it could successfully transfer its expertise abroad. Mr Sainsbury gave no details of how the group planned to develop overseas, though his first choice was the US rather than continental Europe. He would prefer to grow organically, rather than by acquisition, and to expand into markets contiguous with Shaw's base in New England. Mr Sainsbury's other medium-term priorities were to improve the efficiency of supplier relationships and emphasise 'social responsibility' issues, such as the environment. 'These are the areas where we have to demonstrate in the next five years that we are really ahead of all our competitors,' he said. Results, Page 23; Lex, Page 20; London Stock Exchange, Page 42</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Jin Ye: "For The First Time, Intangible Assets Are </F> Appraised"]    [Text] The valuation of intangible assets, a new facet of  Chinese assets appraisal, has passed a milestone with the first  formal publication of an appraiser's findings.    Beijing Jiacheng Assets Appraisal Co Ltd disclosed its  appraisal of the intangible assets of five enterprises early  last month.    They are name recognition of the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel  Beijing, worth 264 million yuan ($30 million); of Hong Kong  Yizhou Ltd's mainland branch, 213 million yuan ($24.5 million),  of Beijing Ye Guangbei Distillery, 54 million yuan ($6.2 million  ), of Hainan Airline Co 203 million yuan ($23 million); and  Hainan Pisk International Airline and Tourist Club, 107 million  yuan ($12 million).    Name recognition is a measure of an enterprise's ability to  profit from the popularity of its name or the trademark of its  products. Other intangible assets are copyrights, patents,  service symbols, software, management systems and permission to  make a product.    "Our work aims to popularize the concept of intangible  assets," said Zhu Sheng, managing director of Beijing Jiacheng  Assets Appraisal. "Now, many Chinese are still blind to the  value of intangible assets, which hinders the development of  China's market economy.    Neglecting to appraise intangible assets may result in loss  of valuable fixed assets, Zhu said.    For instance, while co-operating with foreign investors many  Chinese enterprises fail to calculate the value of intangible  assets. And an inexact appraisal of intangible assets could  lead to losses as enterprises shift to shareholding companies.    At the same time, appraisals may help reduce the number of  trademark infringement cases by fixing a trademark's value.    Underestimating trademark value is a major problem in  current  appraisals of intangible assets, Zhu added.    A famous trademark like Tsingtao beer is valued at only 200  million yuan ($23 million) and Fenjiu is worth 30 million yuan  ($3.5 million).    In comparison, the trademark value of the immensely popular  Marlboro cigarettes exceeds $31 billion, twice the brand's  annual sales. And for Coca-Cola it is $24.4 billion, compared  with annual sales of $8.4 billion.    "It is a pity that China is not represented on the list of  the world's top 10 famous trademarks, although it has many  high-quality products bearing nationally famous trademarks," Zhu  said.    "One goal of China's intangible assets appraisal is to  establish the concept among people that trademarks may mean  much, as well as to help its own famous trademarks tap the  world's market."</p>

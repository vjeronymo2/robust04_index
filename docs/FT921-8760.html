			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: When it's time to call for help - Computers AS I explained in a recent article, the prices of retail software packages (word processing, spreadsheets, databases) remain unreasonably high because of the influence of corporate buyers. But when it comes to business software packages (accounting, invoicing, stock control, etc) the problem is the opposite: in this area of the market, prices are becoming too low. By far the most common application of computers is for accounting; a recent survey found that 52 per cent of small companies with a computer had bought it for this purpose. But when the black art of accounting is combined with the black art of computing, a brew is created that spells disaster. Into it strides the small-business buyer. Supremely ignorant on both subjects, but primed by the latest issue of his computer magazine, he is determined to get the best deal and the biggest possible discount. Experienced dealers have learned to recognise this character from a mile off. They do not have time or resources to give him free consultancy and education (which he wouldn't want, anyway). So, they sell him a machine at a discount, together with a copy of Sage Financial Controller, and make sure they do not get entangled in after-sales support. ('If you want technical support, sir, it is available free of charge from Sage over the 'phone for the first 90 days, or we can put you in touch with a training company'). When our friend gets home with his computer, he becomes acquainted with reality at last. It is not some magic box which, once unpacked, will automatically 'do the accounts' for him. Nor does accounting allow half-measures. If you make a mess of running a word-processing package, you simply revert to the typewriter; but with accounts packages you have burned your bridges because, after going on computer, you stop writing-up the previous manual books. Find out after six months that the new system is not working and there is nothing on which to fall back. The damage can be lethal if the company does not know how much it owes, or is owed, or what orders are outstanding, not to mention the auditor's fees at year-end as he clears-up the mess. When it comes to accounting packages, you must pay for professional help. At an absolute minimum, you should budget for one half-day's support to set up each module on the computer, and another half-day to run through the period-end procedures at the end of the first month. At present rates, that is Pounds 300 a module. So, if you want to run invoicing, sales, purchase and nominal ledgers, you should budget to spend Pounds 1,200 for training and support. This is where software pricing is important. A company buying top-range Tetra 2000 will pay Pounds 2,400 for the four software modules; a company buying Sage will pay as little as Pounds 349. Set against a purchase price of Pounds 2,400, Pounds 1,200 for training and support looks reasonable; but few people can bring themselves to accept they should pay this sort of money for a package that itself only cost Pounds 349. Yet, both companies will need an equal level of support (the Sage user will probably need more because his staff are less likely to be well-qualified). Most small-business users are not prepared to pay for the level of training and support they need to make a successful transition from manual system to computer. As business packages become cheaper and better, this problem becomes more acute. Recently, I tested two newly-released packages - Business Manager from Pegasus, and TAS Books from Megatech. Both are first-rate and offer state-of-the-art software design. The only problem is the price; to compete with mighty Sage, the suppliers have had to set them at Pounds 299 and Pounds 399. At this level users will not be willing to pay for support, so experienced dealers will not want to know. Both suppliers offer direct support over the telephone, but that is quite inadequate for products of this sophistication. There must be an expert on-site. Retail packages such as spreadsheets and word processing are essentially for personal use: if they do not work, a lot of someone's time has been wasted but not too much harm is done. However, applications like accounts and stock control implicate the entire company. If they go wrong, the potential damange is too great. Unfortunately, when all the talk in the computer magazines is about cheaper and cheaper prices, it is an enormous up-hill task to try to educate users into paying proper money for support and training. If you are a new computer-purchaser, look at this way. Take all the money you have saved by cutting prices of hardware and software and plough it back into buying better training and support from a good dealer. The result will be a much more successful installation.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: Old colonial captain to take controls at Aerolineas - Iberia's loans to the Argentine flag-carrier will convert to a majority equity share The three-year crisis surrounding the privatisation of Aerolneas Argentinas may now be close to a solution. The governments of Argentina and Spain are expected to announce soon that Iberia, the Spanish national airline, will complete its takeover of Aerolneas by lifting its stake to 85 per cent from 30 per cent. This will wipe out about Dollars 700m in loans Iberia has advanced Aerolneas. Both sides in the often bitter dispute say the new arrangement puts Aerolneas on a sound financial footing, and will allow Iberia to push ahead with modernisation of the struggling airline. The roots of the convoluted tussle go back to November 1990, when Iberia led a consortium of local investors that paid Dollars 1.87bn in a cash and debt-for-equity package for 85 per cent of Aerolneas. However, before the ink on the contract had dried, Iberia discovered that its Argentine partners were insolvent. Then, a disagreement with the government over payment terms escalated into an angry confrontation that ended with renegotiation of the contract. This required the government to partially re-nationalise Aerolneas, increasing its shareholding to 33 per cent from 5 per cent. Iberia, however, failed to improve Aerolneas's performance. It has had to pump almost Dollars 700m into the company since 1990 to keep it flying. Last year, Iberia demanded that the government contribute its share of a Dollars 500m capital increase to shore up Aerolneas's balance sheet. The refusal by the Argentine economy minister Domingo Cavallo to put any more money into Aerolneas sparked a new confrontation with Iberia. Iberia threatened to walk away from Aerolneas unless the government joined in the capital-raising exercise. In the end, Mr Cavallo decided to allow Iberia to convert its Dollars 700m loans into equity, substantially diluting the government's Aerolneas stake. This required a change in the law to allow Iberia to take a majority share in Aerolneas without altering its status as Argentina's national airline. The deal also dilutes the stakes of minority shareholders, nearly all of them Spanish and Argentine banks, with 27 per cent of the company. However, these banks merely served as a front for Iberia, whose stake in Aerolneas was previously limited to 49 per cent. Once the new arrangement is in place, the government's stake will be cut to 5 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent of Aerolneas will be held by the employees' share ownership scheme. Originally, the government wanted to sell its unwanted shares to private Argentine investors. However, it failed to find any serious buyers. Investor aversion to Aerolneas is hardly surprising. Not only is it a chronic lossmaker, but any fresh investor cash would go to Iberia. Furthermore, investors did not want to risk money in Aerolneas as long as Iberia remained in charge. In its three years under Iberia, Aerolneas has lost almost Dollars 500m. Last year's Dollars 223m net loss was 16 per cent more than in 1992, and revenues fell 10 per cent to Dollars 1.02bn. Despite Mr Cavallo's helpfulness in altering the shareholding regulations, Mr Manuel Moran, an Iberia executive on secondment as Aerolneas's chairman, complains the new rules could make his life harder by allowing foreign competitors into the protected domestic market. Still, he says Aerolneas's health is improving. He forecasts positive cashflow this year, thanks to cost controls, a sales increase of almost one-fifth, to Dollars 1.2bn, and recovering market share. He hopes to start making money in 1995. He wants to improve Aerolneas's poor performance on the important Miami corridor by leasing smaller and more efficient jets to on the larger and more efficient US competitors. Integration with Iberia and its associated companies in South America, notably Venezuela's Viasa will continue. Mr Moran and his predecessors have made similar promises before. Mr Moran, like previous Iberia executives, blames his difficulties on the government, predatory competition, adverse market conditions, and hostile staff. In private, government officials counter by maintaining that Aerolneas's greatest problem is Iberia's poor management. Wherever the blame lies, for an Argentina proud of its national symbols, losing control of the flag-carrier to its old colonial master will be a bitter blow.</p>

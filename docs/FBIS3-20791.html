			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Maroje Mihovilovic: "New Prime </F> Minister-Designate for `New' Times"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Slobodan Milosevic announced  Tuesday to whom he wants entrust the leadership of the Serbian  Government. He decided on Mirko Marjanovic, 57-year-old director  of the well-known Belgrade import-export firm Progres. At the  same time it was revealed how Milosevic plans to ensure  Marjanovic's election, even though Socialists do not have a  majority in the Assembly. A small Serbian party, New Democracy,  which had participated in the DEPOS [Democratic Movement of  Serbia] coalition as an ally of the SPO [Serbian Renewal  Movement] and gained five deputies in the Serbian Assembly,  decided to support Marjanovic and leave the DEPOS. Its leader  Dragoslav Mihajlovic might become deputy prime minister in  Marjanovic's government. Therefore, there is no doubt that  Marjanovic will be elected. The matter was settled by clever  party politics, the Serbian way. When other opposition parties  realized that they had been tricked and that the Socialists were  shrewder, as in the election for president of the Parliament,  they switched their to support to Marjanovic, saying that he is  an apolitical choice since he is a businessman and will  supposedly lead a government of experts capable of later forming  a government of national unity, which would consist of ministers  from the Socialist and opposition parties. Belgrade papers are  already predicting that Marjanovic may even include some people  from the opposition right from the start.    Mirko Marjanovic has a very interesting biography that  reveals why Milosevic selected him. He was born in Knin in 1937.  He is a Croatian Serb. He graduated from the high school in Knin  and earned a degree at the Belgrade School of Economics. In 1961  he was employed in Knin at Tvik, a factory producing screws,  where he eventually elbowed his way up to become deputy  director. In 1973 he left for the Belgrade firm Progres.    Now we have to tell something about Progres. It is not an  ordinary enterprise. It ranked among the leading Serbian  import-export firms next to Genex and Inex. These were the firms  that had at their disposal all the wealth of the former  Yugoslavia. They enjoyed political and military support and  concluded large business deals abroad as covers for the former  Yugoslav State Security. In this way Serbia was able to create  income for itself at the expense of the former Yugoslavia.    As soon as Marjanovic joined Progres, he was sent as its  representative to Moscow, which proves that he also worked for  the secret police. Then he climbed fast and in 1979 he became  director general of Progres, the post he has retained until now.  Belgrade Television reported the news of his candidacy with the  comment that Progres made great steps forward under his  stewardship. It deals in exports and imports in the areas of  heavy industry, construction, agriculture, and natural gas.    Mirko Marjanovic is a member of the Serbian Socialist Party  although he has not been politically active, which is probably  why Slobodan Milosevic selected him in these difficult times.  Because Marjanovic is a man without a public political past,  there will not be much discussion about his candidacy, as  illustrated by the initial reaction of the opposition parties.  Since his election is practically assured because of the  "betrayal" of New Democracy, the opposition is not trying too  hard, at least not in public, to undermine him. This way,  Milosevic has secured his rule under new circumstances, snuffed  out parties' threats, and ensured a new period of political and  social stability, partially because the economic program, which  began with the introduction of the super dinar, is still  thriving despite the malevolent forecasts. If nothing else, it  has succeeded in lowering inflation. With Marjanovic, Milosevic  has "bought" more time for the survival of his regime.</p>

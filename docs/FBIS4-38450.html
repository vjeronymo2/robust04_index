			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Irina Shegoleva] </F>   [Text] Sochi May 30 TASS -- A regular session of a  quadripartite commission held in Sochi on Monday discussed the  return of Abkhazian refugees and displaced persons to Abkhazia.    Taking part in the session of the commission are  representatives from a mission of a U.N. High Commissioner for  Refugees, the Russian Federation, Georgia and Abkhazia. The  commission is expected to look into a procedure of registering  refugees and all those who wish to return, and problems of  conducting an information campaign.    "There are strong differences between the sides about the  number of people wishing to return," said Deputy Chairman of the  Abkhazian Council of Ministers, Leonid Lakerbaya. "Abkhazia is  against using any approximate figures," he said. "In accordance  with an agreement signed in Moscow the right to return to  Abkhazia is given to all those who did not take part in military  operations. We shall abide by this rule," Lakerbaya added.    Abkhazian representatives insist on the fact that the  process  of refugee return should not be stepped up. For the time being,  they are prepared to discuss the return of refugees to the Galsk  region only. Lakerbaya believes that at the first stage, no  more than 200 applications, asking for permission to return,  shall be accepted, while the Georgian side insists on the fact  that the process of refugee return be stepped up as much as  possible.    Another demand made by the Abkhazian side is that those who  wish to return must confirm that they will not fight against the  lawful authorities and pledge to comply with Abkhazian laws.    A group of experts in charge of the information campaign met  before the commission began its work. Deputy Chairman of the  Abkhazian Minister of the Press and Information Beslan Gurdzhua  told ITAR-TASS that it is necessary to inform people about  current developments and create a favourable psychological  climate. "People are being frightened by statements on mass  return of refugees," Gurdzhua said. "No social and economic  conditions for this have been created in the republic yet, " he  added.</p>

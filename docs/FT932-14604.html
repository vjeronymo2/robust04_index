			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Finance and the Family: Pibs may fit the bill - Scheherazade Daneshkhu considers fixed-interest instruments FIXED-interest instruments are attractive against today's economic background of low inflation and relatively low interest rates. To those looking for income, the fixed-interest market is able to offer higher yields than the building societies. Two of the most accessible fixed-interest instruments for private individuals are bond funds and permanent interest bearing shares. Bond Funds Bonds are simply IOUs where the issuer agrees to pay interest and to return the capital on maturity. But since they can be traded, their market price varies during their life. They come in a variety of forms, the best-known in Britain probably being government-issued securities gilts). Few people hold a bond from issue to maturity, and the price at which they buy it might not be the same when they sell. Most gilts trade 'above par value' (in the jargon), so there is always a risk of capital loss - the sacrifice for getting a higher income than might otherwise be available. The relationship between the interest rate and the bond's price is measured by the yield. The running yield is calculated by dividing the interest rate by the market price. As prices rise, yields fall, and vice-versa. Many people feel they lack the expertise to buy individual bonds and find bond funds a convenient alternative. Most bond funds are unit trusts which, by investing in a portfolio of bonds, aim to provide the client with income and/or capital growth. Since investors must pay both initial and management charges, they will want to make sure the fund's performance makes up for the fees. The table of the 10 largest UK bond funds with three-year records shows the yield and performance in terms of percentage growth. Most of the funds listed invest in gilts but some, such as CU Preference, invest in the fixed-interest shares of companies. Since companies can go bust and the UK government cannot, the increased risk of CU Preference is reflected in an above-average yield, but its performance  -the lowest of the 10 - should caution investors not to look simply at the yield when choosing a bond fund. Some funds might offer a high yield which is achieved purely by eating up capital. That might be attractive to some investors, but they should know what they are buying. Investors should also be aware that profits from a bond fund are subject to capital gains tax - which is not the case if the investor had bought government securities directly. Barclays Unicorn gilt fund, the largest, has both a high yield and the best performance over three years of the 10 quoted. Apart from gilts, it also holds fixed interest securities in companies such as British Telecom and Barclays bank. The initial charge is 3.25 per cent on amounts up to Pounds 5,000 and reduces after that; the yearly fee is 0.75 per cent. Not all bond funds aim to give a high income. Whittingdale's Short Dated gilt fund, which has the lowest yield - 3.5 per cent - of the funds listed, is aiming for capital growth through investment in short-dated, fixed-interest securities. But its performance is lower than the sector average, although it is top over five years. Permanent Interest Bearing Shares These are issued by building societies to raise capital and are classified as debt. The market is small so far and began in July 1991 when Leeds Permanent launched the first issue. Pibs pay a fixed income twice a year net of basic-rate tax. Any gains when selling are exempt from CGT. But they are deeply subordinated - which means that if the society collapsed, holders would be last in the line of creditors for repayment. These risks are reflected in the yields, which are higher than those for bond funds. Since Pibs are irredeemable, the building society is under no obligation to repay the principal, so the original investment can be regained only by selling them. Like bonds, the investor is exposed to the risk of a capital loss. So far, though, most holders have seen the value of their shares rise. Indeed, since we published a table last month showing prices at midday on March 11, all have risen - gently, in most cases. Skipton and Bradford and Bingley 11 5/8 have risen by 0.5p, while Bristol &amp; West has seen a rise of just under 4p. Yields have fallen correspondingly but are still some of the highest available on the fixed-interest market. Hoare Govett says that, of the Pibs on issue, it believes Bristol and West 13 3/8 is the most under-valued. The society had a setback last year when interim results showed a 65 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, but it went on to register full-year figures which were down 42 per cent on the previous year. Hoare Govett says it believes the price for the Pibs fails to reflect the upturn at the full-year stage.

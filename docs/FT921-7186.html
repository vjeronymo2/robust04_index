			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Labour aims to end row over candidates LABOUR will this week attempt to clear up remaining pockets of internal wrangling in the Midlands and Merseyside by completing the selection procedures for candidates in five strife-torn constituencies. The process began last night with the confirmation that Ms Clare Short, MP for the safe Labour seat of Birmingham Ladywood, has been reselected as candidate by a 52 per cent vote of the local party. This follows a bitter struggle with opponents from local branches of the EETPU electricians union. The party's governing national executive is expected to give a final official endorsement to her on Wednesday as well as to candidates for the two other 'problem' seats in the Midlands of Nottingham East and Coventry South East and for candidates for the Merseyside seats of Wallasey and Liverpool Broadgreen. All five selections have been closely overseen by the national party to ensure no fresh embarrassments emerge before the coming general election. Officials at the party's Walworth Road headquarters in London have closely vetted the lists of candidates to make certain that charges of extremism, levelled against the Labour candidates in 1987, are not repeated. In Wallasey, for example, Mrs Lynda Chalker, the Tory MP, was widely considered to have slipped in by a narrow majority as a direct consequence of allegations of Trotskite entryism. In Coventry South East and Liverpool Broadgreen - the seats held by Mr Dave Nellist and Mr Terry Fields, the Militant-supporters sacked from the party last year - Walworth Road is seeking tough candidates ready to fight bitter struggles against the rebels, now standing as independent socialists. With the two main parties level-pegging in the polls, Labour cannot afford to lose Coventry South East and it must gain Nottingham East to stand much hope of forming a government after the election. The Nottingham seat, held by Mr Michael Knowles with a Tory majority of 456, has seen the local Labour party split by fierce rivalries in the Asian community.</p>

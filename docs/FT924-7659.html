			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Travel: No oiks or Hoorays - Keith Wheatley and family enjoy a French mobile home holiday IT SEEMS to me that relaxation on holiday is next to impossible if one cannot get on with fellow travellers. Who could enjoy a Caribbean strand if the beach bar were full of oiks swilling lager? How many skiing holidays have been made anxious by a careless chalet mixture of Hoorays lavishly employed in merchant banking and salaried civil servants anxiously counting their francs? The big barrier that companies that sell camping holidays have to cross with first-time punters is the pyschological question: 'Who else goes camping?' Gut-reaction and historical prejuice tend to suggest a mixture of the indigent and khaki-clad fresh-air fiends. Rumours continue to filter through that French camping is different, but it could just be good public relations. With four children under 10 who would willingly live on the beach if possible, I knew why I was at Camping de la Plage, just outside La Trinite-sur-Mer, in southern Brittany. But who else was there? My eventual answer, and subsequent Theory of Continental Camping, owes everything to the curious British practice of labelling car registrations with a letter revealing the vehicle's age. Adjacent to virtually every tent or caravan seemed to be a Volvo or similar respectable saloon with an E, F or G on the number plate: cars four and five years old. Where were the brand-new Sierras, the pristine Vauxhalls, the solid Rovers with only 15,000 miles on the clock? In short, what had happened to the company vehicle? My new-found tennis partner, the Rev Henry Whyte of Kingston, Surrey, (C registration Volkswagen Passat estate), confirmed my observations. Company man was not a camper. These were families where the bread-winner was self-employed, a partner in professional practice, or in jobs such as teaching - people of modest affluence, smart enough to buy a good car but not daft enough to suffer the punitive depreciation on a new one. They were also extremely good company. Sitting next to a chap for an hour while one's toddlers explore the gravitational mechanics of the playground slide, a good deal of ground gets covered. Statistics from Eurocamp confirmed my own evidence that three-quarters of their customers are on a second or third visit. French camp-sites provide a matchless environment for small children. Enclosed, with a pool, playground, companionship and usually adjoining a beach, they provide a context in which the big parental decisions are whether to eat out or light a barbecue. It may be fair to say that the tents, large and permanently-erected, are designed to make the experience as comfortable as possible. Yet somehow a tent does not make the kind of demands that even the most modest house can impose. Having twins still short of their second birthday, our family opted for a mobile home rather than a tent, on the grounds of easier washing facilities and wail-proof walls. With double doors and picture windows, it came close to the ideal of outdoor living. It might not be the average adult's perfect holiday, for it lacks even the minimum sophistication that makes everyone occasionally buy unsuitable clothes or pick up The New Yorker at airports. But people shrewd enough to buy those cars are probably going to escape by themselves - minus children - later in the year.

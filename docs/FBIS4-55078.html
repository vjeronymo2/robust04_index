			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Nikolay Vasilev, chairman of the </F> Alternative Social Liberal Party, by Elizabet Dafinova; place  and date not given: "We Will Not Support a Government With a  `Pirinski' Program"]    [Text] [Dafinova] Professor Vasilev, does the ASP  [Alternative Social Liberal Party] feel the DPS [Movement for  Rights and Freedoms] has deceived it, after everything that has  happened?    [Vasilev] One cannot compare interparty relations with  relations between personalities. Nevertheless, I would like to  say that the joint meeting of the NSD [New Alliance for  Democracy] and DPS parliamentary group decided to walk out of  parliament if Prof. Berov starts talking about specific  structural changes but then fails to do anything about it. I  think it is senseless for us to meet and adopt decisions if they  are not fulfilled.    [Dafinova] What will [Industry] Minister Bikov do now? Will  he follow Karabashev, as the ASP has recommended, or will he  rely on someone else's support -- perhaps the DPS?    [Vasilev] Minister Bikov's seat is firm. If he wants to  stay in the cabinet, it is certain he will do so. However, if  the government fails to change its formula and its economic  policy, we will not only withdraw our support, but will also  cease to take part in the government. From this point on, the  problem is a personal one. Bikov must decide himself what to do.    [Dafinova] At the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] rally on 1  May, Zhan Videnov said that he gives this cabinet another 30-40  days. Some people drew a connection with Valentin Karabashev's  gesture and predict that the ex-deputy prime minister will be  the next prime minister. Is this possible? With whose support  will this happen, with the help of the BSP?    [Vasilev] Naturally, Valentin Karabashev may become the next  prime minister, but it may also be someone else. As far as I am  concerned, this government is already finished. The government  that we supported until now was different, with a different  program. We will not support a government with a "Pirinski"  program. I hope the DPS will also understand this, that it is  not merely a matter of certain personnel changes, but of changes  in the government's policies. The government has started  carrying out a communist economic program. The Communists'  claims have gone beyond all reason.    [Dafinova] Nonetheless, is the ASP considering continuing  its talks about the cabinet with the other political forces?    [Vasilev] The NSD parliamentary group has reached a firm  decision that from now on it will not negotiate with either the  BSP or Berov's government. We will hold the door open only for  the DPS and SDS, and for the individual SDS parties, of course.</p>

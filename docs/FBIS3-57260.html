A six-year war over mainly Christian Nagorno-Karabakh, which  is seeking to break from Moslem Azerbaijan, has displaced  hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis according to humanitarian  [words indistinct] million.    Many of those who have sought refuge in hospitals or holiday  complexes here in Sumgait, 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the  capital, spend their days in frustrating idleness.    Uprooted, having no chance of finding work, their  indignation  deepens, particularly when they recall the day that Armenian  troops entered their villages.    "This war will only end when the Armenians get out of  Nagorno- Karabakh," insists 28-year-old Ruslamov Rovjen, who  said he fled his village of Lachin when it came under Armenian  control on May 17, 1992.    Lachin is part of a strategic Azerbaijani corridor linking  Nagorno-Karabakh to the republic of Armenia.    After their capture of the region in western Azerbaijan,  Armenian forces expanded their operations to areas south and  southwest of the enclave, leaving them in control of more than  20 percent of Azerbaijani territory.    "We can never again live with the Armenians," asserted  Rovjen, a musician, who said he had been forced to leave  everything behind -- including his favorite instrument, the  accordion.    Other refugees say Armenian troops set fire to their homes.  Some accuse Russian units from 7th Army and the 366th Special  Branch of backing Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.    They say they cannot understand how Azerbaijan can be seen  abroad as the aggressor in a conflict that has killed nearly  20,000 people in six years. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / UK Company News: GEC edges ahead to Pounds 356m GEC REPORTED a 'notably strong' performance in its three main divisions for the six months to September 30, though market conditions were not always favourable.

After tax of Pounds 119m (Pounds 117m) and minorities unchanged at Pounds 21m, attributable profits were Pounds 216m (Pounds 208m). Earnings were 8p (7.7p) and the interim dividend has been raised to 2.68p (2.55p). Divisional pre-tax profits were: electronic systems Pounds 87m (Pounds 86m); power systems Pounds 77m (Pounds 65m); telecommunications Pounds 61m (Pounds 60m); consumer goods Pounds 7m (Pounds 9m); electronic metrology Pounds 9m (Pounds 17m); office equipment and printing Pounds 15m (same); medical equipment Pounds 14m (Pounds 13m); electronic components Pounds 6m (Pounds 7m); industrial apparatus Pounds 8m (Pounds 12m); distribution and trading Pounds 5m (Pounds 7m); less other activities losses Pounds 4m (Pounds 5m). The order book rose to Pounds 11.9bn, an increase of 12 per cent since the March year end. Orders within GEC Marconi, the defence subsidiary, were 7 per cent higher at Pounds 4.9bn. Privately-funded research and development, including the company's share in joint ventures, was 12 per cent lower at Pounds 184m. Capital expenditure was 30 per cent lower at Pounds 67m.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Sales fall puts Iveco in further big loss IVECO, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, suffered a second successive heavy loss last year in the face of the continuing steep fall in west European truck sales. Last year's loss of Fl 187m (Pounds 67m) was only marginally lower than the loss of Fl 199m suffered in 1991. Iveco is incorporated in the Netherlands. Other leading European truck makers such as Volvo and Renault also suffered substantial losses last year, while Daf of the Netherlands was forced into receivership in February. Iveco's loss last year was also cushioned by the one-off gain of around Fl 90m from the sale of a 51 per cent stake in its forklift truck subsidiary, Fiat OM Carelli Elevatori, to Linde of Germany. The group's financial performance in the past two years has been burdened by the heavy launch costs for several truck ranges, which have been developed as part of the group's ambitious five-year, L5,000bn (Pounds 2.1bn) investment programme from 1988 to 1992 in new products and manufacturing facilities. Iveco's commercial vehicle sales fell by 6 per cent to 115,500 last year. Sales in Europe fell by 9 per cent to 93,000, but this was compensated by a 14 per cent increase in sales outside Europe to 22,500. Iveco sales volumes in the past three years have fallen by 21 per cent in west Europe from 118,400 in 1989 and by 15 per cent worldwide from 136,100. Demand continues to weaken and Iveco estimates European truck sales fell again in the first two months of 1993, by around 28 per cent from the same period a year ago. The company suffered heavy losses last year in particular in Spain, where it took over Enasa, the loss-making state-owned producer of Pegaso trucks in 1990, and in the UK, where it took over management control of the former Ford truck operations in 1986. Iveco Pegaso's net loss deepened to Pta32bn (Pounds 179m) from Pta20bn in 1991, while Iveco Ford truck's loss totalled Pounds 31m following losses of Pounds 39m in 1991 and Pounds 20m in 1990. Iveco Magirus, the group's German subsidiary, fell to a loss of DM56m (Pounds 22m) from a profit of DM52m a year earlier.</p>

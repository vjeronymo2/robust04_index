			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phase I products available through this announcement are as follows: (1) Mission Definition, a discussion of each team's goals and philosophy, with a technical discussion of operational constraints each team perceives; (2) Vision Statement, a non-technical narrative depiction of the teams' conception of their architectures over the next 20 years in urban, inter-urban, and rural contexts; (3) Logical Architecture, a set of diagrams and textual statements describing the relationship between each architecture's functions and its information needs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Physical Architecture, a further set of diagrams and specifications that transpose the logical architecture components onto the physical systems that make up IVHS;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Traceability Matrix, which ensures that all required high-level IVHS services are accounted for at the lowest levels of the architecture (both logical and physical);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Evolutionary Deployment Strategy, a three-tiered set of temporal snapshots (at 5, 10, and 20 years) of the architecture, and how the teams envision the progression from the present towards their final vision at the 20-year mark; (7) Architecture Evaluation Plan, which describes the method(s) used by each team in the analysis of its architecture; (8) Initial Cost Analysis, an attempt at pricing the various ways in which IVHS will be delivered through products and services, including a market analysis and suggestion of how ``service packages'' could be marketed; (9) Feasibility Study (including risk analysis) exploring the various technical and institutional risks to which each architecture is subject, and how each team proposes to mitigate these risks; (10) Analysis of Data Loading Requirements, exploring the wire and wireless communications demands on the architecture; (11) Initial Performance and Benefits Summary, a discussion of the ways in which each architecture contributes to the broader goals of IVHS; and (12) Preliminary Evaluation Results Summary, detailing the results of analysis, in particular the simulation modeling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOT is interested in the opinions of the public, industry, all levels of government, public and private transportation agencies, and other stakeholder organizations who review these documents. Specifically, DOT is interested in comments regarding the technical feasibility, user acceptability, and general viability of the four proposed architectures. Those who wish to provide comments only on the Phase I Summary Report are encouraged to do so as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The entire set of documents (except the Phase I Summary Report) can be obtained for $225.00, to cover the cost of reproduction and shipping. Those who wish to view the documents at no cost may do so at multiple locations throughout the United States; for dates of availability and locations nearest to you, contact the FHWA at the address listed above under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Phase I Summary Report will be sent in late October, free of charge, to all who respond to this announcement. The Phase I Summary Report will also be available to all who attend the public forums.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A series of 11 public forums will be held during the second and third weeks of November 1994 to present the architectural approaches developed in the first phase of the architecture program, and to allow for stakeholder input based on the information presented. Dates and general locations of these forums are listed above under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> More information on these regional forums, including specific locations, may be obtained from the FHWA contact listed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments received as a result of this announcement, as well as the information obtained during the upcoming series of public forums, will be used in the process of selecting which of the four architecture concepts will continue into Phase II of the program. This second phase will begin in early 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  23 U.S.C. 315; 49 CFR 1.48; Pub.

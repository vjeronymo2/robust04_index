			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: UK manufacturing would look better if compared with rivals (1) Sir, Before there is any more tub-thumping by Roger Lyons (Letters, March 4), the prime minister or any other of the great and good about the decline of British manufacturing, might it not be worth spending a bit of time on examining whether a 'decline' has, or is, taking place? Looking at manufacturing's contribution to gross domestic product in other English-speaking countries and France, the figures appear to be roughly the same as ours. It is true that manufacturing output has fallen in the UK but that is normal in a recession. Historically, British manufacturing industry was over-manned and under-managed. Shedding labour at all levels is an encouraging long-term trend, however dismal for the individuals concerned. Better education and a reduction in costs such as taxes and regulations for all businesses, whether service or manufacturing, is the correct response. Trying to revive the Midlands' galvanised steel widget industry - by whatever means - is a waste of time and money.

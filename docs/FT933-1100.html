			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hepworth bullish despite fall BRITAIN'S construction sector took heart yesterday from bullish statements by Hepworth, the building materials and boiler group, which said it had spotted definite signs of recovery in the UK, in spite of a 16 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits. Mr John Carter, chief executive, said the outlook for trading was now more promising than in recent years. 'There are pockets of recovery appearing right across our operations, particularly in building products,' he said. The group was announcing a fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 32.8m to Pounds 27.5m for the six months to June 30. Sales were 4 per cent higher at Pounds 331.9m. Mr Carter said the results in the first half were 30 per cent better than in the second half of 1992, reflecting the savings achieved in a wide-ranging cost reduction programme and the upturn in the UK. Hepworth cut some 500 jobs in the first half, mostly in the UK. Mr Carter said a further 200 would be taken from the remaining 8,500 staff, mainly in the continental European businesses. Operating profits were down in all divisions, but Mr Carter said Saunier Duval, the group's French boiler subsidiary, had performed well in difficult circumstances. Saunier Duval, which fell 7 per cent at the operating level to Pounds 12.5m, had been hit by weak currencies in its main export markets, Spain and Italy. Hepworth's building products division showed a slight decline in operating profits from Pounds 11.9m to Pounds 11.1m, on sales down 1.5 per cent to Pounds 79.2m. Mr Carter said the decline had been cushioned by cost cutting. Home products fell 21 per cent to Pounds 5m, while minerals and chemicals came in Pounds 2m lower at Pounds 3.5m. Refractories fell 20 per cent to Pounds 3.7m. Earnings per share fell from 11.3p to 9.1p and the dividend is maintained at 5.5p.</p>

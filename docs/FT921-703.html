			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Temperatures soar in health quarrel - Day of Claim and Counter-Claim over 'Leak'; Voters not swayed by row; Prime Minister joins the fray AFTER a day of extraordinary allegations over the 'leak' that disclosed the identity of Jennifer Bennett, the girl who was the subject of Tuesday's Labour election broadcast, some facts had become clear while others remain in heated dispute. Jennifer's name apparently found its way into the newspapers through a combination of two factors. The first was inquiries by The Independent which had discovered Jennifer's identity and questioned the consultant involved. The second was Conservative Central Office's suggestion to the consultant, after he contacted it, to get in touch with other newspapers, and the party's own call to the Daily Express. The sequence of events seems to have been as follows: End of February: Labour begins work on the election broadcast, The Story of Two Girls with the Same Problem, in consultation with Mr John Bennett, Jennifer's father. March 15: Mr Peter LeeRoberts, Jennifer's grandfather and a former Conservative mayor of Faversham, Kent, sends a fax to Central Office warning about the broadcast. The Tories have repeatedly stressed this did not include the name of the child. But her grandfather insisted Mr Bennett's name was mentioned. According to Labour, Mrs Margaret Bennett, the mother, also telephones the Tories. March 24: Midday. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, shows journalists a preview of the broadcast. In Manchester, Ms Julie Hall, Mr Neil Kinnock's press secretary, tells journalists in an off-the-record briefing that the child's first name is Jennifer. She does not divulge any more details. That afternoon, The Independent learns the identity of the girl and the consultant, Mr Alan Ardouin, from its 'own journalistic sources'. The paper said yesterday that these were neither the main parties, the hospital consultant, Jennifer's family, another news organisation, the film crew nor the film's producer. 2pm-3pm. The newspaper telephones Mr Ardouin. He rings back when he has the details of the case. The Independent understands that he has not spoken to any other newspaper. 6.15pm. Mr Ardouin contacts Central Office, and is 'helped', in the words of Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, to contact newspapers. 7pm-8pm. The consultant telephones the Labour party to refute the allegations in the film. Labour says this is the first time it is aware that Jennifer's name is now in the public domain. The Daily Express, and The Independent in its later editions, run stories naming the child. March 25: The political row about the film mounts throughout the day. Yesterday: 9.30am. Mr Kinnock calls on the source of the leak to come forward and denies it was anyone within the Labour party. 9.40am. Ms Hall interrupts the press conference to acknowledge that she gave the name Jennifer to journalists before the film was shown, but claims this would have been insufficient for them to establish her identity. Mr Peter Hitchens, the journalist who broke the story in the Daily Express, says he is 'not in reception of leaks from the Labour party' and that he received the information from a 'second-hand' source. He says 'nobody could possibly have known who this girl was unless the leak came from within the Labour party organisation which made the film'. Mr John Major, the prime minister denies that the Conservatives leaked the name of the girl: 'Most certainly not.' 12.30pm. Sir Nicholas Lloyd, editor of the Daily Express, alleges that Jennifer was first named to The Independent, 'probably by Labour party sources'. The Independent denies it received the information from a political source. 3.30pm. Mr William Waldegrave admits that Mr LeeRoberts's fax was received nine days before the broadcast but claims it was ignored. He adds that when Mr Ardouin made contact with Central Office before the broadcast 'I think we helped the consultant get in touch with the newspapers'. 5.30pm. Central Office clarifies that it advised Mr Ardouin to contact the newspapers, and also telephoned the Daily Express to inform it of this. The Express then rang Mr Ardouin. Central Office denies that it revealed - or even knew  - Jennifer's name.</p>

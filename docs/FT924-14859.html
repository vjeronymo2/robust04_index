			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Russia faces ecological nightmare RUSSIAN officials yesterday painted an apocalyptic picture of a country so full of chemical and organic toxins that even if all pollution were miraculously to stop today, the Russian people would be stunted for the next quarter century. 'We have already doomed ourselves for the next 25 years,' Mr Vladimir Pokrovsky, head of the Academy of Medical Sciences, told a news conference called to publicise the Russian government's first full revelations of the damage done to health and the environment by 70 years of communist rule. The figures cited by Russia's top scientists and environmental politicians were numbing. In a reversal unprecedented in industrialised countries, Mr Pokrovsky predicted that diseases in pregnant women would rise from 83 in 1,000 to 110 in 1,000 in coming years. Widespread ignorance of contraceptives, which are hard to obtain and used by only one woman in five, resulted in 3.5m abortions at state hospitals last year - 2.5 times more than the number of births. Some 40 per cent of hospitals did not have hot water, while an additional 12 per cent had no water at all. Russian infants fare no better after they are born, with 11 per cent of infants suffering birth defects. They become more ill as they grow and about 55 per cent of schoolchildren suffer health problems. Their health is worsened by the water they drink, half of which is contaminated by chemical and organic toxins, according to Mr Evgeni Beliaev, chief Russian health inspector. He said 10 per cent of food was unhealthy to eat. Russians are also dying sooner. Life expectancy fell in 1992 to 69 years for women and 63 for men, a drop from 1991 figures of 74 years for women and 64 for men. The 25-40 age group is hardest hit by illness and early death. Nuclear power, according Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilian, the Russian minister for the environment, poses a greater threat than was previously believed. He said that the VVR reactors, which make up most of Russia's nuclear power capacity and which have been considered more safe than the RBMK-type reactor at Chernobyl, are actually the most dangerous. Mr Danilov-Danilian was critical of what he described as a weak western reaction to his nation's woes. The only western environmental aid of note, he said, was an offer by Norway and Finland to pay Dollars 100m to refit two nickel plants near their border. But he said Russia would need to contribute Dollars 550m to make a go of the project, money that Mr Danilov-Danilian believes could be better spent elsewhere.</p>

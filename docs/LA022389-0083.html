			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT WINE: VINTNERS SEE LESS FEDERAL REGULATION AS ANSWER TO 'WHAT'S IN A  NAME?'  </P> <P> Opus One, Dominus, Trilogy and their brethren now have an umbrella name to  connect them: Meritage, a word that years from now its backers hope will be  widely accepted as defining a super-premium wine made from a blend of the  traditional Bordeaux grape varieties.  </P> <P> Meritage is the name selected by a group of 31 wineries that staged a  nationwide contest late last year to come up with a designation for the new  premium blends of wines springing up all over California. The name was  announced here this week.  </P> <P> The idea of naming a premium wine with a proprietary name is a relatively new  phenomenon, but it's clearly a major trend in premium wine. It marks the third  wave of wine designations in the United States and is an attempt to get out  from under government restrictions.  </P> <P> The Meritage Assn., the group backing the concept, is hoping consumers across  the country, and worldwide, will see the value in having a term to define the  concept of super-premium blended wine.  </P> <P> The drive to come up with a designation was spearheaded by Augustin Huneeus,  president of Franciscan Vineyards in the Napa Valley, a winery that had  produced a super-premium blended red wine similar to that made in Bordeaux, but  it had no unique name to call it.  </P> <P> Huneeus discussed the problem with a number of winery executives and then  realized that a "universal proprietary" designation, one that all wineries  could use, was the perfect answer. So he joined with other wineries (among  those at the first meeting were Merlion and Meridian) and a number of  appropriate-sounding terms were suggested. None sounded right.  </P> <P> Then Dick Graff of Chalone Inc., whose Sonoma County winery, Carmenet, makes  such a blended red wine, joined the group. He suggested a nationwide contest to  name the emerging category of wines, with a prize of about 50 cases of the  blended wines.  </P> <P> Since the mid-1970s when Joseph Phelps Vineyards produced California's first  super-premium blended wine from the Bordeaux grape varieties and used a  proprietary designation on it, California wine producers have eagerly sought a  way to make a better wine without the varietal labeling limitations placed on  them by the federal government.  </P> <P> One of those restrictions says that any wine labeled as a varietal wine (named  after the grape from which it is made) must have in it at least 75% of the  grape named on the label. Thus, a Cabernet Sauvignon you buy today must be  composed of at least 75% Cabernet grapes.  </P> <P> And since varietal wines were the best wines California made, there were  virtually no super-premium wines that were generic.  </P> <P> Before the rule was boosted from a 51% minimum varietal content in 1983,  wineries had the flexibility to add in a greater percentage of Merlot, Cabernet  Franc or Petite Verdot -- other Bordeaux varieties and close cousins of  Cabernet Sauvignon -- to make a better wine.  </P> <P> For instance, in 1972, rains hit the vineyards of the Napa Valley before  harvest and the Cabernet suffered. The earlier-harvested Merlot, however,  survived better, and many wineries made a better wine than they might have made  by blending in Merlot. That year, Sterling's Ric Forman chose to make his  Cabernet fully 40% Merlot and the wine was one of the stars of the vintage.  </P> <P> By 1973, however, public pressure was building to boost the minimum content in  varietal wine to 75%, and the first official proposal to that effect was made  in 1975. The gears of bureaucracy were inexorably grinding to make 75% the  minimum in varietal wines.  </P> <P> Wineries complained that any such move would remove colors from their palette  that permitted blending artistry in the making of great wine. But the foes of  51% minimum content in varietal wines argued then that under those laws, a  Cabernet could be 49% swill.  </P> <P> The 75% rule then in the works would clearly have little effect on wines like  Chardonnay, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, which usually were not blended. But  the new rule handcuffed makers of wines from the Cabernet varieties, which  often were better when blended.  </P> <P> In anticipation of a rule change, Phelps blended a wine in 1974 that was  intended to be an annual blending statement. That wine was called Insignia. It  was a courageous decision, but it left Phelps with a marketing problem since  outside a few sophisticates, few people knew what the wine was all about.  </P> <P> Over the years, other premium Cabernet blends were added to the list; and in  1977, Robert Mondavi and the late Baron Philippe de Rothschild certified the  trend when they announced a joint project to produce a top-quality  Bordeaux-styled wine blended from the traditional varieties.  </P> <P> The first vintage of that wine, then named Opus One, became the prototype  premium blended wine to which all the others are compared. And there followed a  half dozen other similarly named and similarly blended wines including the most  recent, Christian Moueix's Dominus.  </P> <P> A problem existed, however. Marketing such wines to new consumers wasn't easy.  In each case, the new consumer would say "What's in it?" and indirectly, the  question carried the often unspoken question of "Why is it so expensive?"  </P> <P> So a category was needed in which to place this growing number of wines, which  incidentally also includes white wines made like the great white Graves of  Bordeaux.  </P> <P> A century ago, the California wine industry was in its infancy, struggling to  make decent wine. It had few real thoughts of competing with the great wines of  France, but producers here couldn't sell their wines unless the public had some  vague idea about the style of wine they were making.  </P> <P> So California wine makers unabashedly adopted the names of European wine  regions for the names they placed on their labels. Most wines were labeled  things like Chianti, Sauterne, Rhone, Burgundy, Chablis and Champagne.  </P> <P> But the names generally meant nothing. In Burgundy, a red wine is made entirely  from the Pinot Noir grape. In California back then, a Burgundy was simply red  made from whatever happened to be handy.  </P> <P> Also, there were no controls over how such generic wine was blended; one  winery's Chianti could be light and fresh, another's could be dark and  brooding.  </P> <P> A few wineries (Beaulieu and Inglenook among them) made wines from the premium  grape varieties and boldly called them by their varietal names even before  Prohibition. It was a statement of quality, and the wines did command higher  prices than their neighbors. However, varietal naming of wines didn't catch on  until after Prohibition ended in 1933.  </P> <P> It wasn't until the mid-1930s, when Wente Bros. adopted varietal names, that  they began to catch on. Frank Schoonmaker, president of Wente's marketing  company, was pleased with the idea, and he encouraged the winery to do it  across its line. And Schoonmaker promoted the idea that varietal wines were  better than generics.  </P> <P> That set the tone for the second wave of wine marketing -- in which the  specific varietal character of the wines could be expected by the names on the  label. No longer did buyers of California wine have to guess whether a Burgundy  was a dark wine or a light one. They could buy wines called Pinot Noir and have  some assurance that the wines at least had the same heritage.  </P> <P> Varietal naming remained the mark of the highest quality wines for the four  decades that followed, but as blending various varieties became a way to make  an even better wine than a varietal wine, a new way to designate the wine was  needed.  </P> <P> But it also became clear that the public wasn't willing to pay a lot of money  for a wine designated "red table wine" or "claret." So proprietary names began  to be used to signify the higher quality of the wine.  </P> <P> When the number of such wines was still small, it wasn't difficult to find  names for them, and thus we see such disparate terms as Mosaic (from the De  Lorimier winery), Montage (The Christian Brothers) and Le Meilleur du Chai  (Rombauer) adorning prestige blended wines.  </P> <P> But the fear was, said Huneeus, that before long the number of proprietary  names needed will exceed the ability of the language to support them. Moreover,  all those names will be different and there will still be no name for the  category of wines into which they fit.  </P> <P> "Today there are about 30 wineries that are considering making a premium  proprietary blend that have not yet coined a proprietary name," said Huneeus.  He said that if all 30 wineries used different terms, not only would confusion  reign, but there still would be no overall term to describe the category.  </P> <P> "We hope Meritage will reduce the myriad of proprietary names that are  springing up," he said. "It recognizes the fact that California wine makers now  know that the best possible wines they can make are the blends of these  (Bordeaux) varieties, and I hope it will get us off the fixation of varietals."  </P> <P> In the case of such typically unblended wines as Chardonnay, "the varietal  designation is fine; but unquestionably, the varietal designation is not enough  in the case of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. There the case is  quite different. The marriage is usually quite beautiful, better than any of  the varieties on their own."  </P> <P> In some cases, such as with Franciscan's, a wine now will be named Meritage. In  other cases, such as with Opus One and Dominus, the name of the wine will  remain unchanged, but retail shop owners and restaurateurs may now refer to  them as being part of the class of wines called Meritage wines.  </P> <P> "This is a much more focused definition than 'red table wine,' " said Huneeus.  </P> <P> Meritage also will be used to define a blended white wine that is based on the  French model of Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc, two varieties that many wine  makers feel are much better when blended than when left by themselves.  Concannon Vineyards has a 50-50 blend of the two white Bordeaux varieties that  is exceptional and needed a special category in which to fit.  </P> <P> "We are also hoping that Meritage will help to reestablish the beautiful  possibilities of blending Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon," said Huneeus. He said  such wines may be marvelous in terms of quality but that reside in what he  called "a no-man's-land" in terms of image.  </P> <P> In the last year, Sauvignon Blanc sales have dipped in the United States, and  Huneeus said he saw Meritage white wines as "maybe Sauvignon Blanc's last  chance."  </P> <P> The Meritage Assn. will control which wineries use the name on its labels.  Huneeus said the association "will not certify or police quality. All we will  do is set the standard" for what a Meritage wine is.  </P> <P> That brief definition is that Meritage wines must be blends of the traditional  Bordeaux grape varieties -- Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, Petite  Verdot, Malbec in the case of the red wine and Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon and  Muscadelle du Bordelais in the case of the white.  </P> <P> Also, a winery applying to use the term on the label must declare that the wine  is a top-of-the-line wine and that it will not be denominated as a varietal as  well as Meritage.  </P> <P> Among the wineries in the association are Lyeth; Phelps; Glen Ellen; Konocti;  Iron Horse; Flora Springs; Dominus; Meridian; Vichon; Beringer; Concannon; the  Hess Collection; Keenan; Pine Ridge, and Rombauer.  </P> <P> Winner of the contest -- and the only prize -- was Neil Edgar of Newark, Calif.  He is the assistant manager of the Alpha Beta supermarket in Foster City and he  buys wine for the store. His prize is a 10-year vertical collection of two  bottles each of all the Meritage wines of the member wineries, approximately 50  cases of top quality wines.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Proposed Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. 30 CFR Part 701_Permanent Regulatory Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 701.5, Definitions, is proposed to be amended by adding two terms defined in section 2503(c) of the Energy Policy Act.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Lands eligible for remining <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be defined as in the Energy Policy Act by reference to sections 404 and 402(g)(4) of the SMCRA. Thus, the following sites would be included under this definition: sites that were mined for coal or affected by mining activities and abandoned or left in an inadequate reclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuing reclamation responsibility under State or other Federal laws; coal sites in each State abandoned after August 3, 1977, but before the State received primacy under SMCRA and for which available bond is insufficient to provide for adequate reclamation; or coal sites where mining was completed between August 4, 1977, and November 5, 1990, and which remain unreclaimed due to the insolvency of a surety company occurring during that same period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unanticipated event or condition <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is proposes to be defined consistent with the definition contained in the Energy Policy Act to mean an event or condition at an operation on lands eligible for remining under section 404 or 402(g)(4) of SMCRA that was not contemplated by the applicable surface coal mining and reclamation permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. 30 CFR Part 773_Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM proposes to amend Section 773.15, Review of Permit Applications, in two ways. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new proposed subparagraph (c)(13) would require the regulatory authority to utilize data and analyses provided under existing permit information rules and proposed &sect;785.25, discussed in the next section, in order to find that the proposed permit area contains lands eligible for remining and to set a threshold beyond which conditions or events arising subsequent to permit issuance may be presumed to constitute ``unanticipated events or conditions'' for the purpose of applying the permit-block exclusion of proposed paragraph (f) of &sect;773.15. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulatory authority would evaluate the potential environmental and safety problems and associated analysis provided by the applicant based on a review of procedures used, supporting data and documentation, and mitigation plans. After acceptance of the estimates and findings provided by the applicant, the regulatory authority would set the threshold. The threshold which will be determined on a case-by-case basis is therefore set at permit issuance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM believes the information provided by the applicant under proposed new &sect;785.25, which contains additional permit requirements tailored specifically to remining problems, is compatible with the development of a threshold. Two elements of proposed 785.25 are considered to be particularly well suited for this purpose: 1. The permit applicant's estimate of the maximum impacts associated with each identified potential environmental or safety problem; and 2. the permit applicant's estimate of the probability of each potential environmental or safety problem occurring. Furthermore, OSM believes that a threshold expressed quantitatively in terms of either or both of these two elements would provide the clearest guidance for operators, be easier to regulate for the regulatory authorities, and would minimize subsequent controversy and disputes between the operator and regulatory authority as to what events or conditions were indeed ``unanticipated''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSM is therefore seeking comments on three issues associated with formulating a threshold: 1. Whether either or both of the two elements described above, or some combination of the two, would provide an appropriate base for such formulation; 2. methods by which the base may be expressed in quantifiable terms; and 3. whether additional guidance is needed for the regulatory authority in the final rule and what the nature of that guidance should be. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (f) would be added to implement the Energy Policy Act's section 2503(a) mandate for an exclusion from permit blocking provisions of 510(c) of SMCRA. The proposed rule would waive the permit-block provisions of paragraph (b) of &sect;773.15 in cases where a violation occurred at a remining site and the violation was attributed to an unanticipated event or condition. In such cases, the person holding the remining permit would not be rendered ineligible for a new permit based on the violation. Statutory authority for the permit-block exclusion would expire on September 30, 2004. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope of the permit-block exclusion of proposed paragraph (f) derives from the statutory term ``violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation.'' The question has arisen whether the non-payment of delinquent penalties assessed after a notice of violation or a failure-to-abate cessation order based on an ``on the ground'' violation resulting from an unanticipated event or condition should be covered by the Energy Policy Act exclusion. Such delinquencies, which are violations, would be covered by the exclusion if they were construed as ``resulting from an unanticipated event or condition at a surface coal mining operation.'' OSM is seeking comments on the extent to which such violations should be covered by the exclusion in section 2503(a) of the Energy Policy Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 10 Jun (AFP) -- The Haitian Armed  Forces, which according to its commander in chief, General Raoul  Cedras, will fight any U.S. invasion attempt, is a professional  troop of 7,500 poorly armed men.    Gen. Cedras' statement badly conceals the fact that the  Haitian Armed Forces would not be able to offer strong  resistance, although it could later tenaciously harass the  occupation force, military experts in Port-au-Prince have said.  They think it is feared, for example, that the hardline core of  the Army might organize an urban guerrilla group to carry out  terrorist attacks.    The regular troops, 5,300 soldiers and 1,600 policemen, and  even the 925 officers come from mostly low-income or poor social  classes. The Army has a deputy commander, Gen. Jean-Claude  Duperval, and a chief of staff, Brigadier Gen. Philippe Biamby.  The High Command is mainly made up of officers of the Class of  1973 of the Military Academy, whose top student was Gen. Cedras,  who is 44 years old.    This graduation class was the academy's first since being  closed by President Francois Duvalier (Papa Doc, in power  between 1957- 1971) for fear of military coups. Duvalier  thought the officers of his time were subject to too much U.S.  influence.    On the field, the leaders of the troops are officers of the  Class of 1981, to which Lieutenant Colonel Joseph-Michel  Francois, 35, Port-au-Prince chief of police, belongs. The  Armored Corps, which is the best armored unit, played a key role  during recent coup d'etats, including the one on 30 September  1991 against President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. This unit, which  has 26 officers and about 300 men, is stationed in Frere  (southern Port-au-Prince) and is equipped with six light armored  vehicles (V150 Cadillac) with 20-mm and 90-mm guns and machine  guns. Recoilless 75-mm guns and 12.7-mm machine guns mounted on  jeeps are also part of their arsenal.    The Air Force (another 300 men) has three Italian  Siai-marchetti turbo propulsion training planes, a half dozen  Cessna planes equipped with rockets, and a few Sikorsky  helicopters. The Navy (300 men) has a dozen U.S. made patrol  launches equipped with 20-mm guns or 12.7-mm machine guns, but  only six are fully operational.    The light arms are mostly Galil assault rifles and Uzi  submachine guns (Israeli), Brazilian Taurus pistols, and Fal  Belgian assault rifles. There is also a small number of  U.S.-made M-1, M-16, and M- 18 rifles. Some 3,250 soldiers are  stationed in Port-au-Prince, and 250-500 men are in each  department. There are also Army and police aides and  paramilitary groups, which diplomatic sources estimate to number  30,000. Salaries range from 1,000 gourdes ($333) for a private  to 4,000 gourdes ($1,333) for a high-ranking officer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Definitions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 302, 42 U.S.C. 7602, contains definitions for many of the terms used in the Clean Air Act. The term ``Indian tribe'' is among the terms defined in this section and is defined as ``any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village, which is Federally recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.'' CAA section 302(r). Not all of the CAA definitions are set out in section 302. Terms often are defined in the specific Titles in which they appear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Outer Continental Shelf.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 328, 42 U.S.C. 7627, provides for regulation of sources located on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) offshore all the States except Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. These sources must comply with EPA's rule on OCS requirements, which generally set forth requirements that are the same as the applicable requirements in the corresponding onshore area that pertain to the attainment and maintenance of ambient air quality standards and to PSD. If States develop and submit to EPA an adequate program, EPA can delegate implementation and enforcement of these provisions to States. EPA is proposing to extend such authority to Tribes in today's action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Title IV_Acid Deposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program calls for phased nationwide emission reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of approximately 10 million tons from 1980 levels from fossil fuel-fired electric utility units. These reductions are achieved through the purchase and sale of a fixed number of SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``allowances.'' Each allowance entitles the holder to emit one ton of SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Through this emissions trading program, owners of ``affected'' units that can reduce emissions efficiently can sell excess allowances to owners of units where it is more costly to obtain the required reductions, thereby achieving emissions reductions in a cost-effective manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The acid rain program also calls for reductions in nitrogen oxides of approximately 2 million tons from 1980 levels from coal-fired electric utility units. These reductions are obtained by requiring affected sources to comply with certain emission limitations. In many situations, compliance may be demonstrated by averaging the emissions among different utility units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Title IV program is a Federal program during Phase I, from 1995_1999. However, during Phase II, which begins in the year 2000, States will issue the acid precipitation portion of the operating permits addressed below under Title V. 42 U.S.C. 7651&hyph;7651o. In today's rule, EPA is proposing to extend this Phase II permitting authority to Tribes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Title V_Operating Permits Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title V of the Act requires States to develop and submit to EPA an operating permit program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Title V calls for the permitting of certain sources by certain deadlines. Operating permits are to contain all of the Clean Air Act requirements applicable to such sources. The program is intended to promote regulatory certainty and enforceability. Title V also provides for the collection of fees by the permitting agency that reflect the reasonable costs of the permit program. 42 U.S.C. 7661&hyph;7661e. EPA has issued rules specifying the minimum requirements for State permit programs. 57 FR 32,250 (July 21, 1992). EPA is proposing to extend Title V operating permit program authority to Tribes in today's rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Note that this operating permit program is not the same as the NSR and PSD permit programs described previously that, by contrast, require construction permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Small Business Assistance Program.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Title V also contains provisions requiring States to adopt a small business stationary source technical and environmental compliance assistance program, which is to be incorporated into the SIP described under Title I. 42 U.S.C. 7661f. EPA is proposing to authorize Tribes to submit such assistance programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Title VI_Phaseout of Ozone-Depleting Chemicals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Title provides for the phase-out of the production of certain substances that deplete stratospheric ozone as well as providing other restrictions on the use of such substances. It is a Federally established and federally managed program. 42 U.S.C. 7671&hyph;7671q. Among other things, it implements the Montreal Protocol, a multinational agreement addressing damage to stratospheric ozone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LEARY IMPRESSIVE BUT DODGERS LOSE OPENER  </P> <P> Mark Gubicza combined with three other pitchers on a four-hit shutout as the  Kansas City Royals beat the Dodgers, 2-0, Friday in the exhibition opener for  both teams.  </P> <P> Gubicza, 20-8 last season, pitched three perfect innings, striking out three.  He was followed by Jeff Montgomery, Jerry Don Gleaton and Steve Farr, with  Gleaton getting the victory and Farr a save. Tim Crews, who pitched the eighth,  was the loser.  </P> <P> Rookie shortstop Jose Vizcaino's throwing error allowed Gary Thurman to reach  first to lead off the eighth. Thurman took second on Jim Eisenreich's bunt  single and scored when Vizcaino threw away Kevin Seitzer's grounder for an  error. In all, Vizcaino made three errors.  </P> <P> Nick Capra's sacrifice fly with the bases loaded scored Eisenreich.  </P> <P> Dodger right-hander Tim Leary picked up where he left off in 1988 as he pitched  three scoreless innings. He allowed one hit and two walks and struck out two.  </P> <P> Last season, Leary had his most productive season in the majors as he won 17  games and finished among the National League leaders in earned-run average,  complete games and shutouts.  </P> <P> "I felt great today," Leary said. "I wanted to get in a good day's work and I  felt like I did that.  </P> <P> "For the first time out, it wasn't bad."  </P> <P> The Dodgers play the New York Mets today in Port St. Lucie.  </P></p>

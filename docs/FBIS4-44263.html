			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Backhaus and Konrad R. Mueller: </F> "Sisyphus Wants To Become Chancellor"]    [Text] He incessantly rolls uphill the stone of daily  government business in Bonn. But in contrast to the futile  drudgery in Greek mythology, the toiling by the chief of the  Union caucus in the Bundestag is to be rewarded--with succession  to Helmut Kohl.  <H5>  "To Start Everyday Anew, Even If One Never Reaches a Final </H5> Goal"    Wolfgang Schaeuble is quite aware that he does not lead a  bourgeois life. That struck him once again, especially on  Pentecost Monday. According to bourgeois standards, he should  have spent the day with his wife and family in the esteemed  "Adler" in the Glottertal to celebrate his silver wedding  anniversary. Instead, he was busy in the Reichstag in Berlin to  ensure that Roman Herzog becomes federal president.    Perhaps this is one of the reasons why the chairman of the  Union caucus in the Bundestag sometimes pursues the question of  how, and to what, compare the activity of a politician, and thus  explain it better. The answer is surprising: For him, Sisyphus  is the model, the Greek mythological figure condemned by the  gods to incessantly roll a heavy stone up a mountain; but the  stone again rolls down from the top immediately, so that there  is no end to the toil.    However, it is not easy to imagine the success-oriented  political manager as the "hero of the Absurd" and as "eternal  rebel," as philosopher Albert Camus describes the unfortunate  Sisyphus in his famous essay, "The Mythos of Sisyphus." Perhaps  the French thinker's insight appeals more to Schaeuble: "There  is no fate that cannot be overcome by contempt."    But Wolfgang Schaeuble's everyday life in Bonn also recalls  Sisyphus. Last Wednesday, for example, a stone rolled back onto  his desk which he had pushed away only a few days earlier: the  law on indemnification and compensation payment, which is to  regulate the return of lands expropriated in the former GDR  between 1945 and 1949. The project will probably end up in the  mediation committee of Bundesrat and Bundestag. As a politician,  sighs the head of the Union caucus, one has to "start every day  anew on this earth, even if one never reaches a final goal."  Nonetheless, one can be "satisfied and happy." If Schaeuble does  not always look like that, it may be explained by another of  Camus' insights: "A face that labors so close to the stone has  itself turned to stone."    The 51-year-old lawyer has relieved the chancellor of the  stone of daily government business for some time now. Be it  elderly care insurance, the solidarity pact or the question  whether German soldiers are to participate in monitoring the  airspace over Bosnia--it always holds true what a CDU [Christian  Democratic Union] minister said recently: "While Kohl assumes  more and more a presiding role, Schaeuble does the work." The  chief of government, normally forever suspicious of potential  rivals, not only tolerates this development, he even promotes it.    Very soon, the chancellor wants to publicly drape the ermine  cape around his crown prince's shoulders. On 20 June, he will  personally present Schaeuble's new book, Und der Zukunft  Zugewandt [Turn Toward the Future]. Kohl watchers cannot  remember any time when the chief of government had ever before  honored an author in such a way. But Schaeuble is for Kohl "the  beloved son in whom he is well pleased."  <H5>  From a Cool-Headed but Liberal Pragmatist to "Godfather of </H5> the Right"    Who is this frail man with a will of iron, who seems  unstoppable on the road to becoming number one in the CDU? The  judgments on him show a remarkably broad range.    Until the end of the 1980's, Schaeuble's cool pragmatism in  solving problems and creating political majorities was  considered proof of a relatively liberal mentality. Today,  Social Democrat Peter Glotz classifies him as an intellectual  arsonist when he calls him the "Godfather of the Right," because  of his talk about nation and "foreignization." In fact, in past  years Schaeuble demonstrated great understanding for the fears  of too many foreigners. Yet he ignores the fact that shelters of  asylum-seekers are still burning in Germany, and that foreigners  are hunted down on open streets in broad daylight. One could  have wished for a clear word from him.    If one wants to classify Schaeuble, one must go to his  roots:  his parents' home in Hornberg on the Black Forest train line;  high school in Hausach, 10 kilometers distant; and today his  house in Gengenbach, another 30 km further away; the years of  law studies in Freiburg, just 50 km from home. Such a person is  not out to conquer the world from the very beginning; rather, he  wants to become someone at home.  <H5>  "Wash the Neck, Don't Forget the Ears, Attend Church </H5> Service," the Obedient Son Promised His Mother    This was also the goal of the education given to young  Wolfgang and his brothers, Frieder and Thomas:  conservative-strict, but also loving. Karl Schaeuble, a clerical  employee who managed to become an independent tax consultant,  and his wife, Gertrud, taught their boys to respect order,  discipline, a sense of decency, and fear of God. Only recently,  his mother came across a slip of paper with good intentions for  the new year, which Wolfgang had written down at age eight or  nine: Among other things, it said to wash one's neck and not  forget the ears before going to school, and to attend church  service. When Schaeuble today feels that the Gutachtal, where  Hornberg is situated, "is terribly narrow," he means primarily  its geography. But it may also be responsible for some  narrowness in his nature.    Even today, the Black Forest homeland is for him a place of  rest and retreat, especially with his family living there. He  calls his wife Ingeborg and his two brothers the most important  confidants when it concerns personal matters. Together with his  oldest daughter, Christine, who was with him when "this shit  happened," as he calls the attempt on his life in Oppenau on 12  October 1990, they were his mainstay in the ensuing difficult  weeks. Schaeuble is in frequent telephone contact with his  parents whom he calls "Mama" and "Papa" as in his childhood  days. And the fact that the Schaeuble boys emulated their father  in all important ways, at best tried to surpass him, also  indicates that childhood and youth passed "free of conflicts" as  Wolfgang Schaeuble remembers. Although bent on success at school  and in sports, and growing up during the philistine 1950's, no  potential built up that would have led to protest or rebellion.  In 1965, when turmoil set in at the universities, Schaeuble  joined the CDU, of which his father was already a member. "The  spirit of the times never interested me," comments Schaeuble on  his life. His basic attitudes are rooted in the childhood  experiences of the safe world of the Black Forest.    Gerhard Heinzmann, who graduated from high school with  Schaeuble and today works as a clergyman in the diaconry of  Pforzheim,is convinced that "his ethics of responsibility was  molded by his parents and the church." Torsten Wolfgramm,  formerly Schaeuble's FDP [Free Democratic Party] partner as  parliamentary manager, recognizes in him "Max Weber's protestant  performance ethics in person." The virtues of asceticism and  work for work's sake, pointed out by sociologist Weber, have  much to do with Schaeuble's system of values. For him, also,  wasting time is basically one of the gravest sins.    This ethos, absorbed with mother's milk, also immunized him  against the unrest of the 68' movement. The results of the  "cultural revolutionary upheavals of the 1960's," as Schaeuble  sees the emancipation push after 1968, he calls "exaggerated  individualism and hedonism." Schaeuble stresses in conversation  that a 'comprehensive insurance mentality' of citizens  undermines the necessary community spirit. His demand for  greater love for one's country, which always sounded a little  like "hurrah patriotism," he nowadays explains as the desire for  more public spirit, charity, and service to the community. And  he takes the anti-European sting out of his chatter about the  nation as "a community of protection and destiny" by stating  that the Western ties of the old Federal Republic are a part of  the "raison d'etat of united Germany also."    Schaeuble not only banks on nation and patriotism because he  is still of the generation "which put candles in the windows on  17 June," as his schoolmate Heinzmann recalls. Kohl's chief  tactician is also concerned with maintaining the Union's sole  position as the party of unity, and strengthening the right  fringe.    Schaeuble's rise to the first rank of politics was closely  linked to the policy on Germany. As interior minister, he worked  out the unification treaty of 31 August 1990 with then-GDR state  secretary Guenther Krause. Then, on 3 October, came  reunification toward which Schaeuble had worked "as if in a  frenzy." But he had never lost sight of party interests. He  urged all-German elections early on. At that time, Kohl wanted  to make him his designated successor. But on 12 October, the  bullets of a demented would-be assassin tore Schaeuble out of  the political machinery running full speed ahead. For a moment,  everything seemed to be over. German unity and personal fate  were linked even more closely for Schaeuble than for Kohl.  <H5>  "How Enormously Consoling When People Are Kind to One" </H5>   In Bonn it is being asked to what extent the attempt on his  life and its consequences have changed Schaeuble. It is said he  has become hard and bitter, that he is quick to anger, and that  he takes criticism worse than anyone else. Schaeuble himself  claims that, if he has changed at all, he has become more  serene. Everything else he considers projections by healthy  people who blame their insecurity in dealing with the  handicapped on the latter. He counts among the most positive  experiences "how enormously consoling it is when people are nice  to one." That would have been "worth two years in the  wheelchair," if he had had a choice. The coming election  campaign will again prove that his disability, and the iron will  not to let it get him down, has provided him with additional  favor and fascination. A politician with a destiny is more  fascinating than one with a smooth career.    It sounds almost regretful when Schaeuble states that the  old  FRG had been spared "trials endangering its existence." In his  view, such tests would have answered not only the question  whether western Germany was more than a fair-weather democracy;  they would also have offered a chance to correct undesirable  developments. Schaeuble is all the more determined to make use  of the upheaval phase of reunification and the elimination of  the East-West conflict for this purpose. The attempt to use the  Bundeswehr within Germany, which he will pursue until he  prevails, is only a small sample.    With this Sisyphus as chancellor, for whom spiritual and  moral leadership is not an empty word, things could become  uncomfortable.</p>

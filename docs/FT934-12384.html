			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Detection is 'best way' to hit crime THE GOVERNMENT'S view that prison acts as a deterrent was further undermined yesterday after Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, said the rate of detection was far more important in combating crime. His comment in a Lords debate on the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice comes after criticism by Lord Justice Woolf, a law lord, of government proposals to crack down on crime. Lord Woolf recently dismissed the policy of imprisoning greater numbers of people as having a 'miserable record of failure'. Mr John Major has given his public backing to his home secretary Mr Michael Howard, who said prison works as a deterrent against crime. Lord Taylor told peers: 'I am strongly of the view that the most important deterrent to criminals is the likelihood of detection rather than the nature or length of sentences. 'Will I get caught' is uppermost in the villain's mind, not 'will I get three years or five'. 'Public interest at present is that the level of detection is low and, even when detected, many offenders are not prosecuted. I hope that in its avowed aim to give law and order high priority, the government will lay emphasis on detecting and preventing crime and that all the resources necessary to that emphasis will be made available.' Lord Taylor's comments are an indication of the extent to which the legal profession is at odds with the government's view of prison. He yesterday repeated his opposition to removal of the right to elect for jury trial in certain cases. Referring to the planned review authority to deal with alleged miscarriages of justice, he said it was important 'we should not proceed too fast'. It was vital that it be properly set up.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Sizov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 Apr -- The Russian Armed Forces are to be  withdrawn from the territory of the Latvian Republic by 31  August 1994. This was reflected in the Treaty between Russia  and Latvia signed by the presidents of Russia and Latvia in the  Kremlin today.    Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent after  the signing ceremony in the Vladimir Hall of the Kremlin,  Yeltsin said that a package consisting of five documents had  been signed. They had been prepared, he said, with full  agreement by both sides.    Noting that the documents mainly connected with the  withdrawal of troops and the social protection of servicemen and  retired servicemen were signed in the Kremlin today, Yeltsin  said a package of bilateral economic agreements would be drawn  up and signed during a visit to Latvia by the head of the  Russian Government Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>

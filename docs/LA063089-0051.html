			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TINY SPARK THAT SURVIVED;  </P> <P> THE ROCK 'N' ROLL LIFE OF STAR'S CHILD BRIDE  </P> <P> It's noon, and the lobby of the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is swarming with  the ladies-who-lunch set. Today especially they all look alike, these women who  wear their Chanel suits, Charles Jourdan shoes and daytime jewels like merit  badges for a life without problems.  </P> <P> Slowly, a dainty, diminutive blond woman makes her way through the throng.  Outwardly, she seems just as well-bred and well-dressed as everyone else,  though a shade less chic in her off-the-rack knit dress. You can't put your  finger on it, but something makes her stand out in the crowd -- maybe the  expression of detached bemusement that's fixed upon her face.  </P> <P> "Hi. I'm Myra Lewis," she says, pausing while her visitor's jaw drops open and  then shuts again. "So what kind of picture did you have of me in your mind?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Different Image  </P> <P> How about someone sort of boozed-up and blowzy-looking, with 10 divorces under  her belt and a tragic history of addictions, abandonments, break-ups and  breakdowns, who still wears a whiff of the worldwide notoriety that surrounded  her Dec. 12, 1957, marriage at age 13 to her 22-year-old second cousin, rock  'n' roller Jerry Lee Lewis?  </P> <P> Well, then, certainly not this mature woman who's a Chamber of Commerce model  of the Atlanta businesswoman, a published author and the subject of the  just-released Hollywood movie "Great Balls of Fire," based upon her  autobiography of the same name.  </P> <P> She laughs. "I know the image you probably conjured up. I used to always hate  it if people knew who I was before they met me. Because if they meet me and  talk to me, then I say, 'Oh, by the way, this is my background,' it's like,  'Whaaaat?!' But if it's before . . . . "  </P> <P> She shrugs.  </P> <P> "After my divorce, I had to go to a psychiatrist because I thought I've got to  have lost it. You can't go through a life like that and come out and be OK. I  must be insane.  </P> <P> "But none of the psychiatrists would tell me I was crazy. They would say,  'You're fine. You're fine.' But I never felt fine."  </P> <P> As she says this, her eyes begin to mist. Her voice begins to quiver.  </P> <P> And then the tears trickle down.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Like Years of Therapy'  </P> <P> "Writing that book was like years of therapy for me. I went through a lifetime  of grief and happiness and sadness and love and joy and scandal and all those  things. And when the book was finished, it was gone. I felt free of my life  because it was between those covers. And, suddenly, it just all made sense. I  understood not only what happened, but why.  </P> <P> "You see, Myra did not survive that marriage. That little girl I used to be,  she died. She just dispersed into whatever. But there was this tiny spark of  life left, and that's me. What you're seeing is probably the most successful  success story that I know."  </P> <P> Her life is so different now compared to what it once was. She is, after all, a  44-year-old mother and part-owner of an Atlanta real-estate firm with her third  husband, Richard Williams, whom she wed in 1984. She listens to Barbra  Streisand's records instead of Jerry Lee Lewis's. She doesn't even like today's  rock music, except for a few songs by Huey Lewis and the News.  </P> <P> And, yet, let her hear the words that Jerry Lee Lewis wrote when she divorced  him in 1970, "She Even Woke Me Up to Say Goodbye," and she'll cry every time.  Now, with the paperback release of her autobiography and Winona Ryder's  portrayal of her on the silver screen, Lewis is stocking up on Kleenex for the  tears she knows will inevitably fall.  </P> <P> "But people misinterpret why. Like, I was in Memphis last week and this  interviewer asked me a question about the movie, and I just started to cry. And  she grabbed me later and she said, 'You're still in love with him, aren't you?'  </P> <P> "And I said, 'No, I'm not in love with Jerry. But I'm a soft, warm, feeling  person and I didn't destroy my emotions when I cleansed myself of my past. I'm  still very easily touched by the man. If I could walk away and not care, then  I'm no better than an animal.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Skipped the Premiere  </P> <P> For that reason, she passed up attending Monday's New York premiere of "Great  Balls of Fire," opting instead to escape to Hawaii. She hasn't seen the movie  yet. She doesn't know when she will. "I'm told that this movie made Jerry cry.  So I get this lump right here," she says, touching her throat, "because I  already know what it's going to do to me.  </P> <P> "It's going to rip me apart. And yet I've been dying to see it. But, all of a  sudden, it's here and I'm going, 'Wait a second, I'm not sure I want to do  this.' So I'm putting it off."  </P> <P> Last fall, when her curiosity got the best of her, she visited the Memphis set  of "Great Balls of Fire" -- even though the producers had politely requested  that she and Jerry Lee Lewis stay away. "They just came out and said, 'Look, we  don't want these actors playing you. We want them playing what we want them to  play,' " Lewis recalls. "But it was impossible to keep us apart."  </P> <P> Though she received $100,000 for her life story, Lewis is bitter about not  being consulted on either the writing or casting of the movie despite promises  to that effect. Someone from the office of producer Adam Fields simply sent her  a copy of the screenplay and told her that 17-year-old Winona Ryder would be  playing her. At first, Lewis didn't even know who Ryder was.  </P> <P> "Then I ran out and rented 'Beetlejuice' so I could see this little girl who's  going to play me. I saw a little girl who can act, and I thought, 'Oh, this is  good.' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hanging Out With Quaid  </P> <P> And while her ex-husband was hanging out with his screen double Dennis Quaid,  Lewis on the day before shooting was to start found herself sitting in Ryder's  trailer, sipping hot chocolate and talking for hours. "We talked about her  going to school, we talked about her father, we talked about everything except  the movie," recalls Lewis, who learned that Ryder's father had been a huge fan  of Jerry Lee Lewis and given his daughter a copy of "Great Balls of Fire" when  it was published in hardcover in 1982.  </P> <P> "It felt like she was my child, like I was her mother. She was the youthful  Myra."  </P> <P> A few weeks later, Ryder phoned Lewis and said: "I got married today." Lewis  went into immediate shock. "And then I realized that Myra got married today on  the set," she says, her eyes beginning to water again.  </P> <P> Another tear. Another explanation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Just a Book'  </P> <P> "You see, it's not just a book I wrote," she says quietly. "It's us."  </P> <P> When she was researching her book, Lewis one day called up her ex-husband and  asked when he realized he was in love with her. "And he said, 'Girl,' as he  would affectionately call me all my life, 'I loved you from the first time I  laid eyes on you. You were sitting at the kitchen table doing your homework and  I knew then I was going to marry you.' "  </P> <P> Lewis was touched by his memory, and she knew then and there she couldn't trash  him in her autobiography. "Because it's a great love story. It's a fantastic  love story. And most great love stories end in tragedy."  </P> <P> She was drawn to him in the beginning, she recalls, because "he was a little  boy. And he needed someone to take care of him. I was supposed to be the child,  but he was the child in our relationship, really."  </P> <P> Immature for her age (she still played with dolls) though physically  well-developed, Lewis looking back thinks she was drawn into such an early  marriage because she had "an overactive nurturing instinct. From the time I  could remember, all I wanted was a little vine-covered cottage with a husband  and a baby in a high chair. My mother actually gave birth to my little brother  for me because I had begged her so hard for one. And I would go baby-sit for my  neighbors for free just so I could hold their babies."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sense of Urgency  </P> <P> Another reason for the marriage, she maintains, is that her love affair with  Lewis took place against the backdrop of the Atomic Age. "I grew up in the '50s  when it was said this H-bomb, or A-bomb or whatever bomb it was, could come at  any moment, and then life as we knew it would cease to exist. I felt like it  was going to happen any moment, and I was never going to have my life. So it  was like, 'Let's do it.' I didn't instigate 'Let's do it,' but when it  presented itself to me and I was given Jerry's ultimatum of now or never, well,  I took it."  </P> <P> Though Jerry Lee Lewis, who had been married twice previously, eloped with his  child bride at the height of his stardom, a scandal didn't ensue until May 22,  1958, when they arrived in England for a massively publicized tour and a Fleet  Street journalist asked Myra, "Who are you, Miss?"  </P> <P> She innocently replied, "Jerry's wife," and all hell broke out.  </P> <P> For the next 10 years, Lewis found himself branded a "baby snatcher" and his  singing career destroyed. He went from making $10,000 a night in ballrooms and  concert halls to $100 split four ways in squalid Arkansas honky-tonks. "Guilty,  that's how I felt," Myra Lewis recalls. "I just knew I was the stick they were  going to use to beat him over the head with. All of a sudden, I wanted to say,  'Let me explain this,' to make all this bad stuff go away. You see, writing  this book was something I wanted to do back then in 1958 when all the news came  out. But I never lost sight of that dream of wanting to defend Jerry and just  set the record straight, at least one time."  </P> <P> While still grieving for their loss of income and stardom, the couple also  endured the accidental drowning of their first born, Steve Allen Lewis, who was  named for the TV talk show host who gave Lewis his first national exposure.  They later had a daughter, Phoebe, now 25. ("I think my daughter takes good  notes," the mother explains. "She didn't have a boyfriend until she was 16, she  doesn't drink and she's never taken drugs.")  </P> <P> As the years progressed and her husband's career began to pick up again, Lewis  became a scapegoat for his unhappiness and sometimes even his physical abuse.  By 1970, their last year of marriage, she had to call the police the night he  knocked her to the floor and threatened to kill her if she ever got up the  nerve to leave him. That fall she found out he was cheating on her, hired a  detective to tail him and finally served him with divorce papers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Final Plea  </P> <P> When she left, he was standing at the front door, arms outstretched, crying,  "Please don't leave."  </P> <P> "I was angry at Jerry. Why did he have to be so mean? Why did he have to tell  me I was ugly and stupid and nobody would ever have me? So he took my  self-confidence to the ground. And I wound up turning to the first man that was  nice to me."  </P> <P> Immediately after her divorce was final, she married the detective she had  hired, Pete Malito, and moved to Atlanta. The marriage lasted only a year and a  half.  </P> <P> "Talk about a mistake. Now that was a stupid mistake," she explains. "But I was  glad to be out of Memphis because I could never have been anyone but Jerry's  ex-wife. In Atlanta, I could be Myra Malito and a nobody, and that's exactly  who I wanted to be."  </P> <P> With an 8-year-old daughter to support, a paltry child support payment and a  $125,000 alimony settlement payable over five years ("And we went to court  every year for five years," she notes), Lewis in 1973 had to figure out how to  make a living. "There were not many job openings for 'ex-wives of.' After all  the financial work I had done for Jerry, I did have a little business sense.  But I had no training."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'Mundane' Period  </P> <P> She found a job as a $93-a-week receptionist and embarked on the most "mundane"  period of her life. For the next five years, she worked and raised her daughter  and baked brownies. And she also hired a co-writer, found an agent and began  her book. "There were a couple of times I almost gave it up because I felt as  if it wasn't worth it. I was going back and reliving it. I was waking up in the  middle of the night and crying myself to sleep. But I didn't give it up. I made  friends with my past, instead."  </P> <P> In 1982, when the book was published by William Morrow in hardcover, sales were  sparse. "I was disappointed, but I was not really disillusioned by it. I just  said, well, the real life of this book is going to come when it goes into mass  paperback."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, she had received her real estate license, met Williams and joined  his Century 21 office, where she specializes in big-ticket homes. How did she  tell him about her past?  </P> <P> "I gave him the book, he read it, and he just said, 'My hat's off to you,' "  Lewis recalls. She says that, since then, her new husband has never had a need  to feel jealous.  </P> <P> "I'm here to tell you," says Williams, whom Lewis likens more to Alan Alda than  her ex-husband, "that girl has pulled herself up by her own bootstraps. If ever  there's a woman out there who doesn't need a man, she's it."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with IMF Mission Chief Michael Deppler, by Danuta </F> Walewska; place and date not given: "Poland Met IMF Criteria;  Open Road to Debt Reduction"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Walewska] Will Poland be in a  position to obtain a new standby [preceding word in English]  agreement? Doubts have emerged whether we will be able to meet  the requirements that are necessary to achieve such a new  agreement.    [Deppler] If someone doubts this, he has bad information.  The 1994 budget is a basis for a good economic plan. However,  there is more to it than merely the government's economic  policy. Its preparation must take some time. Nonetheless, I do  not think this should last long. I believe that there is a  100-percent probability that I will return to Warsaw within two  months and we will negotiate another standby agreement. The  International Monetary Fund [IMF] cooperated with all the Polish  governments after the democratic transformation started and it  intends to continue to cooperate with them.    [Walewska] Thus it is still possible to negotiate a standby  agreement for 1994?    [Deppler] Absolutely.    [Walewska] Still, you hoped to negotiate this agreement  during this stay in Poland, did you not?    [Deppler] Yes, we hoped to do this indeed, but the  government came to the conclusion that it needed more time to  define some details of the economic plan; we had to respect  this. It must be remembered, however, that the negotiations  with the Paris Club and the second tranche of the reduction of  the debt toward governments (31 March) was for us a deadline  that we could not miss. Now, the part of the mission that had  to deal with preparing all the documents which had to be  submitted to the Paris Club was forced to leave Warsaw last  weekend--if it wanted to get there in time. The government was  busy working on the budget and it did not really have the time  to handle any other economic issues. Therefore, for purely  practical reasons it was not possible to reach the agreement.    [Walewska] Then what else must be prepared so that the  negotiations for the next standby agreement can be started?    [Deppler] We must take a good look at the reforms and the  plans for implementing them in the future. I would not like to  go into details now because it is a matter of mutual trust  between the government and IMF. It does not allow me to reveal  the details. However, there are still many important matters  that the government has only just begun to work on. I also know  that this work is supposed to be expedited; when everything is  ready, we will return to Warsaw.    [Walewska] However, is it already known what goals the  government has set for privatization, what the money supply is  supposed to be, and how inflation is going to be controlled?    [Deppler] The financial aspects of the 1994 program are  absolutely acceptable. The policy of the National Bank of  Poland is clear. In the medium-term strategy we agreed that  Poland will maintain the growth rate and that inflation will be  limited. Nevertheless, there still remains the question of what  should be done to implement these goals? This brings up the  issue of the government's expenditures. What will have to be  done if the budget's revenues are smaller. We also stressed in  the talks with the prime minister that state enterprises should  be a more significant source of the economic growth. Thus,  there is quite considerable agreement concerning the future  economic program as well as the means by which this should be  achieved. These are very complex problems; both we and the  government simply need more time to be able to explain  everything to each other.    [Walewska] What risk can you see in the budget itself?    [Deppler] In line with our estimates, the 1994 budget is  realistic. It is possible that the economy may turn out to be  weaker; however, this is a rather remote possibility. We  believe that the forecasts of a 4.5-percent economic growth are  very real. We cannot see any dangers in what is currently going  on in the economy, even though we are alarmed at the recent  price and wage increase.    [Walewska] How about the methods of financing the budget  deficit?    [Deppler] This was a problem of last year. The key issue  here will be the creation of the conditions that will allow the  people to believe in the value of the zloty. Therefore, the  government should have fewer problems financing the deficit by  means of the Treasury bonds.    [Walewska] However, there were already problems related to  the sale of those bonds last year. Do you think that this is  going to be easier this year?    [Deppler] One cannot be certain about anything in Poland.  We must remember, however, that the situation was special last  year; there were also constant fears of devaluating the zloty.  I hope that this year's solutions will encourage people to buy  the bonds.    [Walewska] The criteria, which are usually set by IMF, are,  in the case of Poland, always similar: inflation, the size of  the budget deficit, domestic debt. Is there anything else that  draws special attention of the IMF? I have not yet heard you  speak about privatization.    [Deppler] IMF has always been interested in the reforms.  Last year we discussed the packet of structural reforms--the  Mass Privatization Program, the Pact on State Enterprise, social  protection. We always think about what the government is doing  to encourage the people to participate in the reforms and to  finish the transformation of the economy. As for this  government, we trust that we will reach agreement in all these  issues.    [Walewska] Is there not a possibility for Poland to be able  to negotiate a "better" agreement with IMF, the extended  facility [preceding word in English], which is considered to be  the next step after the standby?    [Deppler] We have not signed such an agreement with any  Central and East European states; we believe that the annual  standby is more profitable for states that are transforming  their economies; it is better if the implementation of the  criteria is reviewed every six months. This extended facility  that you have talked about, was the only agreement that was not  a success.    [Walewska] What was your greatest disappointment during this  mission: the fact that the finance minister was not present at  the negotiation table, or the fact that we did not satisfy the  conditions for negotiating the agreement as IMF had expected us  to?    [Deppler] We have made considerable progress and worked out  a solid foundation for a new agreement. At any rate, now I am  much more convinced than I was when I arrived in Warsaw.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has issued  a statement declaring the decision of Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon  to suspend the ongoing negotiations in protest against the ugly  massacre of innocent worshipers at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque a  good step.    Hamas denounced the shaky, hesitant position of Yasir  'Arafat  as a submissive position that does not take into consideration  the Palestinian blood that has been spilled or the anger of the  Palestinian people everywhere.    The statement further said: We think that 'Arafat's stands  serve the interests of the Zionist enemy, which seeks to placate  popular rage over the massacre.    The statement added: We consider insistence on pursuing a  policy of relinquishment and continuing the negotiations, rather  than responding to an overwhelming popular desire to withdraw  from the talks, as treason against our people.    An official Hamas spokesman said that it is a priority of  the  popular forces to maintain a strong popular momentum inside the  territories and in the diaspora and to remain determined to  achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Javier Solana will be one of the 10 foreign  ministers at the signing ceremony in Cairo. He will have a  special place, just as his Norwegian colleague who mediated the  talks. This afternoon, Solana highlighted how Spain will  support Palestinian self-rule.    [Begin Solana recording] In a few weeks we will provide 14  vehicles for the Palestinian police and telecommunications  equipment. We will also provide a credit for civilian equipment  for this same police force. In short, we will contribute to the  most important element, that is to the issue of security of the  occupied territories. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Investors focus on risks involved in Chinese paper The poor performance of China's debut offering in the global bond market in early February could pose a stumbling block to future issues by government entities and companies in both the mainland and Hong Kong. According to traders, a glut of paper is still overhanging the market, three months after Merrill Lynch, in association with other securities houses and banks, marketed the USDollars 1bn global bond issue - the Chinese government's first entry in its own right to the US market since the communist revolution. The 10-year bond, on the heels of a Dollars 300m dragon bond issued at a yield spread of 88 basis points over US Treasuries, was launched at an 85 basis point spread over US Treasuries. It subsequently widened to as much as 160 basis points, according to some dealers. Traders believe that greater political and economic risk in China has crystallised in the minds of investors in recent months on the back of economic and monetary statistics. Turbulence in bond markets across the world, uncertainty over China's trade relations with the US, and its own economy have all been proffered as reasons for the ballooning spreads - the argument being that lower rated debt takes the worst hammering when the global interest rate environment turns unfavourable. However, dealers claim Merrill Lynch was forced to buy back more than half the issue and proceeded to widen the spreads. Traders, recognising the bond was under pressure, sold more paper into Merrill's support bid. Spreads on the smaller dragon bond issue also widened as traders sold to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. The dragon bond, lead managed by Lehman Brothers, has kept to within 10 to 15 basis points of the global bond. Mr Chris Nicholas, head of trading at Lehman Brothers, says the dragon bond reaps a 'home advantage' - being placed with Asian bodies, from central banks to retail investors, who have a greater interest in supporting China issues. He said: 'I believe there are a lot of plans for China as a country to continue to raise debt, and also the government related agencies. Our experience in terms of the spread widening over the last two months means the pricing these institutions will be able to achieve has shifted quite dramatically from what they could have achieved six months ago. 'It affects Hong Kong institutions in exactly the same way, particularly those institutions which have a very obvious tie with mainland China.' Other traders point out that Hong Kong companies, which will effectively be Chinese companies by the time the debt matures post-1997, are automatically tarred with the same brush and will face higher funding costs. They believe new issues will come on stream priced at something around 100 basis points over US Treasuries. However, investment banks' desires to secure mandates from China may serve to produce issues which offer less attractive terms to the end investor.</p>

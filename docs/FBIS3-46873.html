			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chang Chae-yong, director of the American Affairs  Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, said that the third U.S.-North  Korean high-level talks will be held after the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] ordinary [tongsang] inspection or  the exchange of special envoys between the North and South are  achieved.    Director Chang said on 6 January that during a telephone  contact with the United States on 5 January, North Korea  announced that it will hold contacts with the IAEA to discuss  the beginning of the ordinary inspection. He said this is a  process for the start of the third round of talks between the  United States and North Korea in which the nuclear issue will be  earnestly discussed.    A relevant government official also said that the move for  the working-level contacts between the North and South will be  active after North Korea and the IAEA discuss the nuclear  inspections, and that the exchange of special envoys between the  North and South is likely to be realized before the third round  of U.S.-North Korean talks.    He said that as soon as the discussion between North Korea  and the IAEA over the nuclear inspection is ended, the United  States and North Korea will hold a working-level contact in New  York and discuss the agenda for partial compromise [pubun  takyelan], including the holding of the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks. He also said that the third round of  U.S.-North Korean talks will be held in Geneva within the next  month only if the present ongoing process of consultations are  being carried out as scheduled.</p>

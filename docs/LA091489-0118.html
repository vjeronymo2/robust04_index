			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: GRANT FACES OPENER MINUS TWO STARTERS  </P> <P> Grant High likely will open its football season against Narbonne on Friday  without two projected starters -- tailback Shawn Booker and quarterback Andy  Wells, both of whom are injured.  </P> <P> Wells broke his ankle and is out indefinitely, and converted wide receiver  Marlowe Lewis will play in his place, according to Grant Coach Bill Foster.  </P> <P> Booker has an injured ankle and is questionable for Friday's game. Booker, who  gained 654 yards in 120 carries for a 5.4 average as a junior, injured the  ankle last week in practice and has not practiced since. Converted fullback  Tony Johnson will take his place if necessary.  </P> <P> Annette Burrows of Camarillo and Cynthia Pardee of Moorpark defeated Terri  Wells and Allison Evans of Louisville, Ky., 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, to win the Plymouth  Women's Doubles Challenge Division I title last week in Port Washington, N.Y.  </P> <P> Burrows and Pardee advanced to the national event by winning a Southern  California tournament and a regional tournament in San Francisco. Both were  awarded a 1990 Plymouth Sundance automobile.  </P></p>

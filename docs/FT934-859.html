			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / International Company News: Crisis plan agreed for Czech airline Shareholders in CSA, the Czech national airline in which Air France, Caisse des Depots and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development jointly have a 40 per cent stake, have agreed to implement a crisis restructuring plan to return the troubled Czech carrier to profit. The decision was made at an extraordinary shareholders meeting in Prague called to discuss CSA's growing losses and claims by Air France and the EBRD that the company was overvalued when they bought their stakes in 1992. The meeting also accepted the resignation of Mr Jiri Fiker, CSA president. He has been replaced by Mr Antonin Jakubse, a former CSA executive in Toronto. Mr Fiker was asked to resign by the Czech government, which has grown increasingly concerned about CSA's financial position. The airline is expected to make a loss of Kcs1.2bn (Dollars 40m) this year, following losses of Kcs400m in 1992. Previously published figures for 1992 had reflected only the loss for the first 8 months before the company was partially privatised. Mr Jakubse has been charged with preparing a 'crisis plan' for the airline. Industry sources say this could include reducing some services and accelerating the sale of old aircraft.</p>

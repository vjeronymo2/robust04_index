			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Beregovoy fires election salvo on jobs MR Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, yesterday kicked off the Socialist party's election campaign by calling on the next French government to reduce unemployment from 10.5 per cent to 8 per cent by 1998. Joblessness has emerged as a dominant issue in the approach to France's parliamentary elections in March. The rise in unemployment - now nearing 3m  -is one of the biggest sources of embarrassment for Mr Beregovoy and the ruling Socialists, who face an uphill struggle in their attempts to improve their dismal opinion poll per-formance. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the Socialists and the leader of their re-election effort, yesterday acknowledged that unemployment was his party's 'major weakness'. He told a Socialist conference in Paris that the party had to 'get to grips with the issue'. The right-wing opposition has already begun its attack on their unemployment record. Mr Eduard Balladur, who is tipped to be prime minister of a future right-wing government, warned on television that there would be 'hundreds of thousands more people without jobs' in the first half of this year as the economic squeeze continued. However Mr Balladur ruled out the possibility of artificially stimulating the French economy by devaluing the French franc. 'It would be against the national interest,' he said. 'I will do everything to avoid the franc being devalued.' His support for the franc was echoed by Mr Beregovoy, who, since the September currency crisis, has backed the Bank of France's efforts to protect the currency against attacks by the foreign exchange markets. 'As long as I am prime minister the franc will not be devalued,' he said in an interview with Journal de Dimanche newspaper. Both the left and right are developing plans to restimulate the economy and curb the rise in unemployment by creating jobs. Mr Beregovoy said his target of 8 per cent jobless by 1998 would be achieved partly by a European Community initiative to cut the working week to 37 hours and partly by employment reform. The Socialists have already tabled proposals to modernise employment practices by encouraging job sharing and part-time working. Mr Fabius said these reforms should be accelerated to boost job creation through public sector initiatives such as housing programmes. In the meantime the government has to get to grips with the financial problem of the rising social security budget deficit, estimated to have reached FFr30bn (Pounds 3.64bn) in the past three years. Ministers are expected this week to announce proposals to allocate an extra FFr20bn to reduce the deficit.</p>

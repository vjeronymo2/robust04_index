			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: Endogenous growth - treat with care An eminent Cambridge economist of yesteryear, Sir Dennis Robertson, once wrote that if you remained in the same place long enough economic fashion would eventually catch up with you. But it is still worth glancing at the most recent phases of the fashion cycle when they are used to rationalise the latest economic policy shifts. An instance is the whole group of theories known by the unwieldy name of 'endogenous growth', of which you will hear more. For they have been called into play in relation to some Clinton policies, above all the investment credits proposed in the president's fiscal package. These theories are also cited by the French Commissariat General du Plan, which is still alive and kicking, but as a source of long-range analyses rather than of immediate policy. There is nothing particularly new about the policy thrust of endogenous growth theory, which is to support government efforts to boost investment. Such efforts were regarded by many development economists as the key to growth in the postwar decades; and their critics long ago devised the name 'growthmanship' as a putdown. Nevertheless plans to boost investment or savings, separately or together, were the mainspring of many development plans prepared for third-world countries, with disappointing actual results. In Britain, Reginald Maudling, who was Conservative chancellor from 1962 to 1964, boasted that British investment incentives were superior to any in the west. The pendulum later swung against so much emphasis on investment, partly because of disillusion with its fruits and partly because of greater emphasis among policymakers on open trade policies, deregulation and the development of attitudes and skills favourable to growth. Mainstream economic theory was also called in aid by the sceptics. The reasserted orthodox view was that the growth of output depended on technical progress and the growth of the labour force. Investment was necessary to support this growth; but any attempt to force the pace by installing capital more quickly would lead to rapidly diminishing returns. Scepticism about the effects of investment was also supported by more down-to-earth 'growth accountancy', pioneered by an American economist, E F Denison. He and his followers found that quantifiable factors such as investment, or the expansion of the labour force, explained in typical cases no more than half a country's recorded growth rate. This left a large residual which could be attributed to technical progress, higher educational standards, market liberalisation or whatever other factor caught the analyst's fancy. The 'endogenous growth' theories are essentially a comeback by the pro-investment school. The assertion is that capital is the key to growth after all, and that the true return to investment is much higher than the market one. The word 'endogenous' was used to suggest that the technical know-how to support more output and a superior range of products was not something existing in a vacuum but came out of the investment process. A survey of the new theories is provided in the autumn 1992 issue of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy (published by the Oxford University Press). Many of the contributions are mainly concerned with mathematical possibilities. An important exception has been the British economist, Maurice Scott, who in his New View of Economic Growth, first published in 1989 (also by OUP), brought in a good deal of evidence to support his assertions in an unpretentious way, and which is only belatedly receiving the attention it has always deserved. Scott has tabulated his reasons for believing that the return to the individual investor much understates the true 'social' return from installing new capital. The first, which is fairly clear-cut, is that part of the gain is taken away in tax. But a second and bigger reason is what he calls the 'learning externality'. By this he means that the benefits of investment by one firm spill over to benefit others. For instance, innovation in one industry may for a time lead to abnormally high profits. Even if these are eliminated by competition, the benefit to the customer of cheaper and superior products remains. A third discrepancy arises from what is called the 'demand externality'. If all firms invest more, output and income will grow more quickly, thus increasing everyone's markets. On plausible assumptions about market structure, this will increase the returns to the original investment compared with what would have happened if one firm had invested on its own. (This 'demand externality' is not the same as the short-term stimulus to output which comes from interest rate cuts or budget deficits. It is rather the counterpart of a long-term increase in the economy's productive potential and therefore in its purchasing power.) A fourth factor acting in the opposite direction - tending to exaggerate investment returns - is called 'animal spirits'. This has become a technical term to describe the tendency of professional management to pursue greater size and growth beyond the point which would maximise their shareholders' wealth. It is one distortion making for too much investment and partly offsets all the other forces making for too little. Scott has deliberately chosen the postwar golden age for his table, when there really were such animal spirits. Since the 1973 oil shock, a negligible amount would have to be allowed for them. But even in the earlier period, they were not enough to prevent the true estimated social return on investment from being twice as high as the private one. The wiser exponents of 'endogenous growth' are very cautious about recommending a helter-skelter drive to subsidise every kind of investment. Scott warns about the 'scope for special interest lobby, not to mention corruption', if attempts were made to discriminate between projects on the basis of their contribution to growth. He concentrates mainly on the deterrents to savings in the tax system and on the case for a budget surplus to increase the national savings total. Even here, however, he is very cautious about making room for more capital spending unless investment actually increases to fill the gap, which 'writing in the midst of a bad depression must be the immediate concern'. But it would be dishonest of me to stop with these prudential considerations. Many of the real world influences favouring growth are ignored by the new theorists. As the introduction to the Oxford Review remarks, 'government thinking about reforms of the regulatory environment receives virtually no support'. Simply looking at the figures, it seems pretty clear that output and investment rise roughly in the same proportion in most countries at most times. Investment seems to me a product rather than a cause of the growth process. Of course, some of the benefits of investment, as of the skilful use of labour or of other inputs, spill over to others beyond those directly responsible. This is a fact of economic life with which we can live. The strongest aspect of the new theory is its opposition to the stark division between technical progress and investment in the older mainstream theory, which overlooks the all-important 'learning by doing'. But I am not convinced that putting all the emphasis on investment is right. Investment left to itself is just a cost; and I doubt if the key to prosperity is to throw bricks and mortar, machinery or research laboratories at problems. Both investment and innovation are parts of a single process of seizing opportunities. The true link between these factors is surely entrepreneurship, which is equally ignored by the mainstream classical theory and its more interventionist challengers.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     The gap between social and marginal real returns to investment  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Non-residential business sector         UK 1951-73    US 1948-73                                        (per pound)   (per dollar)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.

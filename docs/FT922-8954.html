			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Finance Ministers Meet In Oporto: EC agrees to co-ordinate measures to boost growth - 'A considerable breakthrough in the psychology of the Community' EUROPEAN COMMUNITY finance ministers, meeting in Oporto at the weekend, decided to co-ordinate the introduction of a range of supply-side measures to boost growth. But they rejected any short cut to a revival, saying EC economies have to earn interest rate reductions through continued efforts to reduce public spending and restrain wages. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, hailed the outcome as 'a very considerable breakthrough in the psychology of the Community'. Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, Portugal's finance minister, said: 'The main result of this meeting is a confirmation by the 12 that it is essential to proceed with the medium-term strategy agreed at Maastricht and to raise the credibility of European economic union.' It was a signal to the markets that Maastricht was here to stay, he said. Markets should be liberalised further and there was a need for greater efforts to control public spending, measures which it is hoped would help gradually to bring down interest rates. The European Commission is to report within a month on how the co-ordinated measures - which Mr Lamont suggested might include privatisation - can be introduced into member states' convergence programmes. The member states would examine and judge this through the 'multilateral surveillance' process designed to encourage compliance with the stringent financial targets for Emu later this decade. Apart from lower deficits and wage moderation, the main emphasis was on promoting flexibility in the labour market; a fast completion of the single market and the need to conclude the stalled Uruguay Round on world trade liberalisation; reducing the fiscal burden on savings to boost investment; and boosting public investment at the expense of current spending. Expectations of a rather fizzier 'European growth initiative' had been encouraged by France's request for a special debate on the effect on growth and jobs of high interest rates dictated by the high borrowing requirement for German unification. Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, suggested that since Germany's budget deficit was not structural, Bonn should ease off interest rates and 'let the market work,' but EC frustration with Bonn was muted at the meeting. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, said on French TV yesterday that France had 'awoken the attention' of other EC governments on the need to stimulate economic growth in the Community. 'There is not enough growth and too many unemployed. We must buckle down together,' he said. 'It is important that each government does what it can, taking account of the economic situation, to accelerate growth.' He singled out Germany, which is under continuing pressure from its EC partners to drop interest rates to stimulate economic activity. 'Germany has its difficulties and it is France's duty to understand them. . . on the other hand, Germany must understand the difficulties of its EC partners,' said Mr Beregovoy. In Oporto Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, predicted what Mr Sapin called 'very important cuts' to the budget, so that Germany's public spending would grow only half as fast as investment. Mr Waigel described last week's public sector wage rises, averaging 5.2 per cent, as 'bearable' for a reduced budget. Ministers and central bankers at the informal meeting said there were unlikely to be new interest rate drops soon after last week's half point cuts in the UK, France and Ireland. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, chairman of the EC central bankers, warned that premature cuts could lead to big short-term capital flows. 'If you look at 1991, all of us tried to get rates down at one time or other, and some of us burnt our fingers.' Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister facing a general strike on May 28 because of planned social security cuts aimed at meeting Emu budget targets, warned against giving 'an unreal impression that growth will come very soon or be very strong, because that is not the case.' Mr Lamont used the labour market debate to strengthen the UK's attack on EC plans to introduce an obligatory limit of 48 hours in the working week, a directive all its partners are likely to vote through at June 24's council of social affairs ministers, after two years of British filibustering. The Dutch and Spanish ministers, unlike their employment minister colleagues, agreed the measure worked against the grain of growth. Additional reporting by William Dawkins in Paris</p>

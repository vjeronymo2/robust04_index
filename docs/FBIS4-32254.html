			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kolodko has ended his  visit to the United States, during which he explained to his  U.S. partners the Polish Government's economic program.  Grzegorz Kolodko believes that he has succeeded in convincing  representatives of the Washington government and the IMF that  the present Polish Government is not wrecking what their  predecessors have done and that the Strategy for Poland program  is the plan for the future.    [Begin Kolodko recording] The IMF, Treasury Secretary  Dentsen, and Ms. Tyson, head of President Clinton's team of  economic advisors, who will visit Poland together with the  president, all believe that this ambitious program and its  objectives will be fulfilled and implemented if the work is well  organized and if government policy is clear and firm, which we  are, of course, determined to pursue. [end recording]    [Announcer] Grzegorz Kolodko has also announced plans to set  up a Polish-U.S. investment fund to support the privatization  process in Poland. Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko hopes that  initially it will be possible to make $100 million available for  the fund.</p>

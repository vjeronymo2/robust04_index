			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Call for targeted mortgage relief THE government should end mortgage tax relief for the better off and target the relief to those who most need it, according to the Construction Industry Council, one of the industry's lobbying organisations. Redirecting the relief to those who need it least would play an important part in balancing the Budget and improving the economy, the council said yesterday. Mr Ian Dixon, the council's chairman, suggested that linking mortgage tax relief to the council-tax bands may be worth considering.</p>

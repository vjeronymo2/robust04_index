			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / EU agrees plan to aid Merseyside including subsidised interest rates for small businesses - has been agreed between the UK and the European Union after months of controversy and negotiation. The plan will be the basis for spending nearly Pounds 630m of EU funds resulting from Merseyside's Objective 1 status, which was granted last year. UK public-sector sources will match the sum. The combined Pounds 1.26bn is expected to attract more from the private sector. Although details still have to be approved by the European Commission next month, the government yesterday published guidelines on the type of projects that might be funded, with details of how applications should be made. A plan for disbursing the money, with much going on training, was rejected by Brussels in April as vague. The new plan picks five main 'drivers' of economic change. These are: In the big-company sector projects will relate to preparing and servicing sites for companies and inward investors. Infrastructure spending will also be provided. Small and medium-size enterprises will be encouraged to grow, with EU money helping to fund training, services and advice through training and enterprise councils and Business Links. There will be a Merseyside Special Investment Fund, set up by the clearing banks but with EU money used to subsidise interest rates for business loans. Knowledge-based industries will be encouraged, with special attention to technology transfer between Merseyside's two universities and industry. One idea is a graduate-retention programme with local industry, to keep more qualified people in the area. The arts, cultural and tourism sectors will be encouraged. Initiatives will concentrate on training and systematic development of human resources. Inner-city and social-problem areas, such as outer estates with high unemployment, will be targeted.</p>

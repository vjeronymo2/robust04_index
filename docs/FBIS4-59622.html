			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] It is emerging one week later that 'Arafat has  made an appeal for the jihad to continue until Jerusalem is  liberated. This took place in Johannesburg, at the time of  Mandela's swearing-in ceremony, behind closed doors in a mosque.  The Palestinian leader -- in English -- asked South Africa's  Muslim community to participate in the jihad -- the holy war --  to liberate the city. 'Arafat has given assurances that the  struggle will continue. More details from Tiago Rebelo:    [Rebelo] The Palestinian leader delivered the speech at a  mosque -- with no journalists present -- but a recording of his  words reached the South African Jewish community and the Israeli  radio:    [Begin 'Arafat recording] The jihad will continue. And  Jerusalem is not for the Palestinian people [as heard]. [end  recording]    [Rebelo] That is 'Arafat saying that the jihad will  continue,  because Jerusalem belongs to all Muslims and is more important  than anything else the Palestinians have already got out of the  Israelis. It was a public appeal by 'Arafat that, had it been  made before the signing of the Cairo accords, could have been a  reason for the Palestinian autonomy process to be stopped. The  PLO leader is now making this appeal for Arab mobilization,  because, as he stated, the main Palestinian battle concerns  precisely Jerusalem, the most important Muslim holy place.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] We have the PLO representative live on the  telephone. Good afternoon Dr. Isam Bisusu. We have now heard  for the first time -- at least in Portugal -- 'Arafat's appeal.  Is this a PLO counterattack?    [Bisusu] First, I want to confirm that President 'Arafat's  political line, as well as that of the PLO in general, is  precisely the one that was reported in the Declaration of  Principles in Washington and signed in Cairo on 4 May.  Therefore, I want to confirm again that 'Arafat, during the  years of war against Israel, never made an appeal for a jihad;  he never appealed for a jihad. This is because the PLO  declaration, the PLO principles, are very clear about the  international solidarity under which all Muslims, Jewish people,  and Christians have a claim over Jerusalem.    [Announcer] Does that mean that jihad does not mean holy  war?    [Bisusu] Holy war is a totally different thing that appeals  to all Muslims all over the world to fight against the  Christians and the Jews and is a totally different thing.  [passage omitted]    [Announcer] We also have live on the telephone the Israeli  Ambassador in Lisbon Binyamin Oron. Good afternoon. What is  your reaction to 'Arafat's statement?    [Oron] Good afternoon. I would like to correct a small  detail mentioned in your conversation: Jerusalem is not the main  Muslim holy city, it is the third most holy city following Mecca  and Medina.    [Announcer] Is it not the main holy city in Israel?    [Oron] It may be so, but it may be so for the Jews and not  for the Muslims. That is a correction I wanted to make before I  can add anything else.    [Announcer] Can you then comment on 'Arafat's appeal?    [Oron] Well, I heard the speech by the PLO president, Mr.  'Arafat. I have not heard it completely, I only heard the bit  you have broadcasted. If in reality those things were stated, I  believe it is a serious statement.    [Announcer] Do you believe it is a threat to the climate of  negotiations?    [Oron] Well, I believe that all the process is based on a  mutual compromise, in the exchange of documents that preceeded  the signing of the statement of principles which stated all the  differences and conflicts would be decided or discussed through  negotiations and in a peaceful manner.    [Announcer] Let me clarify a concept: Is jihad for you not a  holy war different from the way Dr. Bisusu has interpreted it?    [Oron] I believe that people from the east have different  interpretations. I do not want to debate academic  interpretations. It is natural that the connotation of jihad is  a negative one; it is not one of negotiation and compromise. It  has a negative connotation although orientalists interpret it in  different ways.    [Announcer] To end our conversation, could you tell us  briefly about the statement made in Israel by the government?    [Oron] Well, the government, the prime minister, stated that  if in reality those statements were made, there would be a  question mark over the process. They are serious statements,  and we would have to read the whole text to have a more official  reaction.    [Announcer] Many thanks ambassador. Let us go back to Dr.  Bisusu to have a final comment on the words of the Israeli  ambassador in Lisbon:    [Bisusu] I believe that both sides, the Palestinians and  Israelis, have made declarations of principles in Washington and  Cairo. I believe the Palestinians and Israelis have an interest  in following what was signed in those countries -- Egypt and the  United States. As far as we are concerned, the war is over.  The most important route is that of peace, and we are going to  continue following this route. The Isreali occupation is over  in part of Palestine -- Jericho and Gaza -- and this occupation  ended with peace negotiations and not with military action.  Therefore we must continue the peace negotiations that have  been carried over the past seven months. [passage omitted]</p>

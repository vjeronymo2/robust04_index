			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: DCC shows 24% growth to IPounds 8.8m DCC, the Dublin-based diversified holding company which came to the market in May, reported a 24 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from IPounds 7.11m to IPounds 8.82m (Pounds 8.7m) for the half year to September, reflecting improved economic conditions in Ireland and the UK. The group has interests in 20 companies in the foods, energy, healthcare and computer services sectors, including snack food manufacturing, waste oil recycling and natural gas distribution in the UK, and health care services in the US. Turnover, after deducting the share of associated companies, rose 26 per cent to IPounds 119m (IPounds 94.7m). Operating profits were up 35 per cent to IPounds 10m (IPounds 7.42m). Mr Jim Flavin, DCC's founder and chief executive, said the performance was 'driven by organic growth and not merely the result of acquisitions'. The foods sector is the largest contributor, with operating profits 44 per cent up at IPounds 3m (IPounds 2.1m). The result includes contributions from its associates, among them Fyffes, the fruit trader, and Allied Foods. Earnings per share amounted to 7.9p (6.86p) and an interim dividend of 2.4p is being paid. A good outcome was expected for the year as seasonal factors, particularly in the energy sector, weighted profits towards the second half, Mr Flavin said. DCC spent IPounds 5.1m on acquisitions in the period, including a controlling interest in Virtus, a healthcare products maker. DCC has been trading at below its issue price for much of the period since going public.</p>

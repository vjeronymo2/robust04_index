			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paraguay and the United States have not yet  designated their respective reciprocal ambassadors. This makes  you wonder whether there is an impasse, although Foreign  Minister Luis Maria Ramirez Boettner denies this. In Paraguay's  case, the delay in designating a new ambassador has been  greater. Paraguay has not had an ambassador in Washington since  January 1994 when Juan Esteban Aguirre resigned that post.  Aguirre is currently occupying a high-level Inter-American Bank  (IDB) position in Peru.    Ramirez Boettner said the country has already asked the  United States for its agreement on one name for the post, and  the ministry is awaiting an answer before submitting the  nomination to the Senate. The foreign minister did not want to  provide the name of the future ambassador, saying: "It is not  customary to release the name of an ambassador-designate until  the country where he is supposed to serve sends its agreement."    Ramirez Boettner said the delay in designating a U.S.  ambassador to Paraguay to replace Jon Glassman is not a sign of  disagreement with Paraguay. "It is absolutely normal. They are  going through a transition period during which they are choosing  an adequate candidate for the post. It is absolutely normal,  and we have splendid relations with the United States in all  respects," the foreign minister said. [passage omitted]</p>

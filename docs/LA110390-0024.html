			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACES . . .: TONY WINNER, SITCOM STAR RALPH NOW SETS HER SIGHTS ON MOVIES  </P> <P> Sheryl Lee Ralph has already conquered Broadway -- winning a Tony nomination  for her performance in the 1981 landmark musical "Dreamgirls" -- and headlined  two sitcoms, "It's a Living" and "New Attitude."  </P> <P> Now she is making her bid for movie stardom.  </P> <P> The actress is starring opposite Danny Glover in Charles Burnett's critically  acclaimed first feature, "To Sleep With Anger," as a materialistic wife and  mother whose life changes when an old family friend (Glover) meddles with the  relationships among a family.  </P> <P> "I got a review from somebody," says Ralph, "and they said I was 'intelligently  sexy.' And I said, 'Yeah, that's it.' It's a wonderful thing to be able to  combine those two things not only in life, but in film."  </P> <P> The actress also has won the coveted starring role in "Romuald and Juliette,"  the American remake of the French farce, "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed,"  about a married white executive who falls in love with his company's black  cleaning woman.  </P> <P> Difficulties in casting the male lead have pushed production into 1991. "I  would be hard pressed to say why they haven't found an actor," says Ralph.  </P> <P> But she says someone told her it was a race issue: "It just made me see that  women are further down on the totem pole than we thought. I said (to the  person), 'You mean to tell me that people are entertaining the idea that the  reason why a white leading male actor would not take this role is because I am  an upcoming black female actress?' If that is not one of the most sexist,  racist things ever said to me, I don't know what else to say about the industry  or the nation I live in -- both of which I love so deeply."SUSAN KING  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Furio Colombo: "Bad Memories"] </F>   [Text] Bill Clinton has come to Italy to visit two  countries (the Vatican and Italy) on behalf of two Americas (the  isolationist one that keeps telling him "us first," and that  which bears the great international role and which is demanding  from him a global presence and leadership). In so doing he is  obliged to travel in time, to traverse history twice: Once, to  revisit the victory. And once, for a meeting with the specters  of the past, which that victory declared finished forever.    I used the word "specters" deliberately, because the NEW  YORK  TIMES has used it frequently in its commentaries on  post-election Italy, which are still anxious. On the day when  the American president is due to speak in Rome the NEW YORK  TIMES addresses him twice. On page three the newspaper says:  "Italian neofascism will make Clinton's diplomacy tough." On  page 22, the New York daily's first editorial devoted to Italy  has the headline, "Bad Memories in Italy."    Even if this is the direction of the difficulties that  Clinton has to contend with on his first major international  appearance, we know, even before we hear him speak, that the  American president too will be obliged to split himself in two.  One Clinton, aware of the delicacy of his mission and of his  role as guest, will display cordiality, his famous smile, and  kind remarks which it will not be inappropriate to interpret as  encouragement and good wishes for the new government.    The other Clinton, an anxious one, will examine the signals  and try to understand whether the anxiety that has spread  through the world exists purely and simply as a reflection of  the past or because there is a real fear that the past will  return.    "Bad Memories" provides some pointers. The NEW YORK TIMES  editorial, starting with its headline, presents its leaders with  the jigsaw puzzle of tone, style, rumors (and "gaffes,"  according to the newspaper) created around this period in  Italy's life. It puts forward the following simple arguments:  There is no dispute over the horror of the past (of "that"  past). Indeed, we -- all the world's non-Fascist and non-Nazi  forces -- united to destroy it. But what can be the aim or  purpose or use of digging up the corpse, bringing back the smell  of death of that time?    The editorial seems to be conveying mainly a certain sense  of  surprise. It sounds more like an appeal for sensitivity than a  condemnation of a policy line or a proposed condemnation. It  seems to be asking some Italians, without any attempt to  interfere: How can you want an appeal to that past? And how  can such an appeal serve your domestic life, your economic  recovery, your creative impulse, your international future?    Clinton will certainly have a copy of that editorial in his  briefcase. But Clinton, president of the country that has been  the leader of the world and that is returning to Europe as  leader of the 1945 victory, has openly crossed the lines between  present and past by emphasizing above all the greatness of the  good alliance and the intention that it survive any  misunderstandings and continue to exist. This, since that  alliance among the "good" allies is the very one that brought  the world from the Normandy landing to the collapse of the  Berlin Wall, keeping it free of prejudice, discrimination,  contempt, and any limitations of freedom.    The American president and his aides found valuable support,  almost a solution to the dilemma (mere formalities or some kind  of substantive statement about the new Italy?) by concentrating,  at least in statements made to the American press, on the crisis  in North Korea, which is becoming serious, to the nuclear threat  which seems to be returning. There can be no expedients in that  part of the world. Whatever happens, the Korean crisis shows  that Clinton's America cannot demobilize with respect to  international problems.    Then there are the remarks devoted explicitly to this  government, which American television cautiously framed with the  "causes for anxiety over the presence of ministers having some  connection with Fascism." Clinton says: Let us look forward.  In so doing he seems to have found the right balance.    The dual emphasis on confidence in the country and on the  need to look to the future seems to mean: Instead of letting  your wheels spin in the sands of time, consider whether you  should not make a leap forward. A leap forward in employment,  initiative, and cooperation also means a sharp break with the  bad taste anxiously evoked in the NEW YORK TIMES editorial.    After Clinton has passed through the streets of Rome, we  Italians will again find ourselves on the two sides of sharply  opposing alternatives: Should we interpret it all as a  celebration and normalization? Or should we interpret every  expression of anxiety (as happens more in Europe than in  America) and antagonism as the sign of an anti-Italian front,  every time as a conspiracy against the country, or as the start  of a new resistance?    But this day in Rome could be useful, over and above  diplomatic courtesies. It could remind some people that it  would be better to avoid an obsessive "marching on the spot,"  with attention hypnotized by a single topic, as though the flow  of political events could remain frozen. And it could suggest  to others that they stop displaying such bad taste (or  provocativeness) as to refer to their past as though it were a  normal alternative of history. It is not. If the war had ended  differently, the world would look frighteningly different. Bill  Clinton's mere presence here has told everyone so, irrespective  of what he says.    But Clinton also had to play a twofold role in his brief --  and, some say, not easy -- meeting with the pope. Again,  Clinton -- by nature conciliatory and willing to put himself in  other people's shoes -- had to engage in that conversation with  the heavy burden of American public opinion, disinclined to  accept the Catholic theory of the limitless multiplication of  children in the world. And, we imagine, he will have had to  draw a dividing line between one vision and the other of the  future and the function of the international agencies, of the  United Nations first and foremost, and the plan for birth  control worldwide.    Once again Clinton was forced to realize America's influence  in the world and will have had to consider whether the United  States really can distance itself from a world leader such as  the pope and whether they could not find some common ground in  their disagreement by shifting to the aspect of protecting the  world, rather than the aspect of limitation.    But Clinton's day in Rome was certainly not a waste of time.  Not for him, who was made fully aware of the vacuum and  disorientation that can result from America's absence or  neglect. And not for us, if we really believe that American  democracy -- the most steadfast and stable in the world --  remains the reference point for our life and political approach.</p>

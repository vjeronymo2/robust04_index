			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "This Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] The pacification process in northern Nicaragua,  including a plan against criminal gangs -- the recently  implemented Operation Triangle -- which led to the seizure of a  large cocaine shipment, the relations between the Executive and  Legislative Branches, and the economy were among the issues  discussed at a cabinet meeting headed by President Violeta  Chamorro and Presidency Minister Antonio Lacayo.    The most salient issue discussed by the ministers during  their four-and-a- half-hour meeting was the end of the rearmed  saga on 15 April with the demobilization of the 3-80 Northern  Front [FN 3- 80]. In this regard, Government Minister Alfredo  Mendieta commented on the details of the disarmament plan and  the reintegration into civilian life of the former FN 3-80  combatants. Minister Mendieta also reported on the recently  implemented Operation Triangle.    As for a plan against criminal gangs operating in northern  and central Nicaragua, the ministers were not only briefed on  actions by the National Police and the Sandinist People's Army,  but on the determination of the Chamorro administration to  complement them with legal actions.    In regard to the relations between the Executive and  Legislative Branches, the ministers engaged in ample discussion  on an agreement signed between the two on 12 March in which they  recognize that the two branches must reach a consensus on the  various laws that affect national life.    They also had a broad discussion on an agreement reached  between government authorities and the top military leadership  on the Code of Military Organization, Jurisdiction, and Social  Security.    As for the economy, President Chamorro and Minister Lacayo  instructed the ministers to switch their focus from  macroeconomic to microeconomic aspects to uncover bureaucratic  red tape and make official procedures easier for the population,  especially those related to basic services such as health,  energy, electricity, and customs.</p>

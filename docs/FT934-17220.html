			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Opec output ceiling supports oil stocks A CEILING on output resulting from the Opec talks helped oil stocks yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. AMSTERDAM was lifted by Royal Dutch, up Fl 3.30 to Fl 186.30 on agreement at the Opec ministers meeting in Geneva. The CBS Tendency index finished up 0.6 to 124.5 in turnover reported as low. KNP BT went against the trend with a fall of 20 cents to FL 33.70, having priced its one for five rights issue below market expectations at Fl 30.50. Philips and Polygram both put on 60 cents, to Fl 37.20 and Fl 63.40 respectively; investors responded with some enthusiasm from comments by Mr Jan Timmer, the chairman, that the group's cost-cutting exercise was so far surpassing set targets. PARIS saw the expiry of options and futures contracts pull the CAC-40 index lower; it closed 12.17 down at 2,114.63 after an earlier high of 2,131.52. Because of technical trading turnover rose to FFr3.8bn. Positive moves included Alcatel Alsthom's gain of FFr9 to FFr733 on flat first half-profits, and Elf Aquitaine's advance of FFr8.50 to FFr422.60 on the Opec news. Generale des Eaux lost FFr20 to FFr2,578 on the announcement late on Wednesday that the government may liberalise the cellphone sector and grant a licence to a third operator. The slide in LVMH continued as brokers issued sell notes, the stock coming off FFr63 to FFr3,767. Since recording a year's high at the beginning of September the shares have lost 13 per cent as the market braced itself for disappointing interim results. Bancaire shed FFr20.80 or 4 per cent to FFr494.20 on rumours that it might drop out of the CAC-40 in due course to make way for BNP. FRANKFURT took its gains on the September quarter to 12.8 per cent as the DAX index rose 8.02 to 1,915.71 in turnover dipped from DM5.3bn to DM5.1bn. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that descending interest and inflation rate trends should continue to be good for the market in the medium term, but that the weak dollar, the cancellation of pay agreements in the metal-based industries and any escalation in Russia fears should limit upward potential in the weeks immediately ahead. The leading DAX stocks over the past three months were story-led, said Mr Frahm: at the top, Lufthansa rose 37.1 per cent, on its privatisation prospects and on effective domestic political support; next, Schering was up 23.6 per cent on prospects for its Betaseron drug; and thirdly, Viag's potential merger with Bayernwerk gave it a gain of 22.6 per cent. The same applied to the company at the bottom. Volkswagen, under pressure from industrial espionage allegations, rose just 1.3 per cent, 10.2 per cent down relative to the DAX; but this still left it up 51.6 per cent over the first nine months of this year. MILAN recovered some ground as Fiat rebounded after Wednesday's fall, but the rise was restrained as the market awaited further details of the Rinascente disposal. The Comit index added 2.05 to 596.03. Mr Roberto Morelli at NatWest Securities commented: 'I think that after the shock, the reality is dawning that the capital increase really was needed. The market perception has certainly improved today.' Fiat rose L132 to L5,689. Sip rose L42 to L3,722 in a continued response to much better than expected gross operating profits. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's holding company, moved forward L47 to L1,620 in response to first-half results which showed a return to pre-tax profit. Sme, the state controlled supermarket and motorway restaurant chain, shed L48 to L4,177 as it forecast that full year figures would be in line with those of last year. ZURICH slipped on profit-taking and the SMI index, headed towards the 2,500 level early in the day, finished 12.3 lower at 2,473.1. An analyst at James Capel in London saw no reason for the market to pull back before the 2,500 level was breached, although it was difficult to see what, other than a cut in interest rates, might help prices convincingly higher. He believed that in the continued absence of a lead from the Bundesbank, Switzerland would cut rates unilaterally, since unemployment was rising, the money supply was under control, the Swiss franc was strong and headline inflation was about to fall in November. The profit-taking left Nestle SFr9 lower at SFr1,090 after its strong performance during the week.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 30                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open       11.30     12.00      13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1295.05     1295.16   1295.33    1295.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1296.21     1294.09   1292.66    1293.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               14.00       15.00     16.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1362.94     1362.88   1364.33    1364.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1366.14     1363.91   1362.50    1362.51  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 29    Sep 28    Sep 27    Sep 24    Sep 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1288.31   1288.96   1290.59   1274.95   1273.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1356.79   1364.11   1361.41   1346.86   1347.03  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1296.84; 200 - 1367.61 Low/day: 100 - 1292.36  200 - 1361.38  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

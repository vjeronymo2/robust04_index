			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> A Screening Screening: A cinema complex in Southfield, Mich., has outlined  plans to install metal detectors to keep people from bringing guns and other  weapons to the movies. Officials at the AMC-Americana theater announced plans  for detectors and other increased security measures following a shoot-out at  the cinema Friday night during the premiere screening of Eddie Murphy's  action-comedy "Harlem Nights." Shots were fired inside and out of the theater,  wounding three men. Management has since pulled the movie from the cinema's  marquee. DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

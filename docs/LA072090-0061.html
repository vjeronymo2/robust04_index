			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRE ACT GETS COMICAL IN ST. LOUIS  </P> <P> The folks of St. Louis have been reading all of the rave reviews for the past  four weeks. Friends have told them all about it, saying this is a show that can  not be missed.  </P> <P> But you know how reviews can be, lots of hype and a huge letdown. So who could  blame the fans of St. Louis for being a bit skeptical when they arrived  Thursday night to Busch Stadium, wondering if the show really could be as good  as advertised.  </P> <P> Well, by the time the show ended Thursday night, with the bumbling Padres  losing once again, 8-3, you should have seen the 29,688 paying customers.  </P> <P> They were standing on their feet, begging for more.  </P> <P> Fans were flicking their cigarette lighters, pleading for just one more  appearance.  </P> <P> Sorry, the Padres said, that's all for this night. They'll be around for the  next three days, so come on back, there'll be plenty of more laughter.  </P> <P> Where else can you spend $5 bucks for the cheap seats and see the most comical  team since the 1951 St. Louis Browns, whose owner had to resort to bringing in  a midget for laughs.  </P> <P> Heck, all Padre chairman Tom Werner has to do is just throw nine players, any  nine, on the field to generate the kind of laughter that has people tumbling  down the aisles.  </P> <P> If the act starts to get stale . . . well, maybe that's what Werner had in mind  when he invited Roseanne Barr to sing the national anthem Wednesday. When she's  done, she can stick on a uniform and play a few innings.  </P> <P> Oh, those fun-loving Padres, losers of 17 of the past 20, when will they stop?  </P> <P> The last time the Padres ever had a worse 20-game stretch than this was when  Nixon was President. The Padres twice had stretches of 18 losses in 20 games  during their inaugural year in 1969, but stay tuned, 74 games still remain in  this season.  </P> <P> No wonder when first baseman Jack Clark got ejected in the sixth inning by  home-plate umpire Jerry Davis for arguing a called third-strike, Clark threw  out this beauty:  </P> <P> "I might try to get thrown out every . . . day. I'd have more fun, that's for  sure."  </P> <P> Oh, those Padres. Just when you think they can't get any worse, they put on an  exhibition like Thursday.  </P> <P> Where else can you see a team make two errors on this night, and 10 since the  All-Star break? They've allowed 20 runs the past three games; 13 have been  unearned.  </P> <P> Where else in the same game can you see Clark forget to cover a bunt at first  base; shortstop Garry Templeton forget to cover second on a stolen-base  attempt; third baseman Eddie Williams forget to swing on a hit-and-run; and  second baseman Bip Roberts forget to get down on a ground ball that goes past  him.  </P> <P> And you wonder why this team has somehow managed to lead at the end of just 36  of the past 185 innings?  </P> <P> "We're just a bad team right now," Clark said. "We're playing bad, and we've  been playing bad. The way we're going right now, we're giving teams a chance to  break things wide open."  </P> <P> Manager Greg Riddoch, who took over at the break for Jack McKeon, says to go  ahead and blame him instead of his players. He'll says that he'll take  responsibility for these defeats.  </P> <P> That's awfully heroic of him, but hell, Connie Mack couldn't win with this  team.  </P> <P> Maybe it's time Werner took over the public-address microphone the way former  Padre owner Ray Kroc did on the opening day of 1974, and utter those infamous  words: "This is the stupidest baseball I've ever seen."  </P> <P> "We're all trying to figure out what's going on," said Padre right fielder Tony  Gwynn, who was celebrating his eighth anniversary of breaking into the big  leagues. "I keep thinking we'll turn it around, but I'm sure getting sick of  saying it."  </P> <P> Perhaps the biggest problem, Clark said, is their lack of direction. No one  knows if the Padres are going after victories, if they're in midst of a  rebuilding process, or if they're just plain experimenting.  </P> <P> "I think we need to get to the point where we need to say what we want to  accomplish," Clark said, "whether we're in a building stage or whether we want  to win. We've made a lot of changes, but we really haven't put our finger on  what we want to accomplish. We need to clarify that.  </P> <P> "I think we're going through our rebuilding stage, but we haven't actually  admitted that to you guys (reporters), or to ourselves. And because of that, I  don't think it's fair to a lot of the young players or the position players to  say we're an awful team. But the chemistry's so messed up, we're looking like  one."  </P> <P> "It's obvious we're not going to win it this year, anyway, but it's tough to  come in here and feel like a winner when you always lose. No one's having fun  in here. No one's doing cartwheels. It's screwed up.  </P> <P> "We're not going to win no championship this year, but you can be champions  without having the title."  </P> <P> The Padres indeed have been in a state of transition the past 2 1/2 weeks. Not  only do they have a new manager and two new coaches, but they have five players  on their roster who were playing in triple-A just 16 days ago.  </P> <P> Riddoch, however, didn't buy the argument as an explanation for their losing  ways, and said that there's no reason they shouldn't be playing better than  this.  </P> <P> "The job comes down to throwing the ball, hitting the ball, and catching the  ball," Riddoch said. "It's a 10-day road trip, you can't panic. Also, we have  injuries, so we can't throw the same lineup out there each day and go with it."  </P> <P> The latest injury occurred to Roberts, who jammed his hand in the first inning  while sliding into first base and likely will miss today's game, Riddoch said.  </P> <P> "I'm getting to the point where nothing feels comfortable," Roberts said, who  has started at four different positions this season. "I basically don't know  where I'm playing each day. I mean, I know I'll play, but I just don't know  where.  </P> <P> "But if I keep screwing up, I'm not going to be playing anywhere."  </P> <P> That, of course, can be said about a whole lot of guys right now.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Tony Gwynn, who has already had dozens of his bats stolen this season at San  Diego Jack Murphy Stadium, almost had a bigger scare when he learned that  burglars attempted to break into his house Sunday. But alarms went off, the  police arrived and the burglars fled before anything was stolen. "Thank God  nobody was home," Gwynn said. "It would have really scared my family. There was  no damage, but still, it makes you upset and pretty mad that something like  that would happen." . . . Andy Benes could miss his scheduled start Sunday  against the Cardinals because of a sore left shoulder. If he's unable to pitch,  left-hander Derek Lilliquist will take his place. Benes, a righthander, still  has a sore left shoulder from the melee July 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates,  when third baseman Bobby Bonilla tugged at his arm. "There's no sense taking  any chances, especially at this point of the season," said Pat Dobson, Padre  pitching coach.  </P> <P> The Padres finally got Davis from Kansas City. No, not that Davis. The Padres  purchased the contract of reliever John Davis of Las Vegas to replace pitcher  Mike Dunne, who Tuesday fractured his right leg Tuesday. Davis was raised in  the Kansas City organization, but was traded in 1987 as part of the deal that  sent pitchers Melido Perez, Greg Hibbard and Chuck Mount from Kansas City to  Chicago for pitcher Floyd Bannister. Perez and Hibbard are in the White Sox  starting rotation; Bannister is in Japan. Davis made his debut with the Padres  on Thursday, pitching a hitless inning by inducing two ground balls and a  strikeout. . . . When Calvin Schiraldi entered the game in the fifth inning in  relief of Bruce Hurst, he became the first Padre pitcher since the Kroc era to  wear a beard in uniform. The Kroc family, which has owned the team from 1984 to  June, 1990, had a team rule prohibiting players from wearing beards. Schiraldi  just started growing his beard a week ago. . . . Padre players Jack Clark, Ed  Whitson and Mark Parent spent Wednesday night fishing at one of the lakes on  Cardinal pitcher Danny Cox's 80-acre estate. Clark led the group by catching  two fish. Whitson and Parent were shut out. The highlight of the adventure? "It  was pitch-black out there," Parent said, "and a dog started paddling out of  nowhere. We didn't know what it was until it got close to us. It scared the  hell out of us."  </P> <P> Dal Maxvill, Cardinal general manager, met Wednesday night with Angel  broadcaster Joe Torre to discuss the Cardinal managing job. He interviewed Gene  Tenace on Thursday. . . . Whitey Herzog, former Cardinal Manager, on the  continued poor play of the Cardinals: "I guess it wasn't me. I thought I was  the cause of it." . . . Baby watch: Padre pitcher Mike Dunne's wife, Pam, is  due July 31 with their first baby; Parent's wife, Wendy, is due Aug. 1 with  their first-born. . . . Cardinal reliever Lee Smith, on the hazards of having  two teammates with the same last name: "You're walking through an airport, and  somebody says, 'Hey, Smitty,' and three guys turn around." . . . The Padres are  batting just .172 on this trip with two out and runners in scoring position. .  . . Garry Templeton obtained his first triple since Aug. 21, 1989, when  Cardinal center fielder Willie McGee missed making a shoestring catch.  </P> <P> PADRES AT A GLANCEScorecard  </P> <P> SECOND INNING  </P> <P> Cardinals -- Zeile homered to left, his 10th.

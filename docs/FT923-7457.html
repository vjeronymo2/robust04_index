			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Banking on the impossible LEWIS Carroll's Red Queen, who made it a rule to believe six impossible things before breakfast, would find herself quite at home in international banking. She would surely have seized with pleasure on the news that Chile's sovereign debt has now achieved an investment-grade rating. After all, that raises the possibility that in time some of the Latin American debtor nations will be rated more highly than the banks who lent to them - something that would certainly have seemed impossible a few breakfasts ago. Another newly credible impossibility is a world in which investors and depositors must pick and choose just as discriminatingly among individual Swiss and German banks as they now do between those supervised in more traditionally freewheeling financial centres. To trace that thought back to its origin, turn to the Red Queen's favourite morning reading, the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. The latest edition, published today, contains a study highlighting the remarkably bumpy profits of banks in the most rapidly deregulated financial markets, and the striking difference between the best and worst performers. In countries with traditionally more regulated and insulated financial sectors, such as Germany and Switzerland, the study says, banks appear to have performed more consistently. 'Experience suggests that moving from a regulated cartel-like environment to one in which lending capacity and competition are enhanced opens up more scope for banks' performance to vary according to the quality of management and individual strategies.' Heartily endorsed That view is one which will be heartily endorsed by the shareholders of many a British or American bank. Shareholders in Germany and Switzerland may in time come to hold similar views, since banking deregulation is now under way in both countries. Ominously, commercial real-estate loans, high but stable in Germany throughout the 1980s, are now starting to rise as a proportion of the banks' total lending. That is just what happened in the US, Japan and the UK in the 1980s - and if the increase proves excessive, German bank shareholders may yet regret the consequences. Another prospect to please the Red Queen is a banking system which no longer provides the bulk of bank lending to its domestic corporate sector. Between 1980 and 1991, however, the share of total UK bank lending accounted for by foreign banks rose from 26 per cent to 35 per cent. If it continues to grow at the same rate, UK banks will in time find themselves providing only a minority of total domestic lending. Momentary pause They may not mind, if they continue to reduce their dependence on interest as a source of profits. Figures in the Bank's study draw attention to another remarkable phenomenon: the speed with which banks have raised their non-interest income in the past decade. Between 1980 and 1991, banks in Britain raised non-interest earnings from 25 per cent of pre-tax income to 43 per cent. In France, the figure rose even more sharply, from 19 per cent in 1980 to 45 per cent in 1990. Last year, banks in the US obtained almost half of their total income - 47 per cent - from non-interest sources, up from 27 per cent in 1980. Yet the prospect of banks which derive most of their profits from activities other than lending is surely one which merits a momentary pause for thought. The Bank raises its own delicately arched eyebrow: it notes that the benefits from data-processing investment to raise the profitability of non-interest business have so far been modest, and that banks are not alone in pursuing this sort of customer. Investment banks, money-market funds, insurance companies and unit trusts are all spending hard on technology and products, and the banks may not have it all their own way. The rush into identical markets, with identical products, is part of what got banks into today's mess. In escaping it, managers and shareholders would do well to consider the dangers of creating a similar mess tomorrow. As the Red Queen pointed out: 'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.'</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Environmental Management (8): Look for a silver lining - An industry where recycling strengthens the bottom line A CHEEKY-LOOKING dog examines the bone someone has placed on a fragment of aluminium foil. Our pooch picks up the bone, drops it into a bowl conveniently placed alongside and then sets off with foil in mouth, leaping over household obstacles such as vacuum cleaners and outstretched human legs on its way to the kitchen sink. One paw starts the tap running to clean a trace of blood off the foil and then the dog is off to a garbage container. It drops the foil into the bin which also contains empty aluminium drinks cans. You've guessed. This is a television commercial. It is the most successful ever run by Reynolds Metals, the biggest producer of aluminium foil in the US. The message is entertaining but clear. It says the aluminium industry wants its foil back, as long as it is clean; the industry will take back foil for recycling with aluminium cans and pay for the privilege. Mr Jeremiah Sheehan, Reynolds' executive vice president, consumer and packaging products, admits that it is not as commercially necessary for the industry to recycle foil as beverage cans - in the US only 200m lbs of aluminium is used annually for consumer foil, plus a similar quantity for food and other containers, compared with 4bn lbs used for cans. 'But recycling helps to identify foil as a 'green' product,' he points out. It gives foil an edge over competitive products such as plastics. Reynolds began by testing foil recycling in 1991 in five US cities: Richmond, its home town in Virginia; Baltimore; Tampa; San Francisco; and Seattle. Already one in 10 households in these test areas is recycling foil regularly. The campaign has been extended this year to cover half the US and in 1993 about 70 per cent of the States will be covered. And, following the industry dictum that it's best to catch recyclers young, Reynolds has had 2,100 schools competing to build the biggest ball of foil in a 'Great Balls of Foil' competition for cash prizes. Last year Reynolds paid recyclers Dollars 128m for about 240,000 tonnes of consumer-generated aluminium (mostly cans). Mr Sheehan says Reynolds' campaign 'already has lifted both the foil market and Reynolds' sales.' Across the Atlantic in the UK a similar campaign is about to be mounted. In the UK nearly 40 per cent of aluminium used in packaging (including beverage cans) goes into foil and about 50,000 tonnes of aluminium foil packaging, worth roughly Pounds 15m, is thrown away every year. To recapture at least some of this, an Aluminium Foil Recycling Campaign (AFRC) has been started by foil converters Alcan Ekco Packaging, Bowater Foil and Paper Products and William Garfield, all members of the Aluminium Foil Container Manufacturers Association, with British Alcan Consumer Products. They plan to establish the first 50 local authority aluminium foil recycling schemes in 1993. AFRC says that, although foil is as recyclable as aluminium drinks cans, it has different re-melt requirements and needs a different recovery infrastructure. So five pilot schemes are being tested - in Cambridge, Coventry, Leeds, Sheffield and Perth - which will demonstrate to local authorities how foil collection can fit into the different types of recycling schemes commonly run in the UK. The aim, wherever possible, is to retain the charity benefit tradition of saving clean aluminium foil but to integrate this with efficient recycling practice by joining local authority schemes. Three of the pilot schemes have charities emptying foil 'banks' on local authority and supermarket sites, in return for ownership of the foil. Foil is sorted and loosely compacted by the charities and then collected by an existing secondary (scrap) aluminium industry transport system, led by Cookson Aluminium, to be re-melted. The price for foil in this system is currently Dollars 350 a tonne. There is, of course, more to this campaign for the industry than a willingness to contribute to charity. The aluminium foil packaging producers have in mind various pieces of legislation which threaten to have a tremendous impact on the packaging market. For example, the 1990 UK Environment Protection Act required all local authorities to produce recycling plans by August this year saying how they would meet the target of 50 per cent recovery of recyclable materials from the waste stream by the year 2,000. Meanwhile, the European Community, judging by its draft directive on packaging waste, seems likely to set a 60 per cent target for the recovery and handling of all used packaging materials - and the responsibility for achieving this level falls largely on the producer industries. Apart from helping the producers promote the image of aluminium as a 'green' metal, recycled aluminium of any kind provides the industry with cheap raw material. Manufacturing new aluminium takes a great deal of energy - an average-sized, modern primary aluminium smelter consumes as much electricity as a town of 500,000 people - but the metal 'stores' that energy. It can take 5 per cent of the original energy to make used aluminium as good as new. Estimates vary but the industry probably turned 5m tonnes of scrap back into useable aluminium last year. That compares with production of new material totalling about 15m tonnes. Growth in demand for scrap or secondary metal is growing at 5.5 per cent a year or nearly twice the rate for primary metal. Already as much as 70 per cent of the aluminium used in electrical engineering, building and transport is re-used. Aluminium automotive castings are almost entirely made from scrap metal. The industry is working hard to get back as many aluminium beverage cans as possible for recycling - more than 63 per cent of cans are recycled in the US while the European average has moved up to 21 per cent and the European industry has set a target of recycling half of all beverage cans by the mid-1990s.</p>

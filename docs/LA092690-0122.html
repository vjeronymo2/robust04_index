			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MITTERMEIER NAMED AIRPORT MANAGER  </P> <P> After discussing the matter in closed session for less than five minutes, the  County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted Tuesday to accept the resignation  of their airport manager and replace him with Jan Mittermeier, the airport's  second in command.  </P> <P> "We're all still thrilled over your activity and the leadership you have  provided," Supervisor Don R. Roth, chairman of the board, told Mittermeier  during Tuesday's session. "We want to say congratulations to you."  </P> <P> Along with its congratulations, the board gave Mittermeier a healthy raise,  from $87,838 to $91,000 a year. That makes Mittermeier one of the county's 10  highest-paid appointed employees.  </P> <P> Mittermeier -- a well-liked, 16-year veteran of county government who was  transferred to the airport in 1987 from the auditor-controller's office -- is  the first woman to run John Wayne Airport. She had been widely expected to win  the post.  </P> <P> Officials said the pay raise reflects the board's confidence in Mittermeier,  50,and stands in stark contrast to the way the supervisors dealt with George  Rebella, Mittermeier's embattled predecessor in the airport manager's post.  Rebella was passed up for a raise this year, the only top county administrator  to be so slighted.  </P> <P> Rebella submitted his resignation to the board last week, citing stress and  illness. His resignation was effective Tuesday, ending Rebella's five-year  stint as airport manager, a tenure marred by construction delays and cost  overruns at the $310-million airport expansion project.  </P> <P> The board accepted Rebella's resignation without discussion.  </P> <P> In most cases, a vacancy in a top county management post would be filled on an  interim basis, with a permanent replacement being named after a search. But  supervisors said Tuesday that they were convinced of Mittermeier's ability.  </P> <P> "It's a little off the normal procedure, but it was crying to happen," said  Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, who made the motion to appoint Mittermeier. "She's  the right person for the job."  </P> <P> Mittermeier, who started in her new post as soon as the decision was announced,  said she planned to begin work by reviewing the organizational structure of the  airport staff and seeing how to consolidate it.  </P> <P> The airport's new terminal opened 10 days ago; with it completed, many staff  members will see their responsibilities shift from construction to other areas,  Mittermeier said.  </P> <P> "We've been geared up for managing a very large project," she said. "Now what  we need to do is look at the organization and try to do some consolidating."  JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

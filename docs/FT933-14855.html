			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: Akai loss widens to Y941m at half-way AKAI Electric, the Japanese maker of video and audio equipment, suffered a pre-tax loss of Y941m (Dollars 8.8m) in the half-year ended May 20, reflecting the continuing sluggish state of the consumer electronics market. The loss, significantly larger than the Y623m deficit of the same period a year ago, came on sales of Y25bn, an increase of 2.2 per cent on the previous first half. Sluggish sales of video cassette recorders, particularly in Europe where Akai has a strong foothold, the impact of the yen's rise and increased competition were blamed for the disappointing performance. Akai has an export ratio of 85 per cent and increased sales in all regions except Europe where they fell by 13 per cent. Video equipment suffered a 4 per cent decline in sales while audio equipment saw sales grew by 27 per cent. Akai forecast pre-tax losses would increase sharply in the year to November 20 because of the depressed market conditions and the yen's rise against the dollar this year. It expects losses of Y1.3bn, compared with the previous Y247m. This will be the second straight year of losses for Akai, which had initially expected to post a pre-tax profit of Y200m in the current year. The group hopes to combat the impact of the yen's rise with price rises, an increase in overseas production and in the procurement of parts from overseas. However, it believes sales of VCRs will continue to decline through the year.</p>

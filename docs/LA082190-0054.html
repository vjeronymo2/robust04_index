			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> A feeble attempt at a rally Monday didn't seem to restore any confidence to the  stock market as investors are continuing to face the reality of being held  hostage to the threat of a war in the Middle East, said Irving Katz, director  of research at Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> In addition, weak retail sales and a slowdown in housing starts and sales  confirm investors' fears of a recession while the core inflation rate is  increasing.  </P> <P> None of this was ignored by traders of the 64 San Diego stocks, as 19 dropped  to new 1990 lows.  </P> <P> The reasons are many, but overall perceptions of the future of the companies  have undergone a radical transformation. Belief that California real estate  will go the way of the East Coast with its declining values caused new lows in  Burnham Pacific Properties, HomeFed, BSD Bancorp, First National and Great  American.  </P> <P> The possibility of a drop in discretionary spending, which eventually affects  earnings, produced new lows in Chart House Enterprises and Price Co.  Defense-related issues making new lows included Humphrey Inc. and Maxwell  Laboratories.  </P> <P> Poor and disappointing earnings prospects caused new lows in Wahlco  Environmental, Advanced Marketing Services and WD-40.  </P> <P> Investor difficulty in understanding the merger of Intermark and Triton Group  Ltd. caused both stocks to hit new lows. The shareholders meet on Aug. 30 to  approve a swap whereby Triton shareholders will receive 1.4 shares of Intermark  stock for each share they own.  </P> <P> Recent new issues that fell to new lows included Gensia Pharmaceuticals and  California Jaymar.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 14 (XINHUA) -- South Korean President  Kim Yong-sam exchanged views with former U.S. President Jimmy  Carter here Tuesday [14 June] evening on the nuclear issue of  the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    Carter arrived here Monday in a prelude to his visit to the  DPRK with the possibility of his mediation in the nuclear  problem.    During the talks over dinner which lasted two and half an  hours, President Kim said that the nuclear issue has reached "a  critical stage" due to Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    On Monday, the DPRK announced that it will immediately quit  the IAEA, the United Nations nuclear watchdog, and accept no  more IAEA inspections of its nuclear program.    Kim explained to Carter about the South Korean Government's  firm stance toward the nuclear issue, a source said.    The source said that Kim asked Carter to convey Seoul's  concern and position with regard to the DPRK's IAEA withdrawal.    Carter was said to have explained to Kim about the purpose  of  his visit to the DPRK and promised to relay Seoul's position to  Pyongyang correctly.    The former U.S. President will pass through the  heavily-fortified truce village of Panmunjom into the DPRK on  Wednesday morning and is expected to meet DPRK leader Kim  Il-song.    Carter will return to Seoul on June 18 via Panmunjom and  meet  again with South Korean President Kim Yong-sam before heading  back to Washington.    Carter came here at a time when the U.S., South Korea and  Japan are seeking United Nations sanctions against the DPRK.    Pyongyang insists that its nuclear program is strictly  peaceful and warned that any sanctions aimed at forcing it to  accept inspections will be regarded as a declaration of war.    Carter said earlier that his trip to the Korean peninsula  would be private. "My hope is to discuss some of the important  issues of the day with leaders of the area," he added.    The former U.S. president has been active in resolving  conflicts in Panama, Nicaragua and Sudan, among others.</p>

BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 2 FIRMS PLAN INSTANT PHOTOS FOR TV  </P> <P> Toshiba Corp. and Fuji Photo Film Co. said today that they will jointly develop  a new type of electronic camera that can show photos on TV monitors immediately  after the picture is taken without processing.  </P> <P> A similar camera was introduced by Sony Corp. last year, but the Toshiba-Fuji  system is aimed at recording images as digital signals, enabling easy  transmission of pictures using personal computers and telephone lines.  </P> <P> Digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc inside the camera.  Because it is recorded digitally, pictures can be stored in personal computers,  Iijima said.  </P> <P> The camera will be too costly for broad commercialization.  </P></p>

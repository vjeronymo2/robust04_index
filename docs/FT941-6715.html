			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Small rise in Dutch growth 0.3 per cent in 1993, the narrowest expansion in 11 years, the government estimated. Nonetheless, the growth surpassed recent expectations of state and private economists of zero to 0.2 per cent expansion in GDP for last year and far exceeded the initial projections a year ago that the Dutch economy would contract by as much as 1.5 per cent in 1993. The economy grew 0.8 per cent in the third quarterfrom a year earlier and expanded 0.6 per cent from the second quarter. The contraction of the economy in the fourth quarter may lay the grounds for a possible lapse into recession early this year, should the first-quarter GDP also contract. Cold and wet winter weather this year compared with last year is likely to have undermined output in the key construction sector. The will publish definitive GDP data for the fourth quarter in April. Eastern Germany's industrial output in December declined by 9.3 per cent from November but was up 11.2 per cent from the year. Eastern German data are not adjusted. November output was left unrevised at down 4.4 per cent. Pushed by a surge in foreign trade, German plant and machinery orders rose a real 2 per cent in January from a year earlier, the VDMA industry group reported. Domestic orders dropped 8 per cent in January on the year, while foreign order surged 15 per cent. Italy's retail sales index was down 0.6 per cent in October from a year earlier. The index covers sales from 10,000 outlets across the country. From January to October the index rose 3.1 per cent.</p>

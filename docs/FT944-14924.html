			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / International Bonds: Spread of Argentina's Dollars 500m global issue surprises The Republic of Argentina launched its long-awaited global eurobond offering yesterday, with a Dollars 500m issue of five-year fixed-rate bonds. Syndicate managers expressed surprise at the spread, of 337 1/2 to 350 basis points over US Treasuries, offered on the bonds. 'Argentina was expected to come at around 275 to 300 basis points but because of the deal's size and the difficulty of the markets, it has had to come higher. But even then it is struggling,' said one syndicate manager. However, joint lead manager Deutsche Bank said the pricing accurately reflected demand and current market conditions. 'The pricing is a realistic assessment of how the demand is building. We tried to match price insensitive retail demand in Europe, for whom the coupon is more important, and institutional demand in the US which is more value sensitive,' said a syndicate official at Deutsche Bank. He said 80 per cent of demand came from retail and institutional investors in Europe, with the remainder coming from the US. The bonds, Argentina's first significant dollar issue since December 1993, will be priced today. The National Bank of Canada launched a Dollars 200m offering of five-year floating-rate notes, increased to Dollars 250m because of the huge demand for the issue. The bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over three-month Libor. Fannie Mae, the US mortgage agency, announced its intention to borrow Dollars 20bn in international markets, launching what it claimed was the 'largest global funded programme in the world'. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank is arranging the new facility, with 10 other international banks involved in the marketing and distribution of the issue. The association made its debut in global bond markets in June, issuing Dollars 1.5bn of 10-year global debentures. Abbey National said that it plans to return to the US market following the success of its Dollars 500m offering of yankee bonds launched on Tuesday. Mr Gareth Jones, Abbey National treasurer, said that it would look to do a global offering of Dollars 1.5bn early next year. Salomon Brothers was forced to raise the coupon on the Dollars 100m offering of five-year floating-rate notes launched by Banco di Napoli on Tuesday after Moody's, the US credit rating agency, downgraded the Italian bank. A Salomon syndicate official said: 'The market has now stabilised and at these cheaper levels I think we are going to see more investors coming in to buy the paper.'</p>

			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Tale of the sheep and a grizzly bear A GRIZZLY bear may be bad news to sheep farmers, but an environmental asset to the wider public. Does a government kill the bear, or compensate farmers for lost sheep? If it kills the bears, are other governments entitled to protest by banning imports of its sheep meat? Gatt, which polices world trade, believes countries should have freedom to decide how to resolve their environmental problems, and other countries are wrong to use trade instruments against them if they disagree. This challenge to the use of extra-territorial sanctions to force 'good' environmental practices on other countries has aroused anxiety that a lack of international agreement on environmental standards and practices will make it a 'pig in the middle' in trade disputes. The US 'dolphin-tuna' controversy was a first, but others are pending, such as Swedish and Swiss bans on imports of chickens raised in cages. The World Bank provides support for Gatt's role: 'By promoting the use of more appropriate environmental policies that address the source of a problem directly, Gatt is very much 'for the environment'. Gatt rules can protect (developing countries) from new forms of protectionism under the guise of environmental policy, reinforce the respect of sovereignty in trade relations, and shift emphasis from the use of trade sanctions to negotiations. The rule-based multilateral system protects the interests of small countries against power-based unilateral policing by large countries.' Other ways of pressing countries to change environment policies could include product labelling and financial or technological transfers: 'Trade forums seem to be the wrong places to address environmental issues. The source of the problems is not in trade, but in the need to (take proper account of) environmental costs in prices, to address bad policies, and clarify property rights.'</p>

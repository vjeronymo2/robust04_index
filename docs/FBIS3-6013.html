			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Japan is unlikely to face  pressure at a jobs summit from other Group of Seven (G-7) major  industrialized nations on its financial measures, Vice Finance  Minister Jiro Saito said Monday [14 March].    Issues to be discussed at the summit will concentrate on  "European nations and not Japan," Saito told a regular press  meeting.    He was referring to earlier comments by U.S. Treasury  Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who indicated discussions at the  two-day meeting in Detroit from Monday would include financial  measures.    "I don't know what he (Bentsen) actually said," Saito said,  but the summit is to discuss "medium- to long-term structural  problems," he indicated.    Japan has no such problems, Saito said.    Considering a meeting of finance ministers from the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Hawaii later  this week, he said the gathering is intended to exchange views  "freely" and not to stage negotiations.    He said a meeting between Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii and Bentsen is yet not set.    Meanwhile, Saito said his ministry will "soon" decide on a  "strict" punishment for Kankaku Securities Co., which is accused  of committing illegal loss-compensation practices.    Japan's Securities and Exchange surveillance commission  recommended Friday that the ministry take administrative action  against the second-tier brokerage house.    Kankaku is accused of compensating customers with losses  through so-called "tobashi" deals, which are prohibited under  the securities and exchange law.    The practice involves shifting loss-carrying transactions  from one client to another with a promise to buy back the shares  later at higher prices.</p>

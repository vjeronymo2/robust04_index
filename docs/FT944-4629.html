			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: Profit soars at Malaysian Airlines Malaysian Airlines (MAS) has announced sharply increased pre-tax profits of MDollars 101m (USDollars 40m) for the six months ended September 30. This compares with MDollars 6.4m in the year-ago period. Turnover rose 15 per cent to MDollars 2.3bn, with the inclusion of an unexplained 33 per cent rise in other income. Analysts attributed some of the improvement in profits to the more effective use of capacity, particularly on international routes. The airline has also made staff reductions which have improved overall productivity. Mr Tajudin Ramli, a Malaysian entrepreneur with interests including telecommunications and transport, gained control of MAS earlier this year through a controversial, highly-leveraged MDollars 1.79bn deal. Mr Tajudin's listed Malaysian Helicopter Services company now has a controlling 32 per cent stake in MAS. MAS said overall capacity for the period under review had expanded by 15.7 per cent, and the overall load factor had risen to 64.4 per cent. 'We believe that positive measures taken by the management and staff have to a large extent contributed to the improved half-year results,' he said. 'These include aircraft optimisation and efficient redeployment of the company's human resources.' In spite of the improved results, analysts were cautious in their assessment of the performance of MAS. Some said the results were not comprehensive, and there were still doubts about the overall financial health of the airline. An ambitious expansion programme involving the purchase of 72 aircraft, valued at MDollars 10.6bn, over six years has severely strained financial resources. There are also doubts about the profitability of some of MAS's recently-inaugurated routes, particularly to Latin America. MAS said it would not be paying any interim dividend.</p>

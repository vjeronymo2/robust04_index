			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: St Lawrence Cement suspends dividend ST LAWRENCE CEMENT, the North American cement manufacturing and construction arm of the Swiss Holderbank group, is suspending quarterly common share dividends until further notice. The company attributed the move to weak commercial and residential construction markets in eastern Canada and the north-eastern US. In July it paid a cash dividend of 5 cents on the A shares and a stock dividend equal to 14 cents. St Lawrence is eastern Canada's largest cement producer and is also a large producer and supplier in the north-eastern US. In the first half it lost CDollars 19.7m (USDollars 16.5m) or 48 cents a share, against a deficit of CDollars 10.9m or 27 cents a year earlier. Sales dropped 9 per cent to CDollars 179m. Hydro-Quebec, a leading borrower in international financial markets, reported net profit of CDollars 432m for the first half, up 10 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues for the period were CDollars 3.5bn, up 12.5 per cent. Electricity sales by volume rose 7.6 per cent, partly due to a cold winter. In addition exports to the US were higher and domestic rates rose in May. Operating expenses rose 4.6 per cent.</p>

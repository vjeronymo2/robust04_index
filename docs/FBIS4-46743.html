			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Ignatenko, doctor of philosophical </F> sciences, expert of the Gorbachev Foundation: "Last Push? To the  South!: Russia's Involvement in the Partnership for Peace Could  Critically Destabilize the Situation on its Southern Flanks"]    [Text] It would be utterly unproductive in an  examination of the Partnership for Peace program and the  prospects of Russia's participation in it to address it  alone--the texts of the Invitation, the Framework Agreement, and  Organization and Procedures. Much should be derived from a  consideration of the contexts of this program  also--geopolitical, military-strategic, economic, and others. In  addition, it is impermissible to ignore also the fact that the  states of the post-Soviet South--of the Transcaucasus and  Central Asia--would be drawn into the orbit of NATO's influence  also. And the situation in this "soft underbelly" of Russia will  largely determine the future of both the global South and of  Russia itself.  <H5>  Russia--Missing Link in the Global Military-Political </H5> Alliance of the North    The consistent and successful realization of NATO's  Partnership for Peace would impart a finished nature to the  North-South global opposition. The membership of the Atlantic  structures of Russia and also all the other components of the  former great Eurasian state--the Soviet Union--would signify the  emergence of a global military-political bloc of states of the  North (the northern hemisphere).    The North's line of contact with the South, this global zone  of instability, does not run along the Equator, of course. For  the United States, Canada, and Mexico it is the narrow isthmus  of Panama. North America is protected from Asia and Africa with  their vast South by two oceans. For West Europe this boundary is  the Mediterranean. There are some remnants of the South in the  former Yugoslavia still, it is true, but they could soon be  wiped out.    In other words, this part of the North is protected against  the destabilizing factors of the South by natural barriers. This  North is doing and will continue to do everything possible to  bar to states of the South as far as possible, if not in full,  access to weapons of mass destruction, primarily nuclear, and to  their delivery systems capable of delivering these weapons to  the North. The examples of the pressure on Iraq, Iran, Libya,  Syria, India, Pakistan, and North Korea are typical in this  respect. The North even looks askance at Israel.    But with Russia things are considerably more complicated.  Russia is in direct, immediate contact with the South. So  immediate that it is not always clear where Russia ends and  where this notorious South begins. According to one version  ("each for himself"), Russia borders the post-Soviet South--the  Transcaucasus and Central Asia, that is, zones of extremely high  conflict potential. It is sufficient to recall the  Abkhaz-Georgian, Karabakh, and Tajik conflicts and a mass of  others--of a lesser scale or occurring in latent fashion.    In the other version ("Russia as an integral part of the CIS  with vital interests in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia")  Russia--both directly and indirectly--is in contact with another  conflict-potential zone, which is to no less an extent rich in  factors of instability: the Arab-Israeli conflict, the Kurdish  problem (Turkey, Iran, Iraq, Syria), the Afghan problem (the  civil war in Afghanistan and this state's practical  disintegration), the Pakistani-Indian contradictions (the  problem of Jammu and Kashmir), Uighur separatism (China's  Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous District), and so forth.  <H5>  Russia--Pacifier of the South? </H5>   Let us assume that Russia has subscribed to the Partnership  and/or has actively begun to participate in NATO actions in some  other form. All questions would then confront it in entirely  particular fashion, if Russia is in contact with the South,  being part of the global military-political alliance of the  northern hemisphere (the North). Historical circumstances  themselves would impose on Russia the role of gendarme covering  the global North on one of its "burning" flanks and locking onto  itself many most acute problems of North-South relations on a  world scale.    Why would Russia involuntarily find itself in this role? I  see at least three reasons here.    First, peacemaking operations or, in NATO terminology,  "peacekeeping operations" are envisaged by both the plans of  NATO and the NACC (North Atlantic Cooperation Council) and the  content of the Partnership for Peace program itself (clause 3-D  of the Framework Agreement). The actual force capable of  undertaking broad-based peacemaking operations on the territory  of the CIS and in the entire post-Soviet space is the Russian  Army. Evidence of this is the correlation of the participants  and the degree of their assertiveness in the CIS Collective  Peacemaking Force in Tajikistan.    Second, "peacekeeping operations" are at this moment the  priority direction in NATO activity, virtually. We would recall  Somalia, Bosnia, and even Egypt (the participation of NATO  consultants in the organization of the struggle against Islamic  fundamentalists in this country). A special zone of NATO  interests in this respect, incidentally, is the Caucasus region  (see, in particular, clause 03 of the section "Questions of  Policy and Security." Supplement to "Curriculum of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council for Dialogue, Partnership, and  Cooperation in 1994"). The same applies also to post-Soviet  Central Asia, the "projection" of stability onto which is,  according to a statement of Manfred Woerner, general secretary  of NATO, a principal function of the North Atlantic alliance. A  number of NATO "peacekeeping operations" have shown the  direction in which the tactics of such operations are evolving,  these contemplating the active enlistment in direct combat  operations of the peacekeeping subunits and covering units.    Third, Russia would very much like to take part in  peacemaking operations on the territory of the CIS. One has the  impression that certain influential Russian politicians and  military figures, not without peasant cunning, see such activity  as a convenient form of the restoration of Russian influence in  "zones of Russia's vital interests." If they are lucky, what is  more, with these operations being funded and a mandate for them  being granted by any party--the United Nations, the CSCE, the  CIS... and NATO?    Fourth, the talk about the danger of "Islamic  fundamentalism"  (P. Grachev and A. Kozyrev and B. Yeltsin have already spoken  about it in the appropriate manner) puts us on our guard. A  number of influential Russian politicians and military personnel  are prepared, it would seem, to turn Russia into a kind of  barrier against so-called "Islamic fundamentalism," moving up to  the forward lines of contact with it.  <H5>  How To Destroy Russia </H5>   Were this conjecture to be realized, Russia's future would  seem utterly bleak. On its "southern" flank Russia (like the CIS  as a whole) is exceptionally vulnerable. A border, which is  designed to perform a protective function, with the new  independent states of the post-Soviet South (in the regions of  the Caucasus and Central Asia) is lacking; in a number of  sectors the external border of the CIS here is eroded and  penetrable (to a varying extent) in both directions (the  Iranian-Azerbaijani, Afghanistan-Uzbekistan, Afghanistan-Tajik,  and other sectors).    Russia could find itself--voluntarily or involuntarily, for  reasons, at times, not even susceptible to predictions based on  the logic of common sense--pulled into a number of conflicts.  Primarily the Tajik, Abkhaz, South Ossetian, or Karabakh, which  are now "habitual." It is difficult for Russia even now in its  attempts to extinguish these centers of military danger situated  in direct proximity to its borders. But the difficulties could  grow many times over were Russia to operate under the aegis of  NATO or within the framework of NATO programs. We can imagine  the frustration of the leadership of Georgia and Azerbaijan,  which, endeavoring to protect themselves against Russian  peacemaking, had hastened to sign the "framework agreement" (in  March and May of this year respectively) and which, as a result,  could get those same Russian troops as peacemakers. Whatever the  case, Russia would not, in any event, manage to preserve a  normal relationship with all the parties to the conflicts on the  territory of the post-Soviet South, and the resistance to it of  some parties would be assured.    A particular danger of the situation for Russia is the fact  that there is no clear-cut border between the non-Russian South  within the framework of the CIS and the purely Russian South. It  is sufficient to recall here the North Caucasus (that is,  Russian!) operational formations--from subunits of the  Confederation of Peoples of the Caucasus through the  Cossacks--that participated (are participating) actively in the  Transcaucasus conflicts: Karabakh, South Ossetian, Abkhaz. It is  hard to foresee the details and the routes by which the  conflagration of the conflicts being "pacified" could spread.  But some directions are easily defined: the zones of the spread  of Islam and of the settlement of Turkic peoples on the  territory of Russia.    What the response of the states of the traditional South to  the globalization of NATO and the conversion of the border of  the CIS or a part thereof into the NATO border would be is a  special and very difficult question. For Iraq, Iran, and Syria  border Turkey--a NATO member. Desert Storm (1991), on the other  hand, demonstrated together with many other things, it is true,  a readiness for cooperation even on the part of sworn enemies (I  would recall the coordinated crossing to Iranian territory of  Iraqi aircraft to preserve them from American strikes). But  Russia, were it to find itself NATO's southern flank, would have  to assume assignments pertaining to elimination of the nuclear  missile programs in such countries as Iran, Iraq, India,  Pakistan, and Syria for the realization of one further NATO  goal--blocking these countries' missile programs for protection  against missile attacks against the forward and expeditionary  units of NATO and its allies.    Opposition to so-called "Islamic fundamentalism" as a  strategic goal, Russia's conversion into an outpost of this  struggle--all this would necessarily evoke and exacerbate  hostility between Russia and, at a minimum, Iran (it is usually  seen as the source of "Islamic fundamentalism") and, possibly,  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and more distant Near and Middle East  neighbors also.    Nor can Russia's involvement as a "peacemaker" in conflicts  that the world community imposes on itself and that blaze or  merely flare up in direct proximity to Russia's borders be ruled  out. The Kurdish problem is already making itself felt quite  nearby--on the Turkish-Armenian border. Iranian-Arab  contradictions are not completely settled. There is no certainty  that it will be possible to settle the Arab-Israeli conflict  conclusively and to general satisfaction. Afghanistan, for many  of whose inhabitants war has become a way of life, demands  pacification. The Pakistani-Indian disputes over Jammu and  Kashmir are not subsiding. Chinese Xinjiang is beginning to boil  over. The list could easily be continued.    Thus in the event of Russia's aggressive participation in  NATO activity, it would face the threat of involvement in a  whole series of conflicts in the South. Some of them would  detonate in Russia itself. The time would come for "peacemaking  operations" in Russia. The very existence of the Russian state  could be in jeopardy. The "last push" to the South beneath the  NATO pennant could be for Russia the last in its history  altogether.</p>

"The main  disadvantage is that Brazilian producers will lose  competitiveness regarding their international competitors  because our export costs will increase," Bertone said. However,  he estimates that this system gives the retention program  greater credibility and is not as strong an interference as a  confiscation system would be.    According to a decision by the Industry, Commerce, and  Tourism Ministry, as of 1 March the government will transfer to  exporters the job of retaining 20 percent of the volume of  coffee exports. In Bertone's opinion, the government's decision  is the closest to a market solution.    The CNC president said Brazil knows that its competitors  also  are facing an identical situation. "This has led our competitors  to seek new methods to raise coffee prices, as in the case of  the minimum registry system adopted in Colombia," he said.</p>

"Conflicts between clans  and selfish interest goups must end," General Aidid said in the  latest of a series of increasingly dovish statements.    But he blasted his arch-enemy, self-styled interim president  Ali Mahdi Mohamed and his allies for calling for the formation  of a new government after meetings in Cairo this month which  Aidid did not attend. "We all now face a transitional period of  two to three years, during which the foundations of a new  decentralised Third Republic and its cooperation with our  neighbours will be agreed upon and set out in a national  charter," Aidid said in a statement in the Kenyan capital  Nairobi.    He has held a series of meetings with regional and Somali  leaders in Nairobi since he left Mogadishu in December to attend  peace talks brokered by neighbouring African countries.    Aidid said he would return to Mogadishu soon and urged all  parties "to come together and form an interim administration and  secure our future."    Most key Somali faction leaders and political figures are  currently in Nairobi for informal peace talks.    One set of UN-mediated negotiations has brought together  Aidid's ally Omar Jays and his rival, warlord Mohamed Said  Hersi, known as General Morgan. Their struggle for control of  the southern port city of Kismaayo sparked factional fighting  that killed nine people last month.    The adversaries will meet at the United Nations complex  outside Nairobi this week to agree a date and venue for a peace  conference to end the bloodshed in Kismaayo, UN spokesman George  Bennett said. "There seems to be a greater willingness on all  sides to make concessions," Bennett said.    Aidid's newly conciliatory tone has raised hopes of peace in  Somalia after US and other Western troops withdraw this month,  leaving a smaller UN operation manned mainly by Pakistani,  Indian and other Third World troops.    But diplomats and aid workers remain cautious. Many are  convinced that low-level guerrilla warfare among the clans will  engulf the country after the Western pullout, welcomed by Aidid  whose rag-tag militia humiliated the UN and forced the United  States to abandon Somalia after sending thousands of troops to  end a famine that killed at least 300,000 people.    The famine was triggered by anarchic clan-based fighting  that  erupted after Aidid and other rebel leaders ousted former ruler  Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.    "Aidid has switched roles. Now he's cultivating the image of  a statesman, and he's playing clan politics with some skill, but  he's still on a collision course with Ali Mahdi," said an  African diplomat involved in the Somali peace process.    "Many other disputes will have to be settled before Somalia  returns to genuine peace. It's bound to be a slow process," the  diplomat told AFP.</p>

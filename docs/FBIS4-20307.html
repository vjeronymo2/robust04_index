Last year, there were fund shortages and the center put into  effect a series of macroeconomic control policies and measures.  In such a general environment, our province, motivated by  Comrade Xiaoping's southern inspection remarks and the spirit of  the 14th CPC Congress, conscientiously implemented the  Provisions, making focused efforts to transform mechanisms and  to resolutely adjust the product mix; as a result the industrial  economy continued its good momentum of rapid and healthy  development: For the year, the total value of output of  industrial enterprises at the township level or above  provincewide was 56.963 billion yuan, and the sales value of  industrial output was 54.419 billion yuan; both figures  represented substantial increases over the previous year. The  rate of industrial products sold reached 95.7 percent, an  increase of 1.2 percentage points over the previous year.    There were five gratifying changes in our province's rapidly  developing economy:    --The growth momentum of heavy industry was strong. Last  year the value of output of heavy industry enterprises  provincewide increased by 20.3 percent over the previous year,  representing a growth rate which was 4.6 percentage points  higher than the province's industrial growth rate; heavy  industry' share of the province's total value of industrial  output increased from 60.5 percent in the year before last to  62.9 percent last year, and the increase in heavy industry's  value of output accounted for 78.5 percent of the increase in  the province's total value of industrial output.    --The nonstate industrial sector grew faster than the state  industrial sector. Last year, the total value of output and  sales revenues of collective enterprises in the nonstate  industrial sector of the province increased by 31.5 percent and  39.1 percent respectively over the previous year. In this  respect the total value of output and sales revenues of  township-run industrial enterprises increased by 46.8 percent  and 55.3 percent respectively; the total value of output and  sales revenues of the rest of the nonstate industrial sector  increased by 81.9 percent and 97.5 percent respectively. For the  same period the total value of output and sales revenues of  state-owned industrial enterprises increased by only 10.9  percent and 11.9 percent respectively.    --The amount of foreign exchange created by industrial  exports increased rather rapidly. Last year the value of  industrial exports delivered by the province increased by 27.9  percent over the previous year. In this regard the growth rate  for the first half of the year was 16.3 percentage points higher  than that for the second half.    --Sales revenues of industrial enterprises covered by the  budget on the one hand and profits made by those enterprises and  taxes paid by those enterprises on the other hand increased in a  synchronized manner. Last year, sales revenues of the  province's industrial enterprises covered by the budget  increased by 30.1 percent, while profits made by those  enterprises and taxes paid by those enterprises increased by  27.5 percent.    --Industrial production and sales of the prefectures and  cities increased on a widespread basis.

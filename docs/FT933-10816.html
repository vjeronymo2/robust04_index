			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading shopping centre HIGGS &amp; HILL SOUTHERN is to undertake the refurbishment of the Whitgift Shopping Centre (pictured above) in Croydon, Surrey, under a Pounds 17.5m design and build contract. The Whitgift Centre is believed to be the largest town centre retail complex in the south east, with 140 retailers. In addition to general refurbishment, the project will involve the construction of 24 new retail units, a restaurant, extension of the basement, roofing over the pedestrian malls and complete upgrading of the mall finishes. All the malls will have new low maintenance granite flooring. A completely new lighting system has been designed to enhance the ambience of the malls which will be surmounted by fully glazed roofs, 65ft above ground level, and specially designed to incorporate smoke extractor fans and other safety features. Entry points to the centre will be upgraded and improved. The Allders Department Store will have a remodelled frontage, and an adjacent 20,000 sq ft WH Smith store is proposed. The upgrading programme will transform the 1960s open air shopping areas into a fully up-to-date enclosed retail facility and create an enhanced environment both for retailers and shoppers. Work has started on site and completion is anticipated for mid-1995.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REACTIONS TO THE FALL OF 'MISS SAIGON'  </P> <P> A generation ago, the Rev. Marin Luther King Jr. called on the world not to  judge individuals by the color of their skin but by the contents of their  minds. Ironically, the success of the civil rights movement in redressing  discrimination has created an environment of color consciousness in which an  individual is pegged into a specific racial or ethnic category.  </P> <P> We have become so fixated with color that we jump to the conclusion that  because a person is of a certain race, he or she possesses attributes of that  race and cannot break through the genetic traits. We discount the contents of a  person's mind.  </P> <P> In essence, we deny the humanity we all share by focusing on superficial  aspects. We become hostages of tokenism.  </P> <P> More faith should be placed in the possibility that people from different  backgrounds and ethnicities can empathize and portray each other on the stage.  If we lose this faith, we will have lost much of the promise of a society that  once aspired to treat every individual equally without regard to race, creed  and color.  </P> <P> ALEX ALBEN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

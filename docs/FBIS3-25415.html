Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 16 SAPA -- The African National  Congress [ANC] has given the go-ahead for a special sitting of  Parliament to amend the constitution to provide for greater  regional powers and a constitutional principle that could be the  first step to an Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland]. Annoucing  sweeping concessions at Jan Smuts Airport near Johannesburg  before embarking on a trip to Holland, ANC President Nelson  Mandela said the ANC would call for a meeting of the multiparty  forum leading to a special parliamentary sitting within days.    Mr Mandela announced the ANC had also agreed to a  double-ballot, virtual entrenchment of regional constitutions  and greater regional taxation powers.    He said the ANC had accepted the Natal Province could be  renamed kwaZulu/Natal.    Mr Mandela added the ANC agreed to another constitutional  principle on the right to self-determination.    The concessions appear at face value to meet the demands of  the Afrikaner right-wing and the Inkatha Freedom Party.</p>

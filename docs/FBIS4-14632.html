			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Press Center of Ukraine's Supreme Council: </F> "A Meeting With Members of Parliament of the Russian  Federation"]    [Text] Chairman of Ukraine's Supreme Council I.S. Plyushch  met with the chairman of the Russian Federation State Duma  Committee for CIS Issues and Ties With Compatriots, K.F.  Zatulin, and with a member of the Committee for International  Issues, S.B. Stankevych. They are presently in Ukraine as  official observers at the new parliamentary elections.    During the friendly and open conversation, topical issues of  Ukrainian-Russian relations and the development of ties between  CIS countries were discussed. It was stressed that they must be  based upon the principles of equal partnership and mutually  advantageous economic cooperation and must promote the  development of friendship between the peoples of our countries.    The chairman of the Supreme Council spoke about the  situation  in the country and the course of the political reforms. He  pointed out, in particular, that the elections of Ukraine's  people's deputies had been democratic and that the citizens had  played a full part. There are reasons to believe that,  following the run-off elections in those electoral districts  where candidates did not receive sufficient votes, there will be  a new parliament in Ukraine.    The guests asked about the preparation for presidential  elections and elections to local government. Having explained  his position on the expediency of holding the elections in  accordance with the time-table specified by the Supreme Council,  Plyushch pointed out that the political reforms and the  democratic processes that are under way will help stabilize the  situation in society and will promote the country's emergence  from the crisis. If these processes are hampered, something in  which some political forces are interested, it will not be for  the good of the people.    An exchange of opinions was also held on the further  development of interparliamentary ties.    Ambassador of the Russian Federation in Ukraine L.Ya.  Smolyakov also took part in the conversation.</p>

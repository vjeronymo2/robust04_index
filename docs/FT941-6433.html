			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Wellcome Aids drug patents face challenge Wellcome's patents on its second best-selling drug, the Aids treatment AZT, are likely to face a direct challenge in Europe next month when a Portuguese company launches a Canadian-made version. Farma APS Productos Farmaceuticos has been authorised by the Portuguese government to market Apo-Zido- vudine, a form of AZT made by Apotex, Canada's biggest generic drug maker. It would be priced 15 to 20 per cent lower than Wellcome's product and would be on the market by April, said Mr Augusto Paiva dos Santos, Farma APS director-general. The move could set a precedent as Wellcome fights to defend patents on Retrovir, its version of AZT, in several countries. The UK company has been in a series of patent disputes with companies, including Apotex, over the right to sell AZT. So far Wellcome has won in the US, and has actions outstanding in Canada and France. Apotex said yesterday that 'we're moving aggressively all over the world'. Portugal is the first European country to register Apo-Zidovudine, but the product is already on sale in some Canadian provinces, Senegal, South Africa, Brazil and other countries. Retrovir sales were worth Pounds 248m in 1993, and Mr Paiva dos Santos said they exceeded Es500m (Pounds 1.9m) in Portugal. His company plans to compete with Retrovir to supply AZT to Portuguese hospitals. Wellcome's main patents on Retrovir run out in 2005 but the company may be vulnerable in Portugal because of its patent laws. Wellcome has a local patent on the manufacturing process, but had not been able to patent the material itself. This implies that to prove its patent had been infringed it would have to show that Apotex's product was made by a patented process, which could be more complicated than simply showing that the end product was chemically identical. Farma APS said it might export the drug to other European Union countries and did not foresee any legal difficulties. Wellcome said: 'We will challenge breaches of our patent and hope that Portugal, as a member of the European Union, will respect intellectual property rights.' In a weak stock market yesterday, Wellcome shares rose 2p to 656p.</p>

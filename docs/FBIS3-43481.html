			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Union for the Total </F> Independence of Angola Political Commission in (?Huambo) on 5  January]    [Text] The Malange incident is yet another example of  manipulation by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola [MPLA] government, which will not be happy with any peace  accord arising from the Lusaka peace talks.    1. The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] was advised of a possible visit by U.S. Democratic Party  congressmen to Bie on 4 and 5 January. Through UN channels, we  were subsequently informed that the U.S. team would no longer be  visiting Bie. We received that message in the afternoon of 4  January. It said nothing else. How could the UNITA [word  indistinct] guess that the U.S. team's itinerary had been  changed and that it would go to Malange instead?    2. Between 11 December and today, 5 January, the government  carried out three attacks against Bie.    A. The commission sent by UN Special Representative Alioune  Blondin Beye established beyond doubt that the MPLA-Labor Party  air force had in fact dropped bombs on Bie [words indistinct]  the Americans [words indistinct] while peace was being  negotiated in Lusaka, (?in accordance with) Luanda's orders.    B. On the eve of the arrival of the team of U.S. congressmen  in Angola, the MPLA General Staff issued a communique reporting  that UNITA forces had carried out an attack on the oil-rich area  of Malongo, in Cabinda Province [words indistinct] afterward.  The MPLA General Staff had lied in a bid to impress the team of  U.S. congressmen.    C. Now, the MPLA government is taking the same U.S. team to  Malange to make an impression at any cost, even that of human  lives [words indistinct] the government [words indistinct] on 28  December of last year [words indistinct] the various comments  [words indistinct] that the enemies of peace for Angola are not  to be found inside the MPLA alone. They can also be found  abroad [words indistinct] in Lusaka, where we have a team [words  indistinct] what the MPLA government is capable of doing.    [Dated] (?Huambo), 5 January 1994    [Signed] The UNITA Political Commission</p>

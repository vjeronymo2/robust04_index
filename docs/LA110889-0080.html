			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AFTER FIGHT, LAKERS STILL STANDING;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: L.A. HOLDS ON FOR A 111-107 VICTORY AFTER MAGIC JOHNSON AND  KEVIN JOHNSON ARE BOTH EJECTED FOR ALTERCATION IN THE FIRST QUARTER.  </P> <P> Tempers flared, harsh words and shoves were exchanged, and to the astonishment  of spectators and participants alike, unlikely combatants Magic Johnson and  Kevin Johnson were ejected from Tuesday night's game.  </P> <P> That fight between two of the NBA's best and usually level-headed guards,  occurring just 3 minutes 22 seconds after tipoff, changed the characters and  character of the Lakers' home opener against the Phoenix Suns.  </P> <P> This much did not change, however: The Lakers continued their home-court  domination of Phoenix by eking out a 111-107 victory, before 17,505 fans and  behind James Worthy's 35 points, nine rebounds and one crucial blocked shot  with two seconds to play.  </P> <P> The Suns still have yet to prove they can beat the Lakers at the Forum. Sun  Coach Cotton Fitzsimmons had his personal Forum losing streak stretched to 36  games over 15 years. And, the Suns have not won in Los Angeles in six seasons,  though they came close Tuesday night under extraordinary conditions.  </P> <P> The cause of the game-altering fight was not revealed by the principals. It  happened after Byron Scott committed a turnover near the Laker bench. Kevin  Johnson had been guarding Magic, and it is believed they exchanged some shoves  as Magic backed into the lane.  </P> <P> Scott said he heard Kevin Johnson call Magic a "big punk."  </P> <P> Apparently, those were fighting words. The players met near the free-throw line  in clear view of referees and players. Magic and Kevin exchanged more words,  walking straight toward one another. Then, they exchanged shoves and talked  some more. At that point, Magic landed an open-handed blow to Kevin's right  jaw. Finally, after shoving each other for a third time, the players were  pulled apart.  </P> <P> "I think Earvin said (Kevin) called him a big punk," Scott said. "That's like  calling Mike Tyson a pit bull. You just don't do that."  </P> <P> Both players were ejected, the first time that has happened to Kevin, the third  time for Magic, though it was his first for fighting. Magic also received a  "punching foul," which resulted in a technical foul.  </P> <P> Fines are expected to be forthcoming. There even is a remote chance of  suspensions, since the league is cracking down on fighting. Bill Oakes, the  lead official, said Johnson's ejection was automatic because he threw a punch.  Kevin Johnson's ejection, Oakes said, was at the officials' discretion.  </P> <P> Magic Johnson said he never actually "punched" Kevin Johnson. He said his  open-handed shot that landed on Kevin's right jaw was merely a push that went  higher than Kevin's chest.  </P> <P> "It wasn't really a fight," Magic Johnson said. "I think you have to define a  fight. There was some pushing and stuff. They (the referees) may have made a  quick decision. I think they could have waited and seen whether it was punches  or pushes. But it's human nature to make an immediate reaction."  </P> <P> Which is what prompted the players to fight -- uh, push -- in the first place.  </P> <P> "I did what I was supposed to do," Magic Johnson said. "I'm going to always be  a man, like he was, too. As long as we were just pushing, I don't see a big  problem. That's why we didn't throw any punches -- we aren't the type. But  we're both competitors who won't be pushed." Unless they push each other. Kevin  Johnson, 6-foot-2, 188 pounds, clearly was overmatched against Magic Johnson,  6-9, 220. Kevin was pushed backward twice, but kept coming back at Magic.  </P> <P> "It definitely was a mismatch," Scott said. "There were three pushes, and Kevin  went from the top of the key to the baseline. So, if Earvin really wanted to .  . . "  </P> <P> Kevin Johnson declined to talk specifically about the incident.  </P> <P> Asked if he, as Scott claimed, called Magic a big punk, Kevin smiled thinly and  said: "All the name-calling happened after the incident itself. It didn't cause  it. I don't think this can be classified a fight. I'm surprised I got ejected,  because I pride myself on my conduct. I've never had a problem with anyone."  </P> <P> Until now.  </P> <P> The losses of the two Johnsons immeasurably affected the teams. Fitzsimmons and  Laker Coach Pat Riley each said that both teams were equally hurt by the  ejections.  </P> <P> The Lakers had to use Larry Drew more than usual, put Michael Cooper at guard  and base their offense almost exclusively around Worthy. The Suns turned to  Greg Grant, who is even quicker than Kevin Johnson but only 5-7, and also went  to Eddie Johnson.  </P> <P> But the Lakers, just barely, proved deeper without Magic than the Suns without  Kevin, though it was close for the final quarter and a half.  </P> <P> Worthy, along with Scott's 20 points and Cooper's 16, persevered. The Lakers  had a five-point lead with 1:30 to play, but the Suns did not fold. Worthy  almost did. Uncharacteristically, he missed three of four free throws in the  final seconds.  </P> <P> So, the Suns trailed, 109-107, with 12.9 seconds to play and set up for a  game-tying shot. Dan Majerle attempted a baseline jump shot with two seconds  left, but Worthy partially blocked it. Scott retrieved the ball, was fouled and  sank both free throws with 1.4 seconds to play to improve the Lakers' record to  2-1.  </P> <P> While the ejections changed the focus, they did not alter the intensity nor  competitiveness of the Pacific Division rivals.  </P> <P> The Lakers led, 59-48, at halftime before opening a 68-50 bulge 2:07 into the  third quarter.  </P> <P> From there, the Suns outscored the Lakers, 32-13, to take an 82-81 lead into  the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Eddie Johnson led the Suns' rally. He scored 12 of his 15 points in the  quarter. But despite the scoring of Tom Chambers, who had 30 points, and guard  Jeff Hornacek, who added 21, the Suns could not overtake the Lakers.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Worthy continued scoring inside, Cooper added his fourth  three-point basket, and Scott and A.C. Green also contributed, Green finishing  with 14 points.  </P> <P> But all anyone in the Laker locker room talked about was the altercation.  </P> <P> Riley thought it something of a metaphor of the Sun-Laker rivalry.  </P> <P> "Both of those players have tremendous emotional stability, and I'm sure they  both regret it," Riley said. "But I think that (altercation) showed that we're  going to come out and protect our turf. And I'm sure Kevin wanted to show that  he wasn't going to back down."  </P> <P> By the end of an unusual night, Magic Johnson was smiling and joking. His team  won, even though he did not particularly enjoy the night off.  </P> <P> "You're talking to Earvin Tyson now," Scott announced.  </P> <P> "No, it's more like Earvin Holyfield," Cooper corrected. "He's not ready for  heavyweights yet."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Laker Notes  </P> <P> Magic Johnson's last ejection came Dec. 26, 1988, at Phoenix. . . . Laker  forward Orlando Woolridge, recovering after arthroscopic surgery to remove bone  fragments in his right knee, was examined by Laker physician Stephen Lombardo.  Woolridge is progressing as expected, trainer Gary Vitti said, but Lombardo has  yet to give Woolridge clearance to start running. Woolridge is riding on a  stationary bicycle and receiving electronic stimulation therapy at Centinela  Hospital Medical Center. "Last week, he still had a little fluid in his knee,  and inflammation and pain is an indicator that he is not all healed," Vitti  said. "But (Woolridge) is right where he should be."  </P> <P> The international media is finding its way to the Forum. Two Spanish  journalists interviewed Yugoslav-born Vlade Divac, and a correspondent from the  British Broadcasting Company interviewed Laker rookie Steve Bucknall, who was  born and reared in London before moving to North Carolina for high school.  </P></p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Latin America has coffee gene diversity Sir, The article 'Harvesting a cornucopia' (Technology, September 18) highlights a statement that 'all the coffee in Latin America comes from one original tree brought from Africa. This kind of narrow gene base makes plants extremely vulnerable to being wiped out by disease.' That statement is not correct, because at least two species of coffee, arabica and robusta, were introduced to Latin America, and it has to be improbable that these were the only introductions, especially in the past half century when breeders of most major crops have been working hard to widen the gene base of their breeding material. The proposition that there was only one tree probably derives from a story that about 1723 a young French officer de Clieu carried one seedling to Martinique from the royal hothouse of Louis XV in Paris. Subsequently, seed from this particular tree was reputedly very widely planted. That item apart, the content of the article is sound. The rubber plantation industry in the east (not only in Malaysia) was based on only a small number of trees brought from Brazil, but the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia has for many years been bringing new material collected in the Amazon, through a quarantine station in the Caribbean. A particular concern is to produce high yielding trees which would be resistant to South American leaf blight, a virulent disease which could cause very serious problems if it reached the east. The world plantation oil palm industry developed from an even narrower gene base than rubber and involved only seed from four oil palms planted in the Botanic Gardens at Bogor in Java in 1848. Here again breeders have been working for many years to widen the base of breeding material. Thomas Fleming, Hardens Way, Duns, Berwickshire TD11 3NP</p>

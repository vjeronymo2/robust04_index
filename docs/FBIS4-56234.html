			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mario Reina, economic and legal adviser at </F> the Honduran Presidency, by Lourdes Bonilla; place and date not  given; from the "The Morning Paper" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Bonilla] President Roberto Reina's strong man,  Civil Engineer Mario Reina Idiaquez, has made exclusive  statements to HRN on the economic measures adopted by the  liberal administration led by his brother, before his first 100  days in office are completed.    [Reina] I believe that we have been working hard, both in  the  cabinet and in all institutions.    [Bonilla] Eng. Mario Reina, economic and legal adviser to  President Reina's government, says that the executive machinery  has already taken off even though many disagree.    [Reina] I say yes; I cannot understand how anyone can say  that it has not taken off. There are many things to deal with  and the various commissions at various levels are doing just  that.    [Bonilla] There is strong criticism of the liberal  government's economic cabinet headed by Juan Ferrera at the  Finance and Public Credit Ministry, Delmer Urbizo Panting at the  Economy and Commerce Ministry, and Hugo Noe Pino at the Central  Bank of Honduras, and appointed [as heard] by Eng. Mario Reina.  You claim, however, that the economic cabinet is the one that  works the hardest.    [Reina] I believe that the economic cabinet works the  hardest. As you know we were left in a desperate situation, with  a large deficit. All previous programs are under review and  this has been the economic cabinet's main task up to now.    [Bonilla] People say that these officials do not fulfill  their job requirements?    [Reina] I do not think so. What has happened, as in the case  of Juan errera, is that everyone is trying to determine how to  stretch funds to pay all the pending debts. This poses a  serious problem for him. In fact, because he is a serious  person he is trying to do things right.    [Bonilla] What about restructuring the economic cabinet?    [Reina] Perfection is very difficult, of course, but I do  not  believe there is reason for a change, and it is working hard.    [Bonilla] What about deregulating fuel prices?    [Reina] Prices are deregulated so that they reach their  market price. If international prices go up then prices in  Honduras have to go up as well, otherwise fuel suppliers would  have serious problems. This is what has been deregulated, and  now some suppliers want the government to regulate prices. This  is absurd because they were the first ones to ask that they be  allowed to set their own profit levels.    [Bonilla] What about the hunger strike declared by members  of  the Civic-Popular Committee to protest the draft?    [Reina] A commission of jurists is making an in-depth study  of this case, which is very delicate because it means a change  to the Constitution, a constitutional reform. This strike is  also in support of the government and the president, because I  imagine they want to raise the awareness of the deputies for  this change. I believe that this draft bill will be presented  to Congress by Tuesday. From what the president has discussed  up to now with the deputies and other branches of government, I  believe that they are all aware that the Constitution should be  reformed.    [Bonilla] Does Congress President Carlos Flores agree?    [Reina] Up to now he has also agreed.    [Bonilla] As economic adviser to the liberal administration  you are considered by fellow party members, friends, and  relatives as the boss of the Reina Idiaquez clan. You retired  from private banking to work full time as adviser to the  government of your brother, Carlos Roberto Reina. I understand  that once in a while you slap him on the wrist if he fails to  coordinate something in the best interests of the Honduran  people. Is this true?    [Reina] No, I have never had a need to admonish him. We have  always worked in agreement. My work with my brother has  generally been in an advisory role.    [Bonilla] Are you retiring from private banking to give full  time advice to your brother?    [Reina] No, no. I am already retired, therefore I have the  time to be at my brother's side, such as I am doing now.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semon </F> Ivanov]    [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Financial difficulties have  led to the 50 per cent reduction of the number of Russian  cosmonauts, trained for space flights, while trainings according  to the "Buran" programme have been fully discontinued, because  no launchings of this shuttle vehicle are planned until the year  2000.    "The six detachments of cosmonauts previously included  almost  100 men, which is much more than needed by expeditions to the  orbital piloted "Mir" station, planned until 1997," ITAR-TASS  was told today by officials of the inter-departmental commission  for ensuring the flight and exploitation of the "Mir" space  laboratory.    Cosmonauts aged above 50, were the first to be laid off.  Nevertheless, 54-year-old Gennadiy Strekalov, one of the most  experienced cosmonauts, was left on the staff.    One will hardly have to wait long for a regular space flight  after this reduction of the personnel, as it happened, for  instance, with German Arzamazov, who remained a stand-by on the  ground for 17 years running, or with Tamara Zakharova, who is  now on maternity leave, waiting for her turn to fly.    The largest detachment today belongs to the Russian air  force  -- 17 men. The detachment of the "Energiya" scientific  production society will number 12 men. The medico-biological  institute also has its own 5-man detachment.    The fate of 12 cosmonauts, trained according to the "Buran"  programme, is yet to be decided. They may be switched over to  training for flights to the "Mir" station.</p>

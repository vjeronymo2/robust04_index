			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Adrian Nastase, executive president of the </F> Social Democracy Party of Romania and speaker of the Chamber of  Deputies, by Ileana Lucaciu; place and date not given: "The  Revolt of the Facts Against the Law"]    [Text]  <H5>  Petty Moves </H5>   [Lucaciu] As you well know, we are too much in the habit of  implementing the saying that "if I am going to go down the  drain, I may as well take my neighbor along with me." Why do  you think that this saying is so popular with us Romanians?    [Nastase] One could speculate at length on the meaning of  this saying. I believe that we have not yet managed to develop  a sentiment of solidarity around certain common interests.  Maybe these common interests are not all that clear to us, or  were not properly explained to us. They do not provide enough  motivation for the public at large, the journalists, and the  political forces. Therefore, all we are doing is resort to petty  moves, the end result of which is zilch, meaning that they lead  nowhere. It is a pity, since we are thus making no headway  whatsoever. We should aim at pointing out the essential and  remove, as much as possible, the ballast of our resentments and  learn to appreciate true value and merit. The thing about  dragging the neighbor down the drain along with you does not  apply anywhere else in the world. There are political debates  and contrary opinions in all countries, but things are much too  personal in our country. In Romania, the parties are  personalized and they mainly appear before the public through  their leaders, not their structures. Because of this  personalization, the overall political life is too personalized,  as well. Only to the extent that the parties become more solid  will they be able to function better as organized entities and  will we manage to put an end to this individualistic dimension  and extreme personalization of Romanian political life.    [Lucaciu] Is it worth getting involved in politics, so that  one may be judged severely by the public at large at some point  for all that one has done?    [Nastase] Anyone entering the political life is actually  entering a stage, whereby all your details can assume greater  proportions due to the assorted stage-lighting. Some of the  people backstage can throw a certain light upon you in order to  emphasize a given detail. All this is inevitable.    [Lucaciu] So, whoever enters the political battle must  assume the risks of the trade.    [Nastase] I would not say that it is not natural to attack  political figures. However, I believe that a balance should be  struck between one's political activities and one's private life  when passing judgment on a politician. The politicians also  have parents, families, and children. Flinging mud at people is  unacceptable in the private sphere. Therefore, many politicians  have begun to withdraw from politics and enter the business  world, where they can make more money. I believe that a certain  degree of understanding should be reached and certain practical  limits be agreed upon as far as politician hunting can go. Even  hunting animals has its own rules. For instance, you may not  shoot at a pheasant on the ground or at a rabbit that is  standing still. You may not fire more than two shots. These  are a few rules that are supposed to give the adversary a  chance. For instance, if a newspaper with a certain circulation  aims at starting a hunt for politicians, it can cause such an  upset that it might affect the entire political life.    [Lucaciu] Does that mean that you favor a press law?    [Nastase] No, because I do not believe that a law can solve  this problem. I believe in correlating one's rights with one's  responsibilities. I do not know how one can achieve this  practically. Many countries practice a kind of self-censorship.  I do not think that this is possible in our country. However,  it is obvious that journalists should display a certain degree  of responsibility.  <H5>  The Wall of the Electoral Result </H5>   [Lucaciu] Let us not forget that the press -- the same as  the economy and even politics -- is going through a tumultuous  period of transition. Do you believe that, in this period of  transition, Romania is experiencing a political crisis?    [Nastase] There are several aspects to this question. First  of all, we must clarify the meaning of crisis. Does it mean an  extreme institutional malfunction? Does it mean a breaking  point that requires other solutions than the usual ones?  Paradoxically, the functioning of Romanian society and its  stability have not experienced dramatic upheavals as of  September 1991. No dramatic elements have appeared at the  domestic level since. Therefore, the political life in our  country has proceeded without major malfunctions for the past  three years. I am not sure that we are in a situation of  crisis. We are in a state of constant searches, political  struggles, and attempts to find better or worse answers to the  current problems. We are trying to adjust the current  aspirations to the electoral results of 1992. As a matter of  fact, we are faced in parliament with the electoral choice of  1992. This is rightfully called "the revolt of the facts  against the law." A certain codification of the electoral  options took place in 1992, after which all kinds of political  developments occurred, all of which bumped into this wall of the  electoral result. This wall, created in 1992, can resist until  1996, when the next elections are scheduled, or it can  disintegrate under the pressure of the accumulation of facts,  expectations, and aspirations.    [Lucaciu] Dismantling this wall before 1966 would imply  early elections. Do you believe in the possibility of holding  early elections?    [Nastase] I do not believe in it. However, I can tell you  that, theoretically speaking, if the 1992 situation can no  longer contend with the current political reality at all, then  early elections might take place. We have not reached this  point yet and the major political parties in Romania are not  interested in early elections. The stability we have had since  1991 has been achieved on the basis of a delicate balancing act  that has required extraordinary efforts.    [Lucaciu] The latest public opinion polls show that the same  electorate from 1992 no longer trusts the people it has elected.  In my opinion, the credibility of the parliament and government  has decreased to an alarming level. Does that not mean that we  are in a time of political crisis?    [Nastase] Public opinion polls in most countries show a lack  of trust in the respective parliaments and governments.  Therefore, I would not take these results in our country as  unequivocal. What is more, no matter what parliament or  government functioned in Romania at this time, the discontent  would still be present. You should also note the level of trust  in the political parties represented in parliament. One cannot  make a direct correlation between the lack of trust in  parliament and the lack of trust in the political parties. In  the last instance, we are faced here with a state of expectancy.  The parliament -- not as a political institution, but as a  legislative institution -- is called upon to do more.    [Lucaciu] Before last summer's National Conference of the  Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], you issued an open  letter through which you managed to trigger off an epistolary  dialogue, out of the desire to clarify the doctrine situation of  the party. In my opinion, things have not yet been clarified --  proof of which is the denigration campaign against you, a  campaign that you yourself have said may not be alien to the  doings of some of your party colleagues. Why did this situation  arise?    [Nastase] Compared to the situation last summer, when it was  not very clear how the party members were contemplating their  ideology and action strategy, the situation has changed. The  National Conference has helped quite a lot to emphasize a  theoretical development and modern tackling of the  social-democratic doctrine, which increasingly more party  members have adhered to in recent months. I believe that, right  now, the great majority of the party members are following this  line and are making efforts to build a modern center-left party  that is European in its approach to problems and national in its  approach to interests and values. Of course, there are also  some people who are probably afraid of changes. I do not know  whether personal interests are necessarily at stake there.  However, they might be afraid of the unknown...    [Lucaciu] Looking at the rather diverse attitudes of some  PDSR parliamentarians at times, one may note that they are much  closer, from a doctrine viewpoint, to the PDSR's satellite  parties -- the Greater Romania Party [PRM], the Socialist Party  of Labor [PSM], and the Romanian National Unity Party [PUNR] --  than to social democracy.    [Nastase] The answer is yes and no. Maybe this aspect was  more obvious at the beginning. However, with the passage of  time, we explained to everybody that we must clearly delimit  ourselves from the other parties and I believe that this was  pretty well understood. The problem is more of a practical  nature. The voters can only give their vote to a single party,  which can be the PDSR, the PRM, or another one. There can be no  amorphous structure. There might be some common interests and  strategies. But in the last instance, we must clearly know what  the boundaries of our party are. Regarding the labelling the  people as categorically belonging to a certain sphere or not, I  believe that things have changed a lot since last year. It is  necessary to make a much more careful analysis of the party  structures, including at the regional level. In my opinion, many  people have moved toward a position of expecting and desiring  the modernization of this party.    [Lucaciu] I am looking now at a note published in CURIERUL  NATIONAL daily, which prints excerpts from an interview granted  by PDSR Spokesman Dumitru Paslaru to the BBC. I am going to  read a sentence from it, which I would like to comment on: "We  are dealing here with an attack against a political leader who  has managed to make a name for himself and to elevate the party  and make it stronger than it should have been." What might be  the meaning of "stronger than it should have been"?    [Nastase] I think Mr. Paslaru placed the emphasis on the  wrong word. He wanted to say "stronger than others would have  liked it to be." Since I know him well, I am convinced that  this is what he wanted his comment to be. But then, it is  pretty hard for anyone to comment on everything that has  happened of late. He wanted to express his support, but he also  lacked enough information, hence he found it hard to give an  explanation. The most shocking thing about these attacks  against me is that they did not take place in 1990, 1991, or  1992, but now. Why did they come when I was away on a visit to  Germany? First, I was accused of having four houses, then of  having only one house, then no house at all, since I had given  it away as a present. These things are pretty strange and the  question is: Why did it all happen at this time?    [Lucaciu] Nevertheless, what explanation do you have for  the fact that this concentric fire is aimed only at you?    [Nastase] For the time being, I have adopted a wait-and-see  attitude. The skeptical philosophers of antiquity used to say  that when you have no answer to a question, the best solution is  to suspend judgment on the question for a while. This is  exactly what I am doing now. What is more, my position is very  clear and, in the coming days, I will submit all relevant acts  on the issue of the houses to the relevant parliamentary  commission -- since it takes some time to collect all documents  -- and then I will continue with my other, more important,  activities. This week, we will resume our visits to the  provinces. I no longer intend to continue my game with the  daily ADEVARUL [which has published allegations about Nastase  illicitly acquiring several houses in Bucharest]. I consider it  beneath my dignity.    [Lucaciu] [PUNR President] Funar's party is one of the  PDSR's allies. Do you believe that the PUNR is involved in the  Caritas [Cluj-based money-multiplying Ponzi-scheme] affair?    [Nastase] I do not intend to investigate this matter, since  I do not have the necessary details. I did not see the file.  From the very beginning, I considered the Caritas game as a  damaging phenomenon for Romanian society. I made this statement  some time ago, when I first visited Cluj. At the same time, I  pointed out why I and the party I represent cannot agree with  Caritas and with its way of making money.    [Lucaciu] Why did you not start a legislative initiative at  the time to curb Caritas and other such allegedly "mutual  assistance" games?    [Nastase] The word was out at the time -- and maybe there  was some justification to it -- that Caritas was just waiting  for an excuse not to have to pay out the money it promised and  to also have somebody else to blame for it. A legislative  initiative at that time would have encouraged the Caritas people  to claim that the initiative had destroyed the people's trust in  the scheme, therefore the PDSR or the government should pay the  people whose turn it was to receive money. My statements -- at  least in the Caritas case -- were unequivocal. I said that the  people should be warned about the risks of playing the Caritas  game. Regarding the PUNR position vis- a-vis Caritas, I believe  that they should clarify this matter themselves. When we held  our talks with the PUNR, one of the first explanations we  demanded from them was whether they are involved in the Caritas  scheme or not. Their official answer was a categorical "no."    [Lucaciu] What do you have to say about Mr. Gheorghe Funar's  participation alongside [Caritas director] Ioan Stoica in a  television program?    [Nastase] I did not see that broadcast, but many references  were made to it. We were told that the program was shot in  different studios... I do not remember their explanations very  well. However, the PUNR's position was that they are not  involved in the Caritas scheme. If there are documents that  prove their involvement, it is obvious that the matter should be  discussed by us, by taking the proof into account.  <H5>  Good PDSR and Bad PDSR </H5>   [Lucaciu] The PDSR has negotiated not only with the PUNR,  but also with the opposition. What conclusion did you reach at  the end of these negotiations?    [Nastase] The discussions were halted for the duration of  the budget discussion in parliament, without an "armistice" or  an "end to hostilities" being declared. The budget itself  represented a political struggle, and each side gathered its big  guns to make their point. No serious talks can be held at such  a time, and consequently the negotiations will be resumed after  the budget is finalized. The conclusion of the talks is that  each political force in the country needs to mature itself from  a political viewpoint. This dialogue should become a means of  communication even in delicate situations. Otherwise, blockages  may emerge, with irreparable results through their recurrent  effects. We have achieved a very important thing, namely a  personal dialogue, which is more than we had in 1991 and 1992.  We have gained a lot from that. It is the difference between  "means" and "results." Of course, no major or spectacular  result was obtained. Some people thought that another  governmental team and a new parliamentary majority would be put  together after two rounds of negotiations. Certain political  parties expected such a thing. But the discussions revealed  that changing the parliamentary majority is no easy thing to do.  One cannot ignore the fact that we are working in 1994 with a  parliament elected in 1992. These results cannot be changed  easily.    [Lucaciu] Let us call things by their name. The opposition  is demanding that the PDSR should distance itself from the PSM,  the PRM, the PUNR, and the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania  [PDAR], with which you make up the current coalition.    [Nastase] I do not deny that the opposition is demanding  this. They consider this aspect to be very important. However,  there is a matter of a nuance here. We are asked not to  distance ourselves, but to politically separate ourselves from  them. We are also the recipients of other advice as well, namely  that the good part of the PDSR should join the opposition and  the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)] to  make up the difference from 47 percent to 51 percent. However,  let me assure you that we are not interested in having our party  toe somebody else's line. Of course, from the opposition's  viewpoint this would be a most useful and appealing formula. If  they can get the 51 percent, they would have no further  problems. They would like to take 4 or 5 percent from the  "good" PDSR, to add to their percentage. We do not want to turn  ourselves into an insignificant minority part of another  governmental formula or parliamentary majority formula. Until  now, the opposition has failed to convince us that what it is  suggesting is also to our benefit. To put it bluntly, the offer  is interesting for the opposition, but I do not see how it can  be interesting for us, too.    [Lucaciu] You are talking about good and bad parts of the  party. If the PDSR ceases to be a ruling party, meaning that it  is no longer in power, will it not go the way of the former  National Salvation Front [FSN] and split?    [Nastase] I do not think so. Maybe a couple of people will  leave, but their place will be taken by others. There will  always be an ebb-and-flow movement in the party, as is the case  with others parties, too. The PDSR has already acquired its own  physiognomy and can overcome even an internal crisis. Some  people rely too much on what you just said, and they are very  wrong. I only believe in the need to bring about a change  within the party, minute by minute and day by day. This is what  is actually happening, but it is not all that visible. I have  noted this change in the territory. There are valuable people  who want to join the party. The PDSR is like a snowman, which  we are building and which is turning from a hastily put together  dwarf into a big snowman.    [Lucaciu] May I remind you that snowmen eventually melt?    [Nastase] The observation is very correct. I should better  say "like a man made of clay or precious metals."  <H5>  The Restoration in Attitudes </H5>   [Lucaciu] The fact that the PDSR tried to impose its people  at all administration levels and in the executive, like the  Romanian Communist Party [PCR] did in its time, has led to the  conclusion that a restoration is taking place in Romania.    [Nastase] I do not know, it seems that many ministries have  always functioned with their own apparatus. Whether they  functioned well or not, well, this is debatable. These people,  which form a separate structure, have functioned under the Petre  Roman, Theodor Stolojan, and Nicolae Vacaroiu governments.  There is a good and bad aspect to this situation. The teams  will change with the passage of time. The great majority of  these clerks were not hired now; most of them have worked in  these ministries since 1989. I repeat, I do not know whether  this is good or bad. Where the basic apparatus of an  institution was destroyed, an implosion usually occurred. An  example of this is Bulgaria, where the foreign minister sacked  half of the employees -- if not more of them -- with the end  result being that the respective ministry practically collapsed.  Such things happened in our country, too. I do not know what  you mean by restoration. If you mean that we must not agree  that those people who held positions at a certain hierarchical  level on the country's technical and political scale before 1989  should hold even higher governmental positions now, well, this  is certainly something worth discussing.    [Lucaciu] What is your opinion about the fact that a high  clerk in the Ministry of Culture, the poet Ion Gheorghe, can  claim that "the moment of 22 December 1989 is a crime against  the Romanian people?" His presence in the ministry is proof of  the phenomenon of restoration.    [Nastase] I agree that we can talk about a restoration in  attitudes, but not about somebody's appointment to a given post.  I agree with your assessment of the poet Ion Gheorghe's  comments. Such a statement is inadmissible!    [Lucaciu] Such statements, as well as those made by other  people still longing for the Ceausescu [Nicolae Ceausescu,  former communist ruler] era, are pretty worrisome.    [Nastase] That is why we must continue to pay great  attention to the manifestation of such attitudes and ensure that  our society is perceived by everyone as a society that is worth  living in.    [Lucaciu] But you see, there are such nostalgia-stricken  people even within the PDSR.    [Nastase] I do not know who you are referring to.    [Lucaciu] I am referring to the articles signed by Messrs.  Vacaru [PDSR vice president Vasile Vacaru] and Dumitrascu  [Gheorghe Dumitrascu, PDSR senator for Constanta] in Adrian  Paunescu's [PSM vice president] daily VREMEA on 26 January,  Ceausescu's birthday anniversary.    [Nastase] I do not know whether all these articles should be  taken literally...    [Lucaciu] In one of [Supreme Court Judge] Antonie  Iorgovan's letters, which fueled the polemical dialogue in the  press, he maintains that the country's president should not  belong to any political party and should be independent...    [Nastase] This is a formula that I do not understand very  well. In his opinion, a country's president should be someone  held in a kind of test tube, so as not to be contaminated by  political ideas. If that is the case, then we may one day have  to bring somebody from abroad who has had no contact whatsoever  with Romanian political life and is completely neutral. If we  bring him from the East, it is bad, and if we bring him from the  West, it is also bad. Maybe we should bring him from another  planet. In my opinion, Iorgovan's proposal is naive. Nowhere  is the president accepted and voted for by the entire  electorate. Some presidents are elected by 51 percent of the  votes, others by 55 percent. Look at the Americans or the  French! After the elections, they become the presidents of all  the voters! Everything depends on the ability of the  politicians to realize their duties at a given time, otherwise  they will eventually be held accountable for their failure. If  a president takes someone's side too much, he will be punished  for it. He or the party he represents will surely be punished at  the following elections. We must realize that the current  institutional construction in Romania becomes validated with the  passage of time. Both the parliamentarians and their parties  will be voted for at the next elections to the extent that they  have performed adequately.    [Lucaciu] This is also the PDSR's case. Mr. President Ion  Iliescu has started on his road with your party. Therefore, you  will jointly reap the fruit of your achievements and failures,  proceeding from the assumption that you will also jointly  contest the next elections. The law on everything being  sanctioned by the passage of time will also apply to the  PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu tandem.    [Nastase] Formally, if the president wants, he will be  endorsed by the PDSR. He can also run as an independent, but I  believe that he will accept to be supported by us and probably  by other parties, too. Everybody knows that he was the first  president of this party, which proposed him for the position of  the country's president. Therefore, it only seems natural to me  that, six years from now, when he is no longer the country's  president, he should return to the PDSR. This happens in all  countries in the world. This president-party relationship is not  something abnormal.    [Lucaciu] In his capacity as the country's president, Mr.  Ion Iliescu should be neutral from a political viewpoint, as the  Constitution stipulates. However, due to his sentimental  nature, he does not forget you and often holds consultations  with the PDSR.    [Nastase] At the party level, Mr.Ion Iliescu holds  consultations with us, to the extent that he has consultations  with other parties, too. Occasionally, we also want to meet  with him and he kindly accepts it. However, please note that  Mr. Ion Iliescu meets with politicians from all parties. His  agenda is proof of the fact that he often has such meetings.    [Lucaciu] A recent PDSR-Mr. Ion Iliescu meeting took place  at Cotroceni, with the "Nastase case" on the agenda.    [Nastase] Four subjects were discussed at that meeting. The  press campaign against me was not a distinct subject of  discussion. Of course, this element was brought up at a certain  point. However, the matters of interest for our Central  Executive Bureau meeting were those linked to the basic problems  of our political life.    [Lucaciu] Still, what did Mr. Ion Iliescu have to say about  this campaign against you?    [Nastase] My opinion is that some people thought that my  relationship with the president is too good and it should be  destroyed, so as to hurt me and, I think, also him. Of course,  much speculation can be made in this respect. As far as I am  concerned, I looked back in time and could find no moment of  tension between President Iliescu and myself. On the contrary,  we have always understood each other very well. I have always  told him what I thought, and I believe that this helped him to  take certain decisions. I consider Mr. Ion Iliescu to be a  political figure who has made a great impact on our political  life in the past five years and who will continue to play an  important role.    [Lucaciu] Have you ever thought of running for the position  of Romania's president?    [Nastase] To be honest, I have never thought of this, for  quite a few reasons. First, I do no think of a problem when it  does not arise. Right now, we have a president, new elections  are going to be held two years from now, and I think that  President Ion Iliescu should consider running again for a new  mandate. I am 44 years old and I do not think that a country's  president should be that young. I do not know whether I would  be ready for such a position. I lack the necessary experience,  since I have only been politically active for the past five  years, which is far too little. As a matter of fact, the issue  of the presidency is slightly exaggerated in our country, since  we attach too much importance to the position of president. Of  course, this comes from our past and from the idea that we need  a fatherly figure. If you read the constitutional stipulations  about the president's prerogatives, you will note that they are  rather limited in Romania. They mainly refer to his capacity to  influence. Thus, I assure you that the life of a foreign  minister can be far more interesting than the life of a  country's president, which should not be envied. Therefore, I  have not bothered to think of the problem raised by your  question.   <H5>    Some People Were Scared by the Public Opinion Polls </H5>   [Lucaciu] I asked you that question because a recent pubic  opinion poll showed you to be the most popular political figure.    [Nastase] The polls change from one week to another, if they  are correct at all. Personally, I do not pay too much attention  to these polls, but others seems to have attached great  importance to them, got scared for reasons I fail to comprehend,  and then leaked all kinds of messages and interpretations, some  of which found their way to a certain newspaper [ADEVARUL]...    [Lucaciu] You stand for change and modernization in  politics. What about the family life? How do you see the  husband-wife relationship in your rather large family? Are you  still subscribing to the old principle that the wife should stay  at home, care for the children, and wait for the husband with  the meals ready?    [Nastase] My wife is a very practical and dynamic woman. I  humbly admit that I would have liked my wife to stay at home.  On the other hand, I cannot ignore the fact that, if I were to  stick to such an old mentality, I would practically risk  destroying my family. I cannot ask my wife to wait for me at  home with a hot meal from early in the morning until 11-12 at  night, when I come home after work. I admit that I would like  that, but I am rational enough to realize that if she did not  have something to do and all she had to do was read the papers  that attack me, then she would begin to suffer from anxiety.  That is why I encouraged her to find a job for herself. She is  working on a project now. Maybe she will publish it, I do not  know... The truth is that, these days, a woman can no longer  stay at home as in the past. We, men, should also change our  mentality. I am making efforts to change my attitude, but I  admit it is pretty hard.    [Lucaciu] I hope you will not be angry with me if I ask you  where the nickname "Sweetie" comes from? I heard it from some  of your PDSR colleagues.    [Nastase] This nickname does not even bother me. I believe  I was given this nickname because I am slower by nature, softer  in the way I express myself, pretty easy-going, and with round,  less sharp features. Maybe this is the source of it all. It is  only natural that I should also have a nickname, since almost  every politician has one. I find it hard to judge whether this  nickname suits me or not. After you also wrote a lot about my  nickname, people said that I am authoritarian, tough, and  inflexible. I do not know how these statements tally with the  nickname of "Sweetie." Maybe those who claimed all those things  did it too hastily.    [Lucaciu] At the beginning of your parliamentary mandate, I  believe that the nickname suited you, since you were chairing  the sessions far too delicately. Then, when you were faced with  the hardships of tumultuous parliamentary life, you let go of  the little bell and started making use of the alarm gong and so  forth.    [Nastase] I believe that we cannot make any headway in our  parliament without a little firmness in chairing a session. The  deputies have also begun to accept that the session chairman  should play a more dynamic role. At times, someone is needed to  break the deadlock, by putting together certain ideas in order  to reach a compromise. Otherwise, hours on end would be wasted,  without any results being achieved.    [Lucaciu] Is compromise a specific method in politics?    [Nastase] Compromise is absolutely necessary, it is the  essential way in which many political problems can be solved.  Compromise is the key answer to any political dispute. Of  course, basic principles of values must not be affected, but a  balance of interests should always be achieved.    [Lucaciu] What disturbs you most at this time?    [Nastase] The fact that I am in politics and that I must  keep on going. What I have just said -- that sometimes I feel  like retiring from politics -- is something that preoccupies  many politicians. I -- as well as my wife and parents -- am  also asking myself, quiet often, whether it is worth it to stay  on in politics or devote myself more to my family. Those close  to me suffer along with me for the attacks in various articles,  and I know how ill- meaning they are. But then, I must probably  have a sentiment of duty... I do not know whether this is good  or bad... I inherited this attitude from my father, namely that  I should not desert something when the going gets tough...  Nevertheless, the question remains whether it is worthwhile  staying in politics or not?! Many people are asking themselves  this question today...</p>
